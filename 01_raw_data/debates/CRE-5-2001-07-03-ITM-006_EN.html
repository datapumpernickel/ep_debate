<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Randzio-Plath (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, you have made it clear that all the partners in the European single currency and also in the European Union need to pool their efforts if the historical event of completing the currency union of the 12 is to be achieved, and I can assure you that you have the support of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Central Bank is a very young institution. The euro, for which it is responsible, is not yet even a truly tangible currency. That is why it is so important for the ECB to establish its own credibility. That means that the ECB's mandate needs to be very clearly expressed through its monetary strategy. So far, the ECB has been fairly successful: even commentators who are usually very critical of the ECB's monetary policy are increasingly and quite rightly recognising that Europe needs a specific solution in monetary policy terms and that asset prices should not be the main parameter for monetary policy decision making. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of coherence in justifying individual policy measures. They may well be correct technically speaking, but purely technical explanations are not enough to convince Europe's markets and its public once again that the ECB is committed to price stability and to build up public confidence in the euro, which has unfortunately not improved since it was introduced. Against this background, the European Parliament's demand for immediate publication of the arguments for a decision or otherwise, together with the counter-arguments and the underlying reasons, and also of the summary minutes, could facilitate greater understanding of the ECB.</p>
<p class="contents">Max Weber once spoke about the three sources of authority: tradition, charisma and reason. The ECB should develop the form of authority that Weber considered modern – rational authority – as a means of achieving lasting respect and efficiency. Rational authority depends on a reliable assessment of the facts. Forming a judgment in this way provides a basis for a sensible public debate on the issues surrounding European monetary policy. This is essential if one considers that monetary policy is now, more than ever before, effective above all through the channel of the expectations of the financial markets, which have a considerable influence on the behaviour of the economic players. Without a lever of this kind a central bank can fail to achieve its objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Accountability and transparency do not mean that the ECB should publish more and more material. Quality is more important than quantity, and in this respect I would like to specifically acknowledge the quality of the monetary dialogue with the European Parliament. The ECB has improved the transparency of its monetary policy decision making. Nevertheless, more openness and transparency cannot do any harm, indeed in the coming months they should increase confidence in and acceptance of the single currency. The single European currency depends on this, and the following measures would be helpful:</p>
<p class="contents">First, the definition of the secondary target of monetary policy in accordance with Article 105 should be set and published in order to make it clear when the ECB can and must support growth and employment in the euro area, and that the ECB also supports conditions for sustainable growth effective in terms of employment at the highest level, as it did at the EU Summit in Lisbon with its target of 3% growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, it would be helpful in this respect to publish the models used. As long as the European Central Bank does not opt for an inflation target, it should stick to the two-pillar approach, but it should continuously improve its calculation of M3 by increased analysis and research activity. An analytically disciplined extension of the second pillar is also needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, the ECB's forecasts must be more precise and should not be broad ranges as they have up to now; these need to be narrowed. They should also be issued four times a year. In order to achieve greater understanding and transparency, the ECB should adopt the forecasts produced by its own staff.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth, summary minutes should be published containing the arguments made for and against when making decisions on monetary policy, together with an anonymous account of the voting pattern.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifth, we need to establish whether, as part of the revision of the Treaty, Parliament should not be given a kind of right of confirmation in respect of nomination of members of the Executive Board.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixth, as an important partner in macroeconomic decision making, the ECB should make its contribution to improving the coordination of economic policies and the generation of an appropriate and balanced policy mix, just as other independent central banks do, without diminishing its independence in the process.</p>
<p class="contents">The ECB's priority target of guaranteeing price stability is not, after all, an objective in its own right, but rather a key condition for economic growth and job creation. That is why monetary policy should not be formulated in isolation but rather supplemented by still closer macroeconomic policy coordination in the euro area. The situation still leaves a lot to be desired in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">This could prevent economic integration being driven solely by the markets without any account being taken of employment policy and social issues. Another reason for enhanced macroeconomic coordination involving the European Central Bank is the accelerating globalisation of financial markets, which less and less reflects the turnover of goods and services.</p>
<p class="contents">This suggests that interest rate variations will have a greater influence on the price of financial assets, while their effect on the real economy has become weaker than it used to be.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerns about the independence of the European Central Bank which have been raised as regards the effectiveness of its participation in the macroeconomic policy dialogue are equally difficult to understand. Quite the opposite: I believe that enhanced coordination would not endanger but reinforce the independence of the European Central Bank. A higher degree of economic convergence would also facilitate its task as it would even alleviate the problem of a "one size fits all" monetary policy, and therefore reduce the risk of putting the ECB under political pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Central Bank's position is not the same as that of the US Federal Reserve Bank. Its stakeholders are not just one President, one finance minister and the public, its stakeholders are 12 presidents, 12 finance ministers and the public of twelve European countries, who do not always speak with one voice. As the representative of the European public, the European Parliament would like to be a genuine partner in this dialogue regarding the creation of a new political culture in the European Union, which, on the one hand, guarantees the independence of the institutions but which, on the other hand, also takes account of the responsibility of each institution to be transparent and accountable in the interest of a properly functioning democracy.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maaten (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, this report on switching to the euro cannot be viewed in isolation. It builds on previous reports submitted, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, by Mr Karas and Mrs Torres Marques and upon the recent correspondence between Mrs Randzio-Plath and our President, Mrs Fontaine.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted to note that the European Central Bank and the European Commission are talking the same language as the European Parliament. Only eight amendments have been tabled to this report, by a group none of whose members, I notice, are present in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The euro is already a success, as Mr Duisenberg pointed out convincingly a moment ago. It is also the most exciting European project to date. After all, the European Union is no longer a theory but a tangible reality for all citizens in the euro-zone or, rather, all citizens in Europe and all world citizens. That is happening for the first time in the history of our European cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The launch date is 1 January. The issue will then not simply be about confidence in that currency, it will be about confidence in the European project as a whole, and that European project is, of course, open to all kinds of criticisms at the moment, the most recent case in point being the Irish referendum.</p>
<p class="contents">Provided it is done well, the introduction of the euro could , silence all that criticism. It could ensure that all citizens in euro land are proud of the way it has been done, maybe against all expectations. Where it is not done well, on the other hand, the introduction of the euro could also intensify criticism not only of the euro but also of European cooperation. After all, citizens need not read about the introduction of the euro in their newspapers. They can witness it for themselves. Current criticism with regard to European cooperation is that the decision-making process is not transparent, that citizens are not being heard and that the people at the top know it all. But those people at the top can also subsequently be brought very much down to earth in the eyes of the public. That applies to all of us, in fact.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumer organisations, as well as organisations in the medium-sized and small business sectors, have informed us of their wish to have small euro notes distributed during the last days of December – as is, in fact, also to happen in the case of euro coins – maybe in the form of packets that can be bought in banks or by switching over cash machines sooner, or in whatever other way. The public at large must gain access to those notes. That is an effective way to discourage counterfeiting. After all, citizens will then know from their own experience what the notes, obtained from a reliable source, look like. It benefits the safety of shopkeepers who will need to stock far fewer euros in their shops in order to have sufficient change on 1 and 2 January. It benefits the public. Fewer exchange problems arise when old currency is handed in to shops and euros are given in return. You know you will receive the right amount of the correct money if you pay in euros and get your change in euros. It can prevent a general sense of irritation.</p>
<p class="contents">I can understand the argument of Mr Duisenberg who says: we want to adhere to a decision we have taken. We want to be trustworthy in that respect. I can understand that well because many critics would, of course, exploit this and say that the European Central Bank has changed its mind again. That is not how things work.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we do believe that there are fresh facts. These have surfaced following research carried out within industry, which shows that the practical problems would really be enormous if we were not to distribute euro notes beforehand. I am not saying that frontloading is a guarantee that there will not be any problems, for that is not the case. Neither am I saying that, in the absence of frontloading, there will be considerable chaos. I have a reasonable amount of confidence in the consumer, who will know how to deal with these problems. I do believe that by frontloading, we are, in a relatively simple manner, reducing the risk of problems arising .</p>
<p class="contents">We would welcome a review of your decision. It would also be a sign of wisdom. Moreover, what happens if, by the end of the year, the pressure mounts and Ministers perhaps decide to change their minds and want to frontload in their own countries after all?</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a few final points. Of course, there are technical measures that could be taken, and I know that the ECB is also in favour of these: banks opening on 1 January, frontloading of euro coins, as is happening in a number of Member States, providing shopkeepers with better insurance and loading cash machines with small notes. Furthermore, those cash machines are a cause of concern, as far as I can see. We have, in fact, been supplied with recent figures in this respect from the European Commission. I would certainly not object to testing them in different Member States during the last days of the year. I would welcome your opinion on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The first days of January will be crucial to how much confidence 300 million citizens, and the whole world, can place in the euro. I wish you all the best in the implementation of that project. I do hope that you yourself will be prepared to reflect on our considerations.</p>

The Paragraph in question is the ninth. In our opinion, it compromises the Bank’s independence. The Bank’s task is to monitor price stability in the medium term, not overnight. We want an independent Bank. It is therefore inappropriate for Parliament to prescribe the Bank’s monetary policy. This is an essential point, in our view. Without this adaptation, we will be voting against the report, despite the fact that we give our wholehearted support to the rest of the report. Looking back to the year the report was drawn up and – inevitably – this year to some extent, we still have a wish list with regard to the bank’s communication policy. There is room for improvement in its communication with the financial markets and society.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Duisenberg, I asked you at your hearing whether you are able to stay on. You then replied in the affirmative, yet your stepping down is well documented in the press, as if it were a <span class="italic">fait accompli </span>after all. There is a desperate lack of good candidates. You have gained a great deal of experience. I would ask you once again: are you able to stay on to complete your term in office?</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the conversion to the euro, you know my position.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to comment on cross-border payments. Banks and companies will all earn back the costs incurred during the currency conversion, or they will receive compensation. People in Europe will surely not be the only ones footing the bill and experiencing the disadvantages without gaining any benefits. Mr Duisenberg, I insist that both the Bank and the European Commission assume their responsibilities, assigned in the Treaty, and ensure that cross-border payments which, after all, are no longer cross-border in a European home market, will, on 1 January 2002 cost about the same as remittances at home. You are undoubtedly aware that they have not become cheaper of late, but have become more expensive, by half a euro on average! I should like to inform the Directorate-General Competition of the fact that Parliament will resist a fixed fee of EUR 3 for receiving banks. That would mean that, in some countries, the price would, in fact, increase rather than decrease, and that would be unacceptable! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And I even believe that the changeover to the euro, if we can make a success of this final phase, assumes that we are discussing economic policy as a whole, including monetary policy and, from this perspective, I can only congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Randzio-Plath, the chairperson of Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the proposals that she has made, and I can only regret some of the votes that were cast in committee. If we want the euro to be the tool of the future that we hoped for, to enable Europe to be in harmony with prospects of growth for all, we must also discuss the monetary policy that you are implementing, Mr Duisenberg, and this is a subject that the people of Europe have a duty and the power to tackle.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, to turn to the practical aspects of the euro, I would like to congratulate Mr Maaten on his report, and to remind him that some of the authors of the amendments are here to discuss them and to go over two or three points.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issue of frontloading, Mr Duisenberg, I understand that this is very much like a rearguard action; as proof of this, I refer to the agenda of the recent Ecofin Councils and, once again, as I said to you in committee, this is something that I regret. As well as the symbolic changeover to the euro on D-Day, there was a psychological aspect regarding the time between Christmas and New Year which meant other provisions were required. You decided against these and we are sorry to see this.</p>
<p class="contents">As for everything else, we still have some months left during which we can run a major publicity campaign so as to ensure that the changeover to the euro is as smooth as possible. In order to do this, the campaign that will be run must emphasise two main points: first of all, the issue of sensitive groups of people and, secondly, the psychological aspects of the changeover. I believe that the aim of the whole campaign should be that as many citizens as possible take on board the idea of the changeover from day one and that they cease using two currencies, mentally as well as physically. To this end, I hope that Parliament will be able to adopt an amendment that we re-tabled on behalf of our group, which would ban dual pricing after a period of one year. This year should give people time to adapt – a real changeover should occur if dual pricing is banned after one year. We must eliminate ambiguity from the changeover to the euro, which we must ensure is an experience shared by all citizens, whilst hoping that they will all join us in using the common currency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Mr Duisenberg will remember, Parliament has repeatedly adopted a transparency package advocating five separate measures to increase transparency. I am delighted to report that the ECB has so far agreed three of them, and we must give them credit for this. We have had no problems in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in inviting members of the governing Council to appear before us. Last year, we had eleven such appearances.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the ECB began to publish regular forecasts or, as they prefer to call them, "projections" in the December 2000 monthly bulletin, and that was a very welcome development. In addition, econometric models are now published in the working paper series. It would be nice if they were in more user-friendly form, for example, on CD-ROM, but there is progress.</p>
<p class="contents">The two remaining measures that Parliament is again calling for are a publication of a "Beige Book" setting out conditions in each Member State and publication of summary minutes giving the views for and against interest rate changes. In addition, this year we are asking the ECB Governing Council to deal with a specific problem it has faced in a couple of recent interest rate changes. There was confusion in the markets about what was perceived as an unpredictable decision and the marketplace was clearly not prepared for that decision. Indeed, some people went as far as to say it was arbitrary, so we are calling for the publication of votes on an anonymous basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In particular in the report I support the comments on the need for frontloading the general public with notes and coins. I also welcome its emphasis on the role of local and regional public administrations in the changeover.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that every effort is made to ensure that this so-called flagship event is managed effectively and that the changeover is smooth. Most of my comments, however, are based on a view from the outside, from Scotland, for the time being part of the UK. There may be some problems with public awareness within the euro zone, but we have a much bigger problem within Scotland and the rest of the UK. A Scots newspaper this week published a survey of public attitudes to the euro in Scotland and this showed a lamentable lack of awareness, which was directly linked to a low level of enthusiasm for the currency.</p>
<p class="contents">The level of awareness in Scotland may be lamentable but it is not surprising given the attitudes of the political leaders in the Scots and UK governments in recent years. The new Labour London government has been afraid to show support for UK entry, or even to provide factual information, while the Conservatives have simply shown an almost deranged hostility to the euro and have attempted to mislead the public on the implications of joining.</p>
<p class="contents">In principle my party favours the euro subject to entry terms suiting Scotland's economy and after a referendum, but ideally as an SNP member I would like to see Scotland an independent EU Member State being in a position to make the decision based on Scots priorities, while retaining domestic control over taxation. In the short term, though outwith the euro zone, there is also a substantial need for factual information campaigning on the implications after 2002 in our relationship with the euro zone, whether we ever decide to join or not. I welcome recent statements from some high street retailers in Scotland that they will be accepting euros in their tills, alongside sterling, from 2002. This can only enhance Scotland's position as a welcoming tourist and business travel destination, as well as familiarising Scots with the euro notes and coins.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the UK and the Scots governments to encourage the process of public information and to seek the support of the European Central Bank and the European Commission in encouraging Scots businesses to gear up for the acceptance of the new coins and notes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to yesterday's <span class="italic">Financial Times Deutschland</span>, 49% of Germany's population are against the euro. Over 50% do not believe that it will boost the economy or emulate the stability of the Deutschmark. 30% expect a decline in the value of their assets and 67% expect price increases when we switch over to the euro. The euro has certainly not become a job machine or acted as a brake on inflation, which is precisely what was rashly promised to the public earlier on.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very grateful to you, Mr Duisenberg, that the decline in the euro exchange rate is cited in the ECB report as one reason for the increase in inflation, and that the report at least refers to the increasing inflation rate differential between the euro countries rather than putting all the blame for the euro's weakness on the dollar. Monetary stability in the euro area and the external exchange rate stability of the euro are inextricably linked.</p>
<p class="contents">It needs to be said just as clearly that the ECB's monetary policy has failed to achieve its own stability targets and that the euro is now even associated with a decline in real income. The responsibility for this is not, however, chiefly attributable to the ECB, whose scope for action is becoming ever more restricted. It is more that the policy of the euro countries has contributed far too little to economic convergence. What is really incomprehensible is that the French proposal to establish an "economic government" has gone unheeded.</p>
<p class="contents">The differences in inflation and growth between the individual euro countries, which are in fact increasing, are dangerous and I believe that they should be analysed in great detail in future ECB reports. Uniform interest rates are too restrictive for some euro countries and too expansionary for others. A European monetary policy geared to monetary stability is totally at odds with conflicting national economic, tax and social policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I observed that the European currency was getting off to a bad start: the Union had no economic policy and the Council of Ministers had not even issued an outline plan or guidelines so that the national States could work together to tackle major areas such as unemployment, flexibility, the conversion of some sectors and the social and cultural effects of the increase in pace that technological innovations such as the Internet were bringing not just in the market place but in other areas of life as well. Europe had no foreign policy and no strategies of its own for orienting globalisation and world finance, and this, together with the lack of economic strategy and the indifference displayed by institutional bodies towards the citizens, who had been neither consulted nor informed about the matter, meant that the launching of the euro resembled the building of a cathedral in the desert. Yet there was still hope, for there would have been time to introduce political, economic and financial initiatives to cultivate that desert, if only the political will had been there to develop and implement them.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in recent years, the euro has not been doing well, and the date of its impending entry into force is looming up like an unavoidable appointment for which the citizens have no enthusiasm and which is often viewed with trepidation by some of those very politicians who have contributed, in recent years, to the barren path the euro has taken. It is a currency which has consistently been undervalued in relation to the dollar and which has consequently penalised investments and savings.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same report, Mr Maaten points out how the criticisms we made then – criticisms which, in recent years, we have brought to the attention of Parliament and the Commission on a number of occasions – were justified: indeed, medium-sized enterprises, trade, the craft trades and the agricultural sector, all of which are major production categories, are not yet ready for the transition to the euro. The banking system is not ready either, despite the multibillions invested in purchasing the necessary equipment. These and other issues which remain unresolved give rise to the fear that there will be negative consequences, both for the citizens and in terms of the correct assessment of the real value of the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by saying that we support the many suggestions made in the report, but we nevertheless condemn the fact that both their proposal and their implementation are long overdue. This is why we want to know clearly, once and for all, who is responsible for delays, bad planning and failure to assess the situation with regard to the economic sectors and social situations in the field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are the last people to be consulted and also the last people to be informed.</p>
<p class="contents">The most fervent supporters of Europe will feel an unexpected surge of anxiety when reading Mr Maaten’s report, which describes a state of almost total unpreparedness, the limited, even non-existent, use of the euro in international transactions, including between the countries within Europe, the doubt surrounding the possibility that the banks will exchange citizens’ coins free of charge, the absurd charges for cross-border transactions, even though they are made using the same currency and the excessive price increases that the currency changeover is bound to provoke. The litany is long and it does not paint a joyful picture.</p>
<p class="contents">The governments demanded the euro for ideological reasons whereas large financial organisations demanded it for reasons that are purely self-motivated. The euro has been around for two years and it has failed to catch on even amongst its most ardent supporters, and still less so within the international markets. The euro has lost its value against the dollar and nothing points to an imminent recovery. The changeover to using euro notes is, therefore, a useless and costly operation without a doubt. It will cause a rise in inflation and cases of public or private embezzlement. It would be better to stop all this while we still have the chance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Rapporteur Maaten was right to commit himself to that cause. The euro’s uncertain success as a currency should not be further frustrated by uncertainty during that transition.</p>
<p class="contents">Confidence in a currency is fundamental to every modern economy. The basis for that confidence, however, is rather shaky in the case of the euro. That is why we have nothing to lose by taking precautionary measures during the changeover. It is therefore only fair to do justice to the concerns of all the parties involved. The ECB’s attitude, however, can be described as somewhat inflexible. Further to the Maaten report, Parliament has arrived at a compromise date of 27 December as the date on which to make the first small notes available. It ensures that the changeover is spread out. Those few days leave little scope for counterfeiting. I fail to see why this compromise would not be acceptable to the ECB.</p>
<p class="contents">Along with the availability of euros, payment by bank card is another bottleneck. The way in which those transactions are to be processed is not equal to the temporary massive increase in the use of that method of payment. It is to be feared that people will therefore be forced to use the national currencies longer than necessary. This leads to uncertainty when paying in old currency and receiving change in euros.</p>
<p class="contents">The availability of cash machines and the extent to which payments are made by bank card differ quite considerably from one Member State to another. In the light of this, has the ECB looked into additional methods for distributing the money? Is it possible, prior to the changeover, to buy euros electronically, for example through transactions on the Internet whereby certain quantities are set aside. If payment for these could take place electronically, the amounts would only need to be paid out in January. That would render conversions in January redundant. It would give an indication of the amount requested and would make it possible to plan ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, it would increase the reliability of electronic payments and provide a stimulus to these. If something of that kind is not possible, we must ask ourselves whether online transactions are mere pie in the sky for the time being. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the out-dated ‘shield’ theory. However, it appears now that that theory is only true up to a point, in that it will eliminate currency fluctuations between Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, which is more serious, the euro no longer plays the role of a shield: it is now aggravating the crisis stemming from the economic slow-down in the US, since the euro is preventing each country from taking specific targeted action. In fact, Chancellor Schröder recently called upon the ECB to shoulder its responsibilities by supporting growth in Germany. He is wrong and he should realise that he is a victim of the rules of the monetary unification game. The ECB cannot make a drastic reduction in its interest rates in order to please Germany, because other countries are calling for opposite measures. And, incidentally, if rates were lowered, this could cause the value of the euro to fall even further, which would give a terrible impression when we are just about to embark upon the physical changeover of coins and notes.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems, therefore, Mr President, that the citizens of Europe might have to pay a very high price for wanting a single currency when we have different economies, especially since, according to the latest available statistics, it is this, even more than the euro itself, that seems to be contributing to causing greater divergences in terms of both inflation and growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thank you very much for that.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is a lot of juggling with figures, but they are all relative. I would just like to mention a couple from my own country, where we heard yesterday that 63% of people think it is right that Austria should be a member of the economic and currency union from the outset, 43% see the euro as an advantage and 24% are neutral on this, which means that 67% are in favour. That does mean, however, that we still have a great deal to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to make a few points clear for the benefit of the public. The euro is not "coming", as you see on many posters, it already exists, and it is a success. Every country has benefited from it, price stability has grown, Europe's economic independence has been enhanced, exports and tourism have been given a lasting boost by eliminating exchange rate fluctuations, and a start has been made on reducing government and budget deficits. I call on the governments of all the Member States to inform their parliaments and the public about the advantages of the euro in the euro area and not just to give the impression that something new and unknown is about to arrive.</p>
<p class="contents">The next point that I consider important is that the euro is not a political project and, please excuse me, Mr Duisenberg, you cannot say that it is just a matter for the ECB – that is a point in your favour, you are doing your job well in this respect – and for the banks, nor is it just something for finance ministers. It is a political project and not just a financial product and I therefore believe that we should involve education policy, small and medium-sized enterprises and consumers more in information policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We do this every year and it is the only opportunity which Parliament has to debate the policy of what is now an important and independent European institution.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate is being held within the context of a radically changed global economy. The downturn in the economy, which has brought us to the brink of recession, has created a great deal of pressure. The European Central Bank and other central banks throughout the world are under a great deal of pressure to relax their monetary policy. This pressure emanates mainly from the capital markets, which went into free fall recently and which sometimes appear to have become absurdly pessimistic, just as they were absurdly optimistic until recently, at least according to Mr Greenspan.</p>
<p class="contents">The moral of the story is, I think, quite clear. The central banks must not be guided by short-term prospects on the money markets, be they on a peak or in a trough. You must be guided, Mr President, by principles of monetary stability and economic development, as laid out in the Treaty. But if there is to be greater confidence in the euro, the people of Europe and money markets throughout the world must have greater confidence in how you exercise your policy and how you intend to achieve monetary stability. At this juncture, I think that we need to rethink the system of the two pillars of monetary policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report is timely and Mr Maaten's observations are very welcome. The one clear fact about 'euro day', 1 January 2002, is that it is truly irreversible. It is going to happen and, therefore, we must be ready.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made substantial progress on all fronts. Taking public information first, the surveys of public awareness about the euro are heartening. The most recent survey carried out in May by the Irish Euro Changeover Board show that in my country, 95% of people know the name of the single currency, 91% have same prices in both Irish Pounds and the euro and 79% know that euro notes and coins will be introduced in 2002. Seventy-eight percent have seen pictures of the euro notes and coins and 64% know that an Irish Pound will get you EUR 1.27. There is still a distance to go, however: only 36% of people are aware of the length of the dual circulation period, which in my country has been shortened to 9 February 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, there has been quite an amount of legislation to cater for the introduction of the euro, covering areas such as finance and social welfare. In all cases, it is essential that we act on the principle of favouring the citizen. There are essentially two tasks for national and European authorities: they have to oversee the successful changeover to the euro and provide the public with information about it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is strange, to say the least, to see that the method of self-persuasion used to create the euro has now been replaced by heavy-handed tactics. I am sorry to say that, in my view, the changeover to the single currency has been forced through.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the people were never consulted to find out if they were in favour of replacing their national currency. In this respect, the example of Ireland is a prime example of the way that Europe works. The people are not consulted any more extensively now about the practical introduction of the euro, even though they are the most important element in this equation. Indeed, the information campaigns in which politicians have participated continually place the responsibility on the citizens – their message is that if the euro is a failure, the citizens must understand that it will be their fault. In other words, the task of young people and the retired is to provide information, following the example of governments and civil servants. Lastly, businesses can give practical training. For example, who is dealing with the difficulties experienced by businesses in rural areas, which are faraway from the centres of learning that are based in towns? How can we ask businesspeople who work 12 hours a day to go to their local Chamber of Commerce to attend information sessions?</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, for all the reasons I have given, I do not think it is acceptable to allow the citizens to shoulder all the responsibility. It is too easy to leave what we are incapable of doing ourselves at the door of others. It was Europe that wanted a single currency, so Europe will now have to put take responsibility for it! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Growth is declining and inflation is on the increase. The Federal Republic of Germany, which accounts for a third of the euro area, is bringing up the rear in terms of growth, inflation and net government borrowing. It is no longer the locomotive it once was, it is now the last coach in the train.</p>
<p class="contents">At this difficult time it is, above all, important for the European Central Bank, which is a young central bank, to gain credibility. For this reason we too will not be voting for three of the proposals made by the rapporteur in her report.</p>
<p class="contents">The first proposal was that core inflation should be the key factor in economic decision making, that is to say inflation excluding energy and food. This would amount to looking at the world through rose-tinted spectacles, because what matters to the public is not core inflation but inflation including energy and food prices.</p>
<p class="contents">The second proposal that we will be rejecting is that of setting inflation targets. I am convinced that the European Central Bank was right to establish its own definition of stability shortly after it was set up, according to which monetary stability is an inflation rate of less than 2%. That cannot be altered now. If anything, it is precisely in the current difficult situation that the European Central Bank should be measured by its own yardstick. That is the reason why we cannot vote for this second proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The third proposal relates to the accession countries. The proposal that the accession countries should not in fact be required to meet the inflation criteria of the Maastricht Treaty in the same way, which would also mean a weakening of stability, is something else my Group will not agree to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The change from 12 different national currencies to a single currency is the culmination of months of careful preparation and yet I fear some citizens, even at this late stage, have not grasped the significance of the change and its implications, which I believe are extremely positive.</p>
<p class="contents">No other EU policy change will impact in such a profound and personal way on all citizens and at the same time. From children to pensioners, from the corporate sector to small business, each will be exposed to this significant milestone in European administration. Because there is a degree of complacency with regard to all EU change, every effort must be made in the months remaining before 1 January to alert consumers to the importance of what is happening and, more importantly, to assure them that their interests are placed at the forefront by those whose job it is to manage this important change. I am satisfied that everything possible is being done, but nothing can be left to chance.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that there are some people who are sceptical. Their views are important to the debate, but we must establish beyond doubt that their worries will not be realised. For example, we all recall the introduction of decimalisation and, despite our assurances at that time, consumers experienced price increases. We all need to put beyond doubt the absence of a cost factor in the exchange mechanism. The House will be aware that banks availed themselves of the transition period to cream off excessive exchange charges and, to some extent, this is still happening.</p>
<p class="contents">What assurances can the European Central Bank give that these matters will be scrutinised with the utmost vigour and with appropriate sanctions? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Despite this, many people will not realise until then – and it will come as a bit of a shock – that Europe does affect their daily routine.</p>
<p class="contents">That fact on its own is reason enough to pull out all the stops in order to make the transition as smooth as possible, that is to say without causing irritation among the public. Otherwise, I fear that we will be paying for this in years to come in the form of distrust of the European integration process and, as we stand at the crossroads in Europe today, I do not think that we can afford this.</p>
<p class="contents">Excellent work has already been done, but we have not completed the task yet, and I would therefore urge that the following be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, information must be more extensive, more dynamic, more effective and oriented more towards the target group.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, consumers must be frontloaded, in terms of both notes and coins. And if the European Central Bank remains opposed to this, I wonder, Commissioner, if you would not be able to take action in order to make this possible, by amending the Regulation of 3 May 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, electronic payment must be encouraged, that is true, but it must also become cheaper. A complaint has been lodged with the Directorate-General for Competition in that connection. Commissioner, I would urge you to ask Mr Monti to finally deal with this complaint.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, cross-border payment transfers must become cheaper, and I could not word it better than Mrs Peijs did a moment ago on behalf of my Group.</p>

The bank has achieved stability in monetary policy in the mid-term despite the sudden rise in oil prices, the great uncertainty on the currency markets and heightened tension on the money markets. The faith of citizens in the European Central Bank is primarily based on price stability. It is important to citizens that the currency is stable and that the real level of earnings and purchasing power remain unchanged. However, trust can also be increased by increasing openness and transparency in the work of the ECB. Transparency goes without saying for national central banks, and should also be the case for the European Central Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">The changeover to the euro is a unique event in economic history for which there is no precedent in terms of magnitude. Adopting a single currency is a concrete indication of how far European integration has come. Our citizens expect us to do all we can to ensure a smooth transition to the euro. It is important that we prepare carefully to avoid unnecessary problems and thus giving rise to a negative image among citizens. However, we must remember the fundamentals. The euro will not fail due to practical problems encountered during a transitional period of two or three weeks. If it fails due to anything, it will fail because the currency is not sufficiently stable or strong. Our single currency is as strong as the economy behind it. A strong economy, healthy business structures and a functioning internal market are vital prerequisites for the trust of citizens and the global competitiveness of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context I would also like to mention my concern regarding the fate of the Directive on Takeovers to be addressed tomorrow. The directive has taken twelve years to draw up. After much wrangling, the European Parliament and the Council have managed to reach an agreement through the conciliation procedure. If the directive fails tomorrow we will be able to say that while many fine words were heard in Lisbon, here we need action. The value of our single currency depends considerably on these actions on the part of Parliament, the Council and all the institutions of the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since this is, in any case, a historic event – indeed, hitherto, all the Member States have had to handle currency exchange internally whereas, now, the entire Community will be changing to a single currency – it may be that all the aspects and consequences of the introduction of the euro will not have been foreseen and that some situations – as yet not clearly defined – might arise after the fateful date of 1 January 2002. From this point of view, it is the duty of all of us to endeavour to make contributions which will not just facilitate the transition but also highlight positive or negative aspects closely linked to the event itself.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I feel I may be allowed to focus on three points. Firstly: in the period which remains before the established date of 1 January 2002, information must be must stepped up in the peripheral and decentralised areas, since it must not be forgotten that people in rural areas still practise a form of hoarding under the mattress which must be overcome in this difficult situation. Secondly: after the transition period, during the following decade in which it is laid down that it will be possible to change national currency into euros at Member States' central banks, all the bureaucratic formalities should be reduced in order to allow the poorest people to change small sums of money without any burden being imposed. Thirdly and most importantly: up until the final exchange date, I call upon the qualified intermediaries, particularly credit institutions, to pay greater attention and apply greater rigour to cash transactions. I am sure that organised crime networks amass cash supplies for illegal transactions ...</p>

I have already addressed in my introductory statement the most important ones contained in the two resolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to add some points. Mrs Randzio-Plath asked about the secondary objective in the Treaty. It is our strong belief that if the ECB is successful in maintaining price stability, and thereby creating an environment of predictable stability for entrepreneurs, that is the best contribution that the ECB can make to fostering growth of output and employment. Should the European Parliament be involved, if the Treaty is ever changed, in the appointment of the Executive Board? That is an issue the Executive Board should stay out of. However, the European Parliament is already involved in appointing members of the Executive Board in the same way as the Governing Council of the ECB is involved. On a proposal by the ministers of finance, the European Parliament and the Governing Council of the ECB, Parliament can offer advice so as to enable the Heads of State and the Council to reach a decision.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree that monetary policy should work not in isolation but in ever closer coordination. However, the ECB will never engage in coordination of our policies with other policies in the economic and financial field, because this would prejudice our primary objective under the Treaty, namely to preserve price stability.</p>
<p class="contents">Many points were made about the resolution. I have already addressed some of them in my introductory statement. I am grateful to Mrs Peijs and Mr von Wogau for their support on various points, namely the guarantee of the independence of the Central Bank. I say to both Mrs Berès and Mrs Randzio-Plath, that in no way – and they already know it – would the ECB shy away from a dialogue with the European Parliament or its committees. That has been proven in the past and we will continue to prove it in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Peijs asked the obvious question: can you stay? The answer I always give, and give again, is "yes". She also pleaded for cross-border transfers to be as costly or as cheap as domestic transfers. I agree with her completely. It may take a little longer than 1 January 2002 to achieve it. However, I believe that in a single market with a single currency, the distinction should disappear, but it may take some time.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn to the important subject of frontloading, which has been mentioned by Mr Maaten in his draft resolution and by many other Members. Specific questions have been asked: is it possible or advisable to change the automatic teller machines a few days earlier than 1 January 2002. The answer is "no". That would seriously damage the payments system at the busiest time of the year, namely the last few days of December. The automatic teller machines must still be able to distribute national currencies. If they were disabled for that purpose, the payments system would be seriously damaged. It has to be remembered that between 70% and 80% of total bank note distribution is through automatic teller machines.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important because we too see the potential for problems arising. It is important that the machines are converted as soon as possible. In five countries the old automatic teller machines will have been converted by 1 January. That applies to the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, Ireland and Luxembourg. In other countries it may take a little while longer, but that is mainly due to the fact that some of these machines are in very remote areas which are not serviced every day, for example in Finland and Spain. It will take a little longer there but in the majority of countries the conversion will take place within one week. In five countries it will occur within one day.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Maaten also asked in his resolution for some priority to be given to the dispersal of small EUR 5 and EUR 10 bank notes in automatic teller machines. This point is well covered in the national changeover scenarios. Apart from Finland, in all other countries it is envisaged to dispense, at least in some of the automatic teller machines, the EUR 5 and EUR 10 notes exclusively via ATMs in the first few days of next year.</p>
<p class="contents">There are in place fuller steps that could be taken to smooth the changeover, for example establishing temporary exchange points, for instance in supermarkets. We encourage that. In countries where welfare payments are still largely paid in cash we encourage the use of lower denomination bank notes. We are encouraging banks to open their counters on 1 January 2002. At this juncture, this is envisaged in Austria, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. We urge other countries to consider the same measures as well.</p>
<p class="contents">In its resolution the European Parliament has also made various suggestions. I will not comment on all of them but the European Parliament also suggests what I just said, namely encouraging banks to open their counters on 1 January, a point which is fully welcomed and supported by the ECB. It has been suggested that the date of the annual sales should be changed, postponing them by a few weeks. The ECB is neutral on this point, but I see the merits in it.</p>
<p class="contents">Lower fees for credit cards and other electronic means of payment have been mentioned. This is currently envisaged in Austria, Belgium and Finland. Here, too, the ECB, because of the nature of the subject, is neutral but I would encourage national authorities to listen carefully to the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Returning to the questions that have been asked, I would say that instead of frontloading, our information campaign, as it develops from 30 August onwards and intensifies over the months to come until the end of this year and in the first couple of weeks of next year, will be such that the public at large will, I am sure, be fully familiar by 1 January, with how the bank notes will look with their security features. One element of this campaign is that, in the first or second week of December, we will distribute 300 million leaflets to every citizen of the euro area, fully describing the new bank notes and the procedures of the cash changeover. Mr Maaten asked a question which amused me: "What if, in the last few days ministers do change their minds and do nevertheless start frontloading bank notes?" With all due respect, not only to Mr Maaten but also to the ministers, the ministers cannot take such a decision because in the Treaty they have handed over the competence for the issue of bank notes to their national central banks and the ECB. Only the ECB, the Eurosystem, can decide when the bank notes will be distributed and that will be on 1 January 2002. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solbes,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, following the speech by the President of the European Central Bank, Mr Duisenberg, I wish to comment briefly on a few points. I shall refer basically to Mr Maaten’s report, since I agree with Mr Duisenberg’s comments on the report by Mrs Randzio-Plath.</p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost, I should like to point out that access to starter kits for coins is not limited to one per person. I agree with the decisions that have been taken by the various countries. It is possible to obtain more than one kit in all of these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Duisenberg referred to ‘frontloading’, which is the advance circulation of low denomination notes in automatic cash machines. I should simply like to make one comment, which is that the Commission report to which some of you have referred is a simple report for calculating how much time would be needed to fully replace a national currency with the European currency according to the quantities currently being made available through automatic cash machines. This is a statistical analysis, which therefore assumes that there will be no increase in the rate at which this money is used and nor does it take into consideration sources other than automatic cash machines. In any event, I wish to point out that the existence of transitional periods is justified precisely because the entire operation will not be able to be completed immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to sales, the Commission takes the view that these should be delayed for two weeks so that they do not coincide with the introduction of notes and coins. Nevertheless, this is a national decision, which must be taken by each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">I must make one comment on the risk of price increases resulting from the changeover to the euro: the Commission has considered the matter and takes the view that the crucial factor for preventing the changeover to the euro being used as an opportunity to raise prices is the dual display of prices in both the national currency and in the Community currency. We have, of course, insisted on other measures, such as requiring public administrations to round down their charges or, in any event, maintaining the principle of neutrality. Some of the positions held by the Commission have been accepted by the Eurogroup, which issued a statement on 4 June adopting these points.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to recall, in response to some of the speeches I have heard today, that the period for the dual display of prices should in principle be limited to the first six months of next year and then dual pricing should disappear.</p>
<p class="contents">The practical messages for the public that you are proposing as regards the awareness-raising campaigns can be introduced by means of the cooperation that Parliament is pursuing with the consultative group on the practical aspects of the changeover to the euro, which is made up of the individuals in charge of the various national campaigns.</p>
<p class="contents">I should just like to make one comment on electronic payment: the Commission has tried to ensure that for the purposes of the changeover to the euro, European banking federations and associations move ahead with reducing charges for electronic payment. We have not, however, made any headway on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the Commission and the European Central Bank are committed to moving ahead with reducing charges for cross-border transactions. We are aware that this is not an easy task and that varying approaches between national and cross-border payments might give rise to some conflict with internal market legislation. The Commission is studying potential occurrences in order to facilitate and speed up as much as possible this process of reducing cross-border charges.</p>
<p class="contents">1 January 2002 will mark a milestone in the history of European integration. The whole world will be closely observing what happens in Europe. I am convinced that the institutions, the Member States, and the Central Banks will prove up to the task and I wish to thank Parliament once again for the cooperation it has given us in all aspects of preparing for the process of replacing national currencies with the euro. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
