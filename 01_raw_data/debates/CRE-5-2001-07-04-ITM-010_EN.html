<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bourlanges (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, what we have here, albeit under a somewhat technical title, namely the creation of executive agencies to be entrusted with certain tasks in the management of Community programmes, is a rather important reform, and an element which is by no means peripheral to the administrative reform which is taking place within the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say straightaway that the Committee on Budgetary Control and this House are very much in sympathy with the principle of the agency that has been proposed to us, and our initial impression is a favourable one, because, in creating this agency, the Commission is responding to a matter of fundamental concern to Parliament, a concern which it expressed in the context of the budgetary procedure for the year 2000. Parliament was anxious to see the dismantling of the technical assistance offices (TAOs), which were not supervised very well and which did not come under the Commission’s control, and to have them replaced by establishments which would exhibit both the security which goes with the public nature of the institutions and, at the same time, the flexibility of management and operation which is necessary in order to accomplish a certain number of tasks, in particular the implementation of certain programmes. In short, what we said was, – ‘Let us abolish the TAOs, but let us not replace them with central Commission services, but rather let us invent something new’. These agencies are certainly something new.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal forms part of a greater whole, an externalisation policy which comprises three facets. First, there is the privatisation of certain specific, precisely defined tasks, a privatisation which we are in favour of provided that the private persons who will be responsible for these tasks are not given integrated administrative tasks to do. Second, there are the executive agencies themselves. Finally, there is a third aspect about which we are more doubtful, but which we are not about to discuss this evening, and that is the creation of national agencies, which will be responsible for running a certain number of programmes in the territory of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed regulation which you have before you is concerned only with the statute of the agencies. Therefore, Madam Commissioner, in principle you have the support of the rapporteur and the support of the Committee on Budgetary Control. That does not mean, as I am sure you suspected because you know me, that we agree with everything. There are a certain number of points on which we agree and a certain number on which we disagree. As far as the first group is concerned, as I have already said, we agree with the principle of the agency. We also agree with the detailed rules for the management of that body, part of which will consist of staff seconded from the Commission, because we want this agency to be clearly subordinate, both politically and administratively, to the Commission. The other part of the body will consist of more flexible staff recruited on the basis of temporary contracts tailored to the management flexibility needed for programmes of limited duration.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe, and I think that this is a point on which we agree, that these new bodies must be subject to the same controls, and the same obligations regarding communication, audit and OLAF competency, as the Commission’s central services. On this point, I think we see things from the same angle. On the other hand, there are a certain number of points on which we still have doubts which need to be cleared up.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of these concerns the definition of the tasks that are likely to be externalised and entrusted to the executive agencies. This is an old issue, and one on which the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control are in step, even if some of us are not entirely of the same opinion. We would like these externalised tasks to be <span class="italic">really </span>externalised, because they are of a temporary nature and because they require the use of temporary or specialist staff, but we do not want them to be externalised simply because they would cost less because they would be using less well paid and less qualified staff. That is not our objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we believe that the Commission’s legal responsibility should be complete and direct. This is a point of law on which we may disagree, but I do not believe that we are fundamentally opposed to one another. In the same way, and this is quite an important technical point which Mrs Theato, the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, is particularly keen on, we would like to see discharge being granted to these bodies at the same time as discharge is granted to the Commission. We do not want them to be separated, and we do not want to have to know about innumerable separate discharges. We want to be able to decide on discharge with a single vote, for both operating appropriations and administrative appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">I am approaching my conclusion. There are still two points on which we still differ, and which are causing a problem at the committee stage.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the rapporteur had proposed that 25% of the staff of the agency should actually come from the Commission, although the Committee on Budgetary Control did not go along with this proposal and has not, in fact, agreed to it. On behalf of our group we tabled an amendment which was intended to reinstate this request, but slightly altered, and after negotiations with the Commission we specified that the figure of 25% would not have to be achieved until after a certain time had elapsed, in this case a period of eighteen months, which would enable the agency to reach cruising speed. I hope to be able to convince committee members in the Socialist Group to support this proposal. I have not managed to do so yet, but I have not given up hope.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to my last point, and it is an important one. It concerns the nature of the typical staff statutes and contracts. We disagree on this point, and I am concerned because, following the Cocobu vote, I saw proposals for regulations which rather worried me. We are concerned to note that staff would be subject to non-renewable statutes. If this is the case, we shall find ourselves with staff of inferior quality, who are less loyal and who will not be in a position to ensure continuity of service on all occasions, thus giving rise to periods of interruption which will be detrimental to the interests of those who benefit from the services and for whom the programmes are intended.</p>
<p class="contents">On this point, Madam Commissioner, I want to ask you for a firm commitment. We want to have continuity of service, and we want the staff who are used by these agencies to have renewable arrangements according to need, and not to have their contracts cut off arbitrarily and automatically while the programme is still going on. Those, Madam Commissioner, are the feelings of our committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall stop there, having reached my conclusion, which is that we support your proposal in principle, while waiting to hear from you certain clarifications on the points which I have raised. Thank you, Mr President, for your patience, and I should also like to thank my fellow committee members for their warm support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That may be right. It means the Commission must delegate and decentralise. Various models have in the past proved unsuitable or failures. Either they were not financially transparent, like the minibudgets, or they were conducive to fraud like the TAOs, which is why Parliament demanded their abolition.</p>
<p class="contents">Now the Commission is presenting a proposal for a regulation for the statute of so-called executive agencies, which the rapporteur, Mr Bourlanges, has just explained. I should like to congratulate him on his very detailed treatment of this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to underline a number of important points in his report. The Commission must provide a precise list of the tasks to be transferred, whether they are public or non-public and the type of executive agency to which they are to be transferred. Unfortunately, we do not yet have the promised handbook about that. But it must be clear that responsibility for the proper and economic execution of the transferred tasks lies with the Commission, which is subject to discharge by Parliament, which means there can be no discharge for the agencies themselves. Parliament must be provided with all the information and documents it requires for the purpose without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">The agencies are also subject to scrutiny by the Court of Auditors and, where appropriate, also by OLAF. The Commission is also legally liable for the executive agencies, since they are not anchored in the Treaty as institutions in their own right. The agencies must be evaluated within not more than three years to check they are operating as they should. Finally, all contracts with outside agencies must be limited in time. Mr Bourlanges has just mentioned that. The framework regulation makes no provision for their term to be extended. But I think there ought to be provision for that.</p>
<p class="contents">It is at all events important that at least 25% of executive agency staff should be seconded Commission officials in order to ensure internal supervision of administrative tasks and to see that the Commission’s responsibilities are fulfilled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have stood up to the group discipline of my delegation to support you, but to no avail.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to congratulate the rapporteur on the report that is before us today. He has adopted a very constructive attitude in the Committee on Budgetary Control and I should also like to congratulate him on the excellent working relationship with the rapporteur of the Committee on Budgets. It is first-class teamwork, which deserves to be emulated.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group gives its unqualified support to the proposal of the European Commission. We also back the report by Mr Bourlanges. We are of the opinion that the Commission proposal forms a key component in the reform programme that was set in motion after 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal aims to externalise certain tasks in a clearly defined framework and end the administrative chaos of the technical assistance offices.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgetary Control did tighten the proposal of the European Commission on a number of scores, as Mrs Theato has already mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the location of the registered office of the agencies. The text now refers to opening branch offices for agencies. According to our amendment, this reference is being deleted. There is still room for improvement. Mr Mulder has tabled a sound amendment and I should like you, Mr Bourlanges, to consider adopting Mr Mulder’s amendment as a supplement to your amendment, so that we do not need to choose between the two.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the provisions on financial audit and control are being tightened. The obligation has been included to produce a report annually. That is a major improvement in my view.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we call for one Financial Regulation for all agencies, as opposed to a different Financial Regulation for each agency. If not, we fear that we will no longer see the wood for the trees.</p>
<p class="contents">And finally, OLAF’s powers relating to agencies and relating to the European Commission should be the same in our opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">We still beg to differ with the rapporteur on a number of points. Firstly, his definition of externalisation is rather skimpy. He would like to restrict externalisation to temporary tasks and tasks of a technical nature. In practice, it is true that that will often be the nature of those tasks, but we find it too restricted. A decisive Commission needs flexibility. The question is what is most efficient, what is most cost-effective? That question should be central, and we as European Parliament should not plug that opening. And secondly, this has already been mentioned, Mr Bourlanges proposes to include a minimum percentage for the number of Commission officials who need to work in such an agency.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, a certain percentage of Commission officials will need to work in such an agency, but it appears inappropriate in our view to place a figure on that percentage. That will differ for each agency according to the nature and work of the agency.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bourlanges said in the committee: surely the Socialists are in favour of workers’ rights? I would say: surely, the PPE is in favour of abolishing unnecessary rules and in favour of freedom?</p>
<p class="contents">And finally, I should like to ask the Commission its opinion on the amendments tabled by Mr Ellis to this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Needless to say, the proposal we are discussing at the moment has become inevitable after the events of a number of years ago. It is necessary for us to further regulate the task of the executive bodies so as to avoid the mistakes of the past.</p>
<p class="contents">What will be the specific task of those bodies? We totally agree with Mr Bourlanges that that still needs to be regulated. One thing is certain: they will need to carry out a specific administrative task for a certain limited time.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the salient points for the liberal group?</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Commission will always remain responsible for what happens. It would be unacceptable if certain tasks were to be delegated to another executive agency on a discretionary basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the percentage of the number of officials in such a body will need to be determined on a case-by-case basis. We are opposed to putting a percentage figure on it, for we cannot possibly put a figure on it at the moment. That will clearly depend on the tasks of the agency.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the discharge of agencies, the suggestion that this Parliament should look into the discharge of each agency seems unreasonable to us. If the Commission is responsible, and if it is the case that the Commission is granted discharge by Parliament, that naturally implies that we indirectly grant the agencies discharge. That is our strong view. As for the remainder of the proposals, we generally back the amendments which the rapporteur has tabled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, honourable Members, the European Parliament has played an important part in the whole discussion about Commission administrative reform. The Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control have also played a key role in the question of externalisation. The rapporteur, Mr Bourlanges, in particular provided the initial impulse for the proposal for a regulation that is now before us.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank you for your continued cooperation in working out the proposal and also the report. I have to say that Mr Bourlanges already impressed me when he presented his <span class="italic">magnum</span> <span class="italic">opus </span>on externalisation in November 1999. It is after all very difficult to produce good literature. Many people would say that creating a literary work on externalisation was an impossible task. But you really succeeded in presenting something of high literary value with this first report on externalisation. My warmest congratulations.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now recognised that the Commission as a whole must concentrate more on its fundamental tasks. That is the very reason why the subject of externalisation is being discussed, namely in response to the question of which tasks could be performed in a way other than within the Commission’s present administrative structures.</p>
<p class="contents">The plan envisages three methods and forms of externalisation, namely externalisation in the form of a delegation of tasks to executive agencies, the delegation of tasks to national agencies, i.e. decentralisation, and the assignment of tasks by contract to third parties.</p>
<p class="contents">The framework regulation for executive agencies defines a new form of Community institution that operates in the service of the Commission and has the task of managing and implementing Community programmes independently on the Commission’s behalf, including the associated execution of budget resources. The regulation therefore provides the framework for the creation of executive agencies that the Commission will set up as and when required.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection I should like to highlight the most important points once again. An executive agency is an instrument in the hands of and under the control of the Commission. This also again makes it clear that it is wrong to equate externalisation with privatisation, as often happens in the debate, especially with officials. You made it very clear, Mr Bourlanges, that such is not the case. It means that the Commission’s responsibility for the execution of the budget under Article 274 of the EC Treaty is retained without qualification. That is a point that has just been emphasised again by the Committee on Budgetary Control and also by you, Mrs Theato.</p>
<p class="contents">An executive agency is set up by the Commission. The agency’s management bodies are appointed by the Commission. The Commission exercises control through its own departments. The operational resources managed by the agency remain in the European Union’s general budget and are administered by the agency in its capacity as an authorising party by delegation of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The prerogatives of the budgetary authority are preserved. The budgetary authority approves the allocation to the agency’s administrative resources. The agency’s establishment plan is submitted to the budgetary authority as part of the budgetary procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">We are unable to go along with the suggestion that a fixed percentage of the agency’s staff should be Commission officials. Regarding the duration of the contracts, however, I can point out that setting up executive agencies only makes sense for tasks taking rather longer than one year. That therefore means that contracts for contract personnel will run correspondingly longer. I should also like to add that the European Parliament grants the discharge for the execution of the executive agency’s administrative and operational resources.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, the Commission is able to accept the following amendments: Nos 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12 in part, as well as Amendments Nos 16, paragraphs 1 and 2, in part and 17 and 21 in part.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control for their critical scrutiny of our proposal. Their contributions will make our proposal more balanced and bring us a step closer to our goal of increasing administrative efficiency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to have a very clear explanation from the Commissioner on the third part of Amendment No 25, in other words on the point about renewable contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">I have discussed the matter with your staff, and I wanted a precise undertaking from you. I have not had it. This is an issue of fundamental importance to us. If we do not have a clear undertaking on this point by tomorrow, I shall make arrangements to submit to this House a motion to postpone the vote. I have made it very clear to your staff that we want the people who work for this agency to be subject to contracts which can be renewed. Obviously the renewal does not have to be obligatory, but it is something that I have been insisting on ever since I became aware of the proposed regulation which had been submitted to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. I should also like to say, by the way, that the proposed regulation in question had not been notified, for reasons of which I am unaware, either to the Committee on Budgetary Control or to the Committee on Budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore made it very clear to those who were responsible that I would be expecting an undertaking from the Commission this evening. I have not received it. I would like to think that perhaps the message was not passed on. You have until tomorrow to think about it, but I shall expect an undertaking from you before the vote takes place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
