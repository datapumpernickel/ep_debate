In other words, to category Μ2 and Μ3 passenger vehicles and category Ν2 goods vehicles. The European Commission's proposal makes provision for speed limitation devices to restrict passenger vehicles to 100 kph and goods vehicles to 90 kph. And basically, I agree with the European Commission's proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">A study carried out in Holland and brought to our attention by the European Commission demonstrates that it stands to reap profits in the order of EUR 40 million a year and benefits to society in the order of EUR 89 million a year from the transport sector alone. If we extrapolate these figures, we stand to gain something in the order of EUR 3 billion. But I do not want to dwell on this study because others may dispute it. I should like to dwell for a moment on common sense. And common sense tells us that, if we restrict speeds, we stand to gain, first from road safety, because there will be fewer accidents; secondly, we stand to gain in the environmental protection sector and, thirdly, we shall ensure there is fair competition between companies because we shall have the same limit everywhere, throughout Europe; at the same time, companies will not be able to force their drivers to drive very fast, putting human lives at risk for the sake of their profit margins.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the amendments which I have proposed do not differ in any great respect from the text of the European Commission's proposal. I should like to comment on two amendments accepted in committee. The first concerns the exemption, which we propose should be 5 years from when the directive enters into force for category Μ2 and Ν2 vehicles weighing between 3.5 and 7.5 tonnes. What we are proposing here is that the directive should apply five years after it enters into force and, secondly, that the European Commission should submit a study eighteen months after the directive enters into force on so-called intelligent speed adaptation systems so that we can see if we can use these systems to differentiate speeds depending on the circumstances and, of course, if we can have even lower speeds in urban areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The European People's Party has tabled an amendment for category Ν2, which includes vans, calling for the speed limit to be raised from 90 to 110 kph, because they are a different type of vehicle; they are lighter vehicles and I think that we can be more flexible here. Some fellow members voted against this and explained their reasons. They have ideological, political reasons and they do not think that the European Commission, or rather the European Union, should intervene here. I should like to thank them, I understand their reasons and, even though I disagree with them, I respect their position. But I should like to ask them, given that there are some amendments which make the European Commission's proposal more flexible and bring it closer to their own position, to examine these amendments constructively and, if they can, to vote for them, because it is my prediction that, their position notwithstanding, this directive will, at some point, become European law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We take the view that we may well support the Commission's proposal in principle, but that we do want to bring about some changes on a few points. The traffic safety issue is, of course, decisive, and we need this regulation because traffic safety is not bound by national borders and heavy goods vehicles do, indeed, cross them. In principle, we also need speed limitation devices for smaller vehicles, as we have had good experience of speed limitation devices in heavy lorries. It is because these HGVs travel across borders everywhere that we need European regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Madam Vice-President, we have to introduce the regulations in a slightly refined form and with longer time limits, for we are dealing here with major economic burdens laid on small and medium-sized enterprises. We should therefore be more generous in the transitional provisions, in order that the burden on the economy may not be allowed to be too great.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by appealing to the Social Democrats and Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, who is herself a great expert on traffic safety. As our Amendment No 12 demands, Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, we need different speeds for small and large lorries. So we are again asking you to support our Amendment No 12, so that we can permit a speed of 110 kph for smaller commercial vehicles. If we impose the same speed limit on all HGVs, we are pre-programming traffic jams into the motorway system. If we are to ensure traffic flow, we must make it possible for smaller vehicles to overtake. With that in mind, Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, I ask you to support our amendment. We will then have a great piece of legislation! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The transport of both goods and people on the roads is ever increasing. Movement on the roads is international and cross-border, and so too, therefore, must be the rules we lay down.</p>
<p class="contents">A shining example is the legislation on speed limitation devices. When it came into force in 1994, it had met a certain amount of resistance both from the industry and from the drivers themselves, but this evaporated when the advantages became apparent.</p>
<p class="contents">In a Europe in which more than 40 000 people lose their lives in road accidents, all kinds of methods must be tried in order to make the roads safer. Once speed limitation devices had been introduced, it was no longer possible to build speeding into systems under which the heaviest vehicles operated. This new proposal will lead to speed limitation devices also being used in lighter commercial vehicles and buses, and this will have further positive repercussions. Recently, there has been a marked increase in the frequency of accidents involving lighter commercial vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">Those of us in the Group of the Party of European Socialists support the amendments in favour of a longer transition period. One issue which, however, recurred in the debate on this directive, and which Mr Jarzembowski addressed, is that of whether there should be different speeds for different categories of vehicle. It was argued that identical speeds create congestion and bottlenecks on the roads. I do not believe that is the case. The fewer speed differences there are, the smoother the traffic flows, in actual fact. There are mathematical calculations to show this. It is enough to imagine a road on which vehicles are maintaining the same speed. In that case, the traffic flows more smoothly. That is why I demand that Amendment No 12 be rejected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But more often than not accidents are attibutable to the manner in which the vehicle is being driven, or the carelessness of drivers failing to be vigilant, especially in bad weather for example. Accidents are also caused by drivers crawling along at a snail's pace on motorways and in some cases they could be avoided by having a minimum as well as a maximum speed limit. There has to be recognition that there is a world of difference between motorway and urban driving.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst clearly agreeing with the Commission and my colleagues, including Mr Hatzidakis, that we must do all we can to improve road safety across the European Union, I cannot agree that the way forward would be the introduction of this directive, which advocated a one-speed-fits-all approach.</p>
<p class="contents">It is recognised that the United Kingdom has the best safety record in the EU. It is equally true to say that it was one of the first countries to fit speed limiters on coaches, for obvious reasons. In addition, this directive is also meant to improve the environment and congestion and again I would refute that claim. To extend this directive to those categories of vehicles included in the proposal, and to impose the upper speed limits as outlined, would be a mistake. It is bad enough struggling along motorways when two heavy goods lorries are running parallel because one decides to overtake on a hill and clearly cannot accelerate. If this directive comes into play I believe that congestion and environmental pollution will increase.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the right way forward would be to seriously consider advances in technology, for example the proposed voluntary agreement on pedestrian protection. In addition, there is also the possibility of ISA and I would support a study by the Commission along those lines. Nevertheless, ultimately, it should be left to the discretion of the Member State to decide what would or would not be appropriate. With the exception of a couple of amendments, my delegation will be unable to support this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Traffic safety is rightly one of the core themes of the White Paper. The number of people who are killed each year in the European Union is still far too high. These fatal accidents are often caused by speeding.</p>
<p class="contents">With a view to reducing the road accident toll, speed limitation devices for lorries are an effective instrument for improving road safety. Indeed, lower speeds lead to fewer road accidents and fewer victims.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, benefits can be expected in the fields of maintenance and of a cleaner environment. In order to ensure that speed limitation devices cannot be interfered with and in order to guarantee that they are maintained in proper working order, reliable inspection is needed. Annual compulsory inspection seems best suited for this purpose, in my opinion. But in that case, an adjustment to the European General Periodical Car Inspection Directive is necessary in order to bring about a level playing field.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to draw your attention to the issue of intelligent speed adapters, a very important point in my view. I would therefore like to ask the Commission, at the earliest possibility, to conduct a study into the possibilities which this system could offer. It could contribute to greater safety on the roads, less irritation and a greater sense of security on the part of drivers.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, I should like to ask the Commission to give an extra boost to technology which should make intelligent road and traffic control systems possible. This is with a view to the expected growth in demand for transport, as a result of which the benefits of this directive in terms of road safety will be lost. The level of safety will go down once again, the build-up on roads will increase again and the beneficial impact which we are pursuing by means of this directive will be cancelled out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Hatzidakis, for his fantastic work on this directive, a report which fully supports the Commission’s proposal and which incorporates numerous amendments which improve the text of the proposal without changing its objective.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of the proposal is to extend the scope of the obligatory installation and use of speed limiters to vehicles in lighter categories than those currently affected by these limitations. This measure represents the realisation of the priorities formulated in March 2000, within the framework of the Commission communication on road safety, which also received the explicit support of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal will contribute to an increase in road safety, the protection of the environment and the maintenance of conditions of equal and fair competition between all operators within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make some comments on the report we are dealing with here. There are several amendments which we can support: Amendments Nos 4, 6 and 7 can be accepted in their entirety; Nos 5 and 10 are acceptable in principle, although the dates need to be altered, and the same is the case with Amendment No 6, which I referred to previously.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would prefer the following timetable: two years for new vehicles, three years for international transport and four for national transport. I believe that this answers some of Mr Jarzembowski’s questions on the effects on small and medium-sized businesses, which are the most frequent users of this type of vehicle. There is an adaptation period and, if we bear in mind the rotation of this type of vehicle, the time of the entry into force of the directive, etc., we see that it is not so out of place.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Amendment No 9, the Commission could accept a study in the context of road safety towards 2010, as long as it does not involve a separate report. In any event, the time limit of 18 months is excessively short to carry out such a study. We need two years as a minimum. In this regard, I would like to stress the great importance the Commission attaches to intelligent speed restriction systems and great attention will be paid to the study of this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The concepts behind Amendments Nos 8 and 11 are unacceptable to the Commission. The acceptance of greater maximum speeds for a limited period of time not only raises technical problems for which there is no solution, at least at the moment, but would also hinder the implementation of the measure. The Commission believes that, for the moment, there is no advantage in applying this directive to M1 and N1 vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 12, which Mr Jarzembowski advocated, amongst others, because the triple objective of the directive – road safety, environmental protection and competition under equal conditions – cannot be achieved unless all vehicles are bound by the same speed limit.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we will carefully study Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3, which refer to the textual differences between linguistic versions, in relation to the definition of vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">I would once again like to congratulate the rapporteur and all the Members who have spoken in this debate. I hope that, through the application of this directive, road safety will improve, which is the intention, since the figure of 42 000 deaths per year is completely unacceptable to all of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
