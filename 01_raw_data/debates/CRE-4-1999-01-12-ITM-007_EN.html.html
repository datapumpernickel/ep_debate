<p class="contents">Having been devastated by a fratricidal war just over 40 years ago, Korea is now experiencing impressive growth and is one of the main economic powers in the world, having earned the right to be the first Asian country to join the OECD.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the European Union is concerned, Korea is an important partner which accounts for nearly 2 % of our total trade, thus forming our fourth main partner outside the European continent, after the United States, Japan and China, while we are Korea"s third main trading partner after the United States and Japan, but before China. This trade has doubled in 15 years, reaching ECU 27.5 billion in 1997. The EU was in a position of surplus until 1997. The deficit which has occurred since then was caused by the Asian crisis: Korea"s imports fell from ECU 11.7 bn in November 1997 to ECU 7.7 bn in April 1998. This situation is in contrast to that of Japan and China which have deficits that are not likely to disappear in the near future. With regard to direct foreign investment, the European Union is the leader, having overtaken the United States and Japan in 1998, and with the accumulated investments of South Korea in the EU being greater than our investment there: ECU 2.3 bn and ECU 1.5 bn respectively.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the importance of Korea and our economic relations with the country, this House, through the competent committees, started to indicate reservations at the time of the vote on the agreement signed on 29 October 1996. These reservations were in the areas of protectionism – specifically relating to national preferences under the guise of the ‘frugality plan" or to problems in channels of commerce – intellectual property, respect for human rights and, above all, the failure to comply with minimum labour rules. Following the suggestion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, the rapporteur and the committee responsible for the basic issue, the Committee on External Economic Relations, accepted the postponement of the agreement"s assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">The changes observed in the last two years have been very marked. They have involved internal and external liberalisation and the restructuring of the economy, with all sectors being forced to accept a rationale which will prevent, for example, overinvestment in shipbuilding. This is now leading to assumptions on our part of having to compete with Korea in a process that started before the Asian crisis became more pressing. In addition to this, we must welcome the openness in the political and labour fields that have been evident to a large extent since the election of the current Korean President, Kim Dae Jung.</p>
<p class="contents">The support which may be provided by this agreement has become particularly relevant in view of the crisis South Korea is experiencing, the results of which include significant falls in production and large increases in unemployment, from 2.6 % in November 1997 to 6.7 % in April 1998. However, these consequences are also contributing, in a transitional phase, to the liberalisation and restructuring measures which, with our backing, are being implemented. Even in the area of trade unions, the main target of our concerns, we must undoubtedly welcome the agreement of the Tripartite Commission, which was reached on 6 February 1998, and the specific liberalisation measures that were implemented, such as the recognition of the KCTU (the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions), the authorisation of multiple trade unions at company level or even the right of sacked workers to belong to a trade union. It is particularly symbolic that, just a few days ago, on 6 January, trade union freedom for teachers was approved. But we should realise that some of the measures, while undoubtedly desirable, are likely to cause transitional problems for company managers and politicians.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore have a special responsibility to support an agreement which, in a very delicate external and internal context, may help to strengthen and revive the South Korean economy and alleviate the problems of its inhabitants.</p>
<p class="contents">I must stress that there are clearly points open to criticism in all these areas, for example, the failure of Korea to sign up to international agreements on respect for intellectual property, as underlined in the opinion by Mr Pompidou. However, the conclusion of an agreement promoting improved trade and economic cooperation will give us greater moral and political legitimacy in terms of the demands to be made of a country which, at a time of crisis, could not fail to have major problems with regard to social and political transparency and the restructuring of its economy.</p>
<p class="contents">We will all benefit from the commitment of a strong Korea to the support announced at the Millennium Round of the World Trade Organisation.</p>

<p class="contents">Article 7 of the agreement on maritime transport establishes the goal of securing unrestricted access to the maritime market and to international maritime traffic on a commercial basis and in accordance with the principles of fair competition. Article 8 establishes cooperation in the shipbuilding sector in order to create a fair, competitive market, in view of the current structural imbalance between supply and demand within the international shipbuilding industry. The parties also undertake to observe the principles of the OECD Agreement on Shipbuilding.</p>
<p class="contents">While we welcome the conclusion of this agreement, we should not overlook the problems created by Korea's trade practices and the obstacles it has hitherto put in the way of EU products in the shipbuilding and automobile sectors, which are deemed sensitive under the agreement. Although Europe's shipbuilding industry is currently experiencing a revival, it is affected by considerable overcapacity, due in particular to the Koreans' irresponsible doubling of their plant capacity over the past four or five years, to such an extent that Korea alone can now produce more vessels than all Europe's shipyards put together. The fact that supply greatly exceeds demand is beyond question, given that prices for new vessels of all types have fallen or at least stagnated.</p>
<p class="contents">This alarming structural imbalance has been compounded by the devaluation of the Korean won, leading to a situation which could have particularly grave consequences for Community shipyards and for employment in Europe. Indeed, estimates show that the Koreans could reduce the cost of their vessels by as much as 30 % without altering their margins. Therefore the Korean authorities must not use international financial assistance in support of their shipbuilding industry, and the European Union must take care to ensure that the commitments made by the Korean authorities in this regard are in fact met.</p>

<p class="contents">I found that South Korea had not complied with the undertaking it had given on becoming a member of the OECD in 1996 to bring its labour laws into line with internationally binding labour standards. I also found that there were certain human rights problems. The operation of the national security law was certainly a problem and there was a serious problem concerning long‐term political prisoners. There has been some progress to the extent that, as previous speakers have said, even as late as last week there were moves to legalise the teachers' trade union. There have been other very welcome moves because there were restrictions on trade union pluralism, a total ban on freedom of association and collective bargaining for government employees and teachers and the illegality of one of the two major Korean union confederations – the KCTU. Furthermore, the leadership of the KCTU's union was made illegal through removing the status of union membership from dismissed workers. There have been all sorts of problems. They are being worked through but I would like to see the conclusions in my opinion which, I am glad to say, have been carried forward by Mr Porto in his very excellent report, being looked at very carefully and taken up by the Korean Government.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to draw your attention to some of these conclusions. One is that the Korean Government should immediately implement the OECD undertaking to amend its labour legislation to incorporate internationally binding standards.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish you to note a clause in relation to the abolition of the death penalty. I should like Commissioner Leon Brittan, when he sums up, to tell us whether he will undertake, on our behalf and on behalf of the Commission, to follow up the three points made to the Commission in the conclusions in my opinion and also in Mr Porto's report.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Valdivielso de Cué </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, it is worth emphasising the extent to which the framework agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Korea serves to promote freedom. It protects the legal right to political pluralism and recognises the right to form trade unions, together with the right to engage in union activity. Previously, such activity carried a prison sentence in the Republic of Korea. Other aspects of the agreement such as those relating to intellectual property, patents and trademarks also deserve a mention.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to refer too to the recent meeting between European Union and Korean ministers, chaired by Sir Leon Brittan, who is with us here today. At that meeting, a cautious welcome was given to the initial measures on economic reform adopted by the Korean Government. These measures alone will not be sufficient, but could set the country on the right course for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also worth noting the commitment made by the Korean authorities on the subject of unfair competition with the European Union in sensitive sectors such as shipbuilding and the automobile industry. This commitment was made after high‐level consultations between the European Union and Korea, and we must carefully monitor the situation to ensure that it is adhered to.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, the present social situation in Korea regrettably leaves much to be desired. Not only is this quite unacceptable as we approach the twenty‐first century, but it also results in global dumping affecting countries like ours which do observe the regulations on labour and social standards. This must be made quite clear in the Committee on External Economic Relations.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we recognise the progress mentioned earlier, and encourage the Korean Government to redouble its efforts to attain the social standards the citizens of today require. Finally, it is our most earnest hope that human rights will be recognised in Korea.</p>

While I believe we should give every encouragement to progress in these areas, I would, nevertheless, submit that we have to be vigilant and have an effective and reliable monitoring system. Perhaps the Commissioner could tell us how the Commission would assess improvements in these areas. For example, will it draw on reports from organisations such as Amnesty International and, in particular, I would suggest, the ILO?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should be aware that parliamentary support for this framework agreement is contingent on continuing progress on the issue of labour and human rights and that the support of this House could not be sustained if that position was to worsen. We will not stand silent if our brothers and sisters in Korea continue to be mistreated. I hope the Commission will pass that message on to the Korean authorities very firmly.</p>

Surely it is quite absurd that shipyards that are totally bankrupt by any normal business standards are continuing to operate and still winning shipbuilding contracts at the lowest dumping prices on the world market. And this is happening not just in the normal container sector; South Korean shipyards are also moving into the area of ferries, of passenger ships, the last sector where we Europeans still have a hope of saving jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, how can you assure us that Korea will undertake to observe the provisions of Article 8, namely, in accordance with the OECD agreement which has not yet entered into force, not to take any action to support its shipbuilding industry which would distort competition? How can we ensure that our taxpayers" money that our Member States send to Korea as aid via the European Funds, via the International Monetary Fund, does not in the end rebound on our own jobs in the European shipyards? Nobody would be able to understand that. I hope you can tell us how you intend to ensure that there are no unfair shipbuilding subsidies that harm our own industry.</p>

I would also like to thank Mr Valdivielso de Cué for his kind remarks about my own efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Union is to raise its profile on the world stage it is vital to strengthen ties not only with world‐rank powers but also with key emerging countries. That is why the Commission adopted a communication on 9 December reviewing the Union's relations with the Republic of Korea and making comprehensive recommendations for the future. The Republic of Korea is already a key partner for us, and is becoming more important politically both in its own right and also because of the difficult security situation on the peninsula which has potentially global implications.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons it is essential for us to upgrade bilaterally our relationship with the Republic of Korea. The Framework Agreement does this by comprehensively covering economic issues and political dialogue. It contains detailed provisions which directly address issues of key importance to the European Union; economic issues such as intellectual property rights, ship‐building, maritime transport and so on, but also issues in other fields such as human rights including labour rights, cooperation against drugs and money laundering.</p>
<p class="contents">The Framework Agreement sets up the institutional machinery through which the European Union can pursue its interests vis‐à‐vis Korea, and the Commission is fully committed to using the agreement to advance European interests. I would point out that the Framework Agreement is not an act of charity which opens our markets to Korea. It contains no trade concessions. It is a wide‐ranging non‐preferential agreement which creates new bilateral channels for dialogue and cooperation and, I would point out, for the resolution of disputes with this important trading partner. So it means that, where we have a problem or where we think they have come some distance but not far enough, we have the new opportunity of handling it in a structured way.</p>
<p class="contents">The vote today is timely not only because it is just before the European Parliament sends a delegation to Korea, but also because it is one year after the beginning of a financial crisis and the change of government in Korea. Under President Kim Dae Jung, Korea has started an economic reform beginning to address some of our long‐standing concerns. More needs to be done and the Commission will remain extremely vigilant but Korea deserves our support and encouragement for the course it has chosen. Labour rights is clearly an area where improvement is needed as has rightly been pointed out by Mr Porto.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Smith has asked us how we will monitor the agreement and ensure that there are further improvements in labour rights.The answer is that we will consider all the material he has mentioned and all the material that is at our disposal, and we have a delegation on the spot in Seoul which will be active in assembling information for us. But I think it is right to point out that a number of positive steps have already been taken under President Kim, who has involved the unions in a national tripartite dialogue on restructuring. Last week, as was pointed out by Mrs Malone, a landmark law was passed by the National Assembly establishing trade union rights for teachers. The fact that things are moving in the right direction is all the more remarkable and all the more a positive achievement when you consider that it has taken place at a time of severe economic contraction with growth of minus 6.8 % and unemployment tripling in just over one year. The substance of the agreement and the need to upgrade Europe's political and economic position in Asia are themselves sufficient reasons to commend the agreement for Parliament's support.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would add that by supporting it we have the opportunity to give a political signal of support to President Kim and his allies who are deeply committed to economic reform, who are faced with strong entrenched interests opposed to such reform, and who are committed also to the removal of corruption and increased democracy in Korea. Mr Valdivielso de Cué is right to point out that difficulties still exist, especially in the area of shipbuilding, and Mr Jarzembowski has referred to that. It is impossible to give guarantees as far as the future is concerned. I believe that the implementation of the OECD Agreement would give us the best protection. That is being held up at the moment because the United States is not prepared to ratify the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a strong case for going ahead without the United States because the USA represents a very small proportion of the world's shipbuilding. Unfortunately, European industry does not take that view. I think European industry is wrong, because it has the hope that if this agreement is not ratified it will get more state aid from national governments. The sooner it is disabused of that and reconciles itself to the fact that there will not be more state aid, the sooner it will support going ahead on a quadripartite basis, even without the United States, to give us the protection against Korea that this OECD Agreement would give.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, I hope Parliament will support the Framework Agreement on trade and cooperation with Korea.</p>
