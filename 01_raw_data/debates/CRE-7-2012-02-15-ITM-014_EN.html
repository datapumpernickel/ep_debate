<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Villy Søvndal, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council, on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. </span>– Mr President, honourable Members, it is a pleasure to speak to you about the outcome of the UN Human Rights Council on behalf of the High Representative.</p>
<p class="contents">The UN has a unique legitimacy to promote respect for human rights as universal norms. Throughout the past year, the Human Rights Council has demonstrated its willingness to respond in a united way to the call of millions of citizens for their right to freedom from fear and from want.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU was instrumental in making the Human Rights Council adopt resolutions on North Africa and the Middle East, in particular, Libya, Syria and Iran, but also in the case of Belarus. These are actions that matter. They put the governments of those countries under close international scrutiny and send a clear message. There must be no impunity for gross human rights violations.</p>
<p class="contents">This response is proof that multilateral institutions matter. It is our duty to consolidate the momentum built up in 2011 in Geneva and New York and help the UN to live up to its mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">The High Representative, Ms Ashton, is strongly committed to these efforts. This is why, early in her mandate, she participated last year in the main session of the Human Rights Council together with US Secretary of State, Hilary Clinton, and delivered a very strong speech on human rights. Unfortunately, this year, the date of the main session clashes with the Foreign Affairs Council, which she will be chairing and which will be discussing Syria and key issues of concern on human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The second day overlaps with the General Affairs Council, in which she has to participate in order to ensure that the views expressed in the FAC discussion on Serbia and Kosovo are fully and accurately reflected in the GAC discussion of Serbia.</p>
<p class="contents">The High Representative remains strongly committed to the defence and promotion of human rights worldwide. The High Representative, Ms Ashton, welcomes the continued interest of the European Parliament on the EU human rights policy in the UN and the intention of Parliament to send a delegation to Geneva to attend the 19th session. I will address the Human Rights Council during its ministerial part, representing the High Representative, Ms Ashton. I will stress the EU’s determination to continue playing an important role in the work of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU will intervene consistently in the different agenda items of this Human Rights Council session. I would like to highlight some of the EU’s priorities for the session.</p>
<p class="contents">We have just had a substantial exchange on Syria, and you will agree that its dire human rights situation deserves to stay high on the agenda of the Human Rights Council. We believe that the Human Rights Council should maintain a strong, effective capacity to monitor the situation. We will work to secure concrete follow-up to the resolutions on Syria adopted by the Council in 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">Iran remains a source of serious human rights concerns such as the increasing application of the death penalty and repression against media operators. The EU will fully support the renewal of the mandate of the special rapporteur on human rights in Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU also expects the Human Rights Council to continue to closely follow the human rights situation in other countries of the region, such as Yemen and Bahrain.</p>
<p class="contents">We acknowledge the recent positive development in Burma/Myanmar. Serious challenges still remain and must be addressed in order to improve the human rights situation in the country and deepen its transition to democracy. For this reason, the EU will introduce a resolution to extend the mandate of the UN special rapporteur on the situation in Myanmar. Likewise, the EU will work closely with Japan in order to secure an extension of the mandate of the special rapporteur of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to address the continuing critical human rights situation in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of accountability in Sri Lanka should remain on the agenda of the Council. The authorities need to fully implement the recommendations of the report of the UN Secretary-General’s panel of experts and the lessons learnt, and of the reconciliation commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Ashton is deeply concerned by the increasing number of acts of religious intolerance and discrimination across the world. She recently condemned violence against religious minorities in Nigeria, Egypt and anywhere in the world. The EU will engage at the Human Rights Council for freedom of religion or belief, seeking to renew a strong collective response based on human rights standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, last year, the Council adopted a landmark resolution on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, introduced by South Africa. The EU will work at this session to ensure the success of the follow-up panel on discriminatory laws and practices and acts of violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity.</p>
<p class="contents">The annual session of the Human Rights Council, which brings together key actors on human rights from states to NGOs, can be considered the world’s House of Human Rights. The EU stands ready to engage and cooperate with countries from all regions to ensure the success of this session. We want this Council to have a direct impact on the empowerment of people and to hold accountable those who are responsible for grave human rights violations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This year, two important processes are under way.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the 13th and 14th sessions of the universal periodic review will be organised in the course of 2012. Secondly, there is the ongoing review of the EU’s human rights policy, which should contribute to making the European Union a more active, coherent and effective force in the world. Having said this, I should stress that the EU and our Member States should guarantee respect for human rights in our own policies in order to increase the coherence between internal and external policies and thus enhance the credibility of the European Union in the UN Human Rights Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow, we will vote on the resolution on the 19th session of the UNHRC. In our resolution, we welcome the designation of Burma, Syria, Libya and Iran as key issues of the session. We also welcome the many horizontal issues which will be addressed during the session of the Council. Not for the first time, we regret the fact that the review process has not led to the development of further-reaching membership criteria as regards commitments and performance on human rights issues. We reiterate our call for competitive elections for all regional groups, and we recommend that the European Union and its Member States state their clear opposition to the practice of regional groups putting forward ‘clean slates’ and lead by example on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">On Arab Spring countries, we take note of the restoration of Libya’s membership of the UNHRC and encourage the country’s reintegration. At the same time, we regret that the opportunity was not seized to draw up strong and transparent criteria for reinstating suspended members. We welcome the statement by UN Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, urging the Egyptian authorities to end the excessive and brutal use of force against protestors in Cairo and elsewhere in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">In our resolution, we address serious human rights violations in Syria, a situation which has been discussed in depth today in this room. A universal periodic review, special procedures and the EU’s involvement are among the topics addressed in our resolution. So tomorrow, by adopting this document on the 19th session, the European Parliament will mandate our delegation to voice these and many other concerns which are part of the agenda of the session. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Kofi Annan, speaking after the launch of the UN’s ’responsibility to protect’, said: ’“Responsibility to protect” will remain pure rhetoric unless and until those with the power to intervene effectively – by exerting political, economic and, in the last resort, military muscle – are prepared to take the lead’. At least 400 deaths this year; sexual violence against those held in custody; children as young as ten in solitary confinement; High Commissioner Pillay herself saying that these crimes against humanity are likely in Syria – it is right that Europe goes to Geneva and gets the UN to act where the UN Security Council has failed to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">But we should have praise too. On lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights as the President-in-Office rightly said. On Libya, too: the expulsion of Libya was an essential part of the transition in that country which should not be forgotten and which sets a historic precedent for the Human Rights Council itself. It also allowed the country to appoint a new administration explicit in its support for human rights. Amnesty International says its people are enjoying freedom of expression for the first time in 42 years.</p>
<p class="contents">As this Parliament’s rapporteur, we should also give full backing to the framework on business and human rights adopted by the Council and signal Europe’s determination to promote and to implement it, including, I am proud to say, this week, the announcement by the Enterprise Commissioner, of proposed human rights guidelines for the ICT and employment sectors here in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The need to challenge ourselves in Europe on other issues remains, though. Let us recall the recommendation of the Goldstone Commission following the Gaza conflict and the Panel of Experts’ recommendations following the end of the conflict in Sri Lanka. Time may or may not heal when we suffer an individual bereavement, but when hundreds and thousands die in what are said to be crimes of war, there will never be a healing without justice and the European Union must show that all war crimes will be held to account.</p>
<p class="contents">In Sri Lanka, having visited the last combat zone this year whilst maintaining my Group’s consistent support for an independent commission of inquiry, I acknowledged the government can change the debate if it genuinely conducts investigations against perpetrators and secures convictions, as at least inferred in its own report.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on behalf of the Socialist Group too, we should send a clear warning against countries refusing to ratify human rights instruments by being consistent in our own support, including, nine years after it was signed in, the International Convention on Migrant Workers, seeking to protect over 200 million of the most vulnerable people worldwide. It is to our deep shame that no EU country has either signed or ratified this Treaty.</p>

<p class="contents">With regard to the key issues of Burma, North Korea, Syria, Libya and Iran, we would like to point out the role of the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China in reaching a constructive resolution of several crises.</p>
<p class="contents">We deplore the reluctance of the two non-democratic regimes to cooperate in the UN Security Council, in particular, by vetoing the adoption of the resolution on Syria. The hypocrisy of Mr Lavrov when calling for the stabilisation of the country is incredible. It is no secret that the Kremlin only wishes to maintain access to Tartus naval base, which has been staffed with Soviet or Russian military personnel since 1971 when the Soviet Union and Syria signed an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Cold War is over and we must set aside the neo-colonialist discourse of spheres of influence. That also applies to Beijing, which is increasingly suppressing the freedom of thought, conscience and religion in Tibet. This has led to an increasing number of self-immolations of both temporal and spiritual people in Tibet. The EU and its Member States must consistently pursue a meaningful dialogue with China on human rights and raise those issues on every possible occasion.</p>

It is the only UN forum in which breaches of human rights in the relevant countries can be directly addressed. The results of the EU’s investigation into the council’s working methods were highly constructive and the EU supports the independence of the Office of the High Commissioner and the Special Rapporteurs.</p>
<p class="contents">It is highly regrettable that Baroness Ashton cannot take part in this session of the Human Rights Council. This could be interpreted as playing down the importance of human rights policy in foreign relations. However, one very positive feature is the generous funding given by the European Union to support the work of the UN human rights bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should consider increasing the amount of money in future, because the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has many new responsibilities as a result of the events of the Arab Spring.</p>
<p class="contents">In our resolution, we have devoted a separate chapter to breaches of human rights in the Arab Spring countries. It lists a number of specific requirements which the EU should support. I would like to highlight just two of them. One is the situation in Yemen, where it is important that the serious breaches of human rights, which, in some cases, amount to war crimes, are stopped. There must be no immunity from prosecution for people in positions of political responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The second country is Algeria. It is currently undergoing the process of Universal Periodic Review in the Human Rights Council for the second time. The fate of the thousands of people who have disappeared and of their families urgently needs to be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Human Rights Council can deal directly with breaches of human rights in individual countries and you, Mr Søvndal, have mentioned that you have made use of last year’s momentum to adopt even more specific resolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">You have my full support. The requirements in the report by the Special Rapporteur on Iran must be implemented. We need to see concrete results in North Korea. Although there have been some changes for the better in Myanmar/Burma, international attention must remain focused on the human rights situation in this country.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to implement the results of the fact-finding mission to Gaza and those responsible for the breach of international law must be held to account. In addition, the findings of the investigation commission on Côte d’Ivoire must be put into effect and I am pleased that you have already mentioned this in your speech. We must ensure that the report by the UN Secretary General’s panel of experts on Sri Lanka is taken seriously and implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the European Parliament resolution we are talking about at the moment, the Syrian situation is, in fact, one of the more important issues. I think the condemnation of China and Russia in the resolution for the position they have adopted on Syria is one of many good things which are worth supporting and which my political group also supports. It is also to be welcomed that this is the unequivocal position of the European Parliament on what is, indeed, a shocking matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing I would like to say is that you devoted a large part of your speech, Mr Søvndal, to explaining why Ms Ashton will not be present this time at the UN Human Rights Council. I deeply believe that those who accuse the European Union of not being interested in human rights issues will not use this absence as evidence which confirms this charge.

<p class="contents">We have tabled amendments to illustrate these shortcomings: however, I would like to focus on one of them.

<p class="contents">I was right there on Monday. There were more than 140 arrests, mainly of trade unionists and artists. Yesterday, there were more than 180. This cannot go on. The European Union must remain silent no longer. Mr Erdoğan’s double standards must stop.</p>

What I regret, however, is the fact that this Parliament is shying away from facing up to a fundamental and structural problem in the UN Human Rights Council. That structural and fundamental problem consists of the fact that some of the biggest human rights abusers in the world – for example, China, Cuba and Saudi Arabia, to name but a few – are all allowed to remain members of the Human Rights Council unchallenged. That is actually unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Only countries with a spotless reputation are in a position to, and have any right to, lecture other countries. Granting that right to the aforementioned dictatorships pretty much equates to turning it into a piece of absurd theatre. That is a structural defect that must be addressed, otherwise the compliance procedures will never function as they should. I therefore hope that Parliament will tomorrow adopt the amendments which I have submitted to this effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have been strongly critical of the decision by China and the Russian Federation to veto a Security Council resolution on Syria. We have ensured that the issues which are important to us appear on the agenda. Burma/Myanmar, North Korea, the Arab Spring, the situation in Syria and Libya and the Islamic Republic of Iran will all be discussed during the session. We welcome the fact that Libya’s suspension from the Human Rights Council has been lifted. Regardless of that, we will still be focusing on Libya, because we cannot be completely sure how the situation there will develop in future. Therefore, we need to send out a clear signal to all the countries involved in the Arab Spring that further aid from the Member States is dependent on them meeting certain criteria, which include the rule of law, fundamental rights and civil liberties, good governance, combating corruption and respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ensure that issues such as fundamental rights, freedom of speech and freedom of religion play a more prominent role in the public debate. That applies in all the countries which we are dealing with. I welcome the fact that the funding for promoting democracy and human rights throughout the world is being increased and that much of this money will benefit the Human Rights Council. It is equally pleasing that the subject of human rights has increased in importance within the UN system. This is clear from a glance at the Security Council agenda. However, in order not to undermine our own credibility, we must put our own house in order. We should not allow the majority of Member States to delay the implementation of international treaties. It is unacceptable that only one Member State has ratified the convention on the rights of migrant workers. We cannot stop making aid available or prevent accounts from being unfrozen unless we ourselves act according to the highest standards.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of credibility in general, we need to put an end to the well-known practice of forming blocs in the Human Rights Council. We should focus on what we have in common, rather than our differences, and enter into practical alliances. This is the only way in which we can ensure the necessary transparency, increase the budget of the Human Rights Council even further and reinforce its credibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We non-attached Members are used to being overlooked. Regardless of that, Mr President, because the EU Member States finance a large proportion of UN missions, we need to discuss whether it would be sensible to send a UN peacekeeping force into Syria. This will only make sense if there is a ceasefire and that really does not seem very likely. On the contrary, the conflict is threatening to spread. Our most important tasks are to provide humanitarian aid and to prepare for a further influx of refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">Against the background of the current report from the UN Human Rights Council on Internet censorship, the EU needs to tackle the subject of freedom of expression on the Internet. The controversial Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement clearly overshoots the mark. Data protection and fundamental rights are obviously being sacrificed in order to guarantee that the US entertainment industry continues to earn billions of dollars.

Politicians have to understand that investing in human rights is equally important as investing in the economy. There is, here, an analogy with investing in training and education for the young generation. Everyone acknowledges this to be the most effective investment, but when it comes to drawing up and approving the budget, they suffer an attack of amnesia.</p>
<p class="contents">It is high time human rights were brought out of the political ghetto. There is no justification for the violations of human rights that take place not just in countries which are considered undemocratic, but also unfortunately in Member States of the European Union and in the United States. Recovery from the crisis at the expense of the poorest is a violation of human rights. Governments must guarantee development which is equitable, tackle abuses which lead to and exacerbate poverty, and reduce armed conflicts, because they promote violence.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the forthcoming 19th session of the UN Human Rights Council, I would like to draw particular attention to violence against women. A situation in which every day in Europe, one woman in five suffers violence is something which must not be tolerated. It is estimated that the annual economic, social and health cost of the effects of violence against women in the 47 Member States of the Council of Europe amounts to EUR 34 billion. Over the last two years, the Council of Europe, the Commission and Parliament have taken important steps in tackling violence against women. Unfortunately, the measures taken do not reflect the commitments made.</p>
<p class="contents">I appeal to the European Union and to all Member States of the Council of Europe to sign and ratify the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence. To date, the convention has been signed by only 18 Member States, and none of them have ratified it.</p>

No, I do not think it is inappropriate, because we all talk about what goes on in undemocratic countries, all of us talk about it constantly and we condemn it, while we pass over at least certain things which go on in particular in the United States and in European Union Member States, countries which consider themselves leaders in the field of upholding human rights. In fact, when we look at different statistical data, for example, on violence against women, we find that in Europe, seven women die every day because of violence, and very many other things also become apparent – the Guantánamo prison, for example. So these things, too, need to be talked about, and we must not pretend that bad things happen only in undemocratic countries, in places where there are regimes, because they are also going on around us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Amongst those responsible for the worst violations of human rights, we can point the finger at Syria, its President and the harem of supporters which accompany him in the dying days of the regime, and we can only hope that its end is as close as possible. Amongst those responsible for crimes against humanity figure, first and foremost, the Iranian authorities, but they are not alone in this.</p>
<p class="contents">What is particularly worrying is the attitude of the two members of the United Nations Security Council who continue to oppose more effective measures against the Syrian regime. One of them, Russia, which is nonetheless a member of the Council of Europe, is sending a clear message in its refusal to side with those who are trying to put an end to the bloodshed now associated with the name of the town of Homs.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, this scandal undermines the goodwill shown throughout the world by all humanists, whether they are acting as part of civil society or in one or other of the many institutions dedicated to the defence of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Nothing, no political, commercial or geostrategic reason, can be used to justify the disgraceful attitude of those States that are blocking every means the international community has at its disposal to react to the outrageous situation in Homs.</p>
<p class="contents">The 19th session of the UN Human Rights Council will, I hope, provide the opportunity to remind all concerned of their most basic responsibilities when it comes to respecting the dignity of the human being. The European Union, as it is founded on the principle of the inviolability of human dignity, is undoubtedly in the best position to launch this appeal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a council that is taking place after a year in which much has changed in countries such as Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, Syria and Bahrain, where the people have risen up against the regimes that oppressed them.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of these peoples have succeeded in their revolutions and others have not. What I believe most Europeans regret is that the EU was not prepared to help these peoples to make their transition when this occurred. This could not have been sped up by us, but we could have provided a framework for it. Fortunately, however, there are the cases that we have cited in our resolution, such as Burma, which seems to be on the path to greater openness and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, many things change, but what does not change is EU strategy, which needs to be made effective, consistent, coherent and flexible. Coherence and flexibility do not contradict one another. What we cannot continue doing is offering the same types of trade agreement to Arab countries after the Arab Spring as we did before the Arab Spring. Tomorrow, we will vote on an agricultural agreement with Morocco, which is a country that still does not recognise the self-determination of Western Sahara.</p>
<p class="contents">What we cannot continue doing is allowing European companies to do business with dictatorial regimes without being punished here. My apologies, and now I will answer my question: our High Representative will not spend a single day at the United Nations Human Rights Council.

I would like to concentrate on human rights issues in Northern Cyprus and their place in negotiations for Turkey’s accession to the European Union. In Northern Cyprus itself, there have been reports of violations of the human rights and freedom from discrimination of minorities, torture, and violations of freedom of movement, religion and speech.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1974, during the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, the city of Famagusta was overrun by armour, and the civilian population – fearing massacre – was forced to evacuate, leaving behind everything they could not carry. Only Turks were allowed to remain, and the Varosha section of the city remains isolated and unpopulated to this day. This is in contradiction with UN Security Council Resolutions 550 and 789.</p>
<p class="contents">Technically, this border dispute does call into question the legitimacy of the Cypriot accession to the European Union. A 112-mile long ‘green line’ still divides the island. 1 588 Greek Cypriots are still on the missing persons list following the Turkish invasion, but still the EU – with the exception of one or two Member States –pushes for Turkey’s accession. By discussing Turkey’s accession whilst unresolved border issues and questions of human rights in Northern Cyprus remain, the EU is undermining the integrity of the United Nations. You are overlooking appalling human rights abuses, and you are making a mockery of the integrity of your own position on human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Turkey’s statement that they would freeze EU ties when Cyprus takes over the EU Presidency, I would ask the High Representative: why is the EU negotiating membership with a country that is acting in such a bullying manner? Although, on second thoughts, the High Representative might agree that such a country would fit perfectly into the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, I am delighted to make my maiden speech here in the European Parliament on the subject of human rights. The protection and the promotion of human rights are fundamental features of the European Union’s moral and legal framework.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU needs to agree common positions so as to channel our collective voice in strong defence of human rights. In this regard, I welcome the Arab Spring, and I would condemn in the strongest possible terms the ongoing and appalling repression by the Syrian regime of its population, as described in the previous debate.</p>
<p class="contents">As an incoming Member of the European Parliament’s Palestine Delegation, I am also particularly concerned about human rights violations in Gaza, East Jerusalem and the West Bank. The EU must adopt a strong common position on the follow-up to the fact-finding mission to Gaza, and I call on Baroness Ashton to ensure that the recommendations of this mission are implemented in full, and to ensure that there is full accountability for all violations of international law, regardless of the alleged perpetrators.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to welcome the inclusion of Burma as an EU priority for the 19th session of the UNHCR, and commend the work of the special rapporteur on human rights in Burma. I look forward to the transition to democracy in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to challenge third countries on human rights, we must ensure that human rights are fully protected in our own domestic policies. EU Member States should lead by example, and, as has already been alluded to, we need to ratify all international human rights instruments that we have helped establish, particularly in relation to migrants in our own countries.</p>

This is problematic.</p>
<p class="contents">Another concern I have is how to ensure that the UN Human Rights Council takes the changing world sufficiently into account. As we speak, prisons are increasingly populated by bloggers. Human rights defenders are presented under torture with transcripts of their e-mail, mobile phone and other conversations. People are tortured for their passwords and we see that European technologies play an important part in making that happen in repressive environments.</p>
<p class="contents">The struggle for human rights has moved online and digital freedom is increasingly essential for human rights, such as freedom of expression, press freedom and access to information, but also the documentation and sharing of human rights violations with the rest of the world. Frank La Rue’s UN report on freedom of expression is essential in this regard. It also clearly states that copyright enforcement could risk undermining the respect for fundamental rights and freedoms. I would urge prioritising digital freedoms within the UN Human Rights Council context and to ensure that information is upgraded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, the Human Rights Council will be an historic first, after the first ever UN resolution on human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity was adopted last year. The Council will at last examine in depth the issue of human rights breaches of LGBT people across the world.</p>
<p class="contents">We commend the excellent work of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, and hope this session’s panel will be open, frank and intelligent. Equally, we need to monitor developments in Zimbabwe and condemn the systemic and escalating violation of human rights in Zimbabwe under the Mugabe administration. In Belarus, the dictatorial regime needs to be brought to an end, the death penalty abolished, political prisoners released, and free and fair elections must take place.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the focus on discrimination against people living with HIV and AIDS. It is crucial to remind people every day that HIV and AIDS is a disease and not a crime, and we must fight the stigma that people who live with this infection face every single day.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say to the High Representative and the Commission that it is up to us to fight for human rights and to defend human rights defenders, whether we do so within our EU association agreements or the Cotonou Agreements. If we turn away from that which we can influence, we can hardly lecture the rest of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Human rights cannot be used as a weapon to attack those who pose an obstacle to ambitions of supremacy, when they are conveniently ignored domestically or in relation to saving friendly regimes.

The police routinely refuse to respond to complaints of attacks. The former president of the ANC Youth League, Julius Malema, popularised the singing of the song ‘Kill a Boer’ at ANC meetings.

In the European Union, we believe that everything relating to human rights is absolutely crucial to progress throughout the world and also to ensuring that these are not rights that are defined in an individual situation, but rights that are universal and that all countries bind themselves to and respect. We have not achieved this yet, but that is what we are pressing for. I would like to emphasise that we are very much engaged in this in the Council, too. We have an informal meeting between the foreign ministers in March, a Gymnich meeting, where one of the two topics we will discuss is precisely human rights – with a view to taking a decision on behalf of the EU again in June.</p>
<p class="contents">When we have such a high profile as we do where human rights are concerned, it is also important, if I may put it like this, that we put our own house in order – in other words, that we keep to the straight and narrow ourselves. This also means, of course, that we must continually bring these matters up at bilateral meetings with third countries, and it is important, as several speakers have also pointed out, that we see progress in the form of tangible results, where the world is making progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to add a few remarks in respect of some of the countries that have been mentioned. It is correct – as we also discussed under the previous item – that the human rights situation looks pretty dire in a country like Syria. It is also correct that, as regards Libya, there is no doubt that recent developments indicate that it is making progress where human rights are concerned. Several people also drew attention to Burma. After a long period of dictatorship and a lack of freedom for people, it looks like Burma is now making progress again. Evidence for this comes in the form of elections, by-elections, the release of prisoners and respect for minorities. It is once again important to say that what is absolutely essential where human rights are concerned is that they constitute fundamental principles that apply to everyone. We have a duty to go out and fight to ensure that they do indeed apply to everyone. That is democracy, it is the principle of the rule of law, it is human rights, it is rights for minorities, whether ethnic, sexual or religious. It is people’s fundamental right to determine their own future.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to say that I understand the criticism, and I understand that you would like to see Baroness Ashton at all of your meetings (you have got second best today). However, her absence is a sign that there really is a great deal to be done. I am nevertheless firmly convinced that the criticism of Baroness Ashton would be even greater if she was absent from the next foreign ministers’ meeting, where Syria is intended to be the main topic, or from the meeting in the General Affairs Council, where the main topic will be Kosovo and Serbia. In this regard, I therefore believe that Baroness Ashton has got her priorities right.</p>
<p class="contents">With those remarks, I would like to thank you for the debate. Keep the flag flying for human rights. That is an important European characteristic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Under the impact of the economic crisis and the terrorist threat, the exercise of fundamental liberties has been limited. Even when changes such as the Arab Spring provided the premises to improve this situation, the difficulties in changing the actual situation of citizens persist. That is why I believe that we need a more practical instrument to support the democratic transition in the Southern Mediterranean for the creation of states based on the rule of law. As regards the most disadvantaged groups, unfortunately, women and children are still the main victims. The discrimination against them – including economic discrimination – is more and more obvious and we must focus more on their protection. I think a more effective cooperation is necessary between the European Union, UN and the other international bodies so that the infringement of human rights is no longer encouraged by the impunity still enjoyed by the perpetrators. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
