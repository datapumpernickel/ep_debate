<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Figueiredo (GUE/NGL),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are discussing today is the result not only of the work of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, but also of the major contributions made by both the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, by means of the opinion delivered by Mr Alyssandrakis, and by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, by means of the opinion delivered by Mrs Swiebel. I thank them all for their contributions, which I hope a majority in Parliament will approve.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is based on the Commission communication on the first 15 National Action Plans for social inclusion that the Member States submitted in June last year, following the decisions taken at the Lisbon European Council, in March 2000, on the strategy to combat poverty and social exclusion and based on the four common objectives defined in Nice, which are: to facilitate participation in employment and access by all to the resources, rights, goods and services which are essential to live in dignity, to prevent the risks of exclusion, to help the most vulnerable and to mobilise all relevant bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the limitations and the diversity of approaches employed by the various Member States, the joint Commission and Council report approved during the Belgian Presidency highlights major risks and challenges that must be taken into account if we are to make more rapid progress on an in-depth and exhaustive study of the causes of social exclusion and on the concrete measures that need to be put in practice more speedily and with greater commitment. Unless this happens, our stated intentions on the need for greater economic and social cohesion run the risk of remaining words that are not translated into action.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind you, because of their importance, of the main challenges identified in the joint report, which are: to develop an inclusive labour market and promote employment as a right and opportunity for all; to guarantee an adequate income level and resources to live in human dignity; to tackle educational disadvantage; to preserve family solidarity and protect the rights of children; to ensure good housing for all; to guarantee equal access to high-quality services (health, transport, social, care, cultural, recreational and legal); to improve the delivery of services and to regenerate areas of multiple deprivation.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to meet these challenges, Member States must make significant improvements in the distribution of resources and opportunities in society so as to ensure the participation and social inclusion of all citizens and the exercise of their fundamental rights. It is equally important that an integrated and multidimensional strategy should be put in place, that, on the basis of the objectives defined in Nice and the implementation of the Community programme to encourage the fight against social exclusion, specifically the first round table that is due to take place in October during the Danish Presidency, added value should be sought in the fight against poverty and social exclusion and that encouragement is given for the drafting of the second set of National Action Plans for social inclusion to include priorities, specific targets and goals, appropriate policies and measures, accompanied by the corresponding funds and budgetary appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the common challenge that Community policies and the various national governments face is to ensure that the main mechanisms for the distributive effects of the labour market – the tax system, social security, education, housing, health and other public services – become sufficiently universal to respond to the needs of those who are most exposed to the risks of poverty and social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence also the importance of economic and monetary policies, including policies on competition, farming, fisheries and the Stability Pact, forming a triangle that is consistent with social policies, with each one having to be evaluated on its impact on the social sphere, with a view to reviewing them and ensuring that they comply with the social objectives and the need for greater economic and social cohesion and that they significantly diminish the scandal that is keeping around 18% of the population of the European Union, in other words, more than 60 million people, living in poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally important is the existence of credible and relevant social indicators, also in terms of gender, which enable us not only to observe trends in the social situation in the various EU countries, but also to warn of and monitor trends in the social situation as regards poverty and social exclusion in particular. We must not, therefore, try to deny the reality of the situation and bear in mind that, although it is difficult to analyse the correlation between public expenditure and social protection on the one hand and the risk of poverty on the other, it is fair to say that without social transfers, notably old age pensions, 41% of the population of the European Union would be at risk from poverty, a percentage which would still be 26% if we included old age pensions but excluded income from other social transfers.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, therefore, unhappy about the majority of the amendments tabled by the PPE-DE, which are intended to disguise the reality of the situation and to make it more difficult to implement essential measures to achieve social inclusion. I call on them to withdraw these amendments so that the work that has already been undertaken is not undermined and so that we can make a positive contribution to formalising an effective strategy for fighting against poverty and social exclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to thank the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for adopting almost all the proposals tabled by the Committee on Culture.</p>
<p class="contents">Our committee considers that education, culture and sport are major factors of social inclusion. I should point out here that, if these factors are to have a positive effect, they need to operate in a beneficial social environment, an environment, for example, which knows how to make the best of highly skilled graduates of the education system. We go on to identify a number of important points. Our committee feels that measures to prevent and combat social exclusion in education and culture must be firmly anchored in the public sector.</p>
<p class="contents">More importantly, it considers that a free and public education system is a prerequisite to free accessibility without exclusions and calls on the Member States to provide free compulsory education for a minimum of twelve years to all children. It also considers that the education system should provide young people not only with basic skills, including digital skills, but also with a profound understanding of society that will enable them to become conscious actors of social progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking account of the large number of young unemployed people, the Committee on Culture calls for the institution of "second chance" schools to be strengthened. It also calls for measures to be taken to combat illiteracy, ensuring a mastery of the mother tongue and the learning of other languages. We also call for special programmes for immigrants to learn the basic language of their host country.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the debate held in the parliamentary committees and concluded in plenary today is without doubt a useful and interesting debate. However, it is not enough. As the Committee on Culture points out, we need to implement specific actions in the fight against social exclusion if we are to make any headway before we next address this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is true that social policy has a dual role to play: promote social cohesion, but also productivity. The Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities therefore warmly supports the analysis that poverty and social exclusion can only be overcome by increasing productivity and the earning capacity of so-called underprivileged groups. This applies all the more to women. This is why it is slightly unfortunate that this analysis has not been thought through properly. Indeed, we looked for, and failed to find, the insight that it is due to the unequal distribution of paid and unpaid labour between men and women that women are over-represented among the poor. Poverty among women is directly linked to their lack of economic independence. The latter must be stimulated by means of paid work that generates a sustainable income for women themselves and for their dependants.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Commission and the Member States were willing to adopt this gender analysis, the level of women’s economic independence in Europe would need to be re-examined, and this factor would need to play an autonomous role in the analysis framework and in the policy goals of the anti-poverty policy. Indeed, single older women and single mothers with young children are particularly vulnerable groups. Their vulnerability, however, will not diminish unless the causes are truly identified. As long as the overburdening with unpaid work prevents women, and women with children, in particular, from developing their own earning capacity, they will remain vulnerable groups.</p>
<p class="contents">The so-called combination of work with care, which stands an excellent chance as an emancipation strategy at the moment, can also turn out to be a pitfall if too much emphasis on part-time work and holiday arrangements for women prevent these women from developing and maintaining sufficient earning capacity. The open coordination method can, in this connection, result in useful policy comparisons, and I am looking forward to this with interest. However, in this framework, the indicators used to measure poverty should no longer be gender-blind, but also chart the individual incomes of the individual family household members. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The word alone gives rise to a whole range of discrepancies. We know that the Commission introduced the concept of social exclusion some time ago because the word poverty was regarded as too strong by some Member States. However, we are now facing a certain inconsistency. One could imagine that it might be possible to be a socially excluded millionaire. This might well be conceivable but this is not what is at issue here. What we are ultimately talking about here is mainly money and anything related to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is, of course, the question whether poverty in Europe is the same as poverty in the developing world. No, that is not the case. People in Europe should be compared with people in Europe. It is not acceptable for someone who is in dire straits to be compared with someone in the developing world. That would be all too easy for the governments.</p>
<p class="contents">There is nevertheless a problem, namely that in the system of subsidiarity, most of the responsibilities lie with the Member States, even with the local councils, in fact. We can naturally give a whole host of useful recommendations in this matter. We can conclude agreements and make comparisons. This is all possible. The problem can, in fact, only be solved at the lowest possible geographical level. This is sometimes overlooked by many. It is as if we would be able to solve the entire social exclusion issue in this House. This is impossible. What we can do, however, is exchange information, set good examples and agree on common issues up to a point, but these common issues should not have a counterproductive effect.</p>
<p class="contents">I am of the opinion that we in Europe have not particularly improved the position of children by taking a large number of ideologically inspired measures in the past. We must not overlook that either. We are unable to do this; that is a task for the Member States. We can, in this context, only give a few wise lessons and leave it at that. The rapporteur has, in my view, written a good report, but has at times passed over these wise lessons. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Koukiadis (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, this communication maps out an integrated social policy. The rapporteur is therefore right to see this as a proposal of huge political significance, which is why her position deserves the backing of a large majority. First and foremost, this draft report reaffirms the political will to take combined action against exclusion at European Union level expressed at previous summits.</p>
<p class="contents">Having accepted – and in adopting the social agenda we have demonstrated that we do accept – that expenditure on social policy is also a productive factor, we feel that, if the European Union is to stand by what it says, we need to examine current spending restrictions in this light. We also clearly recognise, and this too is an accepted fact, that we need to join forces in the fight against exclusion and coordinate action on employment, health, housing, education and social protection. However, the difficulties in implementing these proposals are one of the crucial points. Indeed, the more vociferously we clamour for an integrated approach, the greater our responsibility to overcome the obstacles to implementing it. We need a crusade to change practices and customs and to overcome resistance, both from the political leadership and from the officials responsible for implementing this policy. And if there is to be greater interest in this objective on the part of the trades union, they too need to revise their priorities. Finally, there are inherent difficulties in organising substantiated public debates which have the right results, at both the design and evaluation stages.</p>
<p class="contents">Generally speaking, although the different Member States are trying to move away from political measures scattered across various sectors and towards an integrated approach, suitable mechanisms are lacking and the agencies responsible appear unwilling to get their act together. We must welcome the fact that the communication takes account of new dangers of exclusion as the result of new structural changes under way in the European Union, the most important being, as it rightly points out, changes on the job market and the privatisation of public services.</p>
<p class="contents">Although, having said which, the European Union itself has no clear objectives in its liberalisation policy as to what should stay in the public sector. The European Union needs to set an example by properly coordinating its individual policies. That is the only way we shall increase our credibility in the fight against social insecurity, which is one of the main reasons the far-right is gaining in popularity. We have to be clear on one thing: that the open method of coordination on social policy and the proposed international plans for national action against poverty need to be addressed by the Member States and the Commission with the same degree of earnestness as the stability pact and budgetary discipline.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to close by adding that this draft will only be of any use if the Commission is able to supply us with specific progress indicators in the immediate future. The Commission has specific responsibilities here. We do not want, during the second design stage of national plans to combat exclusion, to have to spend yet more time on the basic challenges of and principles behind non-exclusion policies; we want to examine the measures needed to convert all these principles into operational plans, the success rate of the new methods and the potential for monitoring specific added value. We should, I think, have a simple, concise report on these issues at the 2003 summit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A number of the national action plans were criticised for not taking on board the particular position of women, as Mrs Swiebel has been pointing out, in terms of social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">While I would agree with Mr Pronk that a lot of this is about money, it is also about other interlinking factors like a lack of real equality of opportunity. When you consider that at the moment in the UK there are women graduates likely to earn less than male graduates with similar degrees at the start of their careers, then there is a problem. The situation is even worse if you are male graduate of Bangladeshi or Pakistani background; your employment chances are as good as those of a young white man with no qualifications whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents">So there is a whole series of policies here which have to interlink to deal with issues about social inclusion. Of course, we also know that women are more likely to have career breaks, to work part-time, to work on short-term contracts and they are still less likely to hold elected office.</p>
<p class="contents">These factors help to explain why my group will not be supporting amendments which seek to remove the commitment to equal treatment for those in precarious or atypical employment. Equally, we are not supporting the amendments which seek to delete mention of factors of economic and monetary policy, which we believe have a significant impact on social circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">My group sees the value of social security, not just to assist the sustainability of income, but as a measure of social inclusion as well. We also believe that the participation of those experiencing social exclusion and working to relieve it is essential in coming to conclusions and solutions. Social inclusion involves having a voice in the decisions that affect you and we will therefore not be supporting Amendment No 7 either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report is no less important, given the fact that the ideas and objectives concerning social integration and social solidarity were highlighted two years ago in connection with the Lisbon decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">A lot has happened since then, however, and the situation has changed. Many of the governments that contributed to the decision in Lisbon no longer exist for, almost every month, there are new shifts in political power in the governments of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">That is worrying for, as Mr Pronk pointed out, responsibility for social security and integration lies with the Member States or at lower levels, resulting in a need for governments in the Member States that are concerned to prioritise solidarity and social integration.</p>
<p class="contents">If, as I fear, such governments do not exist, account will have to be taken of social mobilisation from below. In these circumstances, women’s movements, immigrant organisations, local workers’ movements and other organisations and movements which give priority to social solidarity will have to organise themselves and conduct a political struggle. Simply being generous or having good intentions is not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that there are antagonisms and conflicting interests and priorities in political life. The poor and the deprived are not the main priorities of those who possess political power. I therefore believe that we in Europe are on the way towards a grim political situation with a wider gulf than we are used to between those who hold power and those who have major and difficult social problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think it important that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, above all, support Mrs Figueiredo’s report. I also hope that this will be the case tomorrow when we vote on the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Because poverty is a multidimensional problem, which affects every aspect of human life, this scourge is now being perceived in a different light. This problem has repercussions not only for the dignity and quality of human life, but also for macroeconomic policies, social security, freedom and security. It is crucial that the Member States come up with long-term strategies primarily geared towards the groups at the greatest risk of social exclusion and which are most badly affected by poverty; the long-term unemployed, the disabled, the elderly, women and immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">The new knowledge-based society provides opportunities to reduce social exclusion through the creation of economic conditions that favour growth, employment and through openness to new forms of participation in society. The key idea is that employment is the best safeguard against social exclusion and poverty. The Member States must ensure free access to education, including qualifications in the field of information technology and languages, and must promote lifelong learning. The new open method of coordination must involve greater participation by local and regional authorities and social partners, in order to enable an effective exchange of best practices.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to emphasise the need for the candidate countries to participate, as soon as possible, in the strategy for social inclusion and to draw up their own national action plans to improve this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That means that 60 million Europeans, or 18% of the population, are still below the poverty line, the line that is defined as 50% of the average income of the Member States. This is made more serious by the fact that 50% of income in Luxembourg is not equal to 50% of income in Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also noted that Member States with social spending above the European Union average, such as Finland, Denmark and Germany, have far lower poverty levels, sometimes 50% lower, than countries in which social spending is below the European Union average. These countries include the southern countries and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">I think a great deal has already been said so far on the need for plans in each of the Member States and also on the need for the European institutions to become involved in these plans. I therefore believe, Mr President, that none of the proposed amendments must be adopted tomorrow, as this would destroy the philosophy of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, I am going to state here that one of the amendments proposes abandoning the eight challenges of which Mrs Figueiredo has spoken, including the rights to work, housing, education and health. If any of these amendments were to be adopted in their current wording, the philosophy of the report would be destroyed. I therefore call on my fellow Members to adopt the report as it stands, because it is a good report that correctly tackles the problems of poverty and social exclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to assure her – though hopefully she needs no such assurance – that such passion and such conviction is shared also on this side of the House, as I am sure it is right across the House. In that case it may be rather odd that her report had a rather rocky ride within the committee and that a large number of people voted against it. I suspect that might happen in plenary, certainly if a number of our amendments, which, as I understand, will be supported by the ELDR Group, fail to get through. It would be a shame if the report were to go down.</p>
<p class="contents">There are just two issues I would like to highlight, both of which have already been addressed more eloquently by my colleagues Mr Pronk and Mrs Bastos. The first point is the importance of this issue being treated on a bottom-up basis rather than a top-down basis, that it is up to Member States as close as possible to the problem to address the problem most successfully. The second issue is the importance of having full employment: promoting employment is the greatest way of addressing poverty and social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of the eight joint actions, the eight core challenges, referred to the point of promoting employment, though it was in recital V in the report. This needs to be stressed with great vigour. In particular I draw the attention of the House to Amendment No 20, which talks about the importance of temporary work and agency work as a way of getting people into permanent full-time employment. I would also say to the Commission that I strongly agree with the Commissioner that it is important to lay the foundations for further development of the temporary work sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Moreover, the first joint report on social inclusion, drawn up on the basis of national action plans combating poverty and social exclusion, highlighted the need for a joint analysis of the different situations in the European Union. In this regard, the national plans identify a number of risk factors which combine to underscore the multidimensional importance of the issue, and, in some cases, these factors are consequences as well as causes, which highlights the need to break the cycle of ongoing and intergenerational poverty represented by<span class="bold"> </span>social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, as happened at the Luxembourg Summit with regard to employment, a similar process of open cooperation and coordination to reach the objectives is starting in the area of social exclusion. Therefore, in order to contain and resolve the issue of social exclusion, specific actions have been proposed based on the four specific Nice objectives, which include the action to help the vulnerable, people with disabilities and elderly people who are not self-sufficient. It is important that these objectives are met, not so that we can give gold stars to<span class="bold"> </span>the different European States but so that genuine added value for the basic objective of social integration can be achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Lisbon, Nice, Stockholm and more recently the Barcelona Summit, are dates, places, cities, memories of summits which illustrate the social temperature of the European Union, dates when the European Union committed itself to creating a better and more developed economy, more and better jobs, sustained development and social cohesion. But we should remember the harsh reality: it might shock many of us if we were to stop and think, or if we read in the media, that in the countries we live in, the percentage of the population living below the poverty line (bearing in mind the commonly accepted criterion of income less than 60% of the national average income) is 8, 12, 14, 19 and even 22% (with an 18% average in the Union as a whole), and also bearing in mind that, although the European Union has recorded an average rate of GDP growth of 2.5%, levels of poverty and social exclusion are still very high.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Figueiredo’s report includes a series of considerations of measures for fighting social exclusion. I would like to highlight two or three of them: firstly, the development of an integrating labour market and the promotion of employment as a right and opportunity for all, a measure which sometimes means having to take decisions which, as is happening in Spain, may be opposed by some; that is why social dialogue is so important, but it must be proper social dialogue involving reciprocal concessions, dialogue in the true sense of the word.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no question that employment is the best way to ensure integration. We also need to promote training, new technologies, in view of the risk of technological illiteracy, and, above all, an integrated and multidimensional strategic approach, sex equality, education and environmental good practice as well as improvements in social services. And of course – and I will end here, Mr President – joint action. I agree that this should be executed at the lowest possible level, but I must also say that, probably, that execution should also be compatible with promotion actions, with actions carried out by other administrations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The debate has clearly illustrated how important it is for us to work together on all three basic policies, economic policy, employment policy and social policy, that is, how important this isosceles triangle is if we are to have balanced results in all the Member States and in the European Union as a whole. Two important political points were also raised during the debate. Can and should the European Union get involved by coordinating or proposing policies on exclusion and poverty?</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, two or three Members have already touched on how we define poverty and exclusion today and of course there is a huge difference compared with developing world poverty. In Europe we are talking about relative poverty but, still, we should not forget that over 65 million people in Europe are dangerously close to the poverty line, nor should we overlook the wider issue of exclusion defined by new demands in the information society.</p>
<p class="contents">So, having agreed on the definition and the complicated issue of indicators, we come to the next question: should the European Union act? I think it is clearer now than at any time in the past, both from the conclusions to come out of Nice and the conclusions to come out of Barcelona, that a social policy dimension is needed in European policies and that the impact of European economic policies in the social area needs to be evaluated. That is why this is the first time, and I think this is worth stressing, that we have had a plan and any attempt to work together at European level on the issues of poverty and exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question is: can the European Union act – under the Treaties and by dividing responsibilities at European and national level? I think that we need to be clear and tread carefully here. Of course there is the question of subsidiarity. Of course social policy is becoming more and more decentralised and is being exercised at local, regional and government level in all the Member States. But I am certain that, by applying the method of open coordination, which does not impose legal frameworks, we have already reaped important initial results. Countries which have never had national action plans are now presenting organised national action plans. Valuable experience from countries which have already applied programmes is being passed to all the other countries. We are working together on the important issue of indicators and we are also working together on the important issue of how to apply these plans. I think that your report has a specific contribution to make and there are a number of points, the most important points, on which I completely agree and it is these points, I think, that should be discussed at the round table scheduled for October, during the Danish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">So it is important for the public debate on poverty to be an open debate involving more people, involving the people concerned, not just parliaments and social partners. Ex-post evaluation of each programme also plays an important part. Quantitative targets at national level are vital, distinguishing responsibilities for national action plans at national, regional and local level is very important and, of course, the budget and linking public funds to proposed policies and measures also plays a very important part.</p>
<p class="contents">During the Danish Presidency, we shall be evaluating national action plans on poverty to date and discussing preparations for future plans, as I said, at the round table in October. These are the issues we need to focus on, in order to ensure that the second generation of national action plans is far more effective. Finally, given that the Commission has been called on to act in the wake of this report, I should perhaps remind you that, since the Commission presented its communication to Parliament last October, the common position on social employment has been approved in Laeken and the programme on social exclusion, a very specific programme on which we worked together with Parliament and which gives the Member States tools to develop action plans on social exclusion, has also been approved.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, I think, important to remember that we have extended the procedure to all the candidate countries and we are in the process of signing action plans on exclusion with all the candidate countries so that, once they have joined, they can integrate fully into current procedures. Of course, we must not forget the very important work carried out – and which will continue during the second half of the year – on the subject of indicators, following approval of the initial 18 indicators at the Laeken Summit last December.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to refer once more to the repeated discussions with your committee on the importance of social indicators to the policies of the European Union as a whole and how social indicators play a very important part at the spring Council, helping to shape final economic decisions in every country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
