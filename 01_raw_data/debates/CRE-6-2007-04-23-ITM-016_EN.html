<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Charlie McCreevy, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and in particular the rapporteur, Jean-Paul Gauzès, for their excellent work in preparing the report on the directive on payment services in the internal market. I also thank you for your patience regarding the deferral of this plenary vote. This has provided the time needed to find common ground between the three institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Currently, 27 different sets of national rules apply to payment transactions. Although we have the euro, national payments markets continue to be fragmented and, sadly, all too often payments are slow and expensive and consumers poorly served. This makes life for our citizens and businesses more difficult than it should be. It holds up their daily activities and hinders their business development. In some cases, desirable payment products, such as direct debits, are simply not available. The directive aims to remedy this situation in two main ways: on the one hand, by providing greater legal certainty and improved consumer protection, and, on the other hand, by opening up the payments market to more competition to encourage greater efficiency and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive provides greater legal certainty by establishing a harmonised set of rights and obligations for users and providers, as well as clear information requirements. Both are essential to an integrated EU payments market, at the heart of which is SEPA, the Single European Payments Area. SEPA is an industry initiative strongly supported by the European institutions. SEPA will allow for the creation of an integrated market, enabling payments to be executed more quickly and easily throughout the European Union. The efficiency of our payments systems should be enhanced and the cost of payments to the economy as a whole reduced. Adoption of the proposed directive is therefore crucial for the successful launch of SEPA.</p>
<p class="contents">But the picture would not be complete without the other objective of the directive, namely that of fostering more competition in payments markets through the establishment of an appropriate and balanced prudential framework for new entrants. New payment institutions, such as money remitters, mobile operators and retailers, should act as a spur to innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout these long months of negotiation, both the Council and the Commission have been very aware of the views set out in the report adopted by the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee last September. The compromise text, which is now on the table as Amendment 286, therefore seeks to meet these objectives and, in particular, calls for a strengthened prudential framework for the new payment institutions. In addition to the qualitative prudential requirements already proposed by the Commission, these new institutions will now be subject to a regime of appropriate and balanced capital charges – both initial and ongoing, and hybrid institutions, such as retailers or telecom companies, must also meet safeguarding requirements such as ring-fencing.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive’s scope will be limited to payments that both originate and end in the European Union. It is, however, important not to forget about payment transactions involving non-EU Member States or non-EU currencies. Consumers rightly expect the provisions protecting them with regard to theft, loss or misappropriation of payment instruments to apply irrespective of whether non-authorised use takes place inside or outside the European Union. Performance, quality and price of payments made towards third countries should also improve. EU consumers transfer considerable amounts of funds to third countries, often to support their families. The costs of such payments can be very high. Therefore, after three years of operation, the scope of the directive should be reviewed in order to assess whether ‘one-leg payments’, where only one of the parties involved is in the EU, or payments in non-EU currencies, should be included.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude: European citizens and businesses today need a single payments market, in which payments can be made as quickly, efficiently and conveniently as domestic payments. This directive can provide the market with the necessary legal foundation for SEPA and with a new prudential framework fostering new competition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On my appointment as Parliament rapporteur in January 2006, I thought that, even though some of the Commission’s estimates seemed optimistic, the creation of such a market through the harmonisation of national laws would enable some obstacles to be removed and would impact positively on growth. I therefore approved in principle of the European Commission’s initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, this proposal for a directive came at the right time to help make a success of the banking sector’s initiative to create a single euro payments area. The objectives declared by the European Commission were to increase competition by creating new participants – you made this point just now, Commissioner – to make the market more transparent for service providers and for users, and to clarify the rights and obligations of users and service providers.</p>
<p class="contents">In a bid to make this legislative proposal more effective and to take account of the technical constraints of the industry, while maintaining the objective of reducing costs for the benefits of users, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted a number of coordinated amendments, which have at last gained the unanimous approval of the committee members.</p>
<p class="contents">All throughout the procedure, there have been informal contacts between the representatives of the European Parliament, of the successive presidencies and of the European Commission. These discussions enabled Parliament – which, on this rare occasion, took a stand before the Council had reached an agreement – to have a tangible influence on the negotiations at the Council. I am particularly pleased with our fruitful cooperation with the German Presidency, which has not spared any efforts, and with your Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">On 27 March 2007, the ministers of finance, gathered together within the Economic and Financial Affairs Council, at last unanimously adopted a general approach on the compromise text. This compromise is, in my opinion, acceptable today. I should like to thank the German Presidency. Its effective work and solid cooperation with the European Parliament have meant that this matter is now on the verge of success.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has drawn closer to Parliament on the key points, namely the reduction of the scope to payments in euros or in the other currencies used within the European Union – with there being an option to adjust this after a trial period – the restriction on exercise of the activities of payment institutions to legal persons, the implementation of strict conditions for authorisation to provide payment services, the introduction of initial and ongoing capital, the isolation of funds for hybrid establishments, the limitation of the granting of credit to 12 months with a ban on revolving credit, and the introduction of a provision indicating that the granting of credit must not contradict national and European rules relating, among other things, to consumer credit.</p>
<p class="contents">There has also been a closer alignment with regard to clearer information for consumers, thanks to a distinction being made between information that must actively be provided and information that must merely be made available to consumers; to the opportunity provided to micro-companies to benefit from the same protection as consumers where information is concerned; and, lastly, to the limited option of derogation, with a maximum volume of transactions fixed at EUR 3 million.</p>
<p class="contents">The text, as it stands, stipulates a J+1 execution time and the clear division of responsibilities between the various payment service providers in the event of a transaction being poorly executed. It is on this compromise text that Parliament will vote tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the significant progress made at the time of ECOFIN in terms of Parliament’s position and the objective of the parties involved to reach an agreement at first reading, I have tabled just one amendment in plenary, which takes up the ECOFIN compromise. I call on my fellow Members to endorse this amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">An Amendment 287, on data protection, aimed at amending Article 71, has been tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left. I do not believe that this amendment should be adopted by Parliament. On the other hand, it would be helpful, Commissioner – and I am also addressing the representatives of the Presidency and of the Council – if assurances were given, in this regard, to our Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise text is certainly not perfect, and some of my fellow Members will perhaps have the opportunity to say so. It does, however, have the virtue of laying the already solid foundations of an internal payments market. It is important to stress what this advance, which will result in the harmonisation of what are, today, strictly national payment systems, represents. It is worth highlighting the fact that we are not just talking here about cross-border payments, which account for less than 5% of payments, but indeed of all payments that are made.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of its obviously technical nature, this text has a definite political scope. It improves relations between consumers and financial payment service providers and contributes to the Lisbon Strategy. However, I should also like to point out that, on this specific and particularly sensitive subject – specific and particularly sensitive because it could give rise to conflicts of interest – Parliament, the diverse institution that it is, has found a solution more quickly than the governments. This is perhaps because we, in this House, have more than elsewhere…</p>

I am pleased that this House has had major input in the decision-making process, and would like to thank all Members of the House for this, not least Mr Gauzès who, being an authority in this area, has handled this issue with much objectivity, and would also like to thank all shadow rapporteurs.</p>
<p class="contents">As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, it is hugely important to my mind that we, faced with 27 different payment systems and consequently 27 different sets of rules, managed to secure an extremely high level of consumer protection. This text strikes me as more than satisfactory, particularly since the banks’ duty of information and their liability in the event of incorrect transactions, loss or fraud have now been omitted.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate was at its most heated when payment institutions were discussed, and in the final analysis, that is also where, as I see it, the compromise is justifiable, even though our group would have preferred to see it tightened up in places. It is not a disgrace to be a bank. This directive is about payments, not in the first instance about credits, and if you wish to grant credit, you need to comply with the conditions and control of the banks.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to express some concern nevertheless. The Single European Payments Area project should not be at the expense of the man in the street. I am pleased to note, Commissioner, that the Commission has launched an enquiry into the rates applicable to card use, and I would urge it to take regulatory action if it turns out that banks have abused their position of power in this respect. The directive has come at the right time, since the project is sound, I think this is now also the right time for it to be correctly implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The introduction of the euro gave us a European, a domestic payment area, one that could never be other than a payment services area, too, and it is that payment services area that we are now bringing a step closer today. What we brought in years ago, in the shape of cross-border retail payments, we are now, by means of this directive, moving forward, and we should be bold enough to say so and not get too bogged down in the details.</p>
<p class="contents">We can be glad that it has proved possible to take account of the quirks in the individual Member States, ensuring, for example, that debits are good value and benefit the consumers. As Mrs de Vits said, we should pay attention to how the market develops in the future, paying, in particular, more attention to the extent to which charges are levied on payments – payments coming in, that is, rather than payments going out. We should focus more on that, since it is in this area, I feel, that there have, very recently, been a number of abuses.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that we can talk of there being such a thing as SEPA – the ‘Single European Payments Area’ – we in this House should show how forward-looking we are by, instead of using the term ‘Open Skies’, referring to a ‘Single European Flight Area’, or SEFA, and, when discussing roaming charges, we can talk about a Single European Telecommunications Area, or SETA; Europe will then, again, become visible, and individual projects will not be laden down with more and more new concepts that obscure it from people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Despite the cultural and structural differences in the ways in which payments are made in Europe, we have managed to find a solution that fits everyone. The decision was taken in September last year; it was only pressure on the part of this House that got the Council to sort the matter out.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Member States, unfortunately, still believe they have to retain their inflexible systems in their dealings with the rest of Europe, but that is not what Europe is about; Europe – as Mr Wieland said – is about bringing everyone together. By projects such as this, Europe can show in practical terms what it means to ordinary people. There were, eventually, compromises on such things as D+1, on loans, on payment service providers and on the provisions for consumer protection, and the ultimate goal should still be to set the emancipated citizen as a benchmark, but I do see this as an important further step, and hope that the directive will be implemented accordingly, despite the unresolved issues remaining in some areas.</p>
<p class="contents">My office has recently been on the receiving end of more and more questions about what actually happens when money transfers are actually effected despite the details being wrong. To give just one example, somebody sent EUR 150 from Germany to Italy and, because of a wrong entry, EUR 113 was deducted in charges. If the banks carry on like that, they will bring the next step on themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I urge them to regulate themselves in a sensible manner and to be guided more by what the public want. I hope that this appeal will not lead to the light going out again; after all, it was not as bad as all that. Again, let me extend warm thanks to Mr Gauzès, and to the Commission, for making it possible for us, once again, to get the Council into line. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to congratulate Commissioner McCreevy.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament as a whole has played a decisive role in the payment services directive and has once again confirmed that it is the most dynamic of our institutions at this moment in time. It is thanks to Parliament and our work that an agreement has been reached and that the Council has adopted as the basis for its own work the report that was approved almost unanimously in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. It is because of the part we played that insurmountable obstacles have been tackled, and it is because of our work – and here I should also like to mention the specific part played by the delegation from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, namely Mrs van den Burg, Mrs De Vits, Mrs Berès and myself – that solutions have been found to certain issues, such as the granting of credit, which is now rightly grounded in the Consumer Credit Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement reached at the March ECOFIN Council, thanks to the German Presidency’s tenacity and the earlier work done by the Finnish Presidency, is in my view an excellent outcome and I believe we ought to support that position. That is why I can announce that the Socialist Group will vote in favour, so as to avoid any delay. We cannot afford any further delays, which would jeopardise consumers – as Mrs De Vits has pointed out – as well as businesses and the banking industry. As regards the banks, the enquiry that the Commission is conducting is important in that it will show up any possible discrepancies; even though we must be strict in our judgments, however, I also think it is right to point out the times when the banks make positive efforts. In fact, the banks are making almost as much effort to comply with this directive as they did when the euro was introduced. A delay would therefore be contrary to their interests, and in our vote tomorrow we must make absolutely sure that any such delay is avoided. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The answer is ‘not really’. Am I supporting it? Yes, because I believe it makes sense to have a European payments system to improve the single market and therefore it makes sense to take this step, far from perfect though it is.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been astonished at how difficult it has been trying to move out of the dark ages on payment times, capital regimes and electronic money. The question I have most often been asked about this directive is ‘Will it make payments cheaper?’, not ‘Will it make payments safer?’. But this is not a price-regulation directive, so the only way to make payments cheaper is through greater competition and through transparency, so that consumers know what they are getting.</p>
<p class="contents">We have achieved greater transparency, which I welcome, as I do the other useful safeguards for consumers. Hopefully, the payment service providers’ ability to passport will enhance competition, but I harbour fears that the ongoing capital regimes and especially the scaling factors of 0.5 and 0.8 for money remitters and mobile remittances respectively mean repeating the mistakes made in the E-money Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">A review of the capital regime after three years in the light of experience, and perhaps after the functioning of extremes of implementation of 20% flexibility, may, therefore, turn out to be interesting. It is certainly an essential backstop that allows me to give my support, as is the possibility of reviewing the scope after three years. It is quite a disappointment to me that the present scope does not extend to one-leg payments.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards Amendment 287, I persuaded my group not to table a similar amendment because, in addition to technical details, the data-protection issue is wider than this directive. That does not mean that the issue does not need addressing or, should it come to it, that a vote against the amendment is against the principle that it embodies, but I hope that another solution can be found that encompasses the idea without destroying the opportunity of this single-reading agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nonetheless, it gives rise to a series of concerns. The creation of payment institutions raises the issue of whether they will act according to the principle of maximising profit or in the interests of the public good. These two approaches are mutually exclusive. The question then arises as to whether genuine increased competition between institutions will ensue, or whether concentration of the payments market will occur within a short time period, with the emergence of an oligopoly. If so, then it is fundamental to introduce this solution for countries in the eurozone. The new Member States will then have an opportunity to assess whether the system introduced is beneficial or not. They will also be able to gain an appreciation of the cost of introducing such a system. The cost is likely to be relatively high in view of the software and monitoring required, and is difficult to estimate at present. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The purpose of this separation is, presumably, to minimise risk. But all payments, apart from a tiny proportion of cash payments, are transfers between bank accounts. Hence banks are the natural institutions for operating payment systems, and I doubt that such a separation is either feasible or even desirable from an efficiency point of view. This directive states that it has the worthy objectives of increased competition, transparency, consumer protection and so on. I wonder whether it will turn out like other financial directives such as MiFID, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, for instance.

I think MiFID will be a revolution for trading in European markets and it will deliver very good results in Europe. I think the Commissioner agrees with me on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, the Payment Services Directive represents a very positive step in internal market harmonisation. Like the Commissioner, I believe that with the present agreement we have reached a balance between banks and other service providers on the one hand and consumers on the other. This was an instance in which the market was not delivering the best possible results and regulation was really needed.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to raise three brief points of substance. Firstly, I very much agree with Mrs Bowles concerning capital regime. I would have favoured the EC’s original proposal on capital requirements. I think that it might not be enough of a level playing field, and new access-related barriers might appear especially for non-banks. I should have liked to see a more liberal competition regime in these aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on the question of credit granted, especially by credit card companies which are non-banks, there are possible disadvantages for these credit card companies, but we can look at these issues again in our review in three years’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, on the liability of payment service providers, I understand that there is an in-built flexibility in payment contracts on what, for example, the payer’s responsibility is in cases like Mr Radwan referred to, when the payment does not appear when it should. However, I think the strict definition on liability in the directive could be too rigid and inflexible and it should have been reformed. On the other hand, we can also go back to this in the review.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, concerning the single reading process, I think Parliament, the Commission and the Council interacted very well on this. However, we were put in a ‘take it or leave it’ situation and it would have been better if Parliament had been able to put substantial amendments in place before the vote in plenary. However, all in all the single reading is a good step towards modernising our legislative processes, but it is not an end in itself. We have a good compromise on this directive, but if this is not the case, the single reading should not be used. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When I look at all the parties involved in the creation of this new dimension of the internal market, whether they be banks, distributors, administrations or consumers, I feel that, ultimately, we would better appreciate the validity of the legislation that we are going to adopt if, in the future, payment services were cheaper for consumers and if their diversity were promoted in such a way as to make modern payment methods more easily accessible.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that we were right to insist that payment institutions should perhaps not be subject to all the rules laid down by Basel II, but that, as a minimum requirement, their stability and viability should be guaranteed in the interests of consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I regret that there has been some confusion regarding the difference between the concept of loan and that of payment. I hope that the agreement reached with this text will not compromise an agreement on a consumer credit directive, which the Union sorely needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I must emphasise the meaning of Amendment 287 and, above all, the letter that the President of our institution has received from the chairman of the ‘Article 29’ group, responsible for data protection within the European Union. We cannot agree today to vote for the report by our fellow Member, Mr Gauzès, without having guarantees from both the Commission and the Council. Therefore, I am addressing our two institutional partners so that, when the SEPA system is implemented, we are not in a situation which, with what we know of the SWIFT system, causes us to exacerbate the wayward developments that we are seeing.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to know that, when the SEPA system enters fully into force, we will have a system that enables us to protect the data exchanged through SWIFT. We also need – and, on this point, I expect a statement from the two other institutions – the negotiations to involve our American partners, so that we can verify the conditions under which the data transmitted by SWIFT are transmitted to the US administration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Many problems associated with the implementation of this Directive have been outlined here today. I would also like to state, as did the rapporteur, that this document is very technical in nature. We still need to have several things clarified; most importantly – the supervision of the payment directive implementation, given that large banking and finance groups are operating. Who will be responsible? Even though the Directive appears to define this, there are nevertheless many uncertainties still present.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important issue requiring attention is supervision of non-banking finance institutions, which is truly necessary and welcome. However, differentiation can sometimes be an offset to supervision, and it can cost more than the operations themselves in small countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have waited a long time, but we have finally got there. Well done! Importantly, the payment services directive opens up the payments market to non-banks. Barriers to entry and the stifling of innovation have been addressed, at least to some extent, through a mix of waivers for smaller players and flexibility for Member States on electronic money and other new means of payments, such as the money purse.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I feel that there are some aspects where we have had an opportunity to make bigger inroads towards competition but have not gone nearly far enough. Non-banks do not need such comprehensive capital requirements as have been agreed with the Council. Payment services companies such as remitters, bill payers and companies offering card-based payment services do not take deposits and therefore do not need the same financial underpinning as deposit-taking commercial banks. One suspects that this is more a matter of protecting traditional banks from new competitors than of protecting consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in this age of instantaneous communication surely even one day is more than should be necessary to move money from one end of the earth to the other, let alone from Strasbourg to Freiburg. And why are the banks afraid to be transparent about the cost of their services instead of charging by stealth in the form of unjustifiably long float times? Surely, in the spirit of Lisbon, we should be leading the world in applying today’s technology to money transfers. They should be instantaneous, with no delay at all. The service provider should then openly display its full charge for the service.</p>
<p class="contents">So this directive, as finally and tortuously agreed, is a step in the right direction towards providing Europeans, both individuals and SMEs, with a modern, efficient and reasonably-priced money transmission service. But it is not all we should expect. Hopefully there will be further steps, Commissioner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is wonderful that we managed this. I should also like to add that the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs have informed the rest of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in an excellent and transparent manner, the latter not always being a matter of course in first-reading procedures, but it is a good thing that we have now gathered pace and can take this issue through to the next step.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make two observations about the content. First of all, I partly share Mr Purvis’s view on competition within the payments market. In the Netherlands, we do not seem to struggle that much with this waiver that has now been suggested, because we hope that new services will develop and new service providers will enter the market, particularly geared towards immigrants, for example, who wish to send money to their home countries. This is typically a service where new service providers have sprung up, and a service which I would like to see above board rather than trapped in illegality underground. As I see it, developments and opportunities of this kind, particularly where smaller amounts and straight-forward services are involved, should be given a chance, because why should those people have to make use of expensive bank services?</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make one final remark, one that has also been raised by various speakers before me. Let us – and this is also a message in the direction of the Commission and the DG on Competition – be on our guard against fresh monopolies, oligopolies or cartels emerging within this market, because this would, after all, lead to a situation where customer services are not cheaper or better. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the area of services in the internal market, we have managed to achieve only partial results, but I hope that we will bring about a real breakthrough with regard to payment services.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself come from what is still considered a new Member State, and I trust that we will be able to enjoy the benefits of the opening up of the internal market in addition to its many disadvantages. This is why last year I was disappointed when we could have had the courage to open up those services that would have represented a comparative advantage for the new Member States, and would have strengthened competition on the internal market. Now we are once again at that point and once again we hope that not only will we lay down in legislation the questions of a service that has not hitherto received complex regulation, but we will also succeed, by ensuring the entry of new players into the field, in really forcing down the price of high quality payment services.</p>
<p class="contents">The true guarantee of the freedom of establishment and service provision is of outstanding importance. The Commission’s original proposal was courageous in this regard, as it would have made possible the introduction of the new services without any special capital requirements, thereby breaking the monopoly that the banks have achieved in this field. The assessment by Mrs Neelie Kroes has also provided ample proof of this. It is with regret that I see that compared to the original proposal, stricter capital requirements are now appearing, but I hope that this will not prevent new players from entering the market.</p>
<p class="contents">The other important consideration is that money transfers should reach the beneficiary as quickly as possible, so that the latter may use the funds as soon as possible. In this area the current compromise may represent a step forward, as it shortens the considerable period during which the bank is using our money free of charge.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased that the compromise gives special attention to micro-enterprises as individual consumers. I will vote for the agreement, which came into being under closed and elitist circumstances. The most important point, however, will come three years after its transposition into national law, when it is reviewed – the proof of the pudding is in the eating. If the above three positive changes take place in this area that I consider to be important, and cheaper payment services become available to vulnerable Central European consumers and small businesses, then we will have done a good thing. If not, because new players have not entered the market, then we will need to make modifications, and this will take courage, so let us hope we will then have the necessary courage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Directiva privind serviciile financiare în cadrul pieţei comune completează iniţiativa sectorului bancar privind înfiinţarea zonei unice pentru plăţi în euro prin armonizarea legislaţiei din statele membre. Deşi în Uniunea Europeană 96% din plăţi au un caracter naţional şi doar 4% din plăţi se realizează între furnizorii de servicii financiare din state membre diferite, directiva propusă va încuraja competiţia, va reduce costurile, va asigura o mai mare transparenţă privind condiţiile si tarifele aplicabile precum şi o mai bună protecţie a utilizatorilor şi furnizorilor prin definirea drepturilor şi obligaţiilor acestora. Sistemele electronice de plăţi asigură un timp de procesare redus şi facilitează tranzacţiile între furnizorii de servicii financiare din state membre diferite, dar implementarea acestora necesită investiţii importante. Mobilitatea cetăţenilor necesită mijloace electronice de plată. În ultimii ani s-au dezvoltat sisteme electronice de plată şi, în acest context, securitatea plăţilor electronice este crucială pentru încrederea utilizatorilor acestor servicii. Consider că, pentru protecţia consumatorilor şi încrederea acestora în serviciile financiare, este important ca pentru instituţiile plătitoare să existe condiţii de autorizare şi funcţionare foarte clar definite.

This is an important political signal; it is the starter’s gun for which the European banks have been waiting, and they too deserve thanks for their constructive and effective cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">For the consumers, the regulations represent a step towards a truly united internal market for financial services, as previous speakers have rightly appreciated.</p>
<p class="contents">However appropriate it is to sound a celebratory note, we should not forget that a compromise always falls short of the ideal solution in certain respects; the pre-eminent example is the way in which the banks will incur considerable costs by reason not only of the single working day execution time allowed them, but also of other structural measures. There are indications that some EUR 23 billion have already been invested in the structural orientation of SEPA as a whole. An execution time of two banking days without any exceptions would, for the European financial sector, be simpler and more transparent, would have been more beneficial to competition, and would, in any case, have saved on costs, but the decision we will be taking tomorrow is one we will be living with.</p>
<p class="contents">While consumers will have cause to welcome the greater choice of banks from different Member States, a critical note has to be sounded where their protection is concerned, in that not all suppliers are subject to the same supervisory regulations; the principle of ‘equal conditions for all market actors’ does not apply in every case. Our political actions should always be guided by the needs of consumers and by the need for a functioning and competitive financial market; so national procedures and financial products that work well, are affordable and accepted should not on any account be sacrificed on the altar of European money transfer transactions, the number of which, expressed as a proportion, is constantly diminishing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Recital 4 stipulates in so many words that it should mean a considerable step forward in terms of costs and efficiency for the consumer and for small and medium-sized enterprises, but how does this measure up against reality? In the Netherlands and in other countries, banks are already giving indications that European rules will make things more expensive for the consumer and for SMEs, and that costs for card payment are set to rise, as they already have done in a number of countries. I would remind Commissioner McCreevy that the project is not finished, but has only just started, and should like him to tell us how he proposes to remain involved, how he will ensure that these objectives are actually achieved and that the consumer really does benefit, and what measures he proposes to take, in tandem with Mrs Kroes, in the next couple of years in order to bring this about. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We cannot establish a single market for payments without a harmonised legal framework at EU level instead of the patchwork of 27 sets of different national rules. At the same time we need more competition and innovation in payments markets. This will provide substantial benefits to our citizens, our businesses, our public administrations and our economy as a whole. Quite simply, payments are the lifeblood of our economy and without an efficient payments system we cannot have an efficient single market.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue regarding data protection was raised by the following Members: Mr Gauzès, Mrs Bowles and Mrs Berès. I would like to say two things on this issue. Firstly, the Commission has already responded to Parliament’s resolution of 14 February 2007 on the SWIFT case. Article 19 of the proposed directive allows the exchange of information between competent authorities responsible for protecting personal data and the authority responsible for supervising payment institutions. This corresponds to the conclusions of the Article 29 working party opinion of 22 November 2006 on the processing of data by SWIFT.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the limitation of data processing to EU countries, as proposed by Amendment 287, would in fact be a contradiction of the data protection directive. That directive has a specific regime for authorising the export of data to third countries if those countries provide the necessary guarantees. This regime aims at ensuring that European data protection standards are not undermined by the export of data to countries with more lenient standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The SWIFT case has demonstrated that we must remain vigilant on the protection of personal data. Combating terrorism and terrorist financing are important. So is the protection of privacy, however, which is a fundamental principle for all EU Member States. The Commission will use all means at its disposal to ensure that all Member States respect data protection, including the export of data to third countries. I will bring the points made here to the attention of my colleague, Commissioner Frattini, who is directly responsible for this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow Parliament has the opportunity to endorse the proposal which reflects the views already expressed in its lead committee’s report, which provides a legal foundation for an efficient and modern payments market. The Commission fully supports a set of compromise amendments aimed at achieving this. I would once again like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Gauzès, and Parliament for your patience in deferring this vote. I stress his conviction that your vote is a historic occasion for payments in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
