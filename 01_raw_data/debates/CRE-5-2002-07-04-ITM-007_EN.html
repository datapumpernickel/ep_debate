They had the opportunity to see on the ground the seriousness and the scale of the humanitarian tragedy, which requires European and international aid to be sent as a matter of urgency. This must be done not only to improve the living conditions of an entire people, but because this is the last chance to save many lives, above all of children, who are dying every day of hunger and disease in the most scandalous silence, without the energy and will even to cry. This aid must be provided effectively and quickly. Often, in this amazing<span class="italic"> </span>bureaucracy that we are becoming, by the time we decide to act, it is already too late. Angola needs emergency humanitarian aid which can be translated, for example, into realities as practical as the urgent dispatch of seeds and farming tools before the rainy season starts in October, to prevent another year of famine.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made our priorities clear in the motion for a resolution that we endorse and support: we must provide emergency humanitarian aid; we must contribute to the consolidation of peace, which includes turning UNITA into a political party and integrating its members into national life; we must support democratic conciliation, seeking to ensure legitimisation through democratic and free elections which respect fundamental freedoms, specifically the freedoms of information, association and expression, and we must pursue economic consolidation and social reorganisation.</p>
<p class="contents">As we have already said in this Chamber on numerous occasions, Angola is a huge country with the potential to assert itself as an influential and important regional power and thereby to contribute to the democratic stabilisation of the entire region and to its economic and social progress. The war limited this potential, but all options are now open and depend on the will of the Angolan people, but also on our support. Let us ensure that our resolve does not falter and thereby weaken theirs! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Everything could have been so different, had it not been for the blindness of the Portuguese dictatorship and the brutality of the fight for power that followed decolonisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Bereft of the pity of the gods and victim of the madness of man, Angola was engulfed in one of the great tragedies of our time, one-third of the population displaced, hundreds of thousands of children abandoned, the destruction of towns and the dismantling of the country’s burgeoning economic infra-structure. All the resources seized by the opposing forces were dedicated to war and to cruelty, with total indifference for the population. We know that in the midst of the poverty and the widespread suffering, countless individuals linked to the State apparatus managed illegally to accumulate incalculable wealth.</p>
<p class="contents">The time has at last arrived for peace and for hope. The international community and the European Union in particular must spare no effort to consolidate peace, to promote democracy and to save millions of people who are exposed to hunger, disease and poverty. The motion for a resolution that we will be approving today shows that the European Parliament has not forgotten Angola. As a matter of fact, the EP has given many moral commitments to Angola. We must redouble our efforts to provide emergency aid to the population under threat, particularly those people who, located in the areas under the influence of UNITA, are living in the most abject poverty. The Angolan authorities, however – and this must be emphasised – also have the moral obligation to give up much of the wealth they have accumulated and help their own people. They also have the obligation to contribute to steer emergency aid in the right direction and to guarantee that it reaches those for whom it is intended and does not disappear en route.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, we in the European Parliament are therefore keeping a close eye on events in Angola. The European Parliament wants Angola to be a land of peace and of progress, a land and a country that is part of the international community. Angola has enormous resources, huge talents and huge hopes. And here, in the European Parliament, we must stand shoulder to shoulder with the Angolan people, even if at times we have to get tough with the authorities installed in Luanda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Three decades of hatred and barbarity have devastated an extraordinarily rich territory and natural environment, ruined Angola’s national infrastructure and annihilated, physically and psychologically, an entire population.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the virtually unprecedented extent of the tragedy suffered by a country situated on a continent that has already seen so much bloodshed, and in the light of the renewed optimism emerging in Angola, the European Union has more than a role to play – it has a real duty, a historic duty, that it must perform.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has an extremely urgent humanitarian duty, first and foremost, to increase security in a country that has been deeply scarred at every level by bullets, famine and mines. But the EU also has a moral and political duty over the long term, which it must assume immediately in order to strengthen the fragile civil and religious peace that is being restored in Angola. It also has a duty to resurrect a still liberated economy and to restore a transparent democratic system within the institutions. On the scorched earth of Angola, which has such abundant mineral resources, the European Union, with its experience, its technical and financial resources, can assist in the emergence of a new model in Africa, that of a model of national recovery which needs to be based primarily on the education of its citizens, achieved through knowledge gained from schooling, from the respect of civilian values and citizenship and the requirement for democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">This period also marks a turning point in terms of the economy. We should rethink and relaunch a development model that is based on the fundamental resources and sustainable and renewable potential. It is on these conditions and these alone that an economic development strategy will be credible and have a bright future. Oil and diamonds will not always be in demand in the economy, the authoritarian policy of colonialism cannot go on, nor can the industrial exploitation of Western businesses continue. Angola’s sudden and promising recovery has taught despairing Westerners an unexpected lesson. It is up to our Union, the European Union now to provide Angola with its experience and its support in writing new pages in its common and turbulent history. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I shall therefore refer firstly to the new and auspicious political situation we are seeing in Angola, where finally, following decades of war, peace seems at last to be irreversible. We can only welcome this extremely positive fact for the expectations it creates for stability, governance and improvements to the living conditions of the Angolan people, for the doors that it is opening to consolidation, improvement and democratic life and for the positive effects that it could bring to the entire region.</p>
<p class="contents">Difficulties nevertheless remain and these could affect the course of the peace process itself. The expectations created by the signing of the memorandum of understanding are enormous and they must not be allowed to come to nothing. In addition to the inevitable trauma, the most pressing problems are to be seen at the humanitarian level, but also concern the much-needed reconstruction of the country, whose economy and infrastructures have been destroyed by the war.</p>
<p class="contents">All the figures are worrying and prove the impossibility of Angola alone providing an appropriate and timely response. This is why I shall focus on some guidelines which I believe are crucial at this time: the need for the international community and, therefore, the European Union, to consider humanitarian aid to Angola as a priority, especially consignments of food, clothing and medicines, as well as the urgent need to supply such aid more rapidly and effectively; the urgent need to supply tools and seeds to enable people to grow crops and to reduce, in a short space of time, the current total dependence on food aid; specific support for the resettlement of displaced populations, specifically with aid for the rebuilding of basic infra-structures; and, as a corollary, clear and committed adherence to the two Conference of Donors phases recommended by the Angolan authorities. Angola expects a great deal from as and we must really not fail these expectations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We must attach priority to the issue of Angola. First of all, in humanitarian terms, we are still facing an enormous emergency. This must be followed up at the political level, given that the peace that is opening up for Angola could make this huge Portuguese-speaking country a major factor for stability in a very troubled region, from Central to Southern Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what all of us in the European Union, both the bodies of the Union and the Member States, must work towards. We must take action to strengthen factors for trust.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now, however, facing a clear humanitarian emergency. We cannot allow the war to continue to kill in Angola, as a result of our indifference or of our slowness, when the weapons fell silent some months ago, thanks to the Angolans’ efforts to achieve a rapprochement.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like, in the little time I have left, to draw your attention briefly to the unusual tragedy of the two Portuguese children who have disappeared and to explain the amendment that we tabled on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had the opportunity to address the issue with the Angolan authorities; the difficulty of the situation was explained to us, which we understand, given the state of war that the country was in a while ago, but we cannot allow this issue to drop out of sight.</p>
<p class="contents">We were told that official investigations are now underway and we wish to express our confidence that these investigations will finally bring to light what happened in that barbaric attack in November last year and what has happened to the Portuguese children and, in the event that they are still alive, as their families believe, that they will be reunited with them.</p>
<p class="contents">I also ask for the support of the House on this point, which is of particular importance to the Portuguese public. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From day to day, images of starving people and dying children are winging their way around the world. According to the information at my disposal, 500 000 people – half a million – are in immediate danger of death. What this makes clear is that humanitarian aid, especially food supplies, is second only to the ending of the war as a matter of priority.</p>
<p class="contents">If the country is to be put on a stable footing, though, this will of course presuppose that the destruction of its infrastructure be ended. The consequences of the depopulation that was enforced in order to cut UNITA off from its supply lines must be dealt with. Emergency aid is a prime necessity before any process of political consolidation can be set in motion, and the establishment of peace and the conditions for successful elections both presuppose and require that this be done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In response to the signing of the peace agreement between the government and UNITA and to an appeal for assistance in addressing the humanitarian situation, the Commission drew up an action plan for Angola to support the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">The action plan identifies a financial package of EUR 125m aimed at addressing the most pressing concerns at this stage, including emergency relief, food aid and food security, reintegration and resettlement of refugees and displaced persons, and de-mining operations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission provides substantial humanitarian support to reduce the suffering of the displaced populations in Angola. The Commission urges the government to take further measures to facilitate delivery of emergency relief assistance. The Commission encourages the government to prioritise the extension of the assistance to the entire territory in its discussions with UNITA.</p>
<p class="contents">We are conscious of the fact that the presence of land- and anti-personnel mines is an enormous obstacle in terms of humanitarian access, resettlement and rehabilitation. Increased security on the ground will make it possible for the Commission to implement, through specialised organisations, the substantial funding already earmarked for de-mining operations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers the demobilisation of UNITA and the Angolan armed forces troops a vital element in the peace process and in this context is considering with other partners support for the Angola Demobilisation and Reintegration Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">To ensure lasting peace, the government should improve the democratic conditions in Angola, especially promoting improvements in the human rights situation and freedom of the press. These, together with freedom of movement, reform of constitutional and electoral laws and a proper census of the population, will be essential to allow free and fair elections to take place.</p>
<p class="contents">Continued efforts to allow UNITA time and space to reorganise and become a viable political force are encouraged.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission urges both parties to consult all segments of Angolan civil society, including the churches, with a view to national reconciliation and lasting peace.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission stands ready to support the organisation of elections as soon as conditions on the ground allow.</p>
<p class="contents">We underline that interventions to promote good governance will have high priority at all stages in the support strategy for Angola. We propose to contribute in particular to the reinforcement of the judicial sector and to the reform of administration and public finances.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community’s future strategy for Angola under the 9th EDF is currently under discussion with the government and civil society. That strategy will establish links between relief, rehabilitation and development. Substantial funding will be earmarked to support resettlement, including micro-projects and the re-establishment of agricultural production and livestock breeding in order to provide a boost to the socio-economic recovery of war-affected zones, particularly in the Central Highlands.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community will continue to provide support for health and education, as well as capacity-building to the provincial administrations, which should ultimately take responsibility for establishing and maintaining social structures and systems.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the government’s intention to organise an international conference for the reconstruction of the country and trusts that the views of all groups of society will be reflected in the reconstruction plan to be presented. The Commission has offered to cooperate in the preparation of this international conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
