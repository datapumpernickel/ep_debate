<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cederschiöld (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, we all know that euro notes and coins are to be brought into circulation on 1 January of next year. Twelve of the national currencies of the Member States are to disappear and be successively replaced by the new common currency. The names of Mr Kohl and Mr Delors ought to be mentioned in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">It is odd that not all Member States have yet realised that the internal market cannot be fully efficient in the long term if it is fragmented in terms of a number of different national currencies. We are all familiar with the advantages of the single currency, that is to say economic and monetary cooperation. The Europe-wide use of the euro has already brought economic stability and a variety of other advantages. It has encouraged economic growth, increased consumption and investment and led to the creation of new jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the single currency will stimulate increased mobility to the extent of leading to a completely new Europe in ten years’ time. With the euro, European integration is taking a giant step forward. The euro will become one of the most significant and most important currencies in international trade. In a few years’ time, 300 million people will have this new national currency which will be used outside the EU as commonly as the dollar is today and with which it will be possible to make payments directly, with no need for currency conversion. The euro is already an international reserve and transaction currency and will in future be so to a much greater extent.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance and significance which the euro will acquire as an international currency will, unfortunately, also mean that it will become attractive to organised counterfeiting organisations. There is evermore sophisticated equipment available for such activity, which means that counterfeiting is nowadays much less complex than it used to be. Against that background, it is important to have comprehensive and effective protection against counterfeiting in place in good time before the euro comes into circulation.</p>
<p class="contents">There will be huge scope for disseminating the euro, extending beyond all frontiers, both within the European Union and between the EU and the outside world. Hence, the arrangements for protecting the euro against counterfeiting must take this new dimension into account and also be equipped with a legal framework involving all the EU Member States, institutions and bodies and also relevant international organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">The three legislative proposals for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting with which this report is concerned are mutually complementary. Unfortunately, they have their legal bases in two different pillars, the first and the third. In the long run, it would be desirable if measures based upon Article 29 of the EU Treaty could be included in Title IV of the EC Treaty so that appropriate decisions for the settlement of issues for which other kinds of measures are unsuitable could be adopted in a unitary fashion.</p>
<p class="contents">The first proposal is an Initiative by the Government of the French Republic and is based on Title VI of the EC Treaty. It is concerned, then, with protection under criminal law and with Europol units having to receive the information and intelligence they need in order to perform their tasks. The amendments are largely aimed at incorporating wordings that have been forgotten about and left out, as well as at correcting a number of unclear terminological and other points.</p>
<p class="contents">The second legislative proposal, which in a way is more interesting, contains the Council’s guidelines on the protection of the euro against counterfeiting and is based on Article 123(4) of the EC Treaty. This legal basis enables the scope of the Regulation to be extended only to those Member States which have adopted the euro as a single currency. The proposal is based on the establishment of a system for the exchange of information and for cooperation and mutual assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">My most important amendments are about the necessity of having a Counterfeiting Analysis Centre at EU level and a national centre in each Member State. The advisability of setting up a permanent European Technical and Scientific Centre for the analysis and the classification of counterfeit coins is also referred to and, especially, the need for entities engaged in the daily handling of notes and coins for their clients to carry out suitable checks on the authenticity of these. Otherwise, it is citizens who are affected, and the latter are completely unprotected when they receive counterfeit coins and notes. There is no way in which they can offset such a loss anywhere else.</p>
<p class="contents">How can citizens be expected to carry detection equipment the same size as a large PC around with them? Even if someone is prepared to pay for the equipment – which does not cost a great amount, but costs approximately the same as a PC – it is not practically possible. I therefore think it is much more appropriate for notes and coins to be analysed before they leave the exchange entity. This is a position which Parliament definitely ought to adopt in order to protect people.</p>
<p class="contents">The third legislative proposal is based on Article 308 of the EC Treaty and is aimed at taking care of those Member States which have not adopted the single currency, namely Great Britain, Denmark and Sweden. In fact, they too must of course be covered by the security regulation we are now developing. Otherwise, this will not work. I am convinced that people in these countries realise that they too must participate in these decisions. They must also realise, however, that, if they are not members of the club, they cannot participate in the decisions on the same conditions as the members. However, those who adopt the euro can be party to decisions on the same conditions as other members. Those who do not adopt the euro do not, unfortunately, have the same influence.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision as to whether or not to adopt the euro is one requiring strength, and on this point I would call upon my own country, Sweden, to try to summon up the strength to take this decision as quickly as possible. It is about nothing other than political leadership. For example, we can draw a comparison with France which, at the time of approving the Maastricht Treaty, approved the latter with a smaller majority than Sweden. In spite of this, France nonetheless managed to take the decision it did. The fact that Sweden, in contrast, did not is something I deeply regret.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to conclude by stating that the proposals in the Council’s guidelines are aimed at guaranteeing effective protection of the euro, and I therefore welcome the proposal in its entirety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hernández Mollar (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Thank you, Mr President. The reason that I am speaking is purely to support and highlight, if possible, essential elements expressed by the rapporteur of this report, our colleague Charlotte Cederschiöld, whom I congratulate for her rigorous and excellent work.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to start by pointing out what a revolution it is going to be when the euro appears on 1 January of next year. The euro is going to be the ultimate symbol of European identity, and along with the yen and the dollar it will be one of the guiding currencies that will be used not only in Europe but also, as our colleague said, on a global scale. It will be the cornerstone on which to build a political union.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite all this, as the euro takes the form of a note or coin, there is obviously the very real risk that there will be attempts to counterfeit it, and as a result, prevention policies are essential. With this objective in mind, we need to work thoroughly on the need to train those who will be working daily with the currency, through courses and other measures, especially banks and bureaux de change, so that they are familiarised with the euro. They are going to be the key players in detecting counterfeit currency.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, and given that the legislative proposals that we are examining today aim to regulate this matter, it is essential both that we have an effective system of police and customs cooperation and that we establish a global information system that includes identifying counterfeit notes, collecting them and sending them to centres that study the method of counterfeiting, the paper used, the ink, the amount counterfeited, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would also like to emphasise the importance of effective criminal protection in order to remove any trace of counterfeiting.</p>
<p class="contents">As I do not wish to dwell on fundamental issues that have already been discussed by Mrs Cederschiöld, such as the inconvenience and confusion caused by having legal instruments that are dependent on different pillars in order to defend the same objective, which is combating the counterfeiting of the euro- I am going to focus on two or three matters that I feel are important. One is the reference made by Amendment No 23, unlike the Regulation, which does not allude to it at all, to a counterfeit currency database. I think that this is something that would increase the efficiency and accuracy of the battle against counterfeiting.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the status of the European Technical and Scientific Centre, which as established in Article 5 of the proposal for a regulation, will channel the fight against the counterfeiting of coins, I would like to stress the need to protect its independence from the Paris Mint from the start, as set out in Amendments Nos 20 and 26. The functional link of this body should be solely with the European institutions and under no circumstances with a national institution.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Amendment No 27 adds to the original text of the Regulation the idea that I expressed at the start of my speech, which is the key role that those who work with money should play in the battle against counterfeiting of the euro. It is important that they be obliged not only to withdraw from circulation any notes and coins whose authenticity is questionable, but also to check for authenticity themselves. We are, of course, aware of the suspicions that this requirement could give rise to, as it would require considerable investment in tools, machines and items to ensure that the money is legal, but it is essential from the point of view of protecting citizens. It is also a guarantee that the money distributed by these bodies will be authentic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course the circulation of the euro will have both positive and negative impacts. The positive is that it will be a physical recognition of the Union moving together closely when it actually benefits individual Member States. The negative aspect of course is that a new currency is open to abuse and to undermining by the expert counterfeiters that we have already heard of.</p>
<p class="contents">The euro is of enormous importance in the world markets, and therefore it is vital that we move to take protective measures to prevent counterfeiting. I am pleased that Mrs Cederschiöld makes such recommendations in her report and I personally and my group support these. It is worth noting, on the obligation to make checks at banks and bureaux de change, that she encourages close cooperation between Member States, the European Central Bank, national central banks, Europol and, when established, Eurojust. Also, she makes important reference to previous decisions on increasing criminal penalties, and calls for the harmonising of criminal charges and penalties.</p>
<p class="contents">It is absolutely essential that we leave no hiding-place for criminals, who can move very quickly with their information and their expertise from one Member State to another. It is also essential to pool and centralise information, and expert analysis when such counterfeiting comes to light. Technical assistance to facilitate the coordination of investigations is also needed if we are to track down these criminals across the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally, I applaud her recommendations to improve and facilitate cooperation between investigative and prosecuting bodies of the Member States, and that every Member State should recognise the principle of previous convictions. Whether in the EURO zone or not, I maintain that every citizen within the European Union has much to gain from a stable currency and a currency that can withstand the threats from the counterfeiters. Therefore I am extremely pleased to congratulate Mrs Cederschiöld on her report and the recommendations contained therein. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berthu (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, in order to protect the euro against counterfeiting, we are looking this evening at a series of technical measures which, however interesting they may be, will not solve the problem. In fact, they even dispose of a crucial problem, which is of a political nature, and which the European Parliament does not seem willing to resolve. I shall therefore take it upon myself to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Once the euro has actually been introduced into circulation, there will be a high risk of counterfeiting, particularly because of the decision that was taken to launch from scratch an entirely new currency which will cause all citizens to lose their points of reference. It may have been designed to do exactly that. Once citizens have lost their points of reference, there is a high risk that they will accept counterfeit euros, believing that they are the real thing. The consequences of this confusion will be made worse by the high face value of some notes, of EUR 100, 200 and 500. Yet, who is going to pay the price for this huge risk? The most vulnerable, the most fragile, those who are least well-informed, small businesses, micro-businesses who may find themselves bearing the cost of worthless, forged notes that they have accepted by mistake.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation is unacceptable – all the more so because it is the same people who are being asked to bear the often very substantial costs of changing over to the euro and who will receive absolutely no financial compensation. It is, therefore, unacceptable that we today continue to pretend that these costs do not exist and to implicitly accept that they are to be borne by the most vulnerable people.</p>
<p class="contents">We are asking the national and European authorities not to shirk their responsibilities. We are asking them to give citizens a guarantee that they will be reimbursed if they accept a forged note by mistake, at least during a transitional period. Otherwise, then, we should provide small businesses with free detectors for forged banknotes. Some will say to me that we do not have the money to do that. I shall reply that we should have thought of this before. We must now shoulder the responsibility, in other words, to postpone the changeover to coins and notes until next January – would it matter after everything we have been through? This would, in any case, be desirable for several other reasons. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Coelho (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over a year ago, on 16 February, the European Parliament considered the problem of counterfeiting of the euro, at the time within the context of a common penal framework. It was our fellow Member, Mrs Cederschiöld, with her skill and rigour, who drafted the report then and opened our debate on the matter. She said that we cannot allow counterfeiting to undermine our single currency. This statement is still valid one year later and sums up the fundamental issue: the security of our currency.</p>
<p class="contents">We have all spoken here of the euro’s importance for our Union, of its economic importance as a complement to the establishment of a genuine economic area without internal borders, of its importance as a mechanism that has contributed to budgetary discipline and to the transparency of the Member States’ public accounts and also of its political value as a symbol of the European integration that we are developing, taking forwards and consolidating on a daily basis. Therefore, for all of these reasons, the security of our currency is extremely important. In addition, we know that the currency’s security is also tied up with its stability and its exchange rate, but the approach we are considering today is that of protection against counterfeiting. If things do not go well, however, with the other approach, there is all the more reason now not to neglect this fight and to increase our precautions.</p>
<p class="contents">In her report, Mrs Cederschiöld quite rightly emphasises the worldwide importance of the new currency and the undeniable fact that it whets criminal appetites. She states that “the euro will be in open competition with the dollar for the title of the world’s most counterfeited currency”. I am sure that Mrs Cederschiöld will agree with me when I say that this is not the competition against the dollar that we wish to win. We are aware that the system will be particularly vulnerable during the transitional period, in which the new European currency and the old currencies will be coexisting. Lack of understanding, unfamiliarity and the obligation on the banks to promote currency exchange will encourage the counterfeiting of both the euro and national currencies. We must also fight against swindling and confidence tricks. We must provide more and better information, especially in my country, Portugal, where surveys show disturbingly high percentages of people not understanding the euro. We have seen examples of the educational contribution made by Catholic priests, particularly in the regions: the contribution of the Church and of the local and regional press must be encouraged and supported. I also agree with the approach adopted by the Commission in its communication, and with the four aspects that have been identified: training, an information system – cooperation, specifically with Europol, OLAF and the European Central Bank – and protection under criminal law.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I shall say once again that I do not share the reservations about the coins having national faces. I think that the increased risk will be compensated for by a greater sense of belonging and of identification, and will also provide a political response to those who are always quick to criticise excessive standardisation. Congratulations, Mrs Cederschiöld! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ford (PSE).</span></span>   – I apologise to Mrs Cederschiöld for mistiming my arrival and arriving after much of the debate. We had an opportunity in the committee for me to have an exchange of views with Mrs Cederschiöld about her report. I would like to congratulate her on the overall thrust of the report. My concerns are twofold, however. First, I am concerned about the size of the larger notes, particularly the five hundred euro note that is going to be issued, which is far larger than the largest note in common use in the United States, in the United Kingdom and in Japan.</p>
<p class="contents">It obviously makes it attractive for counterfeiters, if they are going to counterfeit notes, to counterfeit large denomination notes, rather than smaller denomination notes and I am slightly concerned that this very large note will, if you want, make the euro the counterfeiter's currency of choice. Secondly, at the same time, of course, it will enable those people engaged in money laundering – I know this is not a report on money laundering, but it is a connected issue – to also move their ill-gotten gains around fairly easily and fairly simply. The amount of money that can be put into a small suitcase will be roughly ten times larger than it would have been if we had restricted the currency to smaller notes.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a threat and an opportunity with the introduction of the euro. Firstly the threat is the counterfeiting and clearly, if that happens, it will drive people away from the euro, will have dire consequences for its use around the world if people are badly stung by that, but secondly, we have an opportunity at this period of time to actually catch people engaged in money laundering, as they make the change. We do not have, or we do not apparently have in place, any mechanism across the European Union to try and take advantage of that opportunity, or to try and deter at the point of introduction of the euro the threat of counterfeiting. It is all very well having something up and running later, but if I was organised crime, the time which I would be trying to engage in counterfeiting on a large scale would be around the period of introduction of the euro when you are going to have four hundred million people in the European Union and billions of people around the world who have never been familiar with the notes themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">So I think that there is a threat there and I hope that the Commission and the European Central Bank, although it is probably too late to consider whether to issue a five hundred euro note, will actually consider whether they should issue it at the beginning of the process when there are so many dangers attached to it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Obviously, numerous preparations still need to be made and it has been mentioned, not for the first time, that the European Parliament is tackling this. The European Parliament has dealt with the preparations and the necessary steps right from the start.</p>
<p class="contents">This report deals with the Commission initiative and the French initiative on the protection of the euro against counterfeiting. I should like, on the Commission’s behalf, to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work and to report that the Commission will be happy to include any addenda proposed by the European Parliament. I should also like to stress that the regulation is the pivotal and central point of a comprehensive procedure to protect the euro against counterfeiting. I should like to remind you that the Commission has submitted various proposals since its communication in July 1998. The regulation before us stipulates in particular – I do not intend to go through the whole thing, I just want to mention a few points – that exchanges of information on any counterfeit euro notes and coins discovered will be centralised and regulated. Collaboration and mutual assistance between the various players involved at Member State level and the institutions and bodies at European and international level is clearly regulated, as are collaboration with third countries and the obligations incumbent upon credit institutions. I should like at this point to highlight once again the importance of Article 6 of the regulation, namely the obligation to withdraw from circulation any banknotes which have been identified as counterfeit or which need to be tested and to pass them to the appropriate agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, of course, particularly important, in the light of the time frame which we are discussing, that the regulation be adopted as quickly as possible and I hope that it will be adopted before the end of the Swedish Presidency, because preparations need to be made as quickly as possible. This is the credo which the Commission is passing on to small- and medium-sized enterprises and consumers. Any preparations which can be completed today will mean less worry and stress tomorrow and will make the whole project that much safer.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission intends to take an active part in the subsequent implementation of the regulation. This applies in particular to Article 7 dealing with collaboration between the Member States, the Commission and the European Central Bank and with Interpol. An advisory committee has been set up to help the Commission here.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to remind you that this regulation is not the only important measure to protect the euro against counterfeiting. Various additional instruments have already been adopted or are currently being prepared. For example, a framework resolution relating to criminal law was adopted on 29 May. I should also like to mention another measure which is currently being prepared and which the Commission will adopt in a few weeks’ time, namely a multiannual programme to provide training, technical assistance and exchanges for officials in order to protect the euro against counterfeiting. The delightfully named PERIKLES programme will also be of considerable importance.</p>
<p class="contents">The euro is indeed an historic milestone on the path towards integration and it offers huge potential for further economic development. Of course we always highlight the opportunities here but we do not underestimate the risks attached to the date set for the physical introduction of the euro. We are not underestimating the problems, we are tackling them. I should like to thank the European Parliament for its support; it just goes to show that we are all working to make this project a huge success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
