<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lehne </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this really is a very important report. In recent years Parliament has adopted various decisions, particularly in resolutions on budgetary matters, which have repeatedly stressed that this House would like to see a statute for parliamentary assistants to Members.</p>
<p class="contents">We all remember the report by the Court of Auditors which came before us a few months ago, and which was by no means uncritical – I am choosing my words carefully – of the remuneration of assistants. I accordingly believe that it is high time that the issues of assistants' pay and their conditions of employment were sorted out one way or another. However, and this is the important point, we need to approach this in a serious and rational manner. Although the proposal that we are now considering has been presented by the European Commission, it was not actually prepared by the Commission, but by European Parliament officials. It was entrusted to the President of the Commission by the President of Parliament with a request to adopt it. I have to say that I find this proposal unacceptable in the form we have before us.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal essentially provides for the conditions of employment of other servants to be included in a new Article 78, the gist of which is that parliamentary assistants are categorised as other servants of the European Union, and furthermore that the details of the conditions of employment should be laid down in general administrative provisions to be enacted by Parliament itself. That is the heart of the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The legal basis of the Staff Regulations and the conditions of employment of other servants, that is to say the Merger Treaty, does not provide for an enabling regulation for Parliament. For that reason I have always been critical of this Commission proposal, or rather the proposal prepared by Parliament's administration, because it does not deal with the question of implementing regulations. Nor am I the only one of this opinion: in its judgment of 7 May 1992, the European Court of Justice made exactly the same point. The Court of Justice then ruled, and I am quoting now, that: ‘The general implementing provisions issued under the Staff Regulations may lay down criteria by which the administration should be guided in exercising its discretion or to clarify the meaning of unclear provisions of the Staff Regulations. They may not, however, indirectly limit the scope of the Staff Regulations by restating in more precise terms an already clear provision of those regulations". In plain English, that means that implementing regulations may not conflict with the spirit of the Staff Regulations. If they do, they are invalid and should be disregarded. They do not have the same legal force as the Staff Regulations themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">On this basis, the European Court of Auditors stated the following in a report to the Council of Ministers, prepared at the request of the Council, in the form of an opinion on this Commission proposal: ‘In the present case, general implementing provisions which preclude the application of normal unambiguous provisions of the Staff Regulations, particularly with regard to length of service, for a particular category of auxiliary staff, may be regarded as unlawful and their application could be challenged in an action against a particular case decision". In other words, the Court of Auditors totally agrees with your rapporteur and with the European Court of Justice that if we adopt the Commission proposal, the implementing regulations will be thrown back at us and in the end only the provisions of the Staff Regulations for officials and other servants will apply. This will make it impossible to take account of the special conditions of employment of parliamentary assistants. The result will then quite simply be – and I am estimating that there are 2 000 parliamentary assistants – 2 000 additional European Parliament officials. I think that demonstrates a lack of responsibility and is contrary to the spirit of what we are trying to achieve here.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I originally proposed to the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights that the legal basis should be changed, and that a statute for assistants should instead be prepared, which would have formed an annex to the Statute for Members of the European Parliament and which would have taken as its legal basis the provisions of Article 190 of the Treaty of Amsterdam. For tactical reasons, the Legal Affairs Committee rejected this proposal so as keep the Council's decision making on the Statute for Members of the European Parliament and on the statute for assistants separate from each other.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this will mean that provisions that are supposed to be the subject of contracts between assistants, Members and of course Parliament's administration will then have to be incorporated in the statute itself, or to be precise in the Commission proposal itself. This is what I proposed in a second report to the Legal Affairs Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The only legally watertight alternative which might also be possible would be to dispense with a statute for assistants altogether and arrange instead for the Quaestors or the Bureau to decide in what circumstances a secretarial allowance could still be granted, and also to include issues such as social security obligations and an appropriate level of remuneration in these arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">The Legal Affairs Committee was then faced with a very close vote. My proposal initially attracted support, but the Commission draft ultimately won the day, so that the report which I am presenting on behalf of the Legal Committee contains various contradictions and I as rapporteur cannot support what was agreed in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason I have today tabled a number of amendments on behalf of my group which reflect the draft report which I originally presented to the Legal Affairs Committee, and I urge the House to adopt these. I fear that if we were to adopt the Commission proposal in the form presented to us, it would not be acceptable to the Council of Ministers, in view of the Council's existing reservations in the light of the judgment of the European Court of Justice which I have quoted, and because of the second report of the Court of Auditors. We would therefore be reaching a sort of token decision along these lines: Parliament wants a statute for assistants but is adopting an unrealistic text in the knowledge that the Council will ultimately reject it. This would not help anyone, neither the assistants themselves nor the Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">For this simple reason I would urge the House to adopt the original draft report presented to the Legal Affairs Committee and not the Commission proposal. If this fails and there is not a majority in favour of my proposal tomorrow, I will feel obliged, in the interests of achieving a worthwhile outcome, to request referral back to the Legal Affairs Committee, or, if there is absolutely no other way, to reject this version of the report, because I personally neither want nor feel able to take responsibility for something that I am convinced is wrong, and is to all intents and purposes a token gesture that cannot possibly solve the problems we face in this area.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Gebhardt </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have to say that the rapporteur's sharp criticism of the Commission should not be taken to reflect the views of the committee. I wanted to correct that impression immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">Our work on the statute for assistants to Members of the European Parliament has been difficult and has been made even more difficult by the strident background music which has accompanied it. Nevertheless, we managed to find a way to give our assistants fair conditions of employment including social security arrangements, whilst preserving the autonomy of the European Parliament. The Group of the Party of European Socialists smoothed the path with its proposals. We should now adopt these proposals by a clear majority in the interests of our closest confidants.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments tabled by my group include two additional elements. Firstly, taking the Commission proposal as a basis, we have made provision to regulate the employment relationship between Members and their assistants. This should secure the Council approval which we need. The Council cannot have any objections if we call for general conditions of employment including recruitment, dismissal, remuneration and social security to be the subject of a contract. Nor can it have any objections to a requirement that professional confidentiality and a ban on unauthorised second jobs including lobbying should form part of the contractual conditions of employment. The prohibition of discrimination against citizens of third countries makes sense in view of the forthcoming enlargement of the Union, and the Council will certainly not reject the statute on those grounds.</p>
<p class="contents">The autonomy of Parliament to make decisions on its own affairs will be guaranteed by the second part of our proposal. I have in mind the general implementing provisions that Parliament will adopt itself, which will lay down the details of contracts of employment on the basis of a proposal from the relevant committee. This will also enable us to accommodate many of the rapporteur's proposals without the risk that the Council will object to a particular provision and will therefore drop the whole statute.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention two points which I feel particularly strongly about. The first one is short and simple. Any statute that does not provide our assistants with the best social protection available, including sickness and pensions schemes, should go straight into the waste‐paper bin. It is not worth the paper it is written on.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is also extremely important: our assistants' remuneration. They must be paid fairly and in line with their performance. After all, we are not rewarding certificates and diplomas, but the quality of the work done. So we do not want a fixed scale based on certificates, professional qualifications and officials' grades. What we need is a high degree of flexibility in drawing up contracts as employers, and also flexibility as regards remuneration.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also another point that we have already covered in connection with the Statute for Members of the European Parliament. The contractually agreed remuneration should be transferred from the European Parliament direct to assistants' accounts. This provides us with some degree of protection against the constant insinuations we have heard over the last few days that Members are a pack of thieves who exploit their assistants and use phantom posts to line their own pockets.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for your attention. I hope that on Thursday you will support my group and myself by voting to give our assistants social security and to preserve the European Parliament's autonomy.</p>

Parliament has not come out of it very well, and I should like to say that we regard the outcome of the votes in committee as unsatisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">For our part, we believe that the Commission's proposal was a good starting‐point, so we have tabled one or two minor amendments clarifying in which cases the rules proposed by the Commission will apply. We maintain that it should be made clear which assistants will be covered, and we have introduced a time‐limit. A majority of the group is also willing to approve the system of remuneration proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, it is very important that we should have a decision on this tomorrow. We cannot allow it to be sent back to committee. I find the rapporteur's suggestion that that is what should happen if his position is not accepted most undemocratic. I would urge a majority of the House to vote in favour of the proposal, so as to allow the introduction of a satisfactory system before all the new assistants arrive to take up their positions in the newly‐elected Parliament. This lends urgency to the situation, and I would thank the Commission for everything it has done.</p>

<p class="contents">The report by Mr Lehne works towards this and has some positive aspects that deserve recognition, particularly all those that refer to conditions of employment, resolving disputes, and tax liability. But in other respects, it may be that the situation we have now is fairer than that envisaged in the regulation. This would indeed be the case if some of the amendments tabled were approved, in particular the extensive and excessively detailed Amendment No 38 that covers everything relating to the grading of assistants, the corresponding remuneration systems and the unequal social security schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">The excessive attention to detail in this amendment leaves very little room for transitional situations. I believe that we should opt for a more flexible approach than the one proposed in Mr Lehne"s report, yet without ignoring assistants" rights and whilst fulfilling the obligation to provide contracts of employment with the relevant legal certainty. We acknowledge the rapporteur"s worthy efforts but on certain aspects we do not agree with him.</p>

So maybe it is not such a bad thing that we are now conducting this debate so close to the witching hour. Let me be brief: on the fundamental issues I totally support our rapporteur and I am therefore pleased that he is tabling his own amendments again, and I call on the House to vote for these amendments in the interests of our assistants.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with the two previous speakers that we urgently need to adopt any text that puts a stop to the legal uncertainty under which our assistants currently have to work. We cannot let things get to the point where our assistants feel obliged to take the European Parliament to the European Ombudsman because we are to blame for the continuing legal uncertainty they face. I hope it does not come to that, and from what I have heard there is a good chance that it will not.</p>

<p class="contents">Be that as it may, it unfortunately seems that Mr Lehne's initiative is necessary as regards both remuneration and social protection for our assistants. However, one simple and fundamental principle underlying any social doctrine is that every person has the right to fair pay in return for their work. It appears that that has not been the case and that Parliament, like the Commission, has been forced to come to terms with this. Nevertheless, I feel that Mr Lehne's draft goes into far too much detail on contractual relations and that, to coin a phrase, it ultimately tries to ‘statutify' the position of our assistants too much.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the Commission proposal has the advantage of a degree of flexibility and certainty, and it also has the advantage of having to some extent proved its worth in practice, <span class="italic">mutatis mutandis</span> , with the system for assistants to parliamentary groups, which is fairly similar to the Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, it seems to me that the most important thing is that the choice of assistants – their qualifications, their skills and so on – should be a matter for individual Members of Parliament, who should be at liberty to select their own assistants and agree working arrangements with them.</p>

Consequently, our line in tomorrow's vote will be to stress the crucial nature of the text being adopted: I mean to say that it is essential to lay down certain general provisions, on which to base specific rules governing various matters of a contractual nature. But these general provisions, based on what we regard as a positive Commission proposal, must clarify the situation once and for all. Amendment No 31 in particular – which we recommend for adoption – is both necessary and important: assistants must enjoy equal treatment. They must be paid directly by Parliament, whilst obviously maintaining – or rather strengthening – their links with the Member or Members for whom they work. In this way, transparency and propriety will be ensured.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament must tackle this issue! It should have done so long ago, and must now do so boldly. The battle we are waging here is for transparency and propriety, not only for the sake of assistants but for Parliament itself and its working methods, to ensure dignity and guaranteed rights for all.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Monti, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (IT)</span> Madam President, allow me to thank the rapporteur, Mr Lehne, and the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs for their in‐depth examination of the situation of parliamentary assistants and for their proposed solutions to improve it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission drew up its proposal at the request of the President of Parliament and on the basis of a European Parliament Bureau decision. The Commission drew on its right of initiative to determine a legal framework, albeit with respect for the prerogative of MEPs to establish autonomously the conditions and duration of recruitment and the level of remuneration of assistants.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the existing system, recruitment, pay and social insurance arrangements are agreed directly between an MEP's assistant and the Member appointing him or her. This has led to a wide variety of types of contract, which do not reflect the need for certain basic standards of equal treatment for all assistants. As was suggested by Parliament"s Bureau, the most appropriate way of avoiding the present difficulties appears to be to confer on MEPs' assistants the status of auxiliary staff, while their duties remain subject to specific rules dictated by the particular nature of their role.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, Members will remain free to select their own assistants, whilst allowing them to enjoy all the conditions of service applying to other staff, with the exception of the derogations provided for in the proposal for a regulation concerning their conditions of recruitment and remuneration and the duration of their contract.</p>
<p class="contents">The legal basis laid down in the Commission proposal allows Members to confer on their assistants the status of auxiliary staff. Once this legal basis has been adopted, the second step will be to define the specific parliamentary rules of procedure conferring on assistants conditions of service which are more suitable and equitable than the present ones.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, and also in order to ensure that the regulation is adopted as rapidly as possible, the Commission does not intend to modify its proposal. Amendments Nos 1, 4, 5 and 11 refer to the rules governing Members' expenses and allowances. Since these would change the provisions relating to officials and other servants, the Commission cannot accept them. The other amendments proposed in Mr Lehne's report aim to introduce into the regulation provisions which would have to be adopted by the Council, whereas the Commission would wish Parliament itself to adopt such provisions in its Rules of Procedure pursuant to Article 78a. These amendments are therefore unacceptable to the Commission.</p>
