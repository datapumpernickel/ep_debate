<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kauppi (PPE-DE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – Mr President, the two directives on supervision of the business of electronic money institutions are of the utmost importance to the development of e-commerce in the European Union. The aim has been to ensure the financial integrity of electronic money institutions and to help to cultivate an environment which fosters the development of this new means of payment.</p>
<p class="contents">Since many of the amendments proposed by the Parliament at first reading have been taken into account, I personally find that the view of the Parliament has been incorporated into the common position to a sufficient extent.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position reflects a compromise that has been reached after long negotiations in the Council. I am very aware of the fact that any amendments to the Council common position are likely to carry a real risk that the directive will be lost in conciliation, since the directive was, and continues to be, a very delicate compromise<span class="italic">.</span> As rapporteur I have tried to avoid pushing the directive to the conciliation procedure. I made a compromise proposal which, unfortunately, was not accepted in my political group. I do not think we could reach a conclusion that would serve the interests of all the parties concerned better than this common position does.</p>
<p class="contents">So the question for us as Members of the European Parliament is whether the proposed amendments are absolutely necessary compared to the potential risk that we do not get the supervisory framework at all. That would mean that the situation would remain uncertain from the consumers' point of view. I also want to remind colleagues that the amendments now proposed are new and therefore not based on the position Parliament took at first reading. They are all the amendments proposed by the ECB which were unanimously rejected by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also afraid that by emphasising the position of the European Central Bank in terms of monetary stability control we will cause difficult problems for the Member States which do not belong to the euro-zone. We have to keep in mind that the ECB has no right of veto<span class="italic"> </span>when it comes to European Community legislation<span class="italic">.</span> The monetary stability control of the ECB is based on the founding treaties of the EC and it should not be expanded through the provisions of EC directives.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 1 and 2 add the words “at par value” to the report. These additional words are not absolutely necessary as Article 3 sets out the terms for redeemability. In that article it is implicit that redeemability will happen at par value unless there are any reasonable charges which would be deducted from the par value. In this latter case the additional words would add nothing and be misleading to the consumer<span class="italic">.</span> Adding the words "at par value" to Article 3(1) may mislead the consumer since it is always possible to deduct the charges that are strictly necessary to carry out that operation.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the common position Member States may allow their competent authorities to waive the application of some or all of the provisions of the proposed directive. The waiver is possible in cases where the total amount of e-money issued is limited and where the e-money issued is accepted as a means of payments by only a limited number of undertakings. For example, the waiver could be used for university campus payment cards or for local transport systems. All these cases are also subject to a maximum storage amount of no more than EUR 150. In addition, the waived schemes will not benefit from the Single Market passport provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">The business of these limited national schemes cannot, from a financial stability viewpoint, be compared with the business of large e-money schemes or credit institutions. These limited schemes are not likely to have any spillover effects which could endanger financial market stability. Furthermore, these national limited schemes will not be unsupervised since the text requires any waiver to be subject to a separate decision by the supervisory authorities. Waived institutions would therefore always be registered and monitored by the supervisory authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 3, 4 and 5 reduce the scope of the waiver. It was clear in the Council that the price for having a directive was that a waiver would need to be included as an option. The Council was able to agree its common position only because it felt that a directive, which included a waiver but tightened regulation and permitted competition in a single market, was better than no directive at all. The Commission took a similar view. The sooner the directive is adopted and implemented, the sooner the improved regulation will take effect. If this still raises concerns in practice then the Article 11 review clause is available in reserve.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, at present there is no requirement for supervision of national e-money schemes. Therefore I do not believe that the European Parliament should adopt any amendments or there is a risk that the whole directive may be lost.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We therefore welcome the directive. We also welcome the fact that the non-banking sector will be subjected in this regard to a degree of banking supervision and that a minimum reserve requirement will be stipulated. We also welcome the fact that there are no exemptions to the change-back obligation.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has already indicated in her speech that, in spite of this basic affirmation of the direction and necessity of this directive, there were several motions for amendment and also several areas of discussion which went even further. Although the rapporteur belongs to my Group and I greatly value her commitment, I can nevertheless refute one thing for those delegates who have voiced objections and raised questions, namely the assertion that all the motions for amendment emanate from the European Central Bank. The European Central Bank cannot put forward amendments here, and it is a slight on all delegates who have submitted amendments to say that they have raised these issues and put forward these amendments (which, incidentally, were all adopted unanimously in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs) on behalf of third parties, and not on the basis of their own judgement and responsibility, simply because the report has been adopted unanimously together with the amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">What are we talking about here? These objections and questions, which do not run counter to the basic affirmation, concern four areas, basically relating to the question of whether the exemption provisions in Article 8 are too extensive and need to be more limited. They indeed need to be more limited, and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has taken up this issue, because the issue is in the area of what consequences these comprehensive exemption provisions will have for monitoring currency holdings. What effects will these comprehensive exemption provisions have on currency stability? Under certain circumstances, could the extensive nature of these exemption provisions not lead to circumventions, thus making the exception the rule?</p>
<p class="contents">This matter of monitoring currency holdings and stability and the matter of whether the exception would not thus become the rule have lead to the motions for amendment. Should the recommendation be adopted here without any amendments, I would ask that the Commission and the Council make use of what is in the directive and submit to Parliament a brief report on the consequences of the directives with any amendments which might be necessary. We will monitor this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must ensure, of course, that we in Europe also increase our competitiveness in this area vis-à-vis the United States. The introduction of the Euro will undoubtedly have a positive effect and will mean that the time has also come for us to establish uniform regulations to safeguard electronic commerce.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that electronic money will gain in importance, not just in commerce but also for consumers, particularly as the safety precautions on the Internet are regarded as inadequate and many are therefore hesitant to choose this option. It has to be said that electronic money in the European Union today enjoys rarity value rather than common usage. This must change! In this regard I must also point out that within the European Union these electronic payment systems also fail to work because interoperability is not guaranteed. I think that we should do something about this if we want to promote this means of payment in future. We must also do it in the interests of consumers, because costs will be saved.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the issuing of electronic money is not just about the simplification or safeguarding of payment processes, but in practice also concerns financial stability and the functioning of the payment systems. For this reason we need uniform regulations and we must realise that there will be particular fears if electronic money is issued not just against cash holdings or similar bank account holdings, but if e-money is given on credit. I think that this is the particular cause of the fear of instability instead of the stability which we want to ensure in the European Union. I therefore think that Article 8, which provides for an extension of the conditions for exemption, creates excessive discretionary powers. This could result in many electronic money institutions not being affected by the regulations applicable to credit institutions. This cannot and should not be the case and we all know that national issues of e-money can no longer be guaranteed today, if we look at the wording of Article 8c in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council’s amendments, which extend the scope of money, cannot be in the interest of the consumer. We need electronic money which is valid in a given environment. For this reason, it must cover the entire European area and not just a national area. I also think that institutions issuing e-money should be treated as equal. It is, of course, also important to consider the role of the European Central Bank – controlling the amount of money in circulation, for example. However, I am thinking primarily of consumers. Even if e-money can be used without limit on the Internet and for mobile telephones, this does not mean that it might not be counterproductive. For this reason I cannot support the new wording of Article 8c. I think that we must do everything possible to increase consumer confidence in the electronic money age and not to build consumer foundations which have no stability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Huhne (ELDR)</span></span>   –<span class="bold"> </span>Mr President, it is very regrettable that this common position, which has been put together with such care by the Council and which paid due respect to the Parliament's views at first reading, is now in the process of unravelling. I think we are going to lose a rather useful piece of legislation which would have put in place a necessary supervisory framework for one of the growth areas in financial services, namely the storage of cash on plastic cards and other forms of e-money.</p>
<p class="contents">The concerns which have been expressed by the European Central Bank, which have largely, but perhaps not fully, been taken on board, are coming out in a way which is likely to damage the potential for this business to develop. The concerns, particularly about the waiver, are misguided precisely because it would be very limited: it would be limited to only EUR 150 on any particular card. Every issuer would be supervised by national authorities and we know that the potential for money-supply growth caused by this sort of issuance would be extremely slight given the sort of schemes which are already operating in a number of Member States: for example, on university campuses a student may be able to use this piece of plastic to buy something in a bar, or in a canteen, or in the university bookshop.</p>
<p class="contents">The reality is that other Community central banks – notably the Swedish Riksbank, the Bank of England – do not have these concerns about money creation. If we look at the reality of the ECB's concerns over the last few years, we can see that there has not been a stable relationship between the money supply and the growth of nominal income. There has been a substantial variation in the velocity of circulation because of new developments within the financial services industry and this is merely another one of those. Therefore, in the years before the ECB took charge of euro-zone monetary policy, the Bundesbank itself was not able to respect the growth of its money supply targets.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have here is an attempt, when we see that a particular theory of monetary control is not working and does not accord with reality, to squeeze that reality back into the theory, to the detriment of the innovatory capacity of the Member States and of their financial systems. That is very regrettable. There are a lot of safeguards that the Commission has put in here that the Council has carefully discussed and I very much hope that we will fully support the Council common position on this matter.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since then there have been no more exchange rate risks and, in theory, the cost to consumers of transferring money across borders and of changing cash from one euro-zone currency to another should have reduced sharply.</p>
<p class="contents">There are obligations on financial institutions within the Union to substantially reduce the cost to consumers of transferring money from one euro-zone to the other. We may recall that the European Consumers' Association, which represents the consumers of the European Union, carried out an extensive survey of charges for cross-border payments only last year. The conclusion of that survey clearly demonstrated that costs for consumers of transferring money from one country to another in Europe are still too high.</p>
<p class="contents">With the forecast growth in electronic shopping over the next few years, heavy bank fees for money changes will be a serious disincentive for consumers to shop over the Internet. It is important that consumers are reassured in relation to electronic payments by establishing a legal framework. This survey also showed that consumers are still charged a lot more for making cross-border transfers than they are for making national transfers. This does not make sense. Euro currency has removed exchange rate risks and costs should have reduced substantially.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the directive on cross-border credit transfers which is now in force within the Union. In conclusion, I strongly believe that the new directive on cross-border transfers is good news for the consumers of the Union. It is also good news for financial institutions.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Skinner (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, like some of the previous speakers this evening, I am very pleased the Council came forward with this proposal. I do not think that it will be helped by the amendments being proposed inside this Parliament today and indeed in our committee. Whatever they say about having had to vote for the report as a whole at the end in the committee, it does not persuade me that some committee members did not also have concerns about the effects of some of those amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the opportunities of this nascent market, which we are now seeing emerge in the European Union, will be affected by some of the suggestions being made. Whereas money supply, of course, is of very direct interest to any central bank, there is in this case no direct inference that it will have the effect that everyone suggests it will have, i.e. that e-money will be anything other than a means of exchange, a redeemable voucher if you like or a mechanism expected to be involved in trade. Because of the very limits that Mr Huhne talked about, this is, of course, very closely controlled by the Council's proposed waiver and particularly by some of the sensible compromises suggested earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally, and the EPLP Group, could wholeheartedly support something like the compromise Amendment No 5 which Mrs Kauppi put forward in committee; but I am afraid if Amendments Nos 3 and 4 were adopted here in Parliament this week, we would see this legislation fall. Be in no doubt about that, this legislation would fall. I would worry very seriously about the motives of the people who would like to see this legislation fall, because any vacuum which would be created would be a vacuum the European Central Bank would find itself eased into. As an institution which has kept outside any form of regulation that is decided here or anywhere else, I find that a worrying idea.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me ask all comrades and colleagues around this room today to consider the effects of the amendments that could be passed this week, the damage they could cause, the lack of confidence that would surely emerge and the damage it would do to this nascent market.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Mr President, may I begin by expressing the heartfelt thanks of the Commission for the work that has been done by Mrs Kauppi. We are most appreciative of that work and of her report because it concerns a matter which is of importance, not so much to governments, but in particular to the private citizens of the European Union, as Mrs Randzio-Plath said a little while ago. May I also express the appreciation of the European Commission for the continuing support from this Parliament for the e-money initiative and, indeed, for all the Commission's e-commerce initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has noticed the high level of cooperation between Parliament, Council and Commission in reaching an early agreement on the e-money proposals. As evidence thereof perhaps I may cite the high number of amendments put forward by Parliament, amendments which were then accepted by the Council and by the Commission. We certainly have taken due cognisance of the wishes expressed by this Parliament, and we have done our best to integrate them in the proposals that are now in front of you, as noted by Mr Huhne.</p>
<p class="contents">May I, however, express the Commission's disappointment that Mrs Kauppi's initial report could not be accepted. That report recognised the high level of cooperation between Council, Commission and Parliament as well as the delicate nature of the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation now to the specific amendments, I should like to say the following. The first two that deal with redeemability at par value introduce unnecessary legal uncertainty into the text. The provision on redeemability, which was proposed by this Parliament at the first reading – a first reading which took place almost a year ago – and was accepted by the Council, is clear. It means that e-money must be redeemed for cash on request minus any deductions for legitimate costs in carrying out the transactions. It seems to me that is a perfectly reasonable position.</p>
<p class="contents">The recognition of allowing the deduction of reasonable costs conflicts with an obligation to redeem at par value. On this basis, and for this reason, I cannot regrettably accept the first two amendments. Amendments Nos 3 and 4 propose substantially to limit the circumstances in which Member States may waive the application of some or all of the provisions of the directive to certain limited electronic money schemes; here I am concerned because of a misunderstanding on the waiver provisions. These provisions are optional, they are limited in their application to specific identifiable schemes and they are on a case by case basis.</p>
<p class="contents">May I add that schemes which benefit from any waiver will not benefit from the European passport. They will continue to be credit institutions and therefore fall within the monetary control of the European Central Bank in the euro-zone. Therefore, the justification for their deletion on the basis of monetary policy concerns is unfounded. They continue to report to the competent authorities on a periodic basis.</p>
<p class="contents">While on this point, I should like to say that I am a little intrigued by questions put and remarks made by Members of this Parliament on monetary stability and monetary supply. As stated by Mr Skinner, under the e-money procedure the customer first pays in his money and then gets the equivalent amount of electronic money. In other words, in the whole process not an iota of money is created. Therefore considerations of monetary supply or monetary stability – as one Member put it, e-money as a vector of credit – simply do not apply. E-money does not mean that money is created. It means that money is paid into an institution and received in another form, but it is the same amount of money. Therefore I should like to lay these apprehensions to rest. There is no possibility that monetary instability will arise from the phenomenon of e-money.</p>
<p class="contents">Returning to the waiver provisions, if the directive should fail because of deletion of the waiver provisions – and Parliament originally proposed they should be extended – there is a very real possibility that it will prove very difficult, if not impossible, to harmonise e-money rules in the future. We want those rules. We want them to be harmonised, not least because the citizens of the European Union want that. If these two directives fail it will be detrimental to European consumers, businesses and the whole e-commerce initiative. If there are legitimate concerns or if issues which have not yet been identified arise in the next few years, they can always be taken into account in the review of the application of the directives. The Commission is committed to a review, which will take place three years after the coming into force of the directives.</p>
<p class="contents">Regrettably, therefore, I cannot accept Amendments Nos 3 or 4. As far as the Commission is concerned we would like them to be rejected by Parliament, in the same way as Amendments Nos 1 and 2 will hopefully be rejected. Turning to Amendment No 5, which amends the text so as to prohibit Member States from waiving the redeemability requirement but does not limit in any other way the provisions of Article 8 allowing Member States to waive the provisions of the directive in respect of certain limited schemes, the Commission's view of this amendment is somewhat less unfriendly than it is regarding Amendments Nos 1 to 4. Still, we would support the view expressed by Mrs Kauppi, who said that it would be best for all concerned, if all five amendments were rejected. In the light of these considerations, I ask Parliament most earnestly to reconsider its amendments for fear that the directives will be lost and deformed in the conciliation process.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
