These have strengthened the report to the best interests of the industry and those involved in it. We should all be aware that this report came about, to a large extent, as a result of the aeroplanes flying into the Twin Towers in New York in September 2001. It is an attempt, to some extent, to restore confidence in the insurance market in the European Union. Hopefully that confidence will return.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say at the outset that this is not necessarily a major problem for what we would term the 'major airlines', that is, airlines such as Lufthansa, Air France, British Airways and the other big boys. They do not have a problem with this. It is the small, regional airlines that will be most affected - indeed not only small, regional airlines, but aircraft training schools and people who fly their own small planes, etc. They are the people who, to a large extent, could feel they face the greatest problem. There could be an added cost to them. That is something we want to try to avoid.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, I tried to achieve a consensus with the compromise amendments that we came forward with in committee. I feel we have achieved this.</p>
<p class="contents">We have introduced three extra categories. These categories allow for greater flexibility and stability in the smaller aircraft area. We also have to be aware of the substantial support given to the industry in the United States. The US Government has been a very strong supporter of its industry, especially since 11 September, and continues to be so. We must not allow our industry in the European Union to place its operators at any further disadvantage.</p>
<p class="contents">By sticking to the Montreal Convention and the ECAC figures I hope we have been able to find and bring forward a balanced report that will hopefully find a way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">There are still some areas of concern. We debated them in committee. Mrs Foster brought forward a couple of amendments. She has concerns about the overflying of European Union airspace. That is something that she is right to continue to develop. We have to understand what this means and how it is going to be controlled. The other question is one we really must address between first and second readings – and I ask the Commission to take this on board – is that of an impact assessment, another issue raised in committee. We should return to that at a later stage. We have to know what the cost and effect, the damage or the benefit will be to those who fly, be it as a hobby, on business or for any other reason. We should be prepared to take time to make that assessment. It is not in the interests of the European Union to bring in legislation that will put people at a disadvantage and make the European Union look like kill-joys. That certainly is not my intention.</p>
<p class="contents">I will continue to defend the most vulnerable in this field – the small operators and those who enjoy flying as a sport. In committee I met with many interests in the industry. I also met with the insurers. It is amazing that in the European Union we only have two or three companies or people providing insurance for aircraft. There is very little competition in this field. It is right for us to encourage competition but the timing, elements and basics have to be right. We have to ensure that we have a proposal that will encourage others into this industry and bring greater competition. It is right to encourage and prepare for those conditions. Hopefully, very soon, we will be able to return to a more stable market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It therefore became necessary to clarify the situation, particularly following the events of 11 September 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur has quite rightly said, it is a question of restoring confidence and of providing the possibility of sufficient insurance cover, for small companies as well. The Commission's objective is therefore to ensure that all aircraft flying to European destinations are always insured against various risks, including war and terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Nicholson, for his constructive work, into which he has incorporated a more balanced approach, particularly with regard to third-party insurance.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is very concerned that this proposal should be adopted rapidly and will continue to observe the air insurance market in order to ensure that the current situation excludes any risk of aircraft lacking sufficient cover.</p>
<p class="contents">But I would like to say to the honourable Member that, with regard to the impact assessment, the reality is that before preparing this proposal, the Commission gathered diverse information on the issue of the insurance conditions applicable in the different States of the Union by means of the European Civil Aviation Conference and third countries, including also all aspects relating to insurance associated with leasing contracts, the Commission has been actively monitoring the development of the insurance market, both at European level and at international level. Firstly at European level in order to ultimately put an end to the special conditions which allowed the cover of certain types of risk by the public sector, but also by means of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, which is where we believe this type of issue should essentially be dealt with.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal which the honourable Members are discussing today also stems from the various discussions which took place in a special group created precisely in order to discuss the problems relating to insurance following the tragic events of September. That special group included representatives of the insurance industries and the air industries.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say to you that, following the introduction of special conditions which have been in operation for some time following 11 September (until we believed that the market had recovered sufficient capacity to cover all the risks at reasonable prices), the Commission has monitored the support measures and tariffs applied in the different States of the Union, which has given us firsthand and direct knowledge of the true situation of air insurance in the different countries of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, in this regard, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, Mr Nicholson, we believed that more extensive impact studies were not necessary, since we had more than sufficient information to produce this proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would also like to thank all the members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for having accepted a series of points of view which the Committee on Legal Affairs believed were important because they would improve the report being produced by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Madam Vice-President, please allow me to congratulate you as we have done on other occasions and on other diverse and varied reports, since, once again, you have dealt with a complicated and controversial issue, which may annoy certain sectors and groups affected, and have made a courageous proposal which, in certain cases, as you can see, we have reduced to a certain extent, although on other aspects we have proposed, if you like, some further detail and a degree of toughening of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">We must acknowledge your work and your will to resolve issues so that the European citizens are much better covered and so that they gain confidence in air transport. Furthermore, this confidence, security and responsibility in the rules on air transport should also be extended to other areas of transport on which you have also made proposals and in which we have not reached the same level in terms of the internal market and liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">We are dealing with a courageous proposal, from the Commission, the rapporteur and the Committee on Transport, which provides for a qualitative leap in the field of insurance. As both you and the rapporteur have indicated quite correctly, we are trying to give the citizens and users confidence and we are making our air transport competitive, and at the same time establishing a series of rules which indicate the route to be taken by air companies as well as the route to be taken by other States.</p>
<p class="contents">None of these concepts should make us nervous. I believe we are taking the right approach and we must maintain it. We must improve the texts, we must propose innovative ideas such as this and you will always have our support, Madam Vice-President.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that Parliament will vote to ratify the proposal of the Committee on Transport, which I believe the Commission can accept, and I believe the Council will be capable of following us and that we will not find, as on other occasions, that in the end certain issues have been rather left behind and then we have all regretted it and have been obliged to resolve them hurriedly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think that the report is acceptable to the large majority of the Members of the European Parliament and we must, of course, also thank Mr Ripoll for his work as draftsman. Obviously, the directive before us is useful, especially after everything that has happened in the wake of the terrorist attack on the United States on 11 September 2001 and the upheavals on the insurance market. I also think it is obvious that there needs to be full and fundamental cover for all categories, so that the citizens of the European Union feel that the Union is a body that cares about each and every one of them, does not take a narrow, short-sighted view of certain business interests and is concerned that everyone who has an insurance claim following an aviation accident should be compensated. I think that this particular proposal for a directive makes some headway here.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as our committee is concerned, you know that we approved various amendments which harmonise insurance requirements with the arrangements introduced by the ECAC. I think we need to stay at these levels, so that there is harmonisation between the European Union and the other European countries that are not yet members of the Union and so that there are basically unified regulations at European level. However, we must not go beyond that, because there needs to be a sense of security among our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, as Mr Nicholson said, areas of concern and I think that some Members are even concerned about evaluating the impact on airlines. The Commissioner made a reference and I think that her reference was clear. I hope, Commissioner, that your information is correct, so that there are no repercussions of the sort feared by Mrs Foster on airlines and, to finish, I should like to clarify on behalf of my group that we, the European People's Party and European Democrats, shall stand by the amendments approved in committee. We shall not accept the other amendments, because we believe that the text approved by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism is exceptionally well balanced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Members have highlighted the reasons why this regulation is required in the aftermath of the events of 11 September 2001 in the United States, so I will not go any further on that point. I should just like to say that we believe it is a necessary regulation because it creates legal certainty and because it establishes minimum insurance requirements for liability in respect of passengers, luggage, cargo, mail and third parties.</p>
<p class="contents">On the whole, we believe that the Commission did a reasonable job. However, we also believe our committee has improved the text by bringing it closer to reality and by clarifying certain aspects of it. I support the call from the rapporteur with regard to an economic impact assessment of this legislation before the second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">The main points I would like to raise on behalf of the PSE Group are as follows:</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's categories regarding the minimum insurance requirements cover too wide a spectrum of aircraft and would have constituted a burden which is too high or even unbearable for smaller aircraft in general aviation. I believe we have found a good compromise in the committee by lowering and changing the categories and by using more or less the categories of resolution ECAC/25-1.</p>
<p class="contents">My group has tabled two amendments again for plenary. The first is to ensure that the person of the party liable in respect of an aircraft is identical to the person required to take out the insurance. This amendment is necessary in order to avoid duplication of insurance, gaps in the insurance cover, or insurance without liability.</p>
<p class="contents">The second amendment is about the consequences if the conditions of this regulation are not met, in particular as it applies to an air carrier or aircraft operators from third countries, who must be refused access to routes to or within the Community or the right to overfly the territory if they fail to comply. We must remember that Community air carriers and keepers of aircraft registered in the Community shall forfeit their operating license where the prescribed insurance cover is not maintained. Therefore we must make this distinction between third country and Community carriers or operators.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that refusal or access to routes is the appropriate sanction for non-EU air carriers and aircraft operators, and that the only sanction we can impose is the denial of access to routes.</p>
<p class="contents">These two amendments are reasonable and I hope colleagues will support them<span class="bold">.</span> </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his good work, which has resulted in a balanced report. I had therefore hoped that the Commissioner would arrive in Strasbourg by aeroplane today, but I believe that she just came by car. That is a shame. One could ask oneself whether that is because she considers that the level we are now proposing as a Parliament is too low.</p>
<p class="contents">I realise that it has turned out much lower than she proposed. Nevertheless, I believe strongly in the compromise that our rapporteur has achieved and give it my wholehearted support. I should like, however, to send a general signal to the Commission regarding the tendency I perceive in its rules of late with regard to aviation. I wonder aloud whether the Commission shares my concern that things are not going well for the European aviation sector. I broadly support the Commission’s initiatives. However, that institution’s timing and the ‘open skies’ authority yet to be further developed have meant that the sector is having to deal with a large number of changes simultaneously at a very difficult time. It is overstretched. I would not wish you to misunderstand me: I am in favour of opening up markets to more competition and of reducing intervention by the authorities, but we must be clear and realistic, with transitional rules.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a variety of regimes: national, European and international, and they are intertwined. I think, therefore, that we have to take care not to start the race too fast. I should like to ask that, at second reading, the economic impact be presented, so that we know what it really involves and that we really are going to make the Community finishing line. I fully support the compromise that Mr Nicholson has presented.</p>
<p class="contents">I really find and this is the main reason we have to do it that a cup of coffee at home or here in Strasbourg is much more enjoyable than on the road in Luxembourg if one does happen to go by car. In a real, insured aeroplane. This is what is important. We want to have a consumer-friendly product, a safe product, in the air, and I hope that we can decide on that together tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to successfully achieve such a laudable objective, we must not allow the Regulation we are approving to contain imprecise definitions or confused concepts, since that could lead to situations in which there is no cover or protection, either for the consumer using the air service or for third parties suffering damage in the event of incidents.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore propose several amendments, with a view to better defining in the regulatory text the terms 'passenger', 'insurance' and 'flight', compensation to third parties, where appropriate, and we also advocate the inclusion amongst the risks insured of other contingencies, accidents and fortuitous incidents, as well as the risks caused by acts of war, terrorism, kidnap, sabotage, hijack and social or industrial disturbances.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we propose that companies and operators registered in a third country, that is, outside the European Union, can be considered as conforming to the requirements of this regulation we are discussing, provided that they produce an insurance certificate, issued under appropriate regulatory conditions by any insurer authorised to operate legally in accordance with Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">We also propose that, in all cases of aircraft operated under a leasing system, with or without crews, for whatever time period, it should always be the companies or operators carrying out flights who should fulfil the minimum insurance requirements. Finally, we ask the Commission to take the initiative to harmonise legislation on insurance against risks in all the Union’s air terminals, so that we do not end up in a situation where only possible damage suffered during flights is covered, but also any damage during the rest of the time that users remain within the air transport service chain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For that reason, I certainly do not wish to deny the necessity of this proposal for a regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is indeed important when introducing this kind of measure that all airlines, both EU and non-EU carriers, are subject to the same requirements. After all, the measure would be severely restricted in its effectiveness if this regulation only related to EU carriers. It would, moreover, have a disruptive effect on the already delicate relations in the aviation sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Another aspect for which the international context is of great importance is the amount of the sums insured. It would cloud relations in the sector if we were to lay down considerably higher sums than have been agreed in the international aviation community.</p>
<p class="contents">Without detracting from my support for this proposal, I should like to make an appeal to the Council and to the Commission. Given the malaise in the aviation sector, I would call on the Council and the Commission to adopt a constructive attitude towards the aviation sector. As a result of a number of crises, a kind of yo-yo situation seems to have arisen there, in which the viability of the airlines – not only from Europe, but also from elsewhere – is seriously under threat. Given the contribution that this sector makes to the development of the Community, a support strategy is the least it can expect.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that I can give the report my support – and the rapporteur my gratitude. I should like to note, however, that the circumstances require that it be introduced with care. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, we fully agree with the Commission that the measure is appropriate and necessary; previous speakers have already explained why. We need to give consumers and air transport users increasing guarantees, and we need, as has been said, gradually to achieve a situation where the sector is regulated and rights are protected in this field, in order to provide the same possibility of development and to restore consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, however, true, Commissioner – and I regret to say that this does not appear to be a new scenario – that, although you followed a sound, effective line with regard to air transport, the competent services of the Commission then took – and not for the first time – a rather too rigid approach when it came to specifics.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are quite aware, I am the rapporteur for the measure on overbooking, with regard to which we encountered the same rigidity as we are experiencing today in the field of insurance. What do I mean by rigidity? I mean an approach that is a little oversimplistic, which does not, indeed, take into account the two fundamental factors already mentioned. Firstly, there are different kinds of air transport: the major airlines are one thing but the regional airlines are another, and private operators – as in this case – are quite another. The second factor which is being overlooked is that this is a difficult time for the sector, not so much because of economic trends – September 11, the Middle East, the war in Iraq and now SARS which, as you know, Commissioner, has already done twice as much damage to the air traffic sector as Iraq – as the fact that, in the face of these economic difficulties, while US airlines are receiving what is practically full, total support from the US Government, we, on the other hand, are leaving most of our airlines on their own to cope with the demands we are making of them and the changes we are asking them to make, however necessary these requests may be.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, then, it was necessary for a good measure to be proposed, but I believe that, on this occasion too, without Parliament’s astute contribution, the good end result we can adopt and endorse today might not have been achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was sent to this Parliament to use my best endeavours to arrest the march of EU regulations or mitigate their effect.</p>
<p class="contents">In respect of this legislation, I note that the proposal conforms to the provisions of the Montreal and Warsaw Conventions. However, the signatories to the Conventions are the Member States, not the European Union! Thus, while I would obviously support the idea of rationalising aviation insurance, I cannot accept Commission attempts to superimpose a European dimension on what should be a matter for nation states.

I would also echo remarks by Mr Lisi and others on the state of the industry at this moment.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that none of us here would expect airlines to be operating without the proper levels of insurance cover and there is no evidence to suggest that the airlines have ever done so. However, the draft proposal took no account of the financial impact on the European aviation industry. Airlines have already endured an increase of 300% for their insurance premiums post September 11. In particular the proposal paid no regard to the financial effects on regional airlines, the general aviation sector and flying schools. In addition the UK Government has already estimated extra costs to the UK sector of £50 million, a fact that the Commission is determined to ignore.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the proposed levels of insurance cover and I fully supported the cross-party compromise that was voted on overwhelmingly at committee stage and which was more in line with the ECAC specifications.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly we have still not received a satisfactory answer regarding the practical application of this legislation on the issue of overflying. Comprehensive transit agreements have been in place worldwide for the last 60 years and it is therefore vital that any additional information required would have to be processed in a straightforward manner. The suggestion that this information could be filed with the flight plan seems totally impractical to me and does not answer the important question regarding an aircraft diverting into European airspace in unforeseen or unavoidable circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point concerns third party liability cover for war and terrorism. The Commission strongly suggests that this legislation will open up the insurance market which is currently a virtual monopoly supplier. However, we have heard no detailed evidence to support this, contrary to what the Commissioner has said. According to the experts there are no products of this nature available to international airlines and none are ever likely to emerge.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would request that the Commission not only informs our committee of the results of the business impact assessment but also answers satisfactorily the two additional points I have raised on overflying and insurance cover before the second reading. Too often the Commission ignores such requests from our committee members for information and we will no longer be ignored. Finally, I would stress that this House should not pass legislation that cannot be complied with. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to point out that, of the 31 amendments proposed by Parliament, there are 20 which we can accept, either totally or partially, because they improve or clarify the text and, specifically, those relating to producing evidence of insurance or those relating to overflights, as well as the amendment relating to third-country aircraft for example. Of these 20 which are acceptable, we can accept 15 in the exact form they have been presented and 5 with the appropriate modifications.</p>
<p class="contents">I must point out, however, ladies and gentlemen, that there are 10 which I cannot accept for the reasons I will now explain. For example, Amendment No 9, on state guarantees, because it would not be in line with our approach to state aid and because it would clearly distort competition, or Amendment No 12, on the validity of insurance, which is not legally viable since it could cancel out the insurance during a flight following events such as those which occurred on 11 September and it would therefore be impossible to guarantee its application. Amendments Nos 13 and 15, on the definition of short-term leasing, because they fall within the scope of other regulations which are not currently under review. Amendment No 18, which describes in detail the doubts over the effectiveness of cover, because it is too mandatory. Amendment No 25, which broadens the definition of the insurer, because it would unfairly discriminate against third-country insurers and would violate the Community's international obligations in relation to financial services. Amendments Nos 26 and 28, which extend the application of civil liability and liability for passengers to air operators, because they could give rise to problems in terms of legal interpretation and, on an issue of this nature, as Mr Ortuondo quite rightly pointed out, it is essential that we have the greatest possible clarity in order to prevent contradictory interpretations. Amendment No 27 because it introduces maximum bands rather than minimum insurance sums. Amendment No 29, in which the Commission is urged to harmonise the legislation on insurance at airports, because the need for obligatory insurance requirements to cover third-party damages has not been approved. And Amendment No 30 is not acceptable because the person responsible is often not the person subject to obligatory insurance.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that we are talking about thresholds which are lower than those currently proposed by the market and that, since 9 September 2001, the costs of insurance have been decreasing steadily, although it is true – and Mr Nicholson was right about this – that the problem is raised by small companies, with which there is a case-by-case negotiation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Vermeer spoke of the issue of open skies. In fact, behind all of this there are also problems relating to unfair competition, above all on long routes on which European, American and other third-country companies compete. The honourable Member is well aware that the Commission is trying to achieve a mandate for negotiation with the United States and with other third countries, which allows, on the one hand, the room for flexibility that countries require when negotiating new agreements with third countries, which are not always entirely in the Community interest, which only affect or interest certain specific countries for special reasons, but at the same time ensures that the Community has responsibility and negotiating powers in the final instance. I would like to say to the honourable Members that the United States, for example, has clearly expressed its willingness to begin these negotiations in the coming months, if we have a Commission mandate in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out, with regard to flights, that the 1944 Chicago Convention and the 1994 Transit Agreement, in its Article 5, explicitly allow conditions to be imposed on overflights, not only with regard to the payment of certain types of charge, but also with regard to the obligatory nature of certain types of insurance. These international agreements therefore clearly allow cover of overflights.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issue of the impact assessment – and I will end here, Mr President – we have commissioned an impact study with regard to third countries. We are working on this at the moment. With regard to European companies, we believe that we already have the necessary experience and knowledge.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, I hope that, during the coming debates, we can bring our positions closer together and achieve a result which clarifies and establishes an appropriate level of guarantee for everybody and which restores and increases confidence in this type of transport, which is what we are all striving for</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
