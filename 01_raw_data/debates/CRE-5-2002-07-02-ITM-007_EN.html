<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Trakatellis (PPE-DE),</span></span>  <span class="italic"> rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, today we are debating a legislative proposal for a resolution which concerns (a) traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms, (b) traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms, and (c) amendment of Directive 2001/18 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms.</p>
<p class="contents">The main aim is to harmonise rules within the European Union in a bid to ensure the internal market operates efficiently and consumers are better informed. Unfortunately, however, neither the Commission proposal nor the amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment offer any guarantee that these objectives will be achieved. On the contrary, they open the way for fraud and deception, for the misleading of consumers, for the distorting of prices and competition and for less favourable treatment of EU producers and companies.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal is directly related to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. However, the protocol does not contain any provision on the traceability of products made from genetically modified organisms. This fact does not ensure legal certainty and is a shortcoming, possibly even an obstacle to adopting rules within the Community, not only for domestic Community products but, principally, for imported products. This is because there is no legal obligation to provide all the information at each stage of the production process, thereby opening the way to all sorts of fraud and deception on the part of third country producers and suppliers. As a result, competition will be distorted because, while European Union producers will be obliged to comply with the regulation, third-country producers and suppliers will be able to maintain that their products are made from natural substances, without anyone being able to check and verify if that is really the case. Furthermore, if the European Union unilaterally applies traceability and labelling requirements to imported products and carries out checks without an adequate scientific basis, it may create a trade dispute with third countries which results in the matter being referred to the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, instead of promoting biotechnology as a technology of the future which is recognised worldwide and promises a great deal for human society in the twenty-first century, the proposal deals this technology a mortal blow. What I wonder is: who thinks up such proposals? Everything to do with food has been based in the past on scientific analysis; this applies to testing adulterated food, to BSE, to dioxins and so on. So if it is to be absolutely efficient, this regulation needs to be combined with scientific methods for identifying the differences between products made from genetically modified organisms and conventional products. In addition, methods currently available enable even traces of genetically modified DNA or genetically modified protein to be traced. As your rapporteur, I differentiate between three categories on the basis of these analytical techniques: the first category of products are products containing modified DNA or protein, for which we can use traceability and labelling. The second category contains products made from genetically modified organisms but which do not contain DNA or protein or differ in any other way from conventional products. However, if we treat equal products unequally as regards labelling, then we make them unequal and they fare differently on the market and, of course, they distort prices and mislead consumers, who will probably end up paying more. This sort of approach therefore leads to distortion on the market, confuses consumers and, basically results in fraud because labelling cannot be verified and the truth of what is stated on the label cannot be checked scientifically. So I think it is perfectly clear that the Commission proposal is so contradictory, especially now that it has been amended by the Committee on the Environment that, if we accept the principles contained in it, we shall abolish any scientific basis or logic and end up labelling food on the basis of political convictions or ideological perceptions. Animals, for example, that eat GMO products for 10 days or 20 days will have their meat, milk, butter and cheese labelled; that is the logical consequence of the Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, I believe that the European Commission has submitted this proposal to us under pressure to lift the moratorium. The proposal is totally impracticable. It offers no legal certainty because no authority with jurisdiction, such as the courts, will accept it. Consequently, my proposal to combine traceability and labelling with the principle of determining and tracing genetically modified DNA and protein is the only proposal which can be applied in practice to products made from genetically modified organisms and ensure, with the help of scientific analysis, that the regulation is applied. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Scheele (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposed regulation on which I am the rapporteur concerns the authorisation and labelling of genetically modified food and feed, and should of course be regarded as closely connected with the regulation on traceability. Like many others, including the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I welcome the Commission proposal on the future scope of labelling equivalent products, that is products made from genetically modified ingredients, where the genetic change in the end product is no longer in evidence. That is a great advance in Community lawmaking, and one that responds to the desires of consumers over many years.</p>
<p class="contents">This change will also lead to the labelling of a range of foods which do not at present have to be labelled. Current laws stipulate that oil can consist of 100% genetically modified maize without needing to be labelled as such. The traceability system makes such labelling possible. As we have just seen, discussions are carried on as if this were the first piece of legislation giving consumers information evidence for the value of which is not capable of being provided by processes of analysis, but the EU already has legislation, such as the required indication of origin for many foods, for example fruit and vegetables, that are founded on documents, which are an effective traceability system.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to ensure maximum freedom of choice for consumers, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy also calls for the labelling of animal products and enzymes. Having, albeit from outside, followed discussions in the Council, we are under no illusions: it is highly unlikely that this will form part of this piece of legislation. However, I really do think it necessary to continue with policy discussions on these issues and see what ripples arise when we throw some stones in. The one thing that is clear is that this item of legislation will certainly not lay to rest the issue of whether enzymes and animal products have to be labelled.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with the labelling issue, there have always been discussions as to whether products should be certified as being "not genetically engineered", and I have said that I could accept this as a supplement, but never as an alternative. This particular topic gave rise to discussions in the Committee on the Environment, in which members said they would send back what the Commission had submitted, and wanted only a "not genetically engineered" label.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal envisages a threshold value for contamination that is technically unavoidable and occurs by chance. No doubt we are all agreed that such a threshold value is needed. It has to be made clear at this point that this threshold value applies specifically to technically unavoidable contamination of this kind. It is often asserted, and I have read in numerous newspaper articles, that the European Union is now deciding to require labelling only above 0.5% or even 1%, which is of course nonsense.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither I nor the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy find it acceptable that such threshold values should also apply to those GMOs that are not permitted in the Community. As regards the amount of the threshold value, I hope that the majority of the whole House will support Amendments Nos 162 to 164, which my group has introduced and which lay down a threshold value of 0.5%, requiring also that the threshold value should be lower if progress in science and technology so permits.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee has adopted two further points that I have again brought up, which have to do with the centralisation of the authorisation procedure, but also with the role to be played by the national authorities, especially in relation to environmental impact assessments, which the Commission proposal stipulates should in future be carried out by the European Food Safety Authority. I do not consider this to be adequate and, not wishing to nullify the directive on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified plants, which was enacted as recently as 2001, want to leave the responsibility for this in the hands of the competent authorities in the Member States. Several of my amendments, furthermore, concern themselves with strengthening the public's right to information, and I hope that the great majority in the plenary will support these as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has done.</p>

We could say the Committee was divided into two, with those in the minority able to see, to their immense satisfaction, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy represent their position more closely than the opinion of their own Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The manipulation of genes results in species and varieties which do not occur naturally. Nobody can know what will happen when genetically modified organisms are introduced into the natural environment. They might hybridise with natural varieties, or something may be produced that was not intended when the genes were manipulated. One has to exercise excessive caution.</p>
<p class="contents">It is only reasonable to insist that all genetically manipulated organisms must be able to be traced retrospectively to an adequate extent. The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety required the identity of GMOs to be specified. The Committee on Industry voices more the views of the producers and does not want this.</p>
<p class="contents">It is furthermore in the interests of consumers that they should be allowed to choose the food they eat, and they have a right to do so. For that reason we are proposing that it should be compulsory to label GMO products as such. On that basis consumers can avoid products they do not wish to use. When the Committee on Industry voted, a position that differs from the Commission’s original proposal won by a narrow margin. It is the Committee’s opinion that labelling should be carried out in such a way that a product is labelled when it is GM-free and not when it contains genetically modified organisms. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has adopted a different position on this from the Committee on Industry, and its views are probably a better response to the need for an increase in consumer choice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These matters must be resolved in order to put an end to the Council moratorium on genetically modified organisms. It is no easy task to reconcile the different priorities that must be taken into consideration – first, consumers right to information; secondly, the priority of health and the environment; and thirdly, the functioning of the internal market – and yet this is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">It leaves me speechless, however, to hear things like genes entering the environment. The truth, ladies and gentlemen, is that a little more rigour in the interventions would not go amiss. I am not aware of any gene that has escaped in this way and flown out into the environment. We need to be rigorous and serious, we need to adopt the two proposals made by the Commission, which I think are quite reasonable, and try to adapt our proposal to what the market and consumers need.</p>
<p class="contents">The first priority has to be keeping consumers informed and giving them the ability to choose. The second priority must be a health guarantee. The third priority is that we must always respect the freedom of the internal market and require of third countries what we are prepared to require of ourselves. We cannot have separate legislation and our consumers cannot be inundated with unlabelled genetically modified organisms from other countries because we are incapable of imposing our legislation on the international bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I know that I am exceeding my time limit, but please allow me a little flexibility, as no other Members from my Group are going to speak. I would also like to say that labelling does not mean greater safety. Nor do I believe that it is the responsibility of Parliament, as a political parliament, to lay down a standard stipulating 0.5% or 0.3%. It should be a management committee that sets this parameter, which must be quantifiable. Lastly, …</p>

Amendment No 22, which is put in more precise terms, is an example, stating that committee procedures only come into play when the scope of this regulation is to be extended to new products, and under no circumstances to the contrary. I think that clarifications of this sort are always welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue is the coherence of the legislation, and we should in any case avoid the laboriously achieved compromises of the past, in the novel food regulation and the directive on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified plants, being nullified by new regulations which are currently being put before us.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, this has to do with the public's legitimate entitlement to have access to information. Consumers will only have grown up if we continue to offer them transparency and openness. Here in Parliament, we talk a great deal about freedom, transparency and solidarity. Let us turn these words into deeds, so that the public has freedom of choice about what they want to eat and about what they want to regard as unsaleable goods; let us do this by getting clear product labelling accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">This of course also involves the threshold value issue, and you will be aware that the Legal Affairs Committee has not been able to come to any conclusion about this. Various very diverse proposals having been put to the Committee, when these amendments were withdrawn, it was commented that the Committee on the Environment had a better overview of this issue, but I do not want to draw a veil over the fact that I continue to consider a threshold value of 0.1% worth striving for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sommer (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, why do we need genetically modified plants? If we modify a few genetic building blocks, plants are apparently better adapted to adverse environmental influences, such as attacks by pests or competition from weeds. They become more resistant. Far fewer herbicides and insecticides are needed. There is less environmental pollution. From the point of view of quality and nutritional value, genetically modified foods are absolutely identical to conventional foods. That is guaranteed through comprehensive testing.</p>
<p class="contents">There are widely differing views in Parliament on the present Commission proposals on traceability and labelling. We know that. But we are all agreed on one point: the proposals have been poorly dealt with. We fail to understand why the Commission has no wish to include everything in a single regulation. A comprehensive, uniform regulation could then have included seed, which at present – and again we fail to understand why – is handled under the comitology procedure, thereby more or less excluding Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">However, these shortcomings notwithstanding, we have no desire to reject the Commission proposals because any further delay would be very bad for the status of genetically modified products within the EU and the de facto moratorium which has applied for several years would remain in place.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of the Commission's two proposals is to guarantee that consumers have clear, truthful information about genetically modified organisms in food and feed. Of course, I too am unreservedly in favour of comprehensive information for consumers. That goes without saying. But we can only achieve this sort of information if we make sure that only products that really contain GMOs are labelled as such, with the need for scientific proof, with genetically modified DNA or protein or perhaps other new analytical methods in the future, as our prime requirement. This sort of product-related labelling is the only feasible way forward. The Commission proposal is barking up the wrong tree here. So-called process-based labelling of food and feed, with no facility to prove genetic modification in the end product is simply not practicable and is inviting fraud. Europe would be inundated with a flood of supposed scandals and consumer confidence in our high quality food – and it is high quality – would be shaken even further, and needlessly so.</p>
<p class="contents">For the same reason, then, we should reject the idea of extending labelling requirements to animal products such as meat, eggs and milk products from animals which have come into contact with genetically modified feed at some point. This sort of labelling requirement would be just as perplexing as a labelling requirement for food produced using genetically produced or modified aids such as enzymes because, in both cases, the food itself is not genetically modified in any way and is no different from conventional produce.</p>
<p class="contents">Exactly the same applies to highly refined products such as edible oils or sugar. There is demonstrably no longer any genetic modification in the product. So why label it?</p>
<p class="contents">This sort of procedure, labelling every product which has no more than glanced at a GMO, would run counter to the idea of consumer enlightenment and information. Nearly every food product would have to be labelled "manufactured using or from GMOs".</p>
<p class="contents">Another key question is the threshold for the accidental or technically unavoidable presence of GMOs in products. In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, the threshold value for the accidental and technically unavoidable presence of GMOs was reduced from the 1% in the Commission proposal to 0.5%. The PPE-DE group voted against this, although we are all agreed that this threshold value is a purely political value and has no scientific basis. However, even as a political value, it has to have a practicable, a feasible basis. And, with a lower limit of 1%, the feasibility threshold is more than satisfied. A threshold value of 0.5% simply cannot be complied with at present. It would be a blocking value, a blocking threshold.</p>
<p class="contents">However, on this point, and this too has to be said, the Commission proposal was very poorly formulated. Of course it will generate unease if there is talk of banning GMOs in the EU. It smacks of selling out. Basically, this threshold is a necessary tolerance value, especially in the transition phase, for GMOs which, because of the de facto moratorium, may not yet have been licensed but which have certainly been tested in the EU by the relevant scientific committees and have proven to be harmless to human health and the environment. They are ready to be licensed; they are in a holding pattern. The term we should be using is "preauthorised" and I for one shall endeavour to get this term adopted in the legislation.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lund (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, the two draft regulations and reports we are debating today are important supplements to the Directive on the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment, which we adopted last year. Rules on traceability and labelling are obviously vital, partly so that effective quality control can be carried out but also so that products can be withdrawn from the market if unforeseen damage to our health or the environment should occur and, finally, so that consumers, as consumers, can also be given a real choice between GM and non-GM products. I am therefore able fully to support the policy of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, designed to ensure that we obtain an effective system of traceability and that, as consumers, we are given a free choice. We are to be informed as to whether a product consists of, or contains, genetically modified organisms and we are also to be informed as to whether a product has been made from genetically modified organisms. That also applies, of course, to animal products such as milk, eggs and meat from animals fed on GM products. As consumers, we are obviously entitled to be informed both about the content of the foods we consume and about the methods used to produce them. I am also in favour of the limit for unintentional pollution by genetically modified organisms being set as low as it possibly can be, and at no higher than 0.5%.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me now to make an observation about the multinational chemical concerns behind GM products, as well as about the British Government which is, of course, adopting the extraordinary position that there must be no labelling, except for businesses’ being allowed to label their products GM-free. That would of course be a disastrous solution. The first reason for this is that companies would probably not make very much use of the scheme, for it would of course be voluntary. Not very many firms would make use of it solely as a way of behaving responsibly. The second reason, however, is that such a scheme would leave consumers completely in the lurch. All products not labelled GM-free could of course be either GM or non-GM products. The scheme would not provide consumers with the relevant information, and that is of course also the intention behind the chemical industry’s wishes.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it would become completely impossible to trace genetically modified organisms if there were no positive labelling of these at all the stages of production and distribution. There would then of course be no possibility of tracing genetically modified organisms which might have proved to have had harmful effects on our health or on the environment. In the light of history, one can only wonder at, in particular, the British Government’s going in for a scheme that interferes with traceability in the area of foodstuffs. I simply do not understand industry’s marketing strategy for GM products. It argues the whole time in favour of giving consumers as little information as possible. Does it really believe that confidence in genetically manipulated foodstuffs can be created in that way? That, of course, makes no sense at all, and all I can say, therefore, is that, as a result, I well appreciate the response of the large majority of European consumers. As a result of their constantly encountering the attitude that consumers should know as little as possible, they lack confidence in these products.</p>

I think we are facing one such tragedy. The goal, on which we are all agreed, is clear. Consumers must have the choice: either with GMO or without, and the label must guide them in a clear and reliable manner. In that respect, we have to make a judgment to some extent on the basis of evidence on paper. We must develop a system which we can rely on, which does not necessarily involve scientific tests alone. </p>
<p class="contents">Our group does not want to label processing aids. We are still in discussion about products from animals that were fed GMOs at some stage. However, if we include these two aspects, then we will have to label just about everything, and I wonder whether we are helping the consumer in this way. Will he still be able to see the wood for the trees? This is why we call for a system of non-GMOs, which is, in fact, already being used as a sales point by a number of distribution chains. The key problem we will be facing in respect of paper evidence will be fraud. In my view, if we do not set up a sound and reliable system – since we are mainly dealing with countries outside of the Union – then we had better brace ourselves for the first scandal.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the threshold value, my group will be endorsing 0.5% or lower for accidental presence.</p>
<p class="contents">The Eurostat figures clearly show that most consumers want effective labelling. Should we, however, follow the Commission’s system? Does it provide the necessary guarantees for checking paper evidence in a number of products in total trade? Are we then certain that we will have a really good label? My second question is, if we introduce maximum labelling, so including enzymes and animal products, will we not start labelling nearly every single product, and does this benefit the consumer at all? In my view, the best combination is a non-GMO label along with a label which features a GMO for products in which these are present. This system is not watertight either, nor perfect, but I think that my version of the Greek tragedy will claim the least number of victims. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For our group, the important factors are biodiversity, the environment, health and food safety. It is also a question of consumers’ fundamental right to be able to choose what they buy and what they eat. In addition, the issue can be viewed in terms of power. The power over our food and crops lies to a large extent with multinational companies which sometimes sell genetically modified seeds which are directly dependent on their own pesticides. All these reasons may explain why consumers wish to choose something other than GM products.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no scientific agreement on the benefits of GM technology in the area of food. The technology is controversial and our knowledge of the field is growing rapidly. In particular, there is uncertainty regarding the impact on biodiversity and possible effects for people with allergies. Therefore, the precautionary principle must be applied, and we support Member States’ right to impose a moratorium on the commercial growing of GM crops.</p>
<p class="contents">When the Commission has acted to modernise the European Union’s policy in this area, regulations for traceability, labelling and corporate responsibility have formed the basis for the policy. We believe that, in line with this and as a minimum requirement, no commercial growing of GM crops should be allowed before these changes have been made and introduced into national legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of labelling and traceability, the starting point must be the creation of a comprehensive system which provides consumers with the right to choose. This means that goods produced with the help of GM products, such as meat produced with GM feed, must also be labelled. The addition of remains from proscribed GM products must naturally also not be allowed. With regard to the unintentional addition of remains from GM crops, the threshold should be as low as possible. We believe that the proposal of 0.5 percent is far too high, but it may be a starting point for future reductions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is remarkable that those who usually defend consumers’ freedom of choice in the market now do not wish to provide consumers with this freedom through the effective labelling of GM food. Could it be the case that people realise that most consumers would exercise their freedom of choice by not choosing GM products?</p>
<p class="contents">A labelling system for GM-free products would be a considerably worse solution than that currently proposed. Such a system is based on the assumption that genetically modified food is the rule and that GM-free food is the exception. We would like to see the reverse assumption prevailing.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that on this issue there is strong pressure from industry and from certain national governments to vote against the line taken by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. I would appeal to Members of this House to accept their responsibility for the environment and consumers and to support the line taken on this issue by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and not to give in either to industry or to 10 Downing Street. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To fail to adopt comprehensive labelling and, as a result, more detailed traceability, would be a declaration of consumer policy bankruptcy on the part of Parliament and subservience to the interests of genetic engineering. To allow traceability and transparency to fail would be to trample consumers' rights underfoot, which is why I call on the PPE-DE group in particular to relinquish its blocking stance, to take the consumers’ side at long last and to stop treating them like children.</p>
<p class="contents">It is totally unacceptable for cold-pressed oil or tomatoes to be labelled, because the proof is there, while as soon as the same oil is heated or as soon as the same tomatoes are made into ketchup, they need no longer be labelled. We need comprehensive labelling because consumers have a right to know what they are eating. The market – i.e. consumers – should be allowed to decide. We really have to look on them as responsible adults and we must not, under any circumstances, treat them like children. We have known – since the BSE scandal at least – that consumers want to know what animals are being fed and how.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally we are categorically opposed to a threshold for unlicensed genetically modified food, because that would really push the Commission's objective of greater food safety <span class="italic">ad absurdum</span>. Only expressly licensed products should be marketed. Anything else would be totally unacceptable and would turn food legislation on its head. Even the 1% value for licensed products would appear to be much too high and far too arbitrary for our liking. It would mean that an average shipload of non-genetically engineered soya beans could still contain over 3 000 tonnes of genetically engineered beans. The Commission must submit more safety measures to prevent contamination because what we need is more labelling and more consumer safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This should prompt us to investigate the state of European research, and the role of Europe in the WTO and the – often unregulated, uncontrolled – use of products containing GMOs in developing countries. Similarly, it should draw attention to the importance of safeguarding biodiversity and of providing guarantees and ensuring consumer safety, for science is not yet able to do this with certainty.

Indeed, it would appear that precautions and transparency, which are the basic elements of the Protocol, are to be interpreted in a way which, at times, even distorts their meaning, especially if we read the second regulation, the regulation on traceability and labelling. There is no trace of a uniform method guaranteeing that operators have taken all the steps necessary to avoid contamination, nor is there a requirement for an authority certifying that these measures have been carried out, nor, moreover, is there consistency between the levels of contamination permitted. The same may be said of the samples to be deposited together with the authorisation application, it being left to the discretion of the applicants for the authorisation whether to take a sample or not. Moreover, it would not appear appropriate to require economic operators to provide evidence of the quality of scientific tests, which, moreover, would be a unilateral requirement since not even the Cartagena Protocol gives any significant consideration to the issue of accountability, putting off any analysis even of the principles until after 4 years from the Protocol’s entry into force.</p>
<p class="contents">Again, if the objective is traceability, as far as the precautionary principle is concerned, we fail to understand why an authorisation granted has to be valid for 10 years under one regulation while, under the other regulation, the supporting documentation only has to be retained for five years. We hope, with regard to the work carried out by the rapporteurs and, in particular, Mrs Scheele, who has, nevertheless, succeeded in improving the Commission’s proposal, that the points giving cause for concern will be amended, so that consistency which is at least functional can be achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are allowed to use God’s creation to meet our food requirements, but that does not mean that we can harm the individuality of life around us. The firms involved, however, claim that biotechnology is needed to solve the food shortage.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the problem is not that there is insufficient food, but that it is not distributed effectively. Moreover, a lack of finances is often the reason why people have no food. If we consider the famine in the southern countries of Africa, it is evident that these problems cannot be solved by means of biotechnology.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year, we approved a directive which provided for the conditional introduction onto the market of genetically modified food. The conditions are: protection of the environment and health, freedom of choice for the consumer and ‘the polluter pays’. If the industry is unable to meet these conditions, we need to abandon the marketing of genetically modified food.</p>
<p class="contents">My point of concern is that, despite the strict labelling conditions, real freedom of choice is not guaranteed. Unintentional contamination will always occur. Moreover, I take the view that GMO-free products should not be more expensive than GMO products. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As far as the scope of the proposed legislation is concerned, we believe that labelling must be applied to GMOs and their products in food and feed, and that this must be based on the full traceability of GMOs, without being limited to the detectability criteria of genetically modified DNA, so as to comply fully with the precautionary principle.</p>
<p class="contents">We reject, on the other hand, the amendments that seek to promote ‘non GMO’ or ‘GM free’ labelling since this measure would impose additional manufacturing costs on the ‘GM free’ sector.</p>
<p class="contents">As for unauthorised GMOs in the European Union, we recommend ‘zero’ tolerance. It would be contradictory to strengthen the GMO authorisation procedure, on the one hand, and to agree to the presence of unauthorised GMOs in foodstuffs on the other. In relation to the labelling exemption threshold for adventitious release of GMOs authorised in Europe, we support the 0.5% threshold.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not losing sight of the fact, however, that since the identification of GM products is problematic, the very existence of a threshold poses a problem. This type of ambiguity, which is exclusive to the debate on GMOs, must be resolved urgently within our societies, whose citizens are, increasingly, making up their own minds in the light of fears and threats, to the point where these have now become more influential than the notion of risk itself.</p>

This is obviously what is happening here this evening. We must refrain from taking any spectacular initiatives to attract the media’s attention and instead encourage a pragmatic and scientific approach to the subject in order to set aside any emotional pressures or considerations. Too much of the unfounded criticism of GMOs disregards this scientific approach. Let us keep in mind that genetic engineering has enabled us to make significant advances and progress in the field of pharmaceuticals, for example. We should not allow research to be hindered in such a way.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we must ensure that food and feed does not present any risk to human health, animal welfare or the environment and that the use of genetically modified organisms does not present these types of risks. We must protect consumers against any possible danger, speak openly of the advantages and drawbacks of GMOs by explaining to consumers the risks to which we would be exposed by turning our back on this technology. However, safety remains the most important ingredient in our food. Therefore, GM experimentation must be carried out in accordance with the principle of ‘step-by-step’ scientific validation, on the basis of homogeneous and centralised criteria, and provide the greatest possible transparency in terms of both the conditions governing this experimentation and the results obtained. Having 15 different authorisation systems merely adds to the confusion, in an area where we actually need harmonisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to express some concerns arising from certain proposals put forward in these reports. I reiterate that our credibility depends on the texts that we pass and the realistic measures resulting from them. We know that food contamination or the adventitious presence of GM material is possible, but we must still be able to detect this accurately. The scientific community recommends a threshold of 1% and casts grave doubts upon the ability to bring this threshold down to 0.5% and this does indeed seem unrealistic and impossible at this point in time.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the specified threshold for determining the presence of GMOs must be realistic, this question naturally brings us to the issue of labelling. To say to consumers that we can guarantee food is GM-free would amount to deception. Introducing this policy naturally requires strengthening of scientific validation, controls and applicable penalties.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the European Union will inform consumers as fully as possible in order to give them genuine freedom of choice, and that it communicates to them credible information on GMOs, particularly by means of labelling that is clear and easy to read, unambiguous but not excessively so, in other words based on a system which requires complete and reliable information on the presence of GMOs and their derivatives, based on the detectability and on the analysis of genetically modified DNA and protein. To now attempt to extend this requirement to the labelling of food obtained from animals fed with GMOs poses a problem and may confuse information. In order to be effective, the two reports before us must be homogeneous. Yet, I am concerned about the lack of cohesion which might result from the vote on these two texts. What will we do if both reports deviate from a common guideline? How will we explain this deviation to the public? How will we apply these measures which, ultimately, will be impossible to apply? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a genuine and honest attempt to try to meet the demands of the public with regard to this issue. The rapporteur's reports have been a genuine attempt to improve that proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">It means that we are a step closer to having proper and rational use of GM technology within Europe. I hope it is a step closer to getting the moratorium lifted so that we can start to approve new GM products which will be of benefit to all and utilise the new legislation, of which I was the author last year. It gives much higher protection than the legislation which is currently used in the crop trials now taking place in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to continue to ask questions. Is this really giving the public what they want? When members of the public contact me, by email, postcard, telephone or personally, they do not say "please give us the chance to eat food that contains less than 1% GMO". They say "please give us the chance to choose to eat food that has no GMO in it, that is GMO-free, so that we can make a genuine choice between GMO and no GMO".</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe this proposal does that. It will label food that contains a substantial quantity of GMO, but it will leave on the shelf in the supermarket many different substances and products that are not labelled, but that contain GMO. The public will be misled; the public will be confused; the public will again not have confidence and trust in the labelling systems that we propose for their benefit in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to think again. I doubt whether this proposal, in its present form, unless it is well amended, is going to be of positive benefit to the public. We have to tell people the truth about what is in their food. Ninety-nine percent of the truth is not honest; it is not good enough; it is not the necessary 100%.</p>

But it is animal and human health which is the issue before us and the ELDR Group is united in its belief that products need to be clearly labelled so that consumers can make proper choices.</p>
<p class="contents">We are, however, divided about the clearest way of achieving this result. A majority accept the Commission proposals but want products with more than 0.5% of GMOs or less if practicable, to be labelled as such. Traceability rules should be established so that this is done even when the presence of GMO DNA cannot be identified. But we risk overwhelming the consumer if we label every foodstuff made from products derived from animals fed on GMOs.</p>
<p class="contents">I am opposed to steps being taken which will eventually lead only to GMO-free or to non-GMO products being labelled if such a thing is possible, because this will result in normal foods being classified as special and transfer the burden of proof and costs away from GMO producers. We may have to do this eventually but not yet. GM crops have the potential to bring major benefits, but they also pose threats to the environment. Rules for trade are needed, but I will not be sorry if consumer preference slows the pace of GMO development and allows us more time to assess the full consequences of their use. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today's debate is about ensuring that consumers have the right to know and to choose between the products on sale to them.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to do this, products need an identity and they need some sort of label to state their identity. Today, we have the technology to ensure that this identity corresponds to the product's actual history, what materials have been used to produce it and how it has been produced. So I am against any amendments designed to restrict the traceability of genetically modified organisms and to restrict it to the final form of the product, whereas with the Commission's proposals we could have a system which gives us more information at all stages of production and hence a more accurate, more complex picture of the origin of the final product.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want even rudimentary prevention and freedom of information and consumer choice, we need to support the Commission's basic proposals and reinforce its approach. We, as a Parliament, must not take a more conservative position which might leave us open to accusations of adopting a position which allows information to be concealed. For me, this support includes the need to trace genetically modified organisms – including of course in animal feed – and I should like to add that a limit of 1% seems rather high to me for random contamination. I have learned and heard that 0.1% is possible and I see no reason why we too should not adopt this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to ask the Commission this: it has introduced a concentrated control system, mainly under the principle of food safety. However, for numerous reasons and the games which some people may play, we should I think give the national authorities strong powers of control, perhaps under a system of provisional licences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The only way to do that is with an effective labelling and traceability scheme that will tell consumers exactly what they want to know, which is whether the food or feed is being produced using GMOs. That means labelling food and feed that contain GMOs or have been produced with GMOs, so that when people pick up a packet or a tin in a shop, they can see if this is a GM product or not. That effect would not be achieved with a GM-free label.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from the difficulty of ensuring that products are 100% GM-free, why should we put all of the responsibility, expense and inconvenience on to those who do not use GMOs? That would push up the price of GM-free goods and put them out of the reach of many consumers. Those who use GMOs should have the legal obligation to label and to take all steps necessary to avoid contaminating conventional or organic produce.</p>
<p class="contents">Talking about thresholds for adventitious or accidental contamination but then making those who do not use GMOs responsible for meeting those thresholds contradicts the 'polluter pays' principle. We should reject any threshold for unauthorised GMOs, which should not be allowed to reach the market. In the case of approved GMOs, however, we should accept only the lowest achievable tolerance level. This means that the most recent state of science and technology will be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">I know from the response from my own constituents that consumers are extremely concerned about this issue and are strongly in favour of the traceability and labelling of GM food and animal feed. I also know that many major voluntary organisations, consumer organisations and supermarkets strongly support this kind of scheme.</p>

I would remind you of the debate surrounding the non-food regulation dating back some five years. The viewpoint which my group, and also I myself, expressed at the time was as follows: first of all, GMOs in food are allowed, provided that that is what the consumer wants, but we then need to choose in favour of a safe and transparent system in which only GMOs that are permitted and are thus also safe may be used.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the consumer should have freedom of choice. This means that consumers must be informed as effectively as possible in order that they can make up their own minds.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, these two basic principles were at the time of the non-food regulation the reason why we were decidedly against the ‘may contain’ label. Indeed, this ‘may contain’ label does not inform; nobody is any the wiser. We, or rather I, on behalf of my group, proposed by amendment to this non-food regulation that when genetically modified DNA is identified in food, it should also be labelled. I can recall the protests of the foodstuffs industry at the time and I also remember very well the support given at the time by many organisations, including the Dutch consumer organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal we are discussing today does not give the consumer any freedom of choice, but neither does current practice, despite claims to the contrary. Why? Very simply because in the so-called trash hold, a minimum of one percent of modified DNA in food may occur, without the need for it being labelled. For clarity’s sake, the European Commission now confirms that this non-labelling rule applies to values below one percent. This therefore means that there is food on the market that is not labelled, yet that contains nearly one percent of modified DNA.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission’s proposal that is now before us makes the consumer’s freedom of choice even less transparent. Let me explain. The principle of analytical demonstrability in the end product has been abandoned. We have always been in favour of this principle with its one-percent margin, below which there is no labelling. What is now new is that all additions to the end product that theoretically originate from, or are processed by means of, GMOs, now have to be labelled. In practice, this could result in bottles of fruit juice, to which sugar, or perhaps vitamin C or a filling agent has been added, which have been confirmed on paper to <span class="italic">possibly</span> originate from GMO corn following the many processing stages, having to be labelled as genetically modified.</p>
<p class="contents">This is bizarre. A theoretical one thousandth of modified DNA must be labelled, while the bottle without this vitamin C need not be labelled, although it may contain one percent of modified DNA.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at this rate, tens of thousands of products will have to be labelled of which it cannot be demonstrated that they contain GMO.

The Union’s primary duty is to guarantee maximum security at all the different stages in the production and distribution chain and provide accurate information on the foodstuffs placed on the market. It is then up to the consumer to choose whether or not to buy genetically modified food. However, this freedom of choice presupposes a rigorous, unambiguous labelling system which informs the consumer whether products contain genetically modified organisms, whether they are composed of genetically modified organisms, and also whether they have been derived from GMOs or whether GMOs have been used as processing aids.</p>
<p class="contents">The European People’s Party’s attempt to repropose in plenary the line already overthrown in the Environment Committee must be firmly rejected. Indeed, just labelling foods or feedingstuffs in which tests have revealed the presence of modified DNA or protein, overthrowing the Commission’s line, would be paving the way for a sort of colonisation of the European agrifoods system. We are not just talking about the potential health risk or the principle of transparency towards consumers: we are also and, perhaps, above all, talking about the safeguarding of conventional and organic food production.</p>
<p class="contents">This might seem an exaggeration, but tomorrow’s vote is important for European citizens: on the one hand, we can and must do something to banish their feeling of insecurity, and, on the other, we can and must reinforce the ideal of the Europe of diversities, which can do so much to further its quest for unity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I believe that they have come too late by around 10-15 years, as GMOs are already being used in the production of a very large proportion of our food.</p>
<p class="contents">When people started to grow crops and domesticate animals around ten thousand years ago, they also started refining natural properties. Now we are able not only to choose between different types of plant and individual plants but also to choose the characteristics of the individual plant. It is the same aim we have had for thousands of years, but we have new methods. I profess that I believe in science, I believe in this technology and I believe that we should use our knowledge, but we must be aware that new knowledge always means new risks and requires increased caution. These are two important areas to be considered in this context, public health and possible threats to the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people are concerned. We have reason to take these concerns seriously. The consumer requires labelling, and the consumer is always right. We as politicians must take our responsibility. If one takes the environmental aspect seriously, which, in contrast to Mr Trakatellis, I do, <span class="italic">all</span> food must be labelled, including in those cases where GMOs cannot be detected and where they have only been used to assist production. I therefore fully support the proposal of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. I also support a number of the amendments proposed by the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance which go one step further.

At the same time, there must be a voluntary quality assurance procedure for producers, which offers our millions of consumers high safety standards. Unfortunately, the procedure used in the Member States is too disparate and too unclear. Without strict controls there will be no way of preventing all forms of abusive labelling. Consumers want natural foods and are against the use of any technology in the production of food. Labelling and traceability do not automatically guarantee safety. The greatest danger lies in the procedure for licensing genetically modified organisms in the food chain in the Community, if this contradicts the general product standards laid down in WTO rules.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's plans for reforming the CAP are proliferating daily. The planned amendments are a challenge to the Member States' right of codetermination and to their interest groups.

There are still a number of shortcomings, however, which, in my opinion, could have been remedied by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and I hope that the House will support this committee’s proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">The two points I wish to make are, first of all, the introduction of a 1% tolerance threshold for unauthorised GMOs, regardless of whether their presence is adventitious or technically unavoidable. This is totally inconsistent since, if it is a question of an unauthorised GMO, it should not be present in our food. This is a proposal which promotes fraud and which is a flagrant violation of the spirit and the letter of Directive 2001/18/EC, which was adopted last year. It is therefore unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The second important point relates to the problem of co-existence between GM cultures and non-GM cultures. To deal with this problem by setting contamination thresholds is a totally inadequate approach. It is important to deal with the fundamental problem, namely that of the legal liability of operators. Farmers who are growing or will grow GM crops must clearly ensure that they take all the necessary measures to avoid contamination of conventional products and organic products. It is the ‘polluter pays’ principle that must be applied and this is the case with an approach such as this. I therefore hope that tomorrow’s vote will achieve this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The real challenges involved in genetic modifications are ethical and environmental. Ethical, since the manipulation of chromosomal information explores limits other than those that are technically possible; environmental, because, by introducing foreign genes into cultivated plants, we are deliberately running the risk of spreading undesirable genes amongst wild plant life.</p>
<p class="contents">I am fully aware that genetic engineering is opening up new possibilities for improving cultivated plants compared to those offered by traditional plant selection methods. Research must, of course, continue but the question as to how far we can go in playing the sorcerer’s apprentice with the very core of a living being must, at some point, be raised. We must note that, so far, the benefits of GMOs have been much more tangible for American seed firms than for farmers or consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumers, farmers and citizens feel extremely reticent towards GMOs and legislators must understand this. With regard to industry, legislators must set limits that the industry must respect and ensure that these limits are imposed just as strictly to products imported from third countries as to food produced in the European Union. With regard to consumers, legislators must demand labelling of doses that can be efficiently measured as accurately as possible, in accordance with scientific knowledge. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While the very mention of the term "GMO" is enough to grab media attention, it is important that we put things in perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">We are dealing with this matter as part of a general concern for the welfare of consumers against a background of recent scares related to food and animal feeds. I believe it is important to get away from the emotive aspects of the debate and focus on our role as European legislators, which is to guarantee consumers that we have put a legal framework in place that guarantees the best quality and the safest products. In addition, they should have the clearest and fullest information about every food product they consume so that they can make informed choices.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that legislators listen to all sides and get the balance right, guided by the unassailable principle of safe food for our citizens. In this respect I believe the Commission has, on the whole, made a very balanced proposal. There must be labelling and transparency. There must be guidelines regarding ingredients.</p>
<p class="contents">I am unable to support a series of amendments that seek to go further than is necessary. Many of the amendments adopted in committee would place the European agriculture industry at a considerable disadvantage <span class="italic">vis-à-vis</span> our trading partners, not to mention running the risk of falling foul of our WTO commitments. At the end of the day we should avoid complications that bring no tangible benefit to our consumers and only give ammunition to those who argue that the EU creates burdensome over-regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Providing full information means that consumers have choice. If consumers wish to purchase food derived from animals which were not fed on GM feed, then they can do so via the organic route. Let us face reality and base our decisions on scientific considerations. In the future it is likely that more and more animal feed will be derived from GM crops. I believe that the safeguards are in place to guarantee that these feedstuffs will all have been tried and tested before they enter the food chain.</p>
<p class="contents">If a consumer decides to avoid such products, that is his or her right. It is our responsibility to provide them with the information to make this choice. It would be wrong to give in to attempts to demonise GM foods and feedstuffs. Let us listen to sound scientific advice and trust in our own food safety system, which I believe is second to none. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In line with this ambition, biotech is top priority in the sixth framework research programme which we approved only recently. Advances in crop biotechnology promise major benefits for our environment and consumers. If, for a moment, we can give thought to the interests of others, they will be of incalculable benefit to those who are hungry or suffer blindness and disease in the third world.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore shameful that we bow down to the destructive agenda of Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace, who are intent on bamboozling the public with unjustified scare stories. Clearly, their purpose is to prevent all advance in this area of great scientific promise, for that is what these present texts from the Trakatellis and Scheele reports would mean.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy understood these implications for industry, our farmers, our international trade relations, our scientific community and, yes, for our consumers. It voted for a GM free and virtually GM-free labelling system which would be readily workable and much less bureaucratic and more consistent with consumer wishes for simple and straightforward information – much more straightforward than the present Commission proposal, let alone the absurd texts before us.</p>
<p class="contents">Certain Member States also would much prefer this solution. I ask the Commission to bear in mind, when it comes to codecision, that this option has support in Parliament. If it genuinely stands by its biotechnology action plan, it should give this option more consideration. Indeed, I call on the Commission this afternoon to state that this option could still be open. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If the food contains genetically modified ingredients, then this should be clearly indicated on the label. If GMOs are used in the production process, this should also be evident. In my view, you can take this to extremes and take the rapporteur’s lead. However, we should realise what the implications would be. If we followed the rapporteur’s proposals, at least 80% of the foodstuffs would soon have to be marked as GMO. In addition, nearly 100% of the processed and packaged foodstuffs would receive a GMO label. In this way, information would lose its value in terms of the choices that the consumer wishes to make. We should also realise that we thus accord genetic modification a definite place in food production. This is fine by me. Genetic modification may have many advantages, and I welcome the taboo on GMOs being broken, but I do have concerns. After all, it is easy to predict that biotechnology will thus elbow out normal gen-tech-free production, which we must prevent. </p>
<p class="contents">This is why I call for the introduction of a ‘GMO-free’ label alongside the rapporteur’s proposals, and I mean really GMO-free, that is to say, 0% GMOs and no use of GMOs during the production. The GMO-free label would also encourage GMO-free production, and GMO-free areas would need to be designated, which would provide an economy of scale at the same time. GMO-free would then remain affordable for everyone and GMO-free should not become elite food, in my view. Consumers are entitled to choose GMO-free at affordable prices.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point concerns the position of third countries. In all recent food legislation, we have made certain that imports from third countries must meet European standards. However, third countries can always call upon equivalence. Unfortunately, we are now threatening to adopt a different approach and make imports from third countries in practice impossible. With this Fortress Europe approach, we are closing ourselves off from the world and are turning our backs on the developing countries. I consider this unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to wish both rapporteurs much strength and, especially, fruitful cooperation, because I believe it is extremely difficult at the moment for Parliament to adopt a sound viewpoint. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the name of scientific development, to quote the huge multinationals in the food industry, man is attempting to intervene in the genetic codes of living organisms at a time when no one can guarantee the impact modified species will have; it is not predictable or immediately obvious and only becomes apparent once havoc has been wreaked.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though we consider the amendments made by the European Parliament to be extremely positive, there is a serious risk of their having extremely negative results because labels shift the responsibility for deciding if a product is suitable away from the relevant government agencies and on to the consumer, who is not always able and does not always have the knowledge needed to make that decision. In addition, even if these proposals were to have some degree of success, the benefits would be short lived because, with contamination and the Commission proposing that products containing 1% genetically modified organisms should be considered clean, every product would be contaminated in a few years' time, especially plant products, as a result of cross-pollination.</p>
<p class="contents">What really frightens us is that this attempt focuses on reassuring public opinion, glossing over the risks and fostering a climate of acceptance of modified organisms.

<p class="contents">We must reiterate that when we eat animals, we are eating the food that they themselves consumed. Consumers therefore want to know, and many farmers also want to know, what animals eat.</p>
<p class="contents">Since, initially, I had been appointed draftsman on this issue as a member of the Committee on Agriculture, I felt obliged not to table this opinion on my behalf, such was the desire of my fellow Members – and Mrs Redondo, an inveterate productivist and defender of genetically manipulated organisms, pointed this out earlier – to confuse the debate.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Doyle (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, first of all I must ask why we have two reports at all. Is it just to suit two DGs which could not come up with a cooperative proposal? Can I say you have added to the confusion – as if it were needed – on this particular topic and I am disappointed because we now see two completely different approaches to the same issue, which has done nothing at all to add light and not heat to the subject before us.</p>
<p class="contents">For many, the very expression 'genetically modified organism', is a concept lifted directly from science fiction. The scientific fact, however, of genetic engineering is that this technology has already improved the quality of life for so many, and with a balanced and practical regulatory environment, it has an exciting future in the whole pharmaceutical, medical, food and feed areas, to name but a few.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to lift the moratorium and have a rational regulatory approach to GM technology to allow consumers to make informed choices. I must say, however, that I am extremely disappointed with the industry's lack of defence of their products and processes and, indeed, even their field trials, against unjustified scare stories. It is next to lamentable. They do not deserve any of us standing up here defending their product or their future, because they have gone to ground and covered their head from day one and have made it a very difficult catch-up job now to get a rational common-sense debate in this area. They must take it on the head for failing to defend their products.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also concerned that to some extent the approach lacks scientific rigour in this area. I fully support my colleague Mr Trakatellis's approach. If what we do and the legislation we pass is not soundly based in scientific rigour, we bring all the EU regulatory processes into disrepute; and we are going down this road with many of the issues before us in these reports here today. Not only do we lack scientific rigour in our approach, but we are possibly going to come into conflict with the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a precautionary approach but not a preventive one. There would be a very important central role for the new EFSA in this whole area, including the rigorous risk assessment of any GM feed prior to authorisation for use in the EU. There is no analytical method for determining if animal products originate from animals fed GM feed and insistence on such labelling will open the door for misrepresentation, fraud, distortion of competition and so on. The only way to verify will be by on-farm inspections with another army of inspectors. Please do not send us down that road again.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a plea for the whisky industry: what is the transition situation? They lay down their whiskies to age for up to 12 to 20 years. If we are going to insist on retrospective labelling, how will they be able to compete? Could you put on the record the future of the whisky industry? They are particularly concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If they did not know much about GMOs before 3.45 p.m. they certainly know much more about them now.</p>
<p class="contents">This year the issue of GMs is hotly topical and controversial. It has been a key issue in the Scottish Parliament. In the Welsh Assembly there is talk about a GM-free Wales. Crop trials are presently being conducted in Scotland. One is presently under way in a small village in Munlochy, in the Black Isle, where the local community has even kept vigil at the site of an extensive trial. There is no getting away from this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Food scares over the past decade have meant that consumers want to be sure that what they are eating is safe. Currently, fears about GM foods run high. Although the evidence suggests that GM foods are safe, people are unsure about the environmental impact and the obvious unknown. How do we reassure people over this issue? How do we make the waves – as Mrs Scheele said – on issues like these? Labels and traceability are one answer. The only way to gain the confidence of consumers is to offer a totally traceable, transparent and reliable information system. Traceability puts the burden of proof on the producer. Whether the threshold is 1% or 0.5%, if practicable, these are a step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of labelling, people want as much information as is possible. This has to rest on quality information. The jury is out. A GM-free label has been talked about. There is a lot of potential there, but it can also mislead consumers because of accidental contamination. Rules for GM-free labelling exist in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, but food producers cannot guarantee that products are completely GM free. These products should not become a costly niche market. Mrs Scheele's comment on the subject is welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate will continue. We cannot afford to let this opportunity to have proper, practical traceability and labelling of GMs pass us by. As an article in today's <span class="italic">Guardian</span> says, we are at a crossroads. The vote tomorrow will determine the future of genetically modified food in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Magnum ice creams, for example, are made of processed GM soya. Unilever and the governments of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands prefer to leave things as they are. So do the Christian Democrats, the right-wing Liberals and David Bowe of the Socialists. </p>
<p class="contents">However, consumers are entitled to information about whether or not they are eating GM food. Christian Democrats and the right-wing Liberals wish to keep the European people in the dark. They have one valid argument, namely that the proposed system could lead to deceit. However, deceit also occurs in the origin of food and the labelling of organic food. The Christian Democrats and the right-wing Liberals voted in favour on that occasion. It is quite sickening to think that Christian Democrats and right-wing Liberals should want to feed our citizens GM food unwittingly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
