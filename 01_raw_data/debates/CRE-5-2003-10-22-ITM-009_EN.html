<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Menéndez del Valle (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I would first of all like to express my pleasure and thank all the Members who have joined me in making an effort to achieve the consensus in this report, a report with the significant title of ‘Peace and Dignity in the Middle East’. Unfortunately we are far from peace, and humiliation – rather than dignity – is the order of the day in the troubled lands of Israel and Palestine. However, the report we are discussing expresses the aspiration, in its letter and its spirit, that more and more voices, more and more consciences, should be raised here and over there in favour of this twin objective: dignity and peace, to which we can and must add stability for the region and prosperity for its peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true, as the report indicates, that it has not been possible to establish a climate of mutual trust between the parties and that recently the enemies of peace have placed obstacles and raised pretexts in the aim of making the Roadmap unworkable, but our duty is to continue trying to achieve it in the immediate, in the medium term and in the long term. Hence the report – at risk of being accused of utopianism – calls on the governments of both parties and those of all the countries in the Middle East to implement a new educational policy based on the notion of education for peace and geared towards promoting mutual tolerance and understanding between the different cultures and religions.</p>
<p class="contents">While this is being achieved, however, we must confront the inescapable reality of the situation, and we do so condemning the terrorist violence of Palestinian factions, as well the Israelis’ use of excessive military force against the Palestinian people. Regrettably, the latter consideration is particularly timely at the moment and, I would insist, this is regrettable. As stated in the editorial of the Israeli daily newspaper <span class="italic">Ha’aretz</span> – and I quote, ‘on Monday, while Sharon was giving an empty speech, lacking any realistic political vision, Israeli helicopters were bombing Gaza, hitting several terrorists, but also killing and injuring many innocent Palestinian civilians’; an odious practice which is not isolated and which, writes <span class="italic">Ha’aretz</span>, ‘the Israeli army has shown that it is going to pursue’. Something, in my view, which leads the editorial writer – a clear product of a democratic society such as Israeli society – to advise the Israeli Government and army that, ‘they must not, through this policy, undermine the ethical standards which Israel has adopted over the years. If this were the case, Israeli society would become seriously divided, since public opinion would stop trusting in their political and military leaders’. Actually, in that speech on Monday, the Israeli Prime Minister claimed before the Knesset to be an ardent advocate of the Roadmap. Though with the 14 amendments presented not to the Quartet, but, unofficially, to the US administration.</p>
<p class="contents">Apparently alarmed by the resonance of the so-called Geneva Accord, the peace initiative produced as a result of joint Israeli-Palestinian efforts, Sharon has stated that the Roadmap is the only hope of making progress towards peace with Palestinians. Well, it is time for work. We will rejoice with him if it makes genuine progress. For the moment, however, we will be satisfied if he complies with what the report – on the basis of a consensus – requests from him in paragraph 2: the withdrawal of his army from the autonomous Palestinian territories, an end to selective assassinations and the freezing of all colonisation and of the construction of the security wall.</p>
<p class="contents">‘There is no need to sleep to have nightmares’, said a slogan painted on the Berlin Wall. Fourteen years after its destruction, another wall is causing nightmares in Palestine. And while Sharon, in his speech on Monday, said that he had ordered that the wall be speeded up, last night, in the United Nations General Assembly, 144 governments voted to call on Israel to stop it and to backtrack on a construction which the whole planet – apart from Israel and the United States, who voted against – considers a violation of international law.</p>
<p class="contents">The report deals with various burning issues. For example, on the basis of the necessary constitution of a viable and democratic Palestinian State, it calls on the Palestinian authorities to deal realistically with the so-called right of return for the refugees, so that a realistic solution can be agreed. Even so, as a European, I would insist – and I will end here – that I naturally entirely support the Roadmap, but the report recommends that, in the event that this Roadmap is deadlocked in the immediate future, and in view of the grave consequences that would have, causing greater suffering for Israelis and Palestinians, new options be provided for, in particular, the establishment of an international mandate under the authority of the Quartet in Palestine, which may even include an international force on the ground. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate Mr Menéndez on this very comprehensive report on the situation in the Middle East. I would also like to congratulate him for showing a great deal of diligence and diplomacy in bringing diverging opinions together, while still offering us a report that is full of substance.</p>
<p class="contents">When the honourable Member started work on the 'Peace and Dignity' report there was hope that the Road Map would be the way out of the misery that has gripped the Middle East for such a long time. Today, several months later, much of that hope seems to be gone.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the recent setbacks, we must look for a way forward and explore solutions that will lead to an improvement of the situation. Resignation and failure are not options, for the sake of our neighbours, our partners and all people in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">The two-state solution is still the most widely accepted solution. The Road Map shows us the way, but what we need is the political determination from the parties and the international community to find that way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Many are trying to explore innovative solutions for solving the hard questions, like refugees and Jerusalem first. A group of Palestinians and Israelis have done just that. Many of us have had a chance today to hear from the experience of these people. The Geneva Accords prove that difficult issues can be discussed and resolved, as painful as they may look for either side. But beyond this, the Geneva Accords prove that there are still admirable people from both sides of the conflict who, in the middle of the current tragedy and chaos, have kept their will and courage to look for positive and peaceful alternatives.</p>
<p class="contents">There are other initiatives which deserve similar praise, such as the citizens campaign of Mr Nusseibeh and A. Ayalon who presented their ideas to this house only a few weeks ago and have now attracted more than 80 000 signatures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Menéndez report is totally correct in pointing out that any peace plan depends on the political will and honest commitment of the parties. And that commitment seems to be lacking. Is the current Israeli Government ready to accept the two-state solution, with Palestine being a real viable State? Are the Palestinians ready and capable to exercise governmental functions in all areas, including security? Palestinians must take effective control, undertake visible and effective steps against those conducting and planning violent attacks on Israelis, and publicly reconfirm the right of existence of Israel. It is equally important to press ahead with the preparation of elections, the constitution and civil society involvement in reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Security concerns are given as a reason for the separation barrier deep in the West Bank. But if completed as currently projected in official documents and media speculation, Palestinians would be living in several enclaves which are not connected and are isolated from the outside world. Moreover, the projected route would involve cutting off a large number of Palestinians from their schools, hospitals and other services – and even their livelihoods. It is not too late for Israel to change this. And only yesterday, even some ministers in the Israeli Government criticised the deaths of innocent civilians during the recent Israeli military operations in Gaza, one of the heaviest air strikes for months. Israel really must address these widely expressed concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">The report addressed the Commission directly on several issues. Let me briefly go through them. Paragraph 31 refers to future elections in Palestine. The Commission has already made funds available to the independent Central Elections Commission. Preparatory work for elections could start in the coming weeks. The Palestinian Prime Minister is planning to hold elections in June next year. We are prepared to start voter registration as early as next month. But the present restrictions on movement, the cutting off of one community from another, would make the preparation of elections and an election campaign itself well nigh impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">In paragraph 38, the report calls for an assessment of economic and financial needs. The Palestinian Authority is working on a strategy for economic stabilisation and recovery. An international donor conference for the Middle East is scheduled to take place in mid-November. We will also have the opportunity to discuss with the World Bank and the IMF the prospects for financial assistance on the basis of the Palestinian budget for 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community this year is contributing about EUR 245 million to the Palestinians, either through support of the Palestinian Authority or UNRWA and NGOs. It is the highest per capita support in the world and it is based on the assumption that a viable Palestinian state is in the making and deserves our assistance. Clearly, our help is vital for humanitarian reasons and for attaining a bare minimum of economic activity. It has also helped to create some of the institutional foundations of a Palestinian state. But we need to be clear that, if the situation continues to deteriorate, we are not simply funding the Israeli Defence Force's occupation of the Palestinian territories.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 40 speaks about schoolbooks. The Commission is not directly involved in this issue. But we have met with a variety of parties concerned in order to facilitate dialogue between Palestinians and Israelis. We have also raised the issue in the EU-PLO Joint Committee meeting in June and will observe closely PA endeavours to curb incitement. In this context, let me mention that the latest call for proposals of projects under the EU Partnership for Peace focuses on initiatives to curb violence and incitement to violence.</p>
<p class="contents">The next paragraph rightly states that education for peace is one of the cornerstones on the way to a peaceful solution of the conflict. The extension of TEMPUS to the Palestinian territories and the signature of the scientific agreement with Israel, granting it the same status as EU Member States, are but two examples of our support to this concept.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the international fund mentioned in paragraph 59, I should like to mention that the international community has been making contributions at the rate of about EUR 1 billion a year for the last three years. World Bank reports keep stating that even if this contribution were to be doubled the impact would be minimal. Only an improvement of the security situation and re-establishing freedom of movement would significantly improve the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with paragraph 64 that MEDA regional programmes should be fully used to exploit the potential benefits of regional and cross-border cooperation for the peace process. Discussions in the context of the Wider Europe initiative will take this aspect into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Peace, dignity and security are indeed the foundation for a better future in the Middle East. We must all work to that end. It is in the interests of our partners but equally in ours. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an issue that could even split the House, for if everyone’s motion were to be included, diametrically opposing positions would be established. We will continue to present these positions in our articles and speeches and so forth, but, in this situation, where peace and dignity in the Middle East are essential, it is important for this House to make a contribution with a report that does justice to the great value of peace and dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the Middle East conflict is a conflict of missed opportunities, starting in 1947/48 after the United Nations’ partition plan, continuing with the non-creation of a Palestinian state under Jordanian occupation in 1967, and carrying on with what could have been achieved under President Clinton just before 2000, namely the project which the then Prime Minister Barak was attempting to initiate with his Palestinian partners and which subsequently failed. I therefore believe that the objective – the entire process’s ultimate destination – is clear to everyone: there will be a Palestinian state, the Israelis will have to withdraw from the occupied territories, and the two nations will have to live together in peace, just as the Germans and the French also had to learn to do after centuries of warfare.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is: How many victims must there be before that happens? That is why I see the present situation as an outcome of the Intifada which began in 2000, when suddenly, people no longer relied on the talks which had been promised by both sides in Oslo and to which the European Union has now contributed billions of euros in support. Instead, they thought that recourse to violence would enable them to move closer to the objective I have outlined.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, too, society changes in a process that you have described. Israeli society is more right-wing today than it was a few years ago. Many people who were active in the peace movement, who held illegal meetings with Arafat in the 1980s and 1990s and were threatened with criminal proceedings, now tell us that they do not want to talk to him any more, that they no longer trust him, because every week a bomb explodes in an Israeli city. I imagine that our societies would change too if suicide bombings occurred in Rome, Madrid, Brussels or Berlin on a daily basis. I expect that our societies, too, would become right-wing and reactionary in such a scenario.</p>
<p class="contents">So we must ask ourselves what is the way out of this situation. The Road Map, involving collaboration between the Quartet – the United States, the European Union, the United Nations and Russia – is absolutely the right approach. Everyone must see that we cannot be divided on this issue, and that we intend to continue our support for this process. In this respect, I believe we are a step further forward, in that we have become more demanding, with the Council, too, now saying that the political wing of Hamas is a terrorist organisation, and in that we are speaking out clearly, also about the security fence and the way in which it alters territories. Yes, we have now become more demanding. I hope that we can involve the region as a whole, and that Syria and Iran and indeed everyone who has funded terrorism for so many years will now recognise that they must work for peace if they want to be the European Union’s partners. This report, in my view, makes important suggestions that help contribute to this process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

His suggestions and recommendations are entirely to the point. If they were implemented immediately, they would bring instant peace to the long-suffering people of Israel and Palestine. We are all familiar with the obstacles to peace.</p>
<p class="contents">One amendment, which was rejected in committee, calls President Arafat an obstacle; I would have been tempted to vote in favour of that amendment if its author had treated Arafat and Sharon in the same way, and I would have given it my full support if it had stated that the Bush-Sharon relationship is currently making sure that the deadly status quo and the stagnation in the Middle East remain in place.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of this stagnation, the two peoples are becoming a little more entrenched every day in this murderous folly and in poverty. Avraham Burg, the former Speaker of the Knesset whom we have received and applauded in this very House, accuses Mr Sharon of killing the Israeli nation by destroying its values. Today, he says, ‘we are a State that is building settlements under the leadership of a corrupt clique, which thumbs its nose at the wishes of the people and at the law’. Indeed, occupation, segregation, blockades, humiliation, targeted murders, houses being bulldozed and the wall are merely the visible signs of a deep-felt contempt and the failure to acknowledge a Palestinian national identity.</p>
<p class="contents">‘Even if 1 000 terrorists were killed every day, nothing would change’ continues Avraham Burg. Should we not, then, Mr President, start by ensuring that international law is respected? It is now being flouted quite openly and Israel will have to accept unilaterally to withdraw its army from the occupied territories and to dismantle illegal settlements. Accepting this would give the Palestinian people some political hope, would strengthen the power of its leaders and would enable them to wipe out extremism and terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">There is certainly an alternative to Mr Sharon’s policy and this alternative is being advocated, in Israel, by members of the left and of civil society grouped around Yossi Beilin, Avraham Burg, Ami Ayalon and Amram Mitzna. We must hope that the European Union, unlike the United States, openly supports their initiative, which is the only thing capable of stopping the current process of demolition.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union will have a good opportunity to do so, on 4 November, when supporters of peace sign the Geneva Agreement. The fourth of November, I must remind you, is the anniversary of the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin. Why should the President-in-Office of the Council not go to Tel-Aviv and to Ramallah with Mr Powell, with Kofi Annan and Mr Ivanov, returning only once the mission has been accomplished, in other words, once they have successfully ensured the irreversible and irrevocable implementation of the Road map? Go into the midst of activity and take this initiative in order to generate this shock, of which Messrs Poettering, Baron Crespo and Cohn-Bendit spoke here on 9 October, each in their own way.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, the United States, the United Nations and Russia each have the means of making both sides listen to reason. They have already used these means, moreover, and have a duty to use them now, before the entire Middle East is torn apart. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An important French newspaper stated that, in the name of anti-Zionism, proclaimed far from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, anti-Semitism is re-remerging in a new normalised form. The Middle East conflict, however, is not unrelated to all these problems and we are all concerned about this conflict and this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now dealing with a report on peace and dignity in the Middle East. The report has been produced by the rapporteur, Mr Menéndez del Valle, who has made, I believe, a considerable effort which we are grateful for, although I do not agree with some of his conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">This afternoon, we have had the opportunity to hear two figures from the region: Naomi Chazan, an Israeli, and Jamal Zaqoud, of the Palestinian National Council, who, after the Dead Sea talks, wish to present what is known as the Geneva Accord. They are excellent people – there are excellent people on both sides – their will is excellent, but, naturally, in both cases they are currently far from the political powers, which in reality are the people who govern the destinies of Israel and Palestine.</p>
<p class="contents">I said that this report has been produced with difficulty, because the first document was dated 21 May and the Commission’s agreement did not arrive until 9 October. Almost five months have passed and, over these five months, too many things have happened in those countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a report which relates to the first phase of the Roadmap and I believe it is positive that Parliament should give its opinion on it, because it is the only direction. It also talks about education for peace, which is necessary at all times. Where I disagree with the report, however, is the second part, in which it wishes to propose what the second and third phase of this application will be. I believe it is premature at the moment to define a series of issues which will certainly be problematic: what must the final borders be, what must the policy on refugees be, what must be done in Jerusalem. I believe – sincerely – that it is premature to talk about it at the moment. The priority now is to ensure that the deaths in that region come to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe – and I regret – that this report will not make a real contribution to the peace process, because it will not be accepted equally by the conflicting parties and, in this regard, the European Union will not increase its prestige and its moral authority in the region, which is so necessary at the moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Union now needs to make its voice heard in relation to the conflict which has the greatest effect on our current and future stability. We have seen the complete failure of the Sharon approach, supported by the United States, which consists of using violence as much as possible in the form of state terrorism, which puts him on the same condemnable level as the Palestinian suicide groups.</p>
<p class="contents">We in Spain, where we suffer the murderous terrorism of ETA, once fell into the temptation of employing state terrorism and that led to more violence and even a degree of moral legitimacy for the terrorists, and we therefore had to return to the path of respect for the Rule of Law, which is much more effective and dignified.</p>
<p class="contents">The current spiral of violence gives credibility to both the Roadmap and the initiative of 4 November, in Geneva, of a determined and courageous group of Israelis and Palestinians who are not resigned to the situation, who know that all violence, on either side, represents failure for everybody, and who represent the hope that the only solution applied to the Roadmap is the existence of two States: Israel, a homeland for the Jews, and Palestine, a homeland for the Palestinians. Respect on the part of one people for another and vice versa, the recognition of the rights of refugees, Jerusalem as a dual capital for both States, an end to the unjust occupation of Palestine by Israel, ending and dismantling the Israeli settlements and, above all, removing the wall of shame which is so reminiscent of the ghettos, all of this with respect for international law and the UN, which incidentally sponsored the creation of the State of Israel. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He says that a state without justice that crushes the Palestinian majority under its boot cannot be regarded as the only democracy in the Middle East. Mr Burg is now appealing to Israel’s friends to intervene. It is high time we stopped treating Israel as a normal democracy, because it is an occupying power and state that is in breach of international law.</p>
<p class="contents">We must intervene very much more forcefully. We must of course give our support to the Beilin-Abed-Rabbo initiative and use the resources at our disposal. Parliament has on several occasions requested us to suspend the association agreement. Why does Commissioner Liikanen not address this issue? He lists many good things the EU has done to strengthen the Palestinian Authority, but we must resort to more forceful methods. Obviously, we condemn the violence, but violence in the form of violent resistance to occupation is in actual fact permitted under international law. My country has avoided occupation, but many of the rest of you live in countries in which people have risen up in resistance to occupation. We want violence to be avoided and are opposed to all forms of violence. The violence of resistance and that of oppression cannot, however, be directly compared with one another because they are two different things. The Israeli violence is the violence of oppression and occupation, and is unlawful. That is why we must intervene.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now in the process of developing a military capacity in the EU. I have been doubtful about this for many reasons, but why do we not send our protective forces to the Palestinians? They want protection, and they need protection. It would be the EU’s first big test as to whether this military capacity is to be used for good or for something else. Let us protect the Palestinians. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is very long, and not one understanding or balanced remark is missing from it. It can justifiably be said to be a very long report, considering how little it has to say that is new. The whole thing could be summarised in the words from recital A: ‘whereas the time has come to end the violence and widespread terror that has existed in the region since well before the launch of the United Nations partition plan in 1947 and the founding of the State of Israel on 14 May 1948’. ‘[T]he time has come to end the violence’. How very true, its having so far been going on for some thousands of years. It is nice that the European Parliament thinks it knows exactly what should be done, but it is not particularly nice that this cannot, and will not, be done. This report might usefully be kept, for it could also be used next year and the year after that, for nothing will come of what it contains.</p>
<p class="contents">Another document has been published in the last few days, contrastingly more interesting than this report. The document is entitled ‘Arab Human Development Report 2003’ and has been issued by the UNDP, that is to say the United Nations Development Programme. This comprehensive report, written by Arab scholars, explains why the situation in the Middle East continues to go off the rails. It is an account of the massive suppression of knowledge, political freedom and freedom of expression that characterises the Arab world. It is an account of the brainwashing of children and of the way in which women are deprived of control over their own affairs. It is an account of 270 million people living in the darkness of the Middle Ages. Let us debate peace and dignity in the Middle East in the light of the UNDP's report. To do so requires far greater effort than the showy but ultimately vacuous offerings that the European Parliament has come up with in its own report. It is a matter of urgency, moreover, for the time bomb is ticking in the Middle East. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was, incidentally, done in a peaceful and – I sincerely hope – dignified manner.</p>
<p class="contents">These key words ‘peace and dignity’ are what Mr Menéndez del Valle is striving to achieve in the permanently haemorrhaging Middle East – an honourable endeavour in which I would like to be alongside him.</p>
<p class="contents">I can see two enormous barriers blocking the Roadmap to peace and dignity in the Middle East, and I believe that the rapporteur greatly underestimates them. They are the Islamists’ urge to destroy the Jewish state of Israel, and the interference in the region, which causes the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to escalate. Over the past year, Israel and its citizens have been increasingly faced with the deadly combination of these two factors. To quote but one example: the Lebanese Islamist terrorist movement, Hizbollah, closely linked to Syria and the Islamic Republic of Iran, has for years been actively building its own terrorist network on the West Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore again ask the Council and Commission, as a matter of urgency, what conclusions they draw from this with regard to entering into association and trade agreements with the countries I have named. After all, both European institutions are in favour of fighting international terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Menéndez del Valle, allow me once more to cross swords with you. At the end of paragraph 25, you express your hope that you will be able, as soon as possible, to welcome the new Palestinian Prime Minister to this House’s Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. Why are you overlooking his Israeli counterpart? An invitation to both appears to me to be a parliamentary approach that would have a more balanced, peaceful and dignified effect on the Middle East conflict. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the respectable culture that is represented here.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some interesting points that I want to mention in the minute and a half that I have left, and I quote: ‘<span class="italic">La situation inquiétante qui règne actuellement en Irak constitue un facteur supplémentaire de déstabilisation au Moyen-Orient, ce qui rend plus urgent les perspectives de paix concrètes. </span><span class="italic">Hélas..’ </span>[‘The current disturbing situation in Iraq is a further factor of destabilisation in the Middle East, which makes even more urgent and necessary a concrete perspective of peace… Alas…’] Alas, Mr Menéndez del Valle, of course, you are an orphan of Saddam Hussein! The Middle East was more stable then, but let us move on.</p>
<p class="contents">It is an interesting fact that, after three years of <span class="italic">intifada</span>, 60% of Palestinians live on less than two dollars per day. Two dollars per day, Mr Menéndez del Valle, is what your CAP, your Europe, gives to any four-legged creature born between Finland and southern Sicily. Here, however, you are offering peace: not work, nor even dignity. I agree with Mr Belder, who spoke before me. The UNDP, which does have some knowledge of the matter, has raised a problem: the right to democracy. The Israeli people choose; you do not like their choices, and I do not like them either, but do you want to take them away from them? We want democracy for the Palestinians, but for which ones? You want immediate elections, like those in Cambodia, which you, to your shame, applauded, and now there are murders, as we predicted.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry, Mr President, for having taken a second or two too long, but I know, and not from today, that I am working in a parliament that descends directly in line from Vichy, with a faint echo of the parliaments of the European Far East: you know which ones I am alluding to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wonder, therefore, what the point of the report is and whether it is really helpful, particularly as it does not take a truly detached position, as we have heard from the rapporteur already this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">In fairness, though, through amendment in committee it is now more balanced than it was. Its theme is the call for urgent implementation of the Road Map, a point on which we can all agree. But I have difficulty with the rapporteur's frequent insistence on a greater role for the European Union. He proposes introduction of the euro, an international mandate in Palestine and deployment of an international force on the ground. There seems to be some indecent haste in trying to invent roles for putative EU-badged military forces, which is all part of some other agenda and little to do with the Middle East peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">We should recall that United Nations monitoring and observer forces have been in the Middle East for 50 years and they have singularly failed to prevent either conflict or terrorism. The experience is that an international force does not secure peace but provides cover for its violation. Let us not forget that this area of the Middle East was under a mandate, a League of Nations mandate, for some 26 years, from 1922. It was then the United Nations which divided the area into a Jewish state and an Arab state. The fundamental problem is that, with the honourable exception of Egypt and Jordan, the Arab and other states of the greater Middle East have refused to recognise the existence of the state of Israel. A key element of phase III of the Road Map is Arab state acceptance of full normal relations with Israel. This is long overdue, and Iran needs to be there as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Arab states have also, along with the United Nations, helped institutionalise the Palestine refugee question, so that it has provided fuel for hatred, instability and terrorism for over 50 years. Unrealistic expectations are still being kept alive. The UN Relief and Works Agency began providing the basics of life for Palestinian refugees in 1950 and now has over 4 million on its books. Why in the name of humanity have the Arab states allowed this situation to persist? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I thank the rapporteur for having added some water to his wine, if I might use that expression.</p>

I am also unhappy with paragraph 40 which, in a dishonest and shocking way, sets the Palestinian and Israeli education systems on a par with one another and lastly, paragraph 65, which once again, as I often have to say, raises the threat in this Parliament of suspending the agreement, a measure that would be counter-productive for the little chance of peace that exists. It is for the sake of balance that I will be voting against most of the amendments, not, for example, because I approve of the Israeli raid into Syria, but because I would have liked those who denounce it here and now to condemn the horrific attack in Haifa – which caused nineteen deaths – with the same virtuous indignation. Nothing has been said about this, however, or about the anti-Semitic words of the Malaysian Prime Minister, which are scandalous and unprecedented at this level. We are very far from having the balance that preceding speakers have advocated, Mr Poos in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to say one final thing, Mr President, on the Swiss agreements which, of course, I welcome, as I welcome any initiative for peace. I do, however, have a closing question: why did we not applaud Taba to the same extent, where the proposals on the table were more or less the same, but on that occasion made by the elected Israeli Government?</p>

<p class="contents">I have the impression that the sleep of reason, as Francisco de Goya said, produces monsters, and, sometimes, I also feel that these monsters, which are, in actual fact, the result of the dehumanisation of mankind, are among us. I sense in this House the inability to understand the suffering of others, the inability to understand that time is running out and that, whilst we have been discussing what solutions to adopt for months, for years, people are, in fact, still dying in Palestine and Israel. The inhumanity that I sense here is one that does not understand the daily suffering of living under military occupation, the injustice that children suffer. Of course, there is talk of the pain and suffering of Israeli children that are killed by human bombs but, for Heaven’s sake, we must stop this and start seeing things as they are. There are United Nations resolutions that are not enforced. Let us begin to think about these things and experience them, see the people, go to the places and understand. This is why I said that the sleep of reason produces monsters.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with the report, which is very important and quite clearly stresses its refusal of violence, but stresses just as clearly the right to live in peace, to build. Time is short and I believe that two initiatives are extremely important. Today, we have had Naomi Kazan and Jamal Zakut here; we are going to have Yossi Beilin and Yasser Abed Rabbo here. These are the courageous ones, the people that have the courage to say: let us build, let us work, let us plan; just as all those Israeli voices are courageous – and they are those that we should listen to – like the pilots that refuse to go and bomb. This is something of great importance.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an extremely serious problem: the wall. Mr Poettering said this at the last Parliamentary sitting too: the wall is a disgrace. The wall is destructive, but, above all, it is an annexation of territory. One cannot annex territory and colonise and then want peace. There can only be peace where there is mutual respect. We are giving a strong signal with this report and I believe that we must continue in this direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The number of people living in poverty has tripled. The Palestinian people are starving, when they are not being killed by Israeli bullets. The social and economic crisis is worsening in Israel too, and even the most vulnerable communities are not spared. The situation in Iraq is a further factor for destabilisation in the region. The European Council of 16 and 17 October confirmed that the Mediterranean region was of crucial importance. We should also support the democratic process, assist social and economic development and strengthen political dialogue to ensure that the region is finally able to enjoy peace.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Menéndez del Valle states in his report, there can be no military solution. We must break free of this downward spiral of violence and get back on the track of negotiations and of ensuring that the law is observed. We must force Israel to end this process of establishing settlements and this military occupation, which lie at the root of this appalling situation. It is equally crucial to exert all possible pressure, including economic and trade pressure, not only to stop the construction of this apartheid-style wall, but also to destroy it. This wall is a human and environmental disaster, and is also an affront to the values that we hold dear. These actions run counter to the commitments given in the road map.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our duty to encourage all peace initiatives and in this area, we should attach particular importance to the peace plan known as the ‘Swiss agreement’. We believe that this is a moderate and balanced plan, even if many, who are being asked to make further compromises, find it hard to accept. Although it provides no real answer to the refugee question, this agreement is needed, in order to restore confidence and to give new hope to the two peoples. As we have often said, only the existence of two democratic, sovereign and viable States, as recognised in the 1967 borders, with Jerusalem as the capital, will allow the justice and dignity crucial to peace to be established and provide for a future that offers real possibilities. This agreement allows the legitimacy of international law to be re-established. We must do everything we can to ensure that this is supported by the Quartet, particularly by the Europeans. I would like to express my fear to you, my fear of seeing a new hope dashed, leaving the way open for an even more radical approach, which would only benefit those who prefer violence to the law and war to peace. We have a major political responsibility: we must assume this responsibility in the eyes of history and in the eyes of the world and we must break this silence, which would make us just as guilty for this new crime against humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I wish to pay tribute to the courage of the progressive forces in Israel and of all those who refuse to carry out missions that they consider to be illegal and which cause civilian deaths. We must offer them our utmost solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, we must emphasise civilian missions, in which international organisations play the role of moderator and protector: as a result of their action on the ground, they successfully conduct a citizens’ diplomacy, where our international diplomacy is unable to act. We must ask the Commission and the Council to ask the UN Security Council to send a peacekeeping force to protect the Palestinian people, their heritage and their environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whether this agreement becomes an historic turning point, as I sincerely hope it will, or else a fiasco will now depend entirely upon the reception given to it by the Israeli population and upon the international reactions, especially the EU’s.</p>
<p class="contents">We have here for the first time a unified plan dealing with all the problems of the conflict: the division of Jerusalem, the rights of the Palestinian refugees, the Temple Mount and the Wailing Wall, the settlements and the way in which the borders are drawn. This agreement may still manage to rescue the otherwise almost defunct Road Map. As the Geneva Agreement looks, so too can peace come to look. Most importantly of all, the composition of the Palestinian delegation, representing a broad cross-section of the Palestinian leadership, has now given Sharon the negotiating partners that he has until now maintained did not exist and that he succeeded in making the Israeli population believe did not exist.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must now strongly support the Geneva Agreement. It has shown that there is still life in the Israeli peace wing, which now genuinely has the chance of being strengthened. Both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples want peace. The Geneva Agreement seems to be the surest way of achieving it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This violence has risen to a new and particularly dangerous level for the region and is causing misery for the civilian populations. We have come a long way from the stone-throwing of the first Intifada: what has succeeded this are the suicide attacks against Israel’s civilian population and this terror is met by the systematic use of intelligent weapons of targeted destruction, which also kill civilians – this time Palestinians.</p>
<p class="contents">Some sort of balance in terror is achieved, prospects for a political solution tend to disappear and the dead are counted, Given these circumstances, the Geneva Israeli-Palestinian initiative does well to return the issue of peace to the very heart of the debate. In an attempt to escape the feeling of inevitability surrounding the spiral of violence, the leading players have chosen boldness, in stark contrast with the pre-election paralysis afflicting the US and with Europe’s structural lethargy.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of proposing small steps, the ‘Geneva Agreement’ wholeheartedly embraces the fundamental issues, which have been studiously ignored both by the Oslo Agreement and the Road map, but follows the approach set out at Taba. No area is considered taboo and even the most contentious points are examined: Jerusalem, the Holy places, in particular the Dome of the Rock, or Temple Mount, which would be placed under Palestinian sovereignty, the recognition of Israel, the renunciation of the right of return to Israel of the 1948 refugees and their descendants, a viable Palestinian State, the settlements and land sharing.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add in this regard that the parallel drawn just now by the rapporteur between the Berlin and the Israeli walls does not stand up to scrutiny: the Berlin wall divided a single State, the artificial division of which we never recognised, the Israeli wall, although we can dispute the line it follows, can be considered to be the outline of a border between two States, which we dearly wish to see established instead of the current situation of occupation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Israeli and Palestinian authors of the Geneva Agreement have decided that tensions run so high today that, in order to encourage the two main players to leave behind the mindset of reprisals in which they are currently locked, small steps in the field of security would be more difficult to define and would generate even more misunderstandings than presenting an overall peace plan. The political basis underpinning this plan is undeniably flimsy: its authors are, it must be admitted, not highly representative of Israeli and Palestinian public opinion. We must, therefore, focus on the method that has been selected: that of not swerving from the ultimate aims. It is the substance of the proposals that must take priority. Our debate tonight, Mr President, can make a contribution to this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore quite right to call for peace and dignity in the Middle East. It must apply to everyone equally – Israelis and Palestinians alike. The time has undoubtedly come to seek a way out of the hopelessness of the situation. However, the signs are not very encouraging. The Oslo process has run its course, and the Quartet’s Road Map is at risk of becoming bogged down in the no-man’s-land of hatred and mistrust as well.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are witnessing every day is an obviously divided Palestinian leadership which is either unable or unwilling to tackle terrorism effectively – a leadership which does not condemn the suicide bombings for the murderous attacks that they really are. On the other side, we have military reactions and over-reactions which claim the lives of the innocent and the guilty alike, but which contribute nothing to resolving the problem. The security fence is an expression of both power and powerlessness, and under no circumstances should it pre-empt the drawing of a final border.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, there are peace plans, such as the Geneva Accord and other initiatives, which we in Parliament welcome. They have just one disadvantage: they appear, at least so far, to be a minority programme. The political goal of two states – Israeli and Palestinian – co-existing peacefully must continue to be pursued by all political and diplomatic means. There must be no retrograde step towards an international mandate for Palestine, and nor must there be any suspension of the Association Council, which is and must remain an important bridge for dialogue. Although Mr Menéndez del Valle’s report has been substantially improved by the motions proposed by my group, I will recommend to my delegation that it abstain from voting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It espouses Arafat’s argument unreservedly and completely overlooks what is today’s most pressing question: how can a democracy combat kamikaze terrorism effectively? Then it is morally reprehensible because it puts terrorists and the victims of terrorism on the same level. And you get the impression that some people think the idea that the Jews should respond instead of doing nothing and letting themselves be killed like in the good old days is rather shocking or scandalous. Lastly, it is politically sterile because it locks Europe into a position of powerlessness on the grounds that it cannot be recognised as impartial and therefore capable of acting as mediator.

<p class="contents">There is, as I have always said, an element missing from the Roadmap. The events of last weekend and this week have once again illustrated that the Roadmap cannot lead to peace without any foreign help.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea is being mooted that NATO should intervene in the area. I am not a NATO fan, but anything is better than standing by idly. Even medical personnel are now being numbered among the victims.</p>
<p class="contents">The mutual violence defies all imagination. What is happening in Haifa is terrible to my mind. We visited the area with the delegation and what is happening there is absolutely dreadful.</p>
<p class="contents">An intervention force is needed to organise the disarmament of all resistance groups, as was done in Bosnia. However, Prime Minister Sharon will only accept this under American pressure, which is absent.</p>
<p class="contents">The only alternative is a change in policy or in the government of Israel, which the new Geneva peace plan can bring about. Discussion of this in Israel is gathering pace. The plan requires major sacrifices on both sides, as well as courage. However, we need to skip certain steps of the Roadmap; otherwise, we will never reach our goal.</p>
<p class="contents">As Vice-Chairman of this House’s Israel delegation, I support this new peace plan, and so I would be glad to be present when it is signed. Our group is asking for Parliament’s support in Article 13(b), on which we will vote tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">This afternoon, Parliament welcomed as its guests two initiators, and the interest was overwhelming. These people are bearers of hope in these anxious days. Next month, a delegation of the Knesset will be paying us a visit, and it would be good if we were to organise a joint debate on this.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude with the words of Naomi Chazan, who stated this afternoon: to be pro-Israel, you need to be pro-Palestine and <span class="italic">vice versa</span>.

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, although this document promotes the application of the Roadmap, and its main aim is to promote the peace process, I do not believe it is an objective document.</p>
<p class="contents">In the assessment of the facts I note many biases in favour of the Palestinian Authority, a position which will contribute to confusing and weakening Europe's role in future negotiations, since if we want to contribute to peace, we must have credibility in both sectors and this must be recognised.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this bias is reflected, for example, in the successive condemnations of the Israeli Government and in the great silences on the behaviour of the Palestinian Authority, and I repeat, the great silences. For example, in paragraph 4 it says that the Palestinian Authority is congratulated on having publicly and unconditionally accepted the Roadmap, when we know – and we have evidence of this – that Arafat, having rejected peace in Taba, has refused to accept any measure which may undermine his power, both in relation to the organisation of a single security system and in relation to the transfer of powers to Abu Mazen firstly and now, to the Prime Minister designate, Abu Ala. Furthermore, we know that some of the recent attacks, which have created many victims, are directly or indirectly related to the martyrs of Al Aqsa and to events at the Muqata, and I am not accusing anybody here. </p>
<p class="contents">And above all I am worried about certain paragraphs which are only going to serve to increase the tensions and reduce Europe's credibility, such as, for example, the ambiguity in relation to condemning Palestinian terrorism and the clear desire to separate it entirely from the Palestinian Authority or even worse alliances, more dangerous than those made between democratic parties in the open, documented by means of extreme tolerance towards terrorists, and the lack of a firm, clear and transparent security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, apart from certain condemnations of Israeli methods – which I approve in the document, such as the construction of the wall, which I cannot accept, or the aggressiveness of the armed responses in Palestinian territory, as well as the destruction of infrastructures and other forms of reducing the Palestinian standard of living – I believe that the text does not insist sufficiently on the Palestinians’ commitment to accepting democracy and to build a government capable of taking on its responsibilities. And the first part of the Roadmap includes the development of the foundations for a democratic system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to express my strongest indignation at what Mr Gahrton said just now in justification of terrorist violence and to say that while the occupation must be condemned – it is questionable and I have many criticisms of Israeli policy in that respect – it does not justify terrorism and never will. Terrorism is a crime against humanity, it is absolutely evil, without equivalent, and must be condemned. I really would like to know what the connection is between young people who blow themselves up in discos or people who are murdered in restaurants and the occupation. I think the comparison is absolutely outrageous. Personally, it makes me want to throw up.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming back to the three things I want to say about this report, first of all, as I said, terrorism really cannot be put on the same plane as the criticisms that might legitimately be made of Israeli policy. They are two different things, different in the moral hierarchy and in the hierarchy of evil. Then I would like to mention sanctions, in particular the breaking off of the association agreement. Breaking off that agreement is a sanction against a people, and since our Assembly called for the embargo against Iraq to be lifted on the grounds that a people should not be punished for the acts of its leaders, I do not think we should punish the people of Israel, especially when we have just voted for an association agreement with Lebanon, which can tell us a lot about occupation, being a country that is occupied, annexed by Syria, whether we condemn it or not.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, my third comment is about the international mandate, which takes us back 50 years. I would like to point out, however, that what was passionately refused yesterday is being demanded passionately today: the 1967 borders, the division of Palestine into two or the Clinton criteria. That is what is being called for today after overturning the table. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a Green and pacifist, I obviously reject all violence, but I also note that international law draws a distinction between violence on the part of occupying forces and the forms of resistance directed by oppressed peoples in colonies and occupied countries against the occupying powers. I personally am, however, a pacifist and prefer to see non-violent methods used even against an occupying power. This may be seen from the Minutes, and it is the view I take. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
