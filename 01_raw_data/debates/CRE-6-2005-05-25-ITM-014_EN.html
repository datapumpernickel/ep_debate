<p class="contents">At present, the work of the Union’s legislative bodies is often shrouded in scepticism and lack of concern. It is our especial duty and obligation to change this. This aim could be accomplished by means of the careful definition of the mandate and function of the Fundamental Rights Agency, the guarantee of its efficient operation and for its role to be known as widely as possible. The Union’s announcement, that development has shifted from an economic community to a political community of common interests, is timely and if the Union is to have a Constitution that includes the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the human rights dimension must also become stronger. Since it is one of the principles of the Union that fundamental rights should be treated with priority in its policy, an Agency should be set up to monitor whether these high<span class="bold">–</span>sounding fundamental principles are being observed and to ensure that exercising fundamental human rights becomes a people<span class="bold">–</span>oriented, everyday practice instead of just bare legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">And now, Mr President, let me continue in English. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, following the decision of the European Council in December 2003, this own<span class="bold">–</span>initiative report seeks to set out the means towards the aim of extending the remit of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia and converting it into a Fundamental Rights Agency. The committee and the groups agreed on my approach and although 120 amendments were tabled to the report, we managed to achieve 25 compromise amendments by which all the members of our committee have contributed to the development of fundamental rights within the Union. This led to an absolute majority with only three votes against.</p>
<p class="contents">The core issues during the debate on the report in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs focused around certain problems. One was whether a new agency should be established at all. The main argument here, especially on the side of the PPE<span class="bold">–</span>DE Group, was that there are already too many agencies that are not sufficiently cost<span class="bold">–</span>effective and that thereby many of the tasks of the European institutions, such as Parliament or the Commission, would be delegated to agencies. I tried to make a clear point in this respect in my report. The credibility of the Agency, and our credibility, will be ensured by its well<span class="bold">–</span>defined mandate and structure.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee also asked that Parliament should have a more important role in the structure, mandate and work of this body. As a main legal basis had to be found, we invoked Article 13. But I must emphasise that this Agency has to have a broader mandate, covering the Charter of Fundamental Rights in its totality. Therefore I ask the Commissioner not to interpret this article only in a restrictive sense.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to make the hardly understandable legal language and structures clear, effective and operational and we need even more active cooperation between Council, Commission and Parliament. I can see this Agency cooperating, building the information it gathers on a network of networks, in which we can find a clear way through the jungle of European, national and regional institutions and centres dealing with human rights throughout Europe. Cooperation has to be a keyword in this field when we look at the Council of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to use and build upon what has been achieved so far in the Council of Europe, not only symbolically but also in practical day<span class="bold">–</span>by<span class="bold">–</span>day terms. It is important that a functional model of cooperation be developed, as was emphasised at the Warsaw Summit. I think that the Agency could be a means towards this end. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(HU)</span> The protection of national minorities has become a very important issue since EU enlargement and it has also become clear that combating xenophobia and discrimination is not enough in itself to guarantee minority rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It is certainly a crucial move to create equality of rights and not to tolerate discrimination. However, this is only one, surface treatment of the subject. In order to get a firm grip on tackling this problem, it is not enough to treat the symptoms, but we must dig to the roots and treat the malady in order to create equal opportunities. This complicated subject must be examined from various perspectives. Therefore, a separate section of the Agency must deal with traditional national minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a very sensitive task, and a great challenge today, to monitor the implementation of rights and to find a balance between the granting of individual freedoms and achieving collective security. Therefore, the Agency must stand in the centre of a European movement striving towards better observance of fundamental rights and it must apply all the knowledge from previous experience in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">The goal is to be able to put the fundamental rights into the centre of all possible policies and provisions, so that we can really think of Europe as a symbol of these basic freedoms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Both myself and the Commission are in agreement with the outlook, the spirit and the aims of the report, which have just been mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the sphere of justice, security and freedom, the Commission has centred its operations on the promotion and protection of people’s fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the decision made by President Barroso before this House, we formed a group of Commissioners who are precisely responsible for coordinating the Commission’s policies aimed at promoting and protecting fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">My proposal to the Commission to carry out an impact assessment on each of its proposals ensuring the protection and promotion of fundamental rights has already been adopted. It is a precautionary impact assessment, which allows the Commission to only adopt measures that will enable us to make progress in our attempts to better protect fundamental rights. The request came from Parliament, and I was in full agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the 10 priority measures included in the action plan implementing the so<span class="bold">–</span>called ‘Hague Programme’ for a European area of freedom, security and justice, which was approved by the Commission on 6 May, I have placed the principle of Europe’s promotion and protection of fundamental rights at the very top. This emphasis clearly demonstrates how, in my opinion, the protection of fundamental rights is a priority that cuts across all of the Union’s policy areas, particularly when, as has been stressed a number of times, including in front of this House, it is a case of balancing citizens’ strong calls for security with respect for people’s fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I entirely agree with the rapporteur’s calls for a European agency equipped with a broad remit, which is able to truly take charge of promoting and protecting all fundamental rights. A broad remit, which would justify a new agency being created.</p>
<p class="contents">I too am convinced that there is a need to very clearly state that only a strong and effective agency can justify the conversion of the Vienna Observatory, as decided by the European Council and approved by this House, into a genuine European agency. I would add that this is, however, on the understanding that the agency’s objectives are the protection and promotion of fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Commission, I can state that the report presented today meets with our full approval.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that Parliament must have an important role. I agree, in fact, that it should participate in the agency’s governing body – this is a symbolic aspect, but also an important one. I also agree that Parliament should have its say in appointing the agency’s director, but we obviously have to resolve any strictly legal issues, which do exist and which we must take into consideration. They are issues concerning one or other legal basis, according to the remit that we wish to grant to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond the choice of legal basis, which will correspond to the remit assigned to the agency, I can confirm once again the political commitment of the Commission to take full account of Parliament’s proposals, amendments and guidelines, irrespective of the legal basis selected.</p>
<p class="contents">There are clearly many possibilities: the possibility of a formal codecision process, which would be restricted, however, as many of you already know from a legal analysis, to only certain fundamental rights, or else a different procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if this different procedure were finally adopted, the political solution would not change in my opinion, that is to say, that it would remain the duty of the Commission to defend the proposals of this House and to take them before the Council. Its duty would be to defend them in substance, even if the legal basis were to be different. I therefore confirm this commitment, by once again thanking the rapporteur for her report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I consider that the report is complete and that its contents create preconditions for the protection of citizens' personal data and fundamental rights in general.</p>
<p class="contents">The incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Constitutional Treaty and the future accession of the European Union to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms will certainly create a legal obligation for the Union to promote the protection of human rights in all policy sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">International cooperation by the European Union in this sensitive sector must be strengthened. At this point, I should like to comment on paragraphs 24 and 25 of the report and on paragraph 3 of the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education, where it says that collaboration between the Council of Europe and the Agency should assume an institutional form.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, in order for the collaboration in question to be effective, the states should apply the harmonisation for which provision is made in the resolutions of the Council of Europe. Creating a culture of respect for fundamental rights should be the Agency's priority and should be implemented, among other things, by developing a communication strategy. The structure of the Agency should, in my opinion, also support special departments to deal with mass media communication issues, such as, for example, the concentration of the media, transparency and freedom of the press and expression.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider that a 'yes' vote for this report will be a fundamental step and tool within the framework of freedoms and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the objective of the Agency is to develop a communication strategy which will help to create a culture of respect for fundamental rights and I think, despite any opinions voiced to the contrary, that this is a very important issue, as is its proposed structure. That is why I believe that a more attentive reading of the specific point of the creation of the Agency would be constructive. The rapporteur insists on and analyses this in her report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I myself was involved in one example where a very important report on anti<span class="bold">– </span>Semitism seemed either to have been suppressed or improperly handled by that Agency, and it was my view then that far too much politics had been allowed to enter into the activities of the Agency in respect of that matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I would like to have clear assurances, with regard to the new arrangements, that first of all the new Agency with these wider and different roles will be objective, that it will behave in a sensitive manner and not allow any politics to enter into its work. On top of that I would also want assurances that it will be properly accountable through parliamentary control. What disappoints me is that quite often we say this is intended, but in practice it does not occur. So this time we must insist on these provisions and insist on these matters being secured.</p>
<p class="contents">The only other matter I would like to raise is the issue of the need for a separate gender institute. I believe that it is totally unnecessary: we always have to careful about bureaucracy. I am very satisfied that this Agency will do its work in such an objective manner that it will be able to cope with the extra burdens that will be put upon it by dealing with the issues that would otherwise be dealt with by a separate institute.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate Mrs Gál on her report and I certainly believe that with the kind of assurances that I am asking for it will have a successful start and a successful period of operation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We hope that the creation of this agency will make it possible to establish a real policy on fundamental rights. It is worth repeating that our top priority for the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice is the active promotion of fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you that the inclusion of human dignity in Article 1 of the Charter on Fundamental Rights was a real change of direction. We, and governments, must take an approach that takes account of the honour of each and every person, the basis for the dignity of every citizen. People will be free if they have a place and rights in our society that we have organised to this end. And we all know that the rights to speak and write freely, to elect one’s representatives and to live as one wishes have no real meaning for people who, in their daily lives, do not have the necessary material means to ensure their dignity. We all know that, without the necessary dignity, there is a risk that universal rights will benefit only some.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Frattini has made a commitment to present the report on the creation of the Fundamental Rights Agency under the codecision procedure. We have listened to what you have just said, Commissioner, but we would restate that we absolutely insist on this procedure. MEPs are the elected representatives of the citizens of Europe. As the creation of a Fundamental Rights Agency would have a direct effect on the daily lives of citizens, the opinion of the European Parliament must be clearly heard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very pleased we are voting on this tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Union is entering a new phase. We are in the process of creating a legal obligation for the Union to ensure that fundamental rights are actively promoted across all policy areas. The proposed Fundamental Rights Agency would be the practical tool in this work.</p>
<p class="contents">Its main mandate covers what happens inside the Union. At the same time we know that just outside the Union’s borders there are literally slave markets, where young women and girls are sold to be trafficked into the sex industry in different parts of our Union. For instance, it is estimated that every day about 40 girls are sold from these kinds of slave markets in Moldova. This is the worst case of human rights violation occurring in our part of the world and the Fundamental Rights Agency should be able to confront it.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore I hope that this House will confirm the vote of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs to the effect that the Agency should also be able to cover third countries when they are involved in human rights issues affecting the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I also hope that this House will state clearly that the future gender institute at the very least should work closely with and be situated in the same location as the Fundamental Rights Agency. This is rational and cost<span class="bold">– </span>effective, but more importantly it should be the obvious line of thinking for anyone who believes that women’s rights are human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The many threats to which we are exposed on a daily basis teach us that positive and proactive policies are needed not only to guarantee security, but also to secure freedom, as the latter is not merely a matter of justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur is aware of this fact, and has based her report upon it. I should like to thank her for doing so and to congratulate her, as this really is an eminently suitable basis for such a key decision. I am well aware of how difficult this decision was, because I too, in my capacity as rapporteur on the Article 7 procedure, have had a brief taster of the intra<span class="bold">–</span>group disputes that Mr Kirkhope also mentioned in passing. It is my firm belief that these stem primarily from the perpetual fear that the European Union could regain authority in certain fields, rather than from any other fears. My group is absolutely delighted that a number of principles have been agreed on in the course of these disputes.</p>
<p class="contents">This agency is intended to act in support of the Member States, rather than to take decisions on their behalf. The aim is not to put in place blanket surveillance systems, but to provide institutional support, an early<span class="bold">–</span>warning system and an instrument for awareness raising and dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">Information and activities will be linked up by this agency rather than bureaucratised, and I believe that anyone working in this field will be aware of the urgent need for a European network of networks, as mentioned by the rapporteur. The intention is not that courts should compete among themselves, but that legal disputes over the prevention of human rights violations in Europe should be avoided. No one wants to see Europe assuming the role of Big Brother to the rest of the world, or for it to be overeager to see motes in the eyes of its neighbours; what we want is for it to take a critical look at itself, and to carry out continual and critical assessments of the human rights situation within its own borders.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank the rapporteur, and to assure her of our support. I hope that the Commission will give due consideration to Parliament’s special role as an advocate of fundamental rights, human rights and civil liberties, and that it will also comply with this House’s wishes by providing an appropriate legal basis for this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An independent body is required, which also has strong links with the European Parliament. It is also important that, on this issue, codecision processes can be arrived at between Council and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important aspect, moreover, is monitoring the situation with regard to fundamental rights violations in third countries. All too often we are helpless bystanders and all too often our cooperation links pave the way for fundamental rights violations to take place in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the difference between this agency and the European Court of Human Rights should be highlighted. The European Court intervenes in individual cases, whereas the remit of this agency will be to monitor a political system in its entirety, and to also monitor the legal instruments that may not comply with universally recognised standards in the area of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we are dealing with an extremely important matter, because all too often we, as Members of the European Parliament, report instances of human rights violations without having the means to prevent them from recurring. Today, for instance, a boat sank off the coast of Lampedusa. If it had been the first time, we could have considered it to be an isolated incident. In contrast, such incidents occur all too often and it is necessary, therefore, to carefully assess the legislation in force. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What this House is debating, however, is yet another new agency which is to be given institutional form, and which has been clothed in fine rhetoric. This agency will of course be set up at the expense of European taxpayers.

At the same time, since these fundamental rights serve as a calling card for the EU, both inside and outside its borders, priority should be given to all measures that could lead to improvements in this crucial field, and we should lend our support to a human rights agency with a wide<span class="bold">–</span>ranging remit. I would, however, add one important caveat.</p>
<p class="contents">The main EU institutions bear the brunt of the responsibility for protecting fundamental rights, since the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties, Parliament represents the interests of citizens, the Council represents the interests of the Member States, and, most importantly, the European Court of Justice is the supreme body of legal protection. This responsibility must not be disputed or otherwise jeopardised, and so there must be clear guidelines for the agency, which needs to play a subordinate role.</p>
<p class="contents">A broader exchange of know<span class="bold">–</span>how and experience would allow overall improvements to be made to EU standards, and useful improvements could be made in this field if existing institutions, instruments and procedures were networked. The latter must not be duplicated, however, and we must also avoid any increase in bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="contents">What is particularly important is that this agency should not be set up as a forum for bureaucratic carping. It is for this reason, and not for the reason given previously, that paragraph 47 of Mrs Gál’s otherwise excellent report should be rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">If the agency adheres to these guidelines, there is every chance that it will play a valuable part in protecting European fundamental rights, a task that – after all – falls to all of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Since the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Union has legislated in sectors which touch more directly and indirectly on human rights. The protection of personal data, the right to asylum, equal and transparent access to justice, the fight against every form of discrimination or the protection of minorities are central components of the promotion of human dignity in a Europe of the citizens and not simply of trade or of unilateral emphasis on security at any cost.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that it intervenes legislatively in these – and in all – sectors, the effect of future decisions by the Union on the fundamental rights of its citizens needs to be evaluated if the legislator is to be able to do his job properly. However, paradoxically, no harmonising mechanisms or procedures have yet been provided for the European Union institutions, so that this evaluation can be carried out adequately.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, if we want to do our job properly, we need to acquire an agency, internal assistance if you like, which will support us in our job, such as the future Fundamental Rights Agency. This organisation should not be a study centre; it should be an independent and particularly sensitive antenna which collects information and which evaluates and jointly assists with authority and independence the development and protection of fundamental rights, especially in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it goes without saying that the credentials and structure of this agency must be predefined by the legislator, with the European Parliament therefore as co<span class="bold">–</span>legislator.

That is why I welcome Mrs Gál’s report and the establishment of the fundamental rights agency. However, we must not make too many demands upon the agency or it will fail in the beginning. It needs to work in conjunction with the three institutions and ensure that the proposals coming from those institutions are compatible with and not in contradiction of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and our international obligations. Its focus should be within the EU, but at the same time it should have a role in the formulation of our EU Association agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome this consultation process but I will pay more heed to the concrete proposals that will follow.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say two things. Mr Kirkhope, who is no longer in the Chamber, said that politics should not enter the work of the agency.

Decisions to end infringement of fundamental rights must be taken in the political context and cannot be taken regardless of those consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, some political delegations in this House have never voted in favour of non<span class="bold">–</span>discrimination measures. That in itself party politicises non<span class="bold">–</span>discrimination measures and fundamental rights. Mr Pęk was vehemently against this: European taxpayers will pay. If European taxpayers had not paid, we would still be under the stranglehold of the demonisation that followed the Second World War and Soviet domination. We must have the guts to pay for our freedoms and defend them. If Mr Pęk and Mr Mote are against it, Mrs Gál must have taken the right route and I recommend this report to the House.</p>

This commitment to human rights must be given concrete form from now on and it must be obligatory for the fundamental rights dimension to be incorporated into any new legislative proposals. As Socialist coordinator in this Parliament’s Sub<span class="bold">–</span>Committee on Human Rights, I am in favour of the creation of the Fundamental Rights Agency. I understand the concerns expressed by certain Members, but I entirely disagree with their opinion; this is one of the most important agencies. By means of the powers proposed in the report, the Agency will ensure that we act consistently in terms of promoting and protecting human rights. We therefore support the decision that this initiative should be treated as a legislative initiative by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is very important for the House to demonstrate its support and to be heard where initiative on fundamental rights are concerned. This democratic platform that we are going to create will benefit everybody: Member States, international bodies, civil society and third countries. The request for transversality of fundamental and human rights must also, and especially, be taken into account in the Union’s foreign policy. Finally, this decision can only lead to greater and better promotion and protection of human rights, inside and outside the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its institutional structure should not frighten us, but we should rather give our congratulations for this initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">I certainly agree with people who believe that the protection of human rights must be viewed in a political context, there is no other way. I would, however, like to emphasise the issue of cooperation between the institutions. I believe that the various institutions that the EU has recently established, or will establish in the future, must prove that they are able to cooperate in an ideal fashion, strengthen each other, and really carry out effective work with the help of civil organisations and civil initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">I, myself, am a member of an equal opportunities working group and believe that the Institute for Equal Opportunities, which is soon to be established, will need to participate in this work. The work of the European Roma Forum, that ‘specialises’ in monitoring discrimination, may also contribute to the success of this future Institute. I congratulate the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that EU action on fundamental rights and freedoms requires positive intervention and not only protection.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Commission, I would like to illustrate what the agency must not represent. It must not and cannot be a super court of law, or a new legislator, because the legislative function is entrusted to you, to the Commission and to the Council, and certainly not to the agency.</p>
<p class="contents">The agency must not and cannot be a bureaucratic structure for accusing the Member States, but rather an organisation serving all of the EU institutions, an effective organisation providing assistance to Member States and support for their policies. It must not be an organisation for solving isolated issues or for spreading controversy, as someone said. The agency can be none of those things.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with those who said that we need European awareness directed towards the respect of fundamental rights and freedoms. Duplications with other organisations and bureaucratic inefficiencies must therefore be avoided. On this point, I believe that the work of the Council of Europe must be taken into consideration in the light of its far<span class="bold">–</span>reaching importance. We intend to agree upon a common line with the Council of Europe in order to avoid overlaps and to utilise its crucial experience.</p>
<p class="contents">Some people have reintroduced the subject of geographical competence: should its mandate be only inside the Member States or also outside them? We will devote particular attention to the debate and to the decision that will be adopted by Parliament, but I believe that, to begin with, the agency certainly can and must have geographical competence inside the Member States. This does not, however, exclude – with reference to candidate countries, for instance, or to those countries linked to Europe by the so<span class="bold">–</span>called neighbourhood policies – the possibility of action that does not consist of intervention, but of important monitoring efforts and of communicating information to this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude my speech by stressing the wholehearted desire of the Commission to maintain ongoing dialogue with Parliament, because it is unthinkable that, on such an important issue as fundamental rights, action should not be taken in direct and continuous contact with this House, paying attention to its opinions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
