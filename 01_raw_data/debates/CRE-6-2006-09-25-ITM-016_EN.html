<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ján Figeľ, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, once again, I would like to thank Mrs Prets, the Culture Committee’s rapporteur, for her commitment and constructive work, including several long meetings with my services and those of the Council. For similar reasons, let me also express gratitude to the Employment and Social Affairs Committee, and especially the rapporteur, Mr Kusstatscher. Thanks to their political will, flexibility and negotiating skills, we have been able to agree on a reliable compromise text.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me first refer to the main objectives of this proposal from the Commission. The aim of the charter is to lay down common principles to make all types of mobility for learning purposes more efficient and more effective. These principles include quality information and guidance for the candidates; a sound learning plan; preparation, especially linguistic preparation; adequate logistical support and mentoring schemes in the host country. We also want to make clear what the responsibilities of all stakeholders are and to ensure fair recognition and evaluation of the study and training on return.</p>
<p class="contents">We expect the charter to bring significant benefits to users. First, it should help make citizens more confident that mobility is useful and is being carried out in the right conditions. Additionally, it should make it easier for the large category of people learning in another country to exercise the right to move and study freely within the European Union. It should have a positive impact on the employability of those concerned. Indeed, the charter responds to the important components of the social dimension of the European Union: mobility, education and training for the acquisition of new skills and employability.</p>
<p class="contents">I come now to Mrs Prets’ report, which I welcome very much. I know that the European Parliament’s amendments mean that the text now fits even better with the objectives of the proposal. For instance, you point out that mobility is based on common values and on respect for diversity. You have extended the scope of the proposal to the specific needs of disadvantaged groups and people with disabilities. You have invited the Commission to encourage the use of a mobility charter by national agencies and other organisations. You have insisted on developing gender-specific statistical data and you have also mentioned the portability of government grants and loans to the host country.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, of the 36 amendments voted by the Culture Committee, only four have not been accepted by the Commission. That was not a refusal of the underlying ideas, however, but only because the matter was outside the scope of the proposal, or else covered by other parts of the text. All the remaining 32 amendments have been fully integrated, either literally or with slight rewording.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as you know, Coreper last week agreed on the compromise text. Not a single Member State opposed the text or maintained a reserve. That should ease the agreement in the first reading. Therefore, I ask this House to confirm the text in its vote. It should be an excellent conclusion to a most efficient cooperation between institutions. But, before that, I am open to your questions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Christa Prets (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, I am glad that we have been able, after long-drawn out wrangling, to agree on this document, and, moreover, that we have been able to produce it in good time before the Year of Mobility is over, for I do not think it would make much sense to roll out a Mobility Charter next year; that would not exactly have the desired effect on the outside world.</p>
<p class="contents">More to the point, this Charter is needed as an accompaniment to the new educational programmes that are due to start next year, in which we have put a great emphasis on quantity, in that we want, for example, to have three million students on the lifelong learning scheme by 2012, and 80 000 per annum on Leonardo. In view of that, the need for quality must not be ignored; it really must not be allowed to lose out. Quality must be guaranteed not only in the host countries in which students spend time, but also in their countries of origin, so that the best possible use can be made of their experiences when they return and can really be seen to be added.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to emphasise that mobility must not merely make them more employable; there is a purely personal benefit involved as well, for education is of value not least in that it is character-building, and should therefore ultimately also contribute to greater European understanding.</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter is intended for all those who want to complete a formal or informal period of education or further education abroad, but there must also be a certain balance, not only for the students’ benefit, but also to promote the use of the Leonardo programme and create more openings for businesses to take on trainees.</p>
<p class="contents">While I do believe that this document can set a lot of things in motion, that will depend on how it is received in the Member States. What we have set before this House is not legally binding, and so it is for the Member States to commit themselves to doing what it calls on them to do. We know that very many resolutions are adopted in the Council and accepted without dissent in the EU or within the Council, only to be inadequately implemented at national level. That would be sure to diminish young people’s confidence in what we are doing and also in our intentions.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, though, a number of points I would like to highlight, some of which you, Commissioner, have mentioned. It is important that there should be a Mobility Guide containing introductory information on mobility options, grants and contact addresses. It is also important that the various educational systems be made transparent and capable of being compared with one another, so that young people can know what is in store for them in this or that country. It is also, of course, important that there should be information on the recognition of diplomas, on financial and other support, and that language barriers should be removed.</p>
<p class="contents">The transferability of grants – to which Mrs Schöppges has already referred – is absolutely vital, in that it is needed, not least, alongside logistical support, insurance, residence and work permits, accommodation and preparations for travel, and is every bit as important as the transferability of loans. The same is true of social security insurance. If young people are going to venture to make this leap and be prepared to embark on this ‘foreign adventure’, then their own country’s social security system is one of the things they have to be able to ‘take away’ with them.</p>
<p class="contents">The intention is that the mobility charter should be seen as a frame of reference for making mobility more efficient and effective, with the persons using it having a checklist of ten matters to be sorted out before their departure, such as advice, information, and a learning plan; there are others, but it is not absolutely necessary that I discuss them now.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank all those who have played their part in putting this compromise together. That was not an easy thing to do, but we did eventually manage it. I am glad to see that all the groups have tabled amendments or compromise amendments, and that we will, no doubt, be able to get through tomorrow’s vote quickly and then be able to present a good report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, in considering this resolution, saw it as particularly important that vocation training should be treated as equal in value to general education. Our second concern was that it should be stressed that good continuous education and training is the best instrument for confronting unemployment and poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">The negotiations with the Council were both disappointing and revealing. I regret that I am unable to confirm the statements already made, according to which there was a high degree of consensus. The Council turned the procedure on its head as soon as it realised how willing the rapporteur of the lead committee was to compromise. We, representatives of Parliament, found ourselves being told by the Council what Parliament was permitted or forbidden to recommend. The rapid agreement made this a less than democratic process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This Charter is part of an attempt to go one step further in establishing the idea that education is an area in which cooperation among the various national systems is becoming crucial. If we want to promote mobility, then we shall have to improve the way in which we exchange our knowledge and our information, promote multilingualism, reduce the administrative obstacles and guarantee welfare cover and the portability of financial systems.</p>
<p class="contents">We will obviously have to ensure that candidates are prepared before their departure, monitored during their stay in the host country and reintegrated into their countries of origin. The finding that, despite the wide variety of specific programmes, mobility has not increased, confirms that this Charter is a step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Council has pointed out on more than one occasion that the area of education is a responsibility of the Member States. The compromise reached is worthwhile even though the progress made still lacks ambition and, above all, depends on the goodwill of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot build Europe without making the area of education and culture an open space in which each country and each system, bolstered by its own resources, will no longer be afraid of the other.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon Strategy encourages us to aspire to be more effective and to modernise our education systems. While the Charter will be able to help better coordinate the mobility plans, everything will obviously depend not only on the will of the Member States, but also on the demands of Europeans who, like their ancestors in the Middle Ages, ought to be able to go round Europe without having to negotiate a path full of pitfalls.</p>
<p class="contents">For that to happen, we need more Europe in the area of education and culture. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The mobility of European citizens in the education and training sector makes an important contribution towards improving the quality of their knowledge and broadening their experiences and skills and, at the same time, it is a unique tool for mutual understanding and better knowledge of the various cultures which make up Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that over recent years, thanks to the dissemination of existing education and mobility programmes, such as Comenius, Erasmus and Leonardo, the mobility of young people in Europe has increased considerably. Nonetheless, it is a fact that there are still a great number of other obstacles which hamper mobility.</p>
<p class="contents">Even today, the number of young people crossing the borders of their country in order to participate in an education programme is still at relatively low levels. This is linked, among other things, to various practices and omissions on the part of the Member States, which directly or indirectly restrict the mobility of young Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Quality Charter for Mobility, if correctly applied by the Member States, may make an important contribution towards lifting these obstacles, by offering adequate support for administrative assistance to people on the move, which will include, among other things, suitable preparation prior to departure, the provision of information and assistance, social security, resident's permit, housing and the facility to transfer grants and loans to the host country.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, it is especially important for the experience acquired through these programmes to be recognised on returning to the country of origin. Particular attention also needs to be paid to safeguarding equal opportunities for participants. Within this framework, use of the Europass must also be strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I should like to extend my especial congratulations to the rapporteur, Mrs Prets, and to the other rapporteurs because, thanks to her work, the European Quality Charter for Mobility will be given more quickly into the service of European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It can improve inter–connectedness, bring about ever closer cooperation and promote knowledge of other nations and languages.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as education is concerned, cooperation is improving, although funding is still too low. If we want to attain better results, however, we must also make arrangements for higher quality education.</p>
<p class="contents">If all that companies see in the organisation of programmes for improved mobility is a higher workload without any added value they will not strive to make such programmes a success. In their eyes these programmes will only appear to create more work, increase their costs in arranging mentoring, and leak information to their competitors. If the mobility of workers is to be increased, suitable incentives need to be offered to employees working for companies and organisations. Of course, appropriate measures will be needed to encourage them.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to raise employees’ awareness, so that they become familiar with the opportunities and advantages of mobility. To this end, lists of organisations wishing to take part in the process need to be drawn up, but, at the same time, institutions responsible for the preparation and promotion of such lists should be established.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, employees are still facing difficulties in having their qualifications and skills recognised in other countries. In many countries, students and employees are already successfully using Europass, the use of which also needs to be expanded and improved. Knowledge is an asset and the best investment we can make in order to meet the challenges of the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree, of course, that a recommendation does not have the power of a binding instrument. Developments so far have demonstrated, however, that the numerous recommendations adopted to date in this particular area have resulted in progress towards specific goals, benchmarks and the fulfilment of agreements; as a result, we can see a broad range of activities pertaining to the Bologna or Copenhagen processes.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to confirm that not only today, as the Committee on Culture and Education submits several important reports, but also over the recent months and even years the momentum of development in the field of culture and education has been very strong. As Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges has pointed out, a common Europe needs more culture and more education. I believe that this is the direction in which we are moving. When the recommendation is adopted, it will advance coordination, transparency and culture, the evaluation of feedback concerning the effects of mobility and the conditions prevailing in individual countries and institutions. I for one would like to express my gratitude and assure you that I am prepared to take follow-up steps, especially towards implementation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Knowledge of languages and recognition of educational methods and systems are crucial to fostering the mobility of European citizens. Vocational training is a particularly important aspect of this, and one which brings us closer to achieving the aims of the Lisbon Strategy. </p>
<p class="contents">Considering the issue under discussion from this point of view, I would encourage Member States of the Union to:</p>
<p class="contents">1. Create the conditions necessary for at least two of the national languages of the Member States of the Union to be taught at secondary school level, in addition to the mother tongue.</p>
<p class="contents">2. Ensure vocational training is provided with the support of local economic bodies and organisations, as these are best placed to understand the economic needs of their country. The development of cooperation between relevant bodies in EU countries will allow them to work with their governments to devise and take responsibility for vocational training tailored to the needs of the whole EU.</p>
<p class="contents">3. Introduce a twin-track training system at the earliest opportunity. This means devoting half the time to theory and half to practical vocational training. The so-called old Fifteen and the new Member States of the EU are equally responsible for efforts to promote increased mobility.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, appropriate financial support is essential to achieve greater mobility and better vocational training within the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
