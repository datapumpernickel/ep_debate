It is therefore important for the European Union to preserve the integrity of every aspect of that treaty and to see to it that the treaty review conference planned for 2005 is crowned with success.</p>
<p class="contents">The NPT review conference will have to strike a balance between the three pillars: non-proliferation, nuclear disarmament and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. At the same time, it will have to take due account of the main issues concerning nuclear non-proliferation, in particular the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Iran and the so-called Khan network.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is currently working on a common position that will make a positive contribution to the review conference.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is concerned, the European Union presidency has expressed its deep concern at the country’s announcement on 10 February 2005 that it possessed nuclear weapons. It noted with regret the DPRK’s announcement that it was suspending its participation in the multilateral talks on its nuclear programme indefinitely.</p>
<p class="contents">We will therefore have to bring strong pressure to bear on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to persuade it to go back as soon as possible on its decision to withdraw from the six-party talks so that negotiations can be resumed and a peaceful, negotiated solution found to the crisis affecting the Korean peninsula. We reaffirm that the European Union is resolutely in favour of the six-party talks process as a way of finding a solution to this crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">We must insist that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea complies with the nuclear arms non-proliferation treaty. Respect for international obligations, both on nuclear issues and in the field of human rights, is vital if the European Union is to develop bilateral relations with that country. We are also strongly encouraging the DPRK authorities to step up their dialogue and intensify their contacts with the Republic of Korea.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as Iran is concerned, the Paris Agreement is now being strictly applied, with the total suspension of all enrichment-related activities and all reprocessing activities without exception; this has been verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Negotiations on long-term arrangements began in December in the three working groups concerned with political and security questions, nuclear questions and issues of economic cooperation and technology, as well as the steering committee. The first important series of working group meetings took place in January 2005. Obviously, obtaining objective guarantees of the exclusively peaceful nature of the Iranian nuclear programme will continue to be of prime importance. Reports are being drawn up for the steering committee meeting in March, which will be an important occasion for taking stock of the issue. I would like to add that, at the same time, negotiations on the trade and cooperation agreement and on a political agreement resumed in January 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Both parties are negotiating seriously, and so long as the Iranians continue to take part in the talks there will be a chance of success.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is important to remain vigilant so as to ensure that, under IAEA supervision, Iran maintains a total suspension of its activities, without exception, for as long as the negotiations on long-term arrangements continue, total suspension being the condition for their continuance and completion.</p>
<p class="contents">We also informed US President Bush and Condoleezza Rice of these considerations when we held talks with them in Brussels a few days ago. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission agrees with the Council that the Non-proliferation Treaty must be preserved by every means and even strengthened if possible. This point is made in the EU strategy against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction adopted by the Council in December 2003 and which the Commission, in close cooperation with the Council, is helping to implement. The strategy recognises in particular the need to guarantee adequate financial resources from the budget and Community powers. In support of this, the Commission presented its proposals for the next financial instruments to Parliament and the Council in October 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as the instrument for stability in external relations is concerned, specific reference was made to disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The Commission’s proposal is currently being examined by the budgetary authority. We hope it will result in more resources for promoting the European Union’s activities in the field of disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in the period 2007-2013.</p>
<p class="contents">More specifically, so far as the NPT is concerned, these financial resources should support actions to strengthen the treaty’s three pillars: non-proliferation, disarmament and cooperation in the safe use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of world partnership, the Commission believes that the commitment it gave at the Kananaskis G8 summit in July 2002 against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and related matters is particularly important. That involves implementing projects that will really enable us to help third countries to collect nuclear or radioactive material and make it secure and/or eliminate it, effectively controlling exports or preventing illegal trafficking in materials and equipment that might be used to manufacture nuclear devices, ensuring that specialists and scientists who were previously engaged in arms-related activities are retrained and, finally, contributing to the risk-free development of nuclear applications. All these initiatives would help us reach the ultimate objective of the Non-proliferation Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">During the current year, the Commission has been engaged in a pilot scheme decided by Parliament at the end of 2003. This pilot scheme currently serves to finance an exploratory study under the direction of the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (Unidir) and the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI); it will help the Commission, in cooperation with Parliament and the Council, to press ahead with the programming of new financing instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission expects to present the results of the study in November at a conference of parliamentarians and Member State delegations made up of representatives of the national parliaments and governments, to be held at the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning Iran, as you know the European Union has just resumed talks with that country based on, and following on from, the Paris Agreement between Iran, France, Germany and the United Kingdom, with the support of the European Union’s high representative. That agreement and the subsequent monitoring of the implementation of Iran’s voluntary decision to suspend all enrichment and reprocessing-related activities led the European Union to resume its policy of differentiated and progressive engagement with Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">We have therefore resumed negotiations on an agreement covering such sensitive political issues as, on the one hand, the promotion of human rights, fighting terrorism, the Middle East peace process, weapons of mass destruction and, on the other hand, trade and cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is negotiating on the trade and cooperation-related aspects in good faith, fully taking into account the global context of the nuclear talks and the progress made in that field. We think that should make a decisive contribution to our collective effort by opening up the way to sustainable relations and long-term cooperation between the European Union and Iran. We are in fact convinced that this agreement and the prospects of joining the World Trade Organisation could bolster the necessary economic and social reforms in Iran, thus paving the way for the country’s full reintegration into the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">I come now to North Korea. That country’s announcement on 10 February that it was withdrawing <span class="italic">sine</span> <span class="italic">die</span> from the six-party talks and that it had developed nuclear weapons was clearly not very astute, despite Kim Jong II’s conciliatory words as few days later, when he proposed resuming talks if conditions changed. It has made an already difficult process even more complicated. The recent visit to Pyongyang by a Chinese envoy gives us hope that talks may resume; China’s diplomatic efforts deserve our full support.</p>
<p class="contents">Internal developments in North Korea, especially the provisional measures taken towards reform and the resulting social tensions, have recently given rise to a strengthening of control by the authorities. This is having repercussions on North Korea’s foreign policy. We witnessed similar scenarios in Europe’s former socialist countries. The position adopted by the European Union is not to over react to virulent statements from Pyongyang. We will continue to make clear to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea that the nuclear problem must be resolved and that the six-party talks are the best way of dealing with this question. We will continue to insist that the DPRK must fully comply with all its international non-proliferation commitments, in particular the Non-proliferation Treaty and the IAEA guarantee agreement, and that it must abandon any nuclear weapons programme completely.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the European Union thinks it is important to encourage more contacts between North Korea and the outside world and to support economic reform and change in that country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There will, in May, be a conference to examine compliance with the Treaty, and we think it necessary and proper that an official delegation from this House should participate in it.</p>
<p class="contents">It will, at this conference, be of the utmost importance that the Member States of the European Union should actually put together a common position on this matter and be united in putting it forward. The conference will also, though, be an opportunity for us to consider where we stand on compliance with the Nuclear Arms Non-Proliferation Treaty, and this is where a number of developments give cause for concern.</p>
<p class="contents">For a start, there is North Korea, which, as we have heard, has both opted out of the Nuclear Arms Non-Proliferation Treaty and announced that it has nuclear weapons at its disposal. Although we, in the European Union, possess no powers or means whereby we might in any way enforce the reversal of this decision, we do expect North Korea to resume dialogue with its partners, China in particular, which may, in the medium or long term, make a peaceful resolution of this conflict possible.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we are deeply concerned about what is happening in Iran, where, although the temporary suspension of its enrichment programme that has occurred is a positive development, we do expect it to become permanent in character. The three-way talks between foreign ministers – a means of diplomatic conflict resolution in which we expect our partners, including the United States, to play an active part – are intended to help us reach a common solution to the Iran problem, one that will do justice to its interests and to those of the European Community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It should be said that the Treaty was a huge success in the context of the Cold War, when it helped to control the arms race; now, it offers the framework within which those who were enemies then have considerably reduced their arsenals.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent developments have already alluded to this and have illustrated the continuing need for an international treaty to combat the spread of nuclear arms technology. Investing in the Non-Proliferation Treaty is still a priority. Unfortunately, we cannot fail to note that the Treaty has come under pressure. A recent UN report alerted to the possibility of the Treaty’s irreversible erosion, with a cascade of proliferation as a result. Consequently, the Review Conference scheduled this spring should mainly be seized as an opportunity to reconfirm the Non-Proliferation Treaty’s crucial role, including the objective of ultimate general nuclear disarmament.</p>
<p class="contents">As a champion of the international legal order, the European Union has the special responsibility of ensuring that the Treaty is observed, which means that a tougher line must be taken towards those states that evade it. Naturally, the developments in Iran and North Korea are crucial in this connection. This also means that the EU must commit itself to closing the existing loopholes in the Treaty. The test ban, the ban on nuclear tests, has still not been signed by all parties; the United States, in particular, has not done so, and is also continuing to develop nuclear weapons for battlefield use. Needless to say, these are all issues which undermine the credibility of this important Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Developments since the previous Review Conference have also shown that the Treaty must face up to new challenges. There is a major risk of the development of regional arms races in countries attempting to obtain nuclear arms technology. We cannot, therefore, see the Non-Proliferation Treaty in isolation from improving regional security structures in the Middle East and in South and East Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is the risk – and that is a new threat – of nuclear technology, or even nuclear material, ending up in the hands of what we refer to as non-state actors, in other words terrorist organisations, which could, for example, by means of a ‘dirty’ bomb, do an awful lot of damage.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to conclude that the existing agreements to prevent nuclear material from being mislaid or misappropriated do not offer adequate guarantees. That is why in the resolution we will be adopting tomorrow, we are asking the European Union to pay special attention to this issue. We cannot leave this matter to the United States alone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is a real risk of the non-proliferation scheme being eroded to such an extent that it loses all meaning, with all the risks of a renewed, unbridled arms race that this entails, in a world made far more chaotic and far more dangerous by international terrorism. As I said, this debate and the joint resolution that is before us are very timely.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is urging both the EU institutions and the Member States to show a united front during the Review Conference, and argue forcefully in favour of new initiatives in terms of disarmament, in general, and nuclear disarmament, in particular. Since the Member States are made up of both nuclear and non-nuclear powers, this may not be so obvious. Precisely for that reason, I am pleased with the Council’s communication that hard work is going into a common position with a view to that conference. We would also like to urge all third member states and all European Union Member States that have not done so, to ratify the additional protocols to the International Atomic Energy Agency as a matter of urgency. In the same vein, it is of the utmost importance that the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty should enter into effect as quickly as possible. If this is to happen, a number of states, including not least the US, still need to ratify it.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the United States, we do not quite understand why they constantly – and, in fact, with good reason– warn of the dangers of weapons of mass destruction while at the same time, working on a new generation of so-called ‘light’ nuclear weapons. Surely, it is beyond any doubt that such a development will once again herald an arms race, one that would, this time, involve a type of weapon that could even more easily end up in the wrong hands. We would therefore call on the US to abandon those plans and join us in investing all energy in reviving the efforts towards non-proliferation and disarmament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will also be decisive as regards the thinking underpinning Europe’s security strategy. Let us establish security through effective multilateralism, that is, through international conventions such as the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the reinforcement of such international organisations as the IAEA or the UN. The May conference on review of the Non-Proliferation Treaty has to face up to extremely pressing issues of global security, such as the states in crisis regions seeking to acquire atomic weapons, the black market in nuclear materials and the terrorist groups that are trying to get their hands on them.</p>
<p class="contents">It also has to be clear to us, though, that the commitments to disarm set down in this treaty have to be implemented, once and for all, by the states that possess nuclear weapons, for if they are not, these cannot claim with any credibility that they really do want to put a stop to proliferation.</p>
<p class="contents">I appeal to the European Union to assume an active role as a stakeholder, not only in the run-up to the conference, but also in its negotiations. This is a year in which we succeed or are lost. I appeal to the Council and the Commission, as a matter of urgency, to take a progressive line. We should be trying to put the El Baradei seven-point plan into practice. On issues such as the enrichment of uranium, there is a need for renewal. Signature of the supplementary protocol must become the norm. Secondly, violations of the Non-Proliferation Treaty must be seen as endangering world peace and the sanctions imposed should reflect that.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say something about Iran, and the way the situation in the Middle East is developing. Europe cannot accept the prospect of Iran, one day, being in possession of nuclear weapons; what we expect of it is absolute transparency and cooperation with the EU, and with the IAEA as a guarantee of its renunciation of nuclear weapons. The Bush administration must be pro-active in supporting this, for only the Americans can make promises or carry out checks on whether economic sanctions should be relaxed. It should also be possible to discuss security issues with Iran’s interests in mind, and I urge the Council and the Commission to do so. Where Iran is concerned, I also urge that we have to take care not to dishonour or deny our values during these negotiations; human rights can never be negotiable. As regards North Korea, at this point I would simply appeal to them to return to the negotiating table, and the Commission should examine whether Europe should take on an active role in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely because our credibility is at stake that we need to ascertain whether it is indeed the case that the Americans have more atomic weapons based in Europe than they have stated. If they have, then that is a breach of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and we demand their removal.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and very briefly, let me say something about ‘mini-nukes’. In historic terms, these are something quite different; they represent the abandonment of Cold War-style deterrence in favour of the active waging of war – a disaster waiting to happen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is endangered on the one hand by the nuclear superpowers, and, on the other, by a number of countries on the threshold of acquiring nuclear capacity, as well as by EU Member States and the European Union itself. ‘The EU?’ some might ask in astonishment. Indeed so, for we read in the <span class="italic">European Defence Paper</span>, compiled by the European Institute for Strategic Studies, that Lothar Rühl, former secretary of state in the German Ministry of Defence and the paper’s joint author, has summed the matter up in the following words: ‘We have not avoided the presentation of scenarios in which the European Member States’ nuclear forces can influence planning.’</p>
<p class="contents">This makes it a scandal, plain and simple, that the Socialist Group in this House should have refused to incorporate, in the resolution on which we are to vote, an appeal for a nuclear weapons-free Europe. It really is a bit rich to urge others to dispose of their nuclear arms, while keeping quiet about one’s own deployment plans and the modernisation of one’s own nuclear arsenal! Senator Roche from the Parliamentary Network for Nuclear Disarmament, pressed the point home in Brussels last week, saying – and I quote: ‘We cannot constantly be calling on others to refrain from acquiring more nuclear weapons if we are not ourselves willing to disarm and scrap the EU Member States’ highly dangerous potential for mass destruction’.

<p class="contents">Must Iran and North Korea be persuaded by force to stop research into the production of nuclear weapons? Yes, they must. Is it, however, right for us not to concern ourselves with the nuclear weapons in Israel, Pakistan, India or even in permanent members of the Security Council? Are there, in other words, good and bad nuclear weapons? Is it democratic and fair for us to accept that countries in the first category can possess nuclear weapons but for us to control countries in the second category that wish to acquire them? Is it, I wonder, a coincidence that the countries that are doing their utmost for nuclear weapons, starting with the United States, are the very countries that do not participate in the Criminal Court in the Hague, the very countries that are 'snubbing' the Kyoto agreements on the environment? These are the countries that feel they are the leaders of everyone else and are trying to impose their interests by force rather than by logic. Is it right that 25 countries with a joint resolution, joint central bank and joint agricultural policy should not have the same right to nuclear weapons and that only two of the 25 should have the right to nuclear weapons?</p>
<p class="contents">Nuclear weapons are a problem in both Iran and North Korea, but this new cold war being waged between Russia and the United States, in which we are participating, is a bigger problem. Do we dare to send inspectors to the stockrooms of Israel and China? We do not dare to because we cannot impose it. Consequently, we tear up our own credentials as an agency of independence and justice. Perhaps someone can tell us where Iraq's nuclear weapons are. They could not be found and they did not exist. It was, however, the alibi for a brutish invasion ....</p>

In the case of Iran, we must also ask ourselves why that country really needs nuclear energy, even for peaceful purposes. Moreover, it is politically worrying that an infringement of the Non-Proliferation Treaty can, in practice, be used inappropriately to demand all kinds of favourable conditions. The Treaty should be reinterpreted in such a way as to ensure that high-risk states can no longer indulge in any nuclear enrichment and processing whatever. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Furthermore, if they take this course, they may be emulated by other countries of the region, by neighbouring countries, and this would therefore reverse the tendency towards non-proliferation adopted by some 20 countries over recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, one worrying fact is that the International Atomic Energy Agency has detected more than a dozen cases of disappearances of nuclear material, which means that there is currently a danger of these weapons being used. As Mr Wiersma pointed out in his speech, if terrorist organisations such as Al Qaeda were to acquire nuclear weapons or if totalitarian states such as those I have mentioned were to gain access to such weapons, it would be very difficult to control their use.</p>
<p class="contents">Pursuing the course of dialogue, as Mr Schmit pointed out, is a good idea, and I believe that is the course we should take, but we must not forget that, in the case of Iran, on 1 March, the inspectors of the IAEA were denied access to the Parchin military complex and that, at the same time, the International Atomic Energy Agency has confirmed that Iran is building underground tunnels for storing atomic material and equipment, nor that, for its part, North Korea has between 20 and 30 kilos of plutonium at the nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, as well as one of the largest nuclear arsenals in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that we must accept the President-in-Office of the Council's recommendation that we should be attentive and vigilant, and at the same time we must try to pursue, as the President said, the course of dialogue in order to put a stop to this proliferation of nuclear weapons which, of course, is a threat, as I said at the beginning, not just to the region, but to the whole of the planet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Five years ago, the world was celebrating the historic consensus reached with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), a significant landmark for world peace, as Kofi Annan put it. Five years on, ahead of the Treaty Review Conference, the outlook is starkly different. The United States has shifted its position away from the commitments it made and the current administration has even announced that it will develop new nuclear weapons technology, costing astronomical amounts of money.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States and other nuclear weapon states that are signatories to the Treaty have, thus far, failed to honour their commitments to disarm, nor have they given any signs that they intend to reduce their nuclear arsenals. At this very moment, the United States has 480 nuclear weapons stationed in Europe and has yet to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. The upshot of which is that other states party to the Treaty do not feel they have a binding commitment to comply with the NPT following the invasion of Iraq on the false pretext of the existence of weapons of mass destruction. Possessing – or pretending to possess – nuclear weapons has come to have a certain status, and has in fact come to be perceived as a deterrent or a means of self-defence.</p>
<p class="contents">Countries such as Israel, India and Pakistan, which also have nuclear weapons, remain outside the Treaty and feel neither encouraged, nor under any pressure whatsoever, to sign up to it. More worryingly still, North Korea is trying to withdraw from the Treaty and is blackmailing the international community. We have reached the point where applicants to join the permanent Security Council cite this status to support their candidature.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations’ High Level Panel on dangers, threats and challenges says that the stage has been reached where the process of eroding the non-proliferation regime could have passed the point of no return and could result in galloping proliferation. Additionally, we know that there is a high risk of nuclear materials falling into the hands of terrorists, often completely out of state control.</p>
<p class="contents">Such galloping proliferation can only be prevented if the international community channels all its efforts into effective multilateral solutions. The forthcoming NPT review is an opportunity that must not be wasted. The EU must play a key role in making the Treaty work as a permanent bureau, which would entail coordination with EU nuclear weapon states if there is to be genuinely coordinated action within the terms of the foreign and security policy and the security and defence policy. Given the urgency of the situation, Parliament should send a mission to the conference to monitor European intervention, to monitor what the Member States do and to encourage action on the Treaty, in line …</p>

<p class="contents">The position of the UK Government is sadly both reckless and irresponsible, and it is also illegal. We have heard a lot about international law recently, so I would remind both Britain and France that, according to the ICJ in The Hague, nuclear weapons are not only immoral but also illegal. Britain and France should lead by example and unilaterally dismantle their illegal nuclear warheads, and the EU and its Member States must present an action plan and timetable for achieving a nuclear-free Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are dealing with a country which has concealed its production of nuclear weapons from the international community. These arsenals therefore have to be dismantled and North Korea must sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty at once and allow IAEA inspectors from Vienna to carry out the appropriate inspections.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we believe that the diplomatic route is the only viable one in that region. North Korea must return to the negotiating table for the six-party talks with the USA, South Korea, Japan, Russia and China. Against this backdrop, aggressive statements from Washington are not helpful. Instead of the Bush administration’s recent sabre-rattling, I believe North Korea should be offered a political and diplomatic agreement as a <span class="italic">quid pro quo</span> for monitoring of its nuclear arsenal.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I believe that when debating nuclear weapons, we cannot avoid the issue of who should cast the first stone. For example, we cannot avoid emphasising the recent revelation in Italy that, in certain NATO bases on Italian soil, nuclear weapons belonging to the US are being stockpiled, unknown to residents in the vicinity. In my view, therefore, the issue of nuclear disarmament is everyone’s business and does not merely concern the two countries now under discussion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Next May in New York, at the conference on the non-proliferation treaty, no further concessions or compromises can or should be made. In particular, the possibility of reactionary and in many ways obscurantist regimes, such as those of Iran and North Korea, coming into possession of nuclear weapons must be prevented. This concern is only heightened by the risk of plutonium being stolen by terrorist groups which, alas, are increasingly active.</p>

This analysis may be very pessimistic, but it would appear to be accurate, and, as we draw near to this year’s review conference, one begins to feel that things are at bursting point.</p>
<p class="contents">A cursory look at the map reveals that, in one region, and linked to one another by land, Pakistan, India and China are in possession of nuclear weapons, and soon Korea and Iran will be too. There are land links between all these countries and their interests collide with one another, with all the resultant potential for blockades and dangerous situations.</p>
<p class="contents">In a region such as that, can countries such as Indonesia or the Philippines, in the long term, refrain from doing likewise? If Korea and Iran get their way, then it seems to me quite clear that there will be no stopping them, and that leads me to conclude that we have to endorse the line that has been advanced here with regard to Iran. We should give the three foreign ministers and the European Union a chance. I am glad that the United States has come round to this strategy of achieving something by way of negotiation.</p>
<p class="contents">In this instance, because of the way things are developing and because there are evidently already underground facilities that cannot be shifted by these means, pre-emptive strikes would probably do more harm than good. Others may know more about this than I do, but I do believe that we have to be aware of the consequences resulting from geography and the structure of these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Iran cannot blackmail us – that, I believe, is important – but, on the other hand, we should – as the President-in-Office of the Council has said – do everything possible to get it to defer any further developments until such time as negotiations have produced other possibilities. It has to be clear – to this House as much as to anyone else – that improved relations with Iran will be possible only if solutions are found to the nuclear issue and to the issues of human rights. So, for example, there should be no chance of this House ratifying a cooperation agreement with Iran – assuming there were even to be negotiations concerning such a thing, which, reasonably enough, there are not under the present Luxembourg Presidency – unless Iran were to take a more reasonable line. I might add that it is quite plain that this has to include such things as the Non-Proliferation Treaty, the IAEA, and the UN.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies, and in the same way, to North Korea, for I too believe that it is necessary to make clear our willingness to help that country in which people are suffering such enormities, our willingness to improve their situation, and that this might well cost us more than we were formerly prepared to spend. We should, of course, also consider – and I expect Mr Ford will come back to this later on – whether the European Union should not take part in the current six-party talks, seeing as we are already involved in funding. I think thought should be given to what shape our political involvement might take.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, I do believe that countering these countries’ nuclear capacities is of crucial importance in the overall framework and in terms of anti-terrorism, for it also enables us to forestall mini-nukes and dirty bombs, among other things. We have to discern the connection here, for it is with these capabilities that we are dealing here, and not just with traditional nuclear strike capability. For that reason, we cannot take this task too seriously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can make use of this Treaty to threaten people and bark at them, but there is no question of us being able to bite anyone who fails to comply with it. Any important developments there have been have occurred outside the framework of the Treaty, or even in spite of it. India and Pakistan have acquired nuclear weapons and the secret blueprints for such weapons have been stolen from Pakistan, yet sanctions have not been imposed on either of these countries. Libya has abandoned its nuclear programme, yet the Treaty played no part in this. Iran and North Korea are not only building atomic bombs, they are now also developing means of delivering them, and there appears to be no chance of putting an effective stop to these programmes. Countries like these are engaging in negotiations under false pretences, in order to gain time and develop their nuclear programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">What action should therefore be taken? Unless new and stricter control mechanisms are put in place, there is absolutely no point in continuing to talk in twentieth century terms, as though the countries that have the capacity to build nuclear weapons were still parties to the Treaty. There can be little hope of enforcing the Treaty without effective controls, and the requirement to abandon nuclear weapons must form part of the overall policy adopted towards a given country. On its own, the Treaty will get us nowhere.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point relates to something that should be stated quite plainly. Unless we cooperate with the United States and engage in serious dialogue with our American partners, adopting a policy of coercion will be equally futile, whether in the case of Korea or Iran. This is because such countries are expert at playing the ‘good cop, bad cop’ game, whereby they hold talks with one party and are afraid of the other. There is little chance of the party they hold talks with, and of whom they are not afraid, being able to persuade them to make any real changes. I thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The North Korean Government’s declaration that it possesses nuclear weapons has rightly aroused great concern for a region with the world’s greatest nuclear concentration. At the same time, a nuclear Iran would destabilise the Middle East, creating huge security problems in Europe’s own backyard.</p>
<p class="contents">The European security strategy is right to consider the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction as the second most serious global threat after international terrorism. Moreover, everyone knows that where rogue or bankrupt states are involved, or where monitoring is inadequate, the two problems are closely connected.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot face this challenge alone. International coordination is needed to combat nuclear arms proliferation, and to increase police control and legal methods for monitoring, based on Dr ElBaradei’s seven steps, among which I would mention the five-year moratorium on new facilities, the unequivocal commitment to disarm by the five officially-recognised nuclear states, and the objective of making the Middle East a nuclear-free zone.</p>
<p class="contents">The relationship between the European Union and the United States is crucial for the effective combating of nuclear proliferation. Europe and the United States are complementary. In the immediate future, the joint transatlantic goal must be to halt Iranian activity and ensure the success of the annual NPT review conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For this reason, we need to give special attention to what is going on in North Korea and in Iran, and I welcome the line taken by this House and my own group on the need to make it plain to Iran that negotiations on a trade and cooperation agreement cannot be concluded until such time as there is conclusive evidence that its nuclear programme is peaceful. It was on this point that the IAEA talks in Vienna made no satisfactory progress. It is also clear that we have to express our concern at the supply by Russia of nuclear fuel rods to Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">That the situation in North Korea is equally disturbing, as a danger to the region as a whole, is something of which I have become aware in my capacity as chairman of the joint delegation to both Koreas. I therefore call on the EU, represented in this instance by the Commission and the Council, to do everything possible to facilitate the resumption of the six-party talks, a process that is still open despite North Korea’s most recent statement. We call on North Korea to come back to the negotiating table. All diplomatic channels must be used to this end. Although the European Union is not party to the six-party talks – something that may well change – it is in our interests that the crisis should de-escalate and that nuclear weapons should not become more widespread. Evidence of this is our humanitarian aid and agricultural aid programme for North Korea.</p>
<p class="contents">The World Food Organisation has drawn attention to the desperate state of the people as they attempt to get food. In humanitarian terms too, it should be in North Korea’s interests to concentrate its resources on improving the supply of food to its people, rather than on disproportionate rearmament, not to mention on becoming a nuclear threat. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The review conference in May offers an opportunity to achieve a breakthrough, one that will demand a constructive approach on the part of all, including the ‘permanent five’ and hence also of China, which increasingly presents itself as the hegemonic power in its region. China is resurgent, and only one country – North Korea – ignores it and its goal of a Korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons. North Korea is working on warheads and rockets to carry them, it is hampering the six-party talks and destabilising the entire region. The reason for this is that North Korea is a dictatorship desperately hanging on to power.</p>

One day, perhaps, we will come to an agreement with the French Government enabling us to have all our plenary sittings in Brussels, but as long as the treaty stands as it is, the present situation is not up for discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">We should spell it out to the North Koreans that their activities are a menace to the whole security setting in the Far East. South Korea feels itself under threat, and so do Japan and Taiwan, and it is this whole regional security aspect that I think we have to focus on. We must make the attempt to persuade our Chinese friends to use their influence. They may well constantly maintain that they have none, but I believe that to be a diplomatic ploy.

While we are debating problems relating to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the Non-Proliferation Treaty, I think it would not be out of place to alert this House to the existence of new military technologies that render the situation even more complex. It is already possible to manufacture what are known as suitcase bombs. These bombs are light and easily transportable, and could therefore easily fall into the wrong hands, for example those of terrorist groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Very low-intensity bombs are a further example of a new military technology, and their existence completely blurs the clear distinction previously made between traditional weapons and nuclear weapons. The emergence of such weapons, the purpose of which would appear to be to allow attacks on heavily defended and fortified locations, could result in their use in countries that are not signatories to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. This would then trigger, or rather it might and should trigger, corresponding reactions from the international community, as every country that has signed the Treaty has the assurance of other countries that nuclear weapons will not be used on its territory. I thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The primitive communism to which North Korea is still politically and economically subject can be overcome only by Chinese pressure or persuasion to that end.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to Iran, on which I was rapporteur in the previous legislative period, I would like to make it clear that we certainly do have a combination of interests that we can reduce to a common denominator. While Iran aspires to conclude a partnership and cooperation agreement with the European Union, we, who are the European Union, want to see Iran acting within the parameters set by the International Atomic Energy Agency and complying with its requirements. Regarding as I do the peaceful use of atomic energy as a good thing, I am not fundamentally opposed to a country using it, provided that it is ensured that the highest possible safety standards are in force and that the cycle facilitating the enrichment of uranium and the manufacture of weapons is subject to international control, which, in Iran’s case, means that it is not operational. If we can actually manage to get it across to Iran that there is a package formed by a partnership and cooperation agreement on the one hand and compliance with the international community’s requirements in respect of the peaceful use of nuclear energy on the other, and that this package is indivisible, then we can get a result.</p>
<p class="contents">There is something else that I regard as important: in balancing interests against each other, the issue of human rights must not be disregarded. We cannot sacrifice human rights for the sake of an agreement, even if Iran’s <span class="italic">quid pro quo</span> is compliance with nuclear requirements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a country that over the last 12 to 18 months has engaged in massive and irreversible steps on the road to economic reform, in particular in industry and agriculture. However, the nuclear crisis is still hanging over us.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last five years, the European Union has put half a billion euros into North Korea in humanitarian and development aid, yet we have not been included in the six-party talks. Several weeks ago, the North Korean Ambassador to Berlin spoke to Parliament's new delegation for relations with the Korean Peninsula and indicated that North Korea would welcome our participation, as would the Chinese and the South Koreans. In our joint resolution we are asking the Commission and the Council to investigate the possibility of the European Union being part of that programme. That may help to break the logjam we are facing there. The European Parliament would not like a situation in which it has no say in the onward negotiations but, like last time round with the framework agreement, is left with the bill!</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is not on the plutonium programme – North Korea has stated that it now has nuclear weapons – but on one of the causes of the crisis, which was the claim by the United States that North Korea had a highly enriched uranium programme. It looks as though North Korea got the blueprints from Pakistan, but the Americans have produced no evidence that it has an ongoing programme. Neither has it the necessary materials to produce the gas centrifuges, or the quality or quantity of electricity – which would have to be enough to power a medium-sized city in Europe – to undertake that programme.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point concerns the Korean Energy Development Organisation. The Council has chosen not to pay the EUR 4 million to South Korea as suspension costs for that programme, which therefore threatens its future. I know some in this House would not like to see it refined into a nuclear programme, but it could well serve as a very useful channel for non-nuclear conventional or renewable energies. We ask the Council to look again at whether this small contribution, which would buy a couple of flats in London, should not be made to enable us to have that political impact. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, things seem to be moving in the opposite direction. As Mr Wiersma and Mr Brok commented, there is a danger that we are entering a new era of nuclear arms proliferation – a fresh nuclear arms race in very sensitive regions where the ultimate consequence of proliferation could be actual use.</p>
<p class="contents">This makes it all the more important now to ensure that the European Union and all its partners should bring the necessary pressure to bear on those who believe that nuclear weapons give them greater power. We need to give a clear signal both to North Korea and Iran that developing nuclear weapons will not pay, and that the international community will not tolerate such a development.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with those who say that in the case of Iran we need to pursue the negotiations already in progress vigorously, in order to convince the Iranians that there is an alternative to developing nuclear arms, and that the prospect of a partnership with Europe and of an economic cooperation agreement is more valuable than any development of nuclear weapons, both in terms of Iran’s security and of its economic development. I also agree that human rights should not be ignored in those negotiations, and that respect for those rights is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">North Korea is of course even more complicated, as that country has to some extent already been ostracised by the international community. Yet taking sanctions against this country, whose population is already suffering enormous deprivation, would not achieve very much. The European Union should not just limit itself to providing humanitarian aid here; we should also play a more significant political role. I totally agree with those who have said, as Mr Ford has just done, that it would also be wrong for the European Union to act as a provider of funds without a political role.</p>
<p class="contents">Our relations with China which, as Mr Jarzembowski said, are important, will certainly help us to bring pressure to bear on North Korea. China is perhaps the only country to have any real leverage over the North Korean regime.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, it is crucial that the discussions concerning the Non-Proliferation Treaty should not essentially end in failure, in a kind of half-hearted status quo. The NPT is even more important now than it was in the past. There are now other, even more appalling risks, with proliferation to all sorts of non-State entities and terrorists. I believe that this is another area where the European Union must be very vigilant.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must, therefore, speak loud and clear at the NPT conference, and act, both in its negotiations with Iran and in the discussions with Korea, to which we must be a party, to make our voice heard. A world without nuclear arms may not yet be within our grasp, but we should at least halt their dangerous proliferation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission supports and will continue to support these efforts to encourage both disarmament, particularly in Russia, and non-proliferation.</p>
<p class="contents">We are at present working with the Council to secure the necessary funding to implement the Union’s policies in the areas of non-proliferation and disarmament. As an indication of the Commission’s commitment in this respect, I would like to refer to an agreement recently concluded during the Cotonou review, which now incorporates, as a vital element, a non-proliferation clause, intended to strengthen multilateral agreements and export controls. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
