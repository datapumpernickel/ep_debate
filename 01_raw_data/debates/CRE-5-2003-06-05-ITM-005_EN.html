<p class="contents">The European Commission, which has to ensure that Community law is applied, has to maintain special relations with citizens who are witnesses to, or the actual or alleged victims of, violations of Community law and who lodge complaints with its services.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication that inspired this report demonstrates the Commission’s desire for transparency and efficiency. As it committed to doing, it publishes in consolidated form its internal rules of procedure governing its relations with the complainant. It also ensures that it keeps in contact with the complainant throughout the investigation of his complaint according to a strict schedule.</p>
<p class="contents">It was following an own initiative report and criticisms made against the European Ombudsman when a complaint was closed, and also repeated requests from the European Parliament, that the European Commission has reconsidered its administrative methods for dealing with relations with the complainant.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be noted that the Commission enjoys discretionary powers with regard to assessing complaints and deciding whether or not to commence infringement proceedings and to refer a case to the Court of Justice. This is not, therefore, about reconsidering the way in which complaints are handled but about enabling citizens to be informed, in particular about the progress of the examination of their complaints. We note with satisfaction that the Commission’s proposal is entirely a step in the right direction. We consider that the administrative measures taken by the Commission as regards the consideration of complaints are particularly welcome and that they allow complainants to be regularly informed of the stage reached in the proceedings. Moreover, we regard the maximum one-year period that the Commission has undertaken to comply with in order to respond to each case as entirely reasonable, given the number of complaints lodged and their complexity.</p>
<p class="contents">The only point that seems to me to be missing from this communication, however, is the situation when a complaint and a petition are lodged at the same time. As you know, the Commission is not the only institution to respond to citizen’s questions regarding the proper functioning of the institutions and the correct application of Community law. The European Ombudsman and the European Parliament, through its Committee on Petitions, also receive an increasing number of complaints. A complaint lodged by a citizen may therefore also be the subject of a petition to Parliament lodged by the same citizen. This is when two complaints are lodged at the same time, each of them being treated differently according to the institution with which it was lodged, according to a different timetable, which, you will understand, is a source of confusion for both citizens and the institutions themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems both desirable and logical for decisions made by Community institutions regarding complaints, appeals or petitions to be coordinated between the institutions concerned in order to provide an effective service for citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we are urging the Commission to revise the interinstitutional agreement, which dates from 1989. It should also be considered that this was when the position of Ombudsman was introduced and the right of petition was recognised in many Member States, which considerably increased the number of appeal cases.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite all of the Commission’s competence in processing complaints, citizens should still use the Committee on Petitions, which considers and responds to the problems raised in a more political way, but the Commission and Parliament obviously complement each other in order to ensure the effective service required. Moreover, the need for information is going to increase in the years to come, with the arrival of ten new Member States in the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to finish by mentioning something very promising that the Commission has done: creating Solvit. The purpose of Solvit is to settle, very quickly – and when I say very quickly I mean within ten weeks, with four additional weeks in the event of additional problems– recurrent cross-border problems concerning the internal market, and to prevent legal actions. What is different about Solvit is that it involves Member States in a partnership with the Commission for investigating the case. This is evidence of integration, which is enjoying growing success, and the Commission is to be congratulated on this progress, the ultimate aim of which is to make life simpler for citizens in terms of respect for Community law.</p>

The second is to tighten internal discipline as regards notification given to complainants at the main stages of proceedings, including, where appropriate, when cases are closed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is ready to work with Parliament to examine ways of improving coordination of the two bodies' response to state measures which are incompatible with Community law, such measures being brought to the institution's attention either via petitions or complaints. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There have frequently been many criticisms in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the Ombudsman, in relation to a complaint concerning the Macedonian Joint Venture, stated at the time that the Commission would have to reconsider its operating methods in respect of complaints by citizens, in other words in respect of the intercommunication between the Commission and European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">So now we have this communication from the Commission, which recognises that the handling of this intercommunication requires a better framework, mainly from an administrative point of view, in the area of permanent personal contact with the citizens who have submitted the complaint or petition, and in the area of the classification of complaints, treating them properly and reasonably.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by Mrs Fortou has arrived in this context, and I would like to congratulate her on her work. The agreement must be maintained up to the end. We call on the Commission to welcome the proposals in this report, which make a great deal of sense.</p>
<p class="contents">I reiterate, therefore, that we give our full backing to this report, and to the Commission we say that we are at a particularly opportune and interesting moment, coinciding as it does with the accession of 10 further Member States, to pursue this action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My group is of the opinion that the Commission communication is a step in the right direction, since it recognises how important the role of complainant is in the exposure of infringements of Community law. The Commission must welcome the citizen as the provider of a service, and must look after citizens’ interests. Only in this way is trust created, and the feeling conveyed that the EU is a Union for its citizens. The citizen must always be shown ways in which he can assert his rights as a citizen of the Union. This must also apply to the Commission even if it turns out that the Commission is for once not the right body to which to turn with a complaint. The citizen must have the feeling that this is what Europe is, and I say Europe because we must remember that many citizens do not make any distinction between the institutions. The citizen must therefore be given an answer. Therefore I particularly welcome the fact that this communication includes this aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">I would have liked the wording to be more clear, however, in particular by stating that the Commission must in all cases show the complainant an alternative means of recourse to law. Citizens must be dealt with and informed individually and personally. The Commission must inform the complainant immediately and consistently. Here it is also important that the complainant really does have the opportunity to present his complaint to the Commission in person and to explain it in more detail.</p>
<p class="contents">The good intentions of the communication must now be put into practice and must not be allowed to remain merely a theory on paper. Like the rapporteur, I too am basically of the opinion that the one-year time limit for processing complaints is sufficient. That means, however, that the one-year time limit must be the rule and that the citizen is able to rely on really obtaining an answer within one year. I do not believe the excuse that the Commission does not have enough staff in order to do this to be a valid one. Like Mrs Fourtou, I regret the fact that the communication did not make any connection with the petition procedure. For years the Committee on Petitions has been demanding intensified inter-institutional cooperation. This has already been referred to in the Perry-Keßler report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lambert (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating not only the rapporteur on the report but also the Commission on the communication. For us it represents an important step in recognition of the role and legitimate rights of citizens who file a complaint with the Commission. It is also the first time the Commission has adopted public rules on how to deal with infringements of Community law by Member States. Those public rules are often a marked improvement on the practice in a number of our Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I recall that when the previous Ombudsman, Mr Jacob Söderman, asked the Commission to adopt rules on how to treat complainants, his recommendation was to recognise that the complainant was a party to an administrative procedure. While my group considers that this should be the final objective, it also considers that the adopted code is a genuine improvement. Perhaps there will be an opportunity to advance further through the adoption of an administrative law for the Union's institutions and agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I want to mention an area on which my colleague, Mr Wyn, and I tabled an amendment which was rejected by the committee – which is unusual because our committee normally shows very good sense. The report at the moment states that the Commission enjoys a discretionary power in relation to its consideration of complaints.</p>
<p class="contents">While we recognise that the Commission needs a certain discretion as to if and when it opens an infringement procedure, the discretion has to be used in compliance with the Commission's obligations to ensure that Community law is implemented and applied.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 211, which makes the Commission the guardian of the Treaties, and Article 226, which gives the Commission the right to open infringement procedures, constitute the essential safeguard in the Treaties for the application of the <span class="italic">acquis</span>. Therefore, we are concerned about this view of the Commission's powers of discretion being extremely wide and would prefer to have them described as providing a certain margin of appreciation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to stress, as the Convention is coming to a conclusion, the importance of maintaining the Commission's role in monitoring the implementation of Community law. The number of complaints received by the Commission and the number of petitions to Parliament clearly show that citizens <span class="italic">need</span> that opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is very much to the point, and that point is that we need more transparency and commitment on the part of the Commission in its administration and towards the citizens of the Union – something that has already been mentioned. I believe that a time-limit of one year is not only appropriate, but is even very generous. We have Member States where commitment to schedules is the order of the day. We should try, together, to get rid of double-tracking when it comes to dealing with complaints. That has already been mentioned too. That is one of the objectives of this House, and especially of its Committee on Petitions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission still has difficulties with administration that is transparent and people-friendly. It has happened to every one of us that at some time we have had to defend the relatively small number of officials – some seventeen or eighteen thousand – that the Commission employs, because most of the time they behave towards the public as if they had about a hundred thousand. I do not need to remind you of the game of hide-and-seek that the Commission is currently playing in connection with the EUROSTAT scandal, where one has the feeling that the Commission has not yet learned that modern administration has something to do with transparency. We only have to look at last year’s report by the Ombudsman, which shows that in the year 2002, Commissioner, 75% of complaints were about your institution. Of those complaints, there were many that could have been settled relatively easily and at little cost. In fact, 27% of the complaints by EU citizens were concerned with lack of transparency and refusal to provide information. Once again it boils down to transparency. Mr Prodi publicly promised something quite different when he took office three years ago. A further 15% of complaints were concerned with avoidable administrative delays. The issue of late payments has now become legendary in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that there is great potential here for improvement at little cost. We just need goodwill, and I think it would be a good idea if we could agree, Commissioner, that, in relation to the commitments that you have entered into, whereby everything will be dealt with within a year, Parliament could receive regular reports from you.</p>
