We cannot accept the presence in the confines of the European Parliament of representatives of a group that is holding eight Portuguese citizens hostage and which today we will be condemning in a resolution to be adopted by this Parliament.

Would it not be simpler to give them a little less money rather than making them pay tax?

Furthermore, I have to say that I am tired of hearing people say that there is not enough money for pensions because pensioners are living too long. We predict what the weather will be doing in 20 years and we worry about all those who are going to die of BSE, so do you really think, Madam President, that we did not know that people would be living longer?

Stockholm will build on what was set out at last year's Lisbon Summit which outlined plans for a dynamic, knowledge-based and competitive economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I have said it before and I will say it again, jobs, jobs, jobs. That is what it is all about. Lisbon set far-reaching goals for the next decade – to create the world's leading knowledge-based economy by 2010, to create 20 million new jobs across Europe by 2010 and to promote economic and social reform which combine competitiveness and social cohesion, investing in people and raising skill levels. In simple terms, this means increasing the skills and mobility of Europe's workforce, encouraging enterprise, helping small firms and improving EU regulation. It also means boosting the EU's research and development effort and ensuring lifelong learning.</p>
<p class="contents">This Summit is incredibly important to our citizens and we have to set out what Stockholm means for them. First and foremost, jobs is our top priority. We aim to establish a business-led skills taskforce and a jobs database to overcome the skills shortage. We must make full use of Europe's older workers, increase gender equality across the labour market, and encourage women to become entrepreneurs. Supporting SMEs is crucial for the EU to meet its employment targets, as small and medium-sized businesses provide two-thirds of all private sector jobs across Europe, and make up 98% of all businesses in the UK. The right regulatory environment, including cutting red tape, is of paramount importance to small firms and to job creation.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we need to accelerate economic reforms and full energy liberalisation by 2003 is a priority in this agenda. Not only will this bring down prices across Europe, but it will encourage energy suppliers to be more efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, all this is just a small sample of what we want to achieve at Stockholm. I very much hope that we can achieve our goals, so that, our citizens will benefit from a dynamic and competitive economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In our opinion, the processes of self-determination, of independence and freedom to associate as desired, should take precedence over the territorial integrity of this or that entity.

On the other hand, you cannot keep any state lastingly together from above against the will of the majority of the inhabitants of a region, or maintain internationally recognised borders. Right across the area populated predominantly by Albanians run national borders they never wanted, and within Serbia and Macedonia they find themselves against their wills in the position of an ethnic minority. The Albanians believe they suffered an injustice in 1913 when a large part of their native region was not assigned to the new state of Albania that had just seceded from Turkey. Since then this has created a breeding ground for popular uprisings which aim at finally creating a Greater Albania. One way of avoiding this might be to quickly introduce a federal constitutional regulation into Macedonia, along the same lines as that which enables Flemings and Walloons to live peaceably side by side again since Belgium’s federalisation. Anyone wishing to combat nationalism must first remove its breeding ground by offering people a solution acceptable to them.

Apart from the many advantages that an integrated internal market for securities would bring, the report also contains a proposal for reform of the legislative process in securities matters which I consider to be a major step in the right direction. The present legislative process is much too long-winded and inflexible to be able to adapt to the much more rapidly changing securities markets. We simply cannot always be lagging behind market trends while at the same time setting ourselves such ambitious targets as the one decided in Lisbon, of becoming the world’s largest and most dynamic economic area within ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the broad outlines of the Lamfalussy Committee’s proposal, but I must insist on the ‘call-back’ mechanism proposed in Parliament’s resolution, which allows the European Parliament to call on the Commission to withdraw the proposals put before the Securities Committee concerning implementing measures in the event of a negative position being taken by itself or the Council. The Commission would have to comply with such a request and put forward a legislative proposal as part of the codecision procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">But the most important thing in all the squabbling about power sharing between Council and Parliament is that we should not lose sight of the objective of an integrated European securities market. We have set ourselves the year 2005 as a target date for an integrated internal market in financial services. Time is ticking by and rival markets and economies are not asleep. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today the governor of the Bank of Greece presents his report to parliament, in which he highlights the huge increase in Greece’s balance of trade deficit, which almost doubled in 2000 and now exceeds EUR 8 billion, compared with about EUR 4.5 billion in 1999. This huge increase in our balance of trade deficit has little to do with the increase in oil prices. The statistics show a significant increase in the number of imports penetrating traditional manufacturing sectors of the Greek economy with all that this implies for production, inflation, employment and incomes.</p>

Instead, it limits itself to repeating generalisations and to focusing on the sole objective of monetary policy, price stability and keeping inflation below the 2% limit set by the European Central Bank, without taking account of considerations concerning the real economy, particularly employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The report insists on the need to speed up the liberalisation of telecommunications, postal services, energy and transport, regardless of the consequences for employment, regional cohesion, working conditions and a high-quality universal public service. It continues to predict a healthy economic situation, despite signs that the EU’s economy is slowing down, as the rapporteur himself states, when we should be thinking about the slowdown of the US economy, the economic recession in Japan and the effects of these trends on the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The report insists on the need for greater flexibility in the labour market, at a time when there are more than 14 million people unemployed in the EU and around 65 million living in poverty. There are striking inequalities in income and employment is becoming increasingly insecure, with the majority of new jobs created being temporary or part time. The report continues to insist on moving towards the euro without creating the mechanisms necessary to minimise the economic and social risks. This is all being done in the name of the inviolable principle of competitiveness and the abstract concept of the social economy of the market.</p>

Its first recommendation, and the only specific one, is to ‘demand’ that ‘all necessary steps be taken’ to keep inflation below the mythical threshold of 2%. But how can anyone have confidence in experts who think that investments represent 5,3% of the GDP in Europe, whereas, in the year 2000, the accurate figure is 20,5%? How can we accept this insistence on demanding, yet again, as always, these ‘suitable reforms’ of social security systems, and a ‘more flexible’ labour market?</p>
<p class="contents">The political hypocrisy of using the word ‘social’ to dress up an increasingly rampant capitalism is compounded here by a very foolish error. By making inflation the absolute barometer of good economic health, there is a risk that the current recovery will be stifled, and that the prospect of a return to full employment will be put off to a time which is decidedly not ‘reasonable’.

<p class="contents">The resolution contains a number of sensible statements that I would like to underscore here too, especially because they are not always written so clearly. It is quite amazing that Members of all groups are saying that the present demographic trends make suitable reforms necessary to guarantee the benefits of social security systems in an efficient and safe way and that incentives must be provided for older workers to opt to extend their working lives.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to stress how welcome it is that this Parliament takes the view that the economic and monetary policy not only of the European Union but also of the Member States should be guided by the principles of the social market economy, the main elements of that economic system being named as freedom and democracy, competition, price stability, sustainable growth, subsidiarity, solidarity and private property.</p>
<p class="contents">I also find it good, given the worrying inflationary trends in many Member States, to reiterate that all necessary steps must be taken so that the inflation rate can be kept below 2% in the second half of 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly pleased that my motion that the liberalisation of the telecommunications, post, energy and railways sector must not be hasty but balanced was accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">The explicit call for a more flexible labour market, a labour market that must have the necessary human capital with the best possible education and training to satisfy the demands of the international knowledge economy, which presupposes consistent investment in the fields of education and new technologies, is particularly important if we are to achieve the ambitious objective of becoming the locomotive of the world economy in this decade like the American economy was in the 1990s.</p>

In 1991, to everyone’s surprise the moment suddenly arrived. The new, independent Ukrainian state, comparable in area and population with France, is now unfortunately a country in crisis. I visited the country in 1995, and saw factories at a standstill, stinking trains, dilapidated trams, beggars, money that had become worthless, and political polarisation between the Central Europe-oriented west and Russian-oriented east of the country. Things have not improved since then. A power struggle is going on uninhibited by any sense of decency, and parliamentary democracy is being given no chance to develop seriously. In general, I see no point in giving oppressive regimes money and simply hoping that things will improve as a result. The rulers of these countries are keen on the advantages of trade and subsidies, but absolutely refuse to allow openness or democracy. But the abuses in Ukraine are still less serious than those in Russia or Turkey, and resistance to them is greater. I agree that we should in this case take advantage of the opportunities for improvement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It highlights the progress made in the country’s development and in the partnership between the EU and the Ukraine, but is not afraid to refer to matters of criticism.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to discuss three aspects. Firstly, the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1989 led to the rapid formation of sovereign independent states, a process that happened quickly, almost overnight, but which could not change the specialisation that had developed over decades or the cooperation between the various countries’ economies.</p>
<p class="contents">Although at a different pace, the process of transformation, for which the EU also pressed, went hand in hand with social breakdown and unknown poverty for large sections of the Ukraine’s population. The EU ought to attach greater importance to dealing with this problem in its cooperation with the Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">While the EU and the Member States pursued primarily market interests under the slogan of stability, little attention was paid to the cooperation established over many years between the CIS states, one might even say it was torpedoed. In its own interest, the EU should pay greater attention to this factor in future and, in its understanding of how the Ukraine fits into the world economy, should also bear in mind that other CIS states are engaged in a similar process.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Ukraine has been given a lot of advice, and in many areas this has no doubt been legitimate and helpful. But politics is always tied up with interests. And if the shaping of partnership shows a strong tendency to benefit one particular party, then there is a problem. Partnership with the Ukraine ought to promote economic stability and social security and prevent or help to reduce tension. This is where the EU’s and the Ukraine’s real common interests lie.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, no-one will dispute that the OSCE played an important role in maintaining stability in Europe during the cold war. Both sides were involved in this process and both sides gained from it. The cold war ended ten years ago, and the OSCE should now be developed primarily into an instrument for the peaceful political resolution of conflicts. But NATO is pursuing the opposite course, basing its new strategy on strength and displays of power outside the alliance’s borders, which are steadily moving eastwards, and the EU is following in its wake. I consider involving the Ukraine, which has a long frontier with Russia, in this strategy to be a very serious matter. The Ukraine – and other CIS states as well – ought to be more closely involved than in the past in political processes for the resolution of conflicts. The OSCE would be the appropriate framework for this. With the Union acquiring new external borders, this factor will be of increasing importance not least with regard to the Ukraine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important to know that ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) was created in October 1998 in order to address American dominance in internet control, including DNS (Domain Name Systems) and the allocation of Internet Protocol (IP) address numbers.</p>
<p class="contents">ICANN consists of a 19-member Board of Directors, whose directors and external members are selected on the basis of criteria that will ensure a geographical balance. ICANN consists of four advisory committees, including the GAC (Governmental Advisory Committee), which includes representatives of the European Commission and the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking these factors into consideration, it would seem obvious that the European Union must invest in order to play a crucial role in the international management of the internet, and in order to strengthen the neutrality of ICANN by means of a strong presence from the European Union, in collaboration with the United States and other governments, through the Governmental Advisory Committee. It is also important that the Board of Directors of ICANN should be geographically representative. Its representatives should be elected, and Africa should now be represented, so as to ensure that all continents are represented.</p>
<p class="contents">I must emphasise that the management structure and legal field in which ICANN develops must be based on transparency, neutrality and independence. This means that the budgetary and financing system of this organisation must be based on criteria of clarity. It is only in these conditions that the viability of ICANN can be guaranteed. The Union must make sure that ICANN observes the protocols of WIPO (the World Intellectual Property Organisation) and cooperates with WIPO in its role as a negotiator and protector of rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that the rapporteur reminds us about the importance of closing the digital divide, and of providing the widest possible access to the Internet.

This is why the Movement for France delegation has not voted.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution, particularly in paragraph 32, attempts to amalgamate the issue of genetic engineering in the medical sector with the issue of biotechnology in the agricultural sector, perhaps in order to make the latter more acceptable. In reality, although both cases involve manipulating genes, the problems that arise are different. In medicine, it is a question of helping certain individuals whose lives would be seriously compromised if they were not given such treatment. In agriculture, on the other hand, the target is broad, or even undefined and infinite, since it involves setting in motion production methods which may affect the environment in general or the health of millions of consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, there is no doubt that genetic engineering in the medical field gives rise to ethical problems which are more serious than those elsewhere, and we note that the Purvis resolution, in paragraph 61, takes cover behind pious generalities, while avoiding specifically tackling the problem that is currently the most urgent: that of cloning for therapeutic purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">When voting took place, Parliament did not wish to ask directly for the abolition of the de facto<span class="italic"> </span>moratorium on the authorisation of genetically modified organisms. Nevertheless, it adopted a paragraph 34, which ‘regrets government actions to block or delay authorisation of GM products for reasons not based on objective scientific opinion’, which may amount to the same thing, depending on what one understands by the phrase ‘objective scientific opinion’. We would feel more reassured if the resolution had clearly said which government, in its opinion, was holding up these authorisations in such a blameworthy fashion.</p>
<p class="contents">Another defect in this resolution is the fact that in paragraph 36 it congratulates itself on the subject of the agreement drawn up a month ago between Parliament and the Council, on the procedure for authorising GMOs. Yet we ourselves criticised that agreement, on the grounds that it establishes authorisation procedures without establishing traceability, liability or compulsory insurance on the part of distributors. Admittedly, the resolution also calls for testing and labelling guarantees, but Amendment No 6, which lays down liability and insurance obligations, was rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as if this were not enough, the resolution calls for the European Food Safety Authority to be responsible for authorising GMOs, which we totally disagree with, because we would like each State to retain the right of international safeguard in this important field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It demands that Member States encourage private industry to penetrate further into universities and public institutions. It calls upon researchers to participate in setting up private businesses. It wants more mobility between universities and the private sector. It welcomes the progress achieved in the financial markets and is in favour of stock options. It invites businesses to play an active role in ‘informing’ the public about GMOs – as if we were not already subjected to massive ideological publicity campaigns from these industrial groups!</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution tabled by the Committee on Industry leads the way in favour of GMO production. It claims that there is no objective scientific opinion on which to base their non-authorisation. It calls for the immediate lifting of the ‘effective moratorium’ that is holding back the marketing of these products. It wants field trials to be authorised, even though this would mean the inevitable uncontrolled spread of GMOs. A few considerations on the need to draw up ‘ethical guidelines’ do nothing to hide the essential nature of this resolution, i.e. to oppose all the public movements that are currently campaigning on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, they cannot prove that there are no major drawbacks attached. Nor can opponents of a rapid deployment of biotechnology prove that the drawbacks are such that no deployment should ever take place. The truth will only emerge in the long term, perhaps in 30 or 50 years’ time. In the meantime, patience and research are called for. It is precisely that kind of patience that is lacking in Mr Purvis’s proposal. On the contrary, following on from what was discussed here last month in relation to the Bowe report, he wants to make it difficult for Member States to maintain the moratorium independently. His aim is to give scope for rapid commercial use wherever possible. It is remarkable that the parties grouped in the PPE, which call themselves Christian, are here throwing the door wide open to something, while they are still completely unsure as to whether they will have to explain it in retrospect as an improvement on God’s creation or as a further contribution to its progressive destruction. Instead of focusing all criticism on therapeutic cloning and voluntary euthanasia, it would have been more natural for these parties to be more critical on this of all points.

Our citizens have challenged us in the field of food production to safe food, with the guarantee of adequate precautions to ensure this goal and proper liability and penalties in place for any violation resulting in damage to the person on the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">We are presently living with the tragic devastating results of BSE and FMD and there is a consensus in the EU that we must re examine the very basic of our agriculture industry: There is presently a united call for re examination of the CAD and organic food production in being promoted and supported within our institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In light of these considerations, I believe the EU must exercise extreme caution in embracing the biotechnology industry without the outmost care and precautions being in place.</p>
<p class="contents">The US, a front runner in the field of biotech Industry is itself dealing with the difficulties of rapidly progressing GM food production sector where private sector involvement has lead to a market place dominated by global companies and the devastation of small producers who cannot compete with ‘corporate’ farming. The SME's of Agriculture do not appear to have been protected or supported in the world of GM food production.</p>
<p class="contents">I must vote against the Purvis report on a number of points. I believe that the promise of solving illnesses, increasing yield and cleaning up the environment etc remain to be proven. Indeed in the US, it is my understanding that many GM crops have been shown not to increase yield but even to possibly decrease yield. Widespread genetic engineering of crops and food will surely lead to further intensification of agriculture and what of the health risks from GM products; the EU Commission has banned the use of BST (genetically engineered Bovine Growth Hormone used to increase milk production in the US) for health reasons. BST is not allowed in any other country apart from the US. There is a documented large increase in allergies to Soya which is now 50% GM.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the suggested lifting of the Moratorium on GM crops, gene transfer is now a proven fact. In my own country of Ireland what hope is there of protected non-GM crops from contamination of this kind? How will we be able to pursue organic food production in crops such as wheat and the cereals?</p>
<p class="contents">How can we determine if future proposals for labelling and monitoring are adequate when we do not, as yet, know exactly what they are to be?</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the Cartagena Protocol, it must be aid that our own European Commission tried to resist clauses to introduce Cartagena into the Directive 90/220.</p>
<p class="contents">This report unfortunately dismisses organic food, as being at present incapable of providing enough food for Europe as it's not cost effective. Organic producers assure me that they refute this statement.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many other points including an almost unrestricted Patenting system that force me to vote against this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as far as the ethical problems surrounding genetic engineering, the US model we are using as a benchmark has without doubt, led to the breakdown of the protection of the dignity of the human being. We are now faced with some members of our human family being used as objects for research, and the cloning of children at the embryonic stage is imminent within our own European Community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, having said that, I must admit that I am suspicious of a certain utilitarian philosophy which tends to affirm that the ends justify the means and that, ultimately, we should just let the operators get on with it and the market will sort it all out.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also suspicious of an ideology of progress, which was what also inspired the Nazis and Stalinists, and feel that the ethical concerns surrounding this issue are not of secondary importance but should take centre stage because biotechnologies touch on the very heart of life in all its mystery and sanctity. Biotechnologies are a vast sector, which ranges from the innocent use of natural fermenting agents, used since the dawn of mankind to make bread and beer, to the genetic engineering of human beings, which touches on the very essence of mankind in all its intimacy and heredity, leaving behind individuality in a bid to achieve immortality.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Purvis’s report is immensely enthusiastic on the subject of biotechnologies, from which he expects wondrous benefits for mankind; to be fair, he does refer to the risks inherent in biotechnologies and to the ethical problems which they raise, but I should like to draw your attention to the fact that, so far, these benefits have yet to be proven. For now, the benefits seem to be assets for the companies alone and the risks appear to be liabilities for our citizens and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall close by quoting from two small articles in Mr Purvis’s report which deserve to be highlighted:</p>
<p class="contents">Article 60: [the European Parliament] wishes the technology to be exploited to the benefit of society in accordance with the fundamental values and ethical principles of European citizens, their culture and civilisation, and to this end sees the need to develop ethical guidelines;</p>
<p class="contents">Article 61: stresses that the public’s wish for ethically-motivated limits on genetic engineering and biotechnology is justified... </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Unfortunately, Parliament’s report, drafted by Mr Purvis, does not address these issues and, dangerously, acts as a biased mouthpiece for all the interests of the huge multinationals in the sector. It follows an approach that supports, in the name of good causes, the liberalisation and increasingly widespread use of products, not all the consequences of which for the environment and human health are known, quite apart from the fact that these actions also raise far-reaching ethical issues, such as genetic modifications and the patenting of life and the environment, which is the heritage of everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">The approach of squeezing profit from everything, without careful assessment, leads the industry, in order to compensate for high research costs, to try to put onto the market products whose safety cannot be guaranteed and which, furthermore, create an economic dependency on the part of their users, which is what is happening in agriculture with GMOs.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in terms of medicines and patenting them, developing countries and the poorest parts of the population are being excluded, which is what is happening, unacceptably, as a result of the behaviour of multinationals in Brazil and South Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore reject this report. This is an area in which research should be in the public domain, not controlled by private interests, since the fair distribution of the benefits and the necessary risk assessment must be guaranteed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
