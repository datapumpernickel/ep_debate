<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Frithjof Schmidt (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, by means of the report on fair trade and development, we, as Parliament, are reacting to the remarkable economic and political success story which is fair trade.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years, growth rates in fair trade within Europe have risen, on average, by 20%, with the trend upwards. In individual countries, we have market shares of up to 20%, as is the case with coffee in Great Britain. This all serves to demonstrate the success of a civil society initiative under market conditions which, hitherto, has got by without significant state support and funding. At the same time, this is also directly successful in combating poverty since fair prices guarantee a fair income. It is also fairly crucial as regards social development in the southern states that producers in these countries receive a fair income.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the entire matter demonstrates the high level of awareness on the part of European consumers and their interest in social responsibility in relation to trade internationally speaking as well as high product quality. This topic also therefore concerns the protection of consumer interests. Fair prices, fair working and production conditions, adherence to ecological standards; all of these things are of equal benefit to the quality of life of producers in the south and consumers in the north.</p>
<p class="contents">There was also broad agreement in the Committee on Development, something I am very pleased about. At this point therefore, I would like to extend my express thanks to all my colleagues in the Committee on Development, the shadow rapporteurs, and the coordinators, for their constructive advice. The report was adopted unanimously in committee. This was preceded by intensive exchanges between the Fair Trade Movement and numerous associations on the problems of fair trade. In committee, we jointly drew up and put forward criteria which have to be met by products designated ‘fair trade’ so as not to deceive consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">This report therefore calls on the Commission to present a recommendation relating to fair trade. This involves the promotion of a political and economic concept and not, for instance, the promotion of a trade name, nor does it involve a legally binding, detailed regulation or a Fair Trade Act for the whole of Europe. It is not, nor should it be, our intention to over regulate and, hence, possibly impede this successful, burgeoning market. However, it does involve defining criteria which make up the substance of the concept of ‘fair trade’.</p>
<p class="contents">Key criteria that have been put forward to this end in the report include, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, producer prices which guarantee their existence, informing consumers about the prices maintained by producers, that is, transparency, observance of the core conventions of the International Labour Organisation regarding health and safety at work and child labour in relation to production, the observance of environmental standards, supporting production and market access by producer organisations and monitoring compliance with these criteria. It would be important for these points to be included in the Commission’s recommendation.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, I would also expressly like to thank the Commission. Especially in the Directorate General for Development and the Directorate General for Trade, openness to and, I might add, also a liking for this report, was clear to see. We had highly constructive exchanges.</p>
<p class="contents">One more personal observation: Commissioner Mandelson, I know that you love chocolate and I have often seen how you prefer fair trade chocolate from Oxfam. These are two predilections we both share. I am therefore already aware through your consumer habits that you take an open view of this topic.</p>
<p class="contents">I would again like to make a particular appeal to you. In the ‘aid for trade’ programme, which is now being discussed at the WTO, create an ‘aid for fair trade sector.’ If we were only able to use 10% of the funds in this area for the fair trade sector, that would provide enormous impetus for this fine concept. Help us by giving preferential treatment to fair trade products in public invitations to tender, and breathe fresh life into Article 23 of the Cotonou Agreement, whereby fair trade in collaboration with ACP (Africa, Caribbean and Pacific) States is to be accorded important status and supported.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union needs a well-coordinated fair trade policy. Parliament will today, I hope, take an important step in this direction and it is then up to the Commission to take a further important step. We need this recommendation, Commissioner Mandelson. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sincerely and warmly I would like to thank him for this report, which I think is very valuable and will be well received.</p>
<p class="contents">Fair Trade is one of the key tools, in my view, to enhance sustainable development and to equip us better to fight poverty in the world, and as a concept it is developing fast. It is undoubtedly a very popular trade practice. It is gaining in currency and appeal with public opinion, and helps to raise public awareness about all the issues that are involved in sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">You are not just undertaking an act of consumption that is good in terms of the content of what you consume. It is also a stimulus to the brain. It makes you think and therefore it is even more valuable. Consumers do take into account considerations about the conditions of production. People care, they do not just eat, and Fair Trade has pioneered this in a most attractive way.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission actively supports Fair Trade. We took on commitments to Fair Trade in the Cotonou Agreement with the ACP countries, as well as in our communication on policy coherence for development.</p>
<p class="contents">Many trade and development assistance projects support Fair Trade: development projects to the tune of over EUR 4 million in 2003, and growing. These consist mainly of support for NGO activities, but also of direct aid to the harmonisation of standards at work. We also participate in Fair Trade events.</p>
<p class="contents">One could argue that whilst Fair Trade helps salve the conscience of those who buy such products, others continue, nonetheless, to exploit the needy. I am not happy about that argument: Fair Trade is not a panacea for all the problems of poor producers, nor does it necessarily mean that because you are not buying and consuming Fair Trade products you are exploiting the poor.</p>
<p class="contents">What is required to tackle poverty and to enhance development is a general and coherent policy framework. It is this that we need to develop, to conceptualise, and this report will help us to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Fair Trade is private and limited to the participating producers, while the UN Millennium Development Goals are for all. So Fair Trade is particular and specific, the Millennium Development Goals are general and wide-ranging; but there is a clear interconnection between the two. The objective is different for an individual and for EU policy-making.</p>
<p class="contents">An individual makes a personal choice. He or she is entitled to exercise that choice. You cannot automatically translate that into a more wide-ranging policy. The individual consumer looks at one packet of coffee, rightly. Policy-makers, on the other hand, have to take into account the sector as a whole and our obligations to that sector as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a complete and public solution – one that should not be confined, therefore, to Fair Trade only. As the report rightly points out, there are other non-Fair Trade operators that can achieve similar results to those obtained by Fair Traders, that have the same growth potential and that can influence consumer choice and the international trading schemes. We should fully use the potential of all credible initiatives to support sustainability. That should be our test. Does it help, does it aid, does it take forward sustainability? If it does, that should govern our response and attitude to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Building on commitments taken previously, we want to explore with our partners the use of economic partnership agreements with the ACP countries, as well as other trade agreements, for including specific incentives targeted at improving market access for fair trade products. That is where I believe we can leverage our interest and leverage our commitment most beneficially.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very useful, therefore, that the report points to the danger of inappropriate national legislation in the field of Fair Trade. I am aware of some initiatives being taken that might harm the status that Fair Trade has already achieved. We need to be vigilant about these and to see, therefore, whether it is not better to take a more coherent and collective approach in order to leverage the greatest benefits for Fair Trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Conversely, too firm an adhesion to the particular approach embodied in Fair Trade would be at risk of being discriminatory against other systems, some of them acknowledged in your report, which have similar claims and that we can and should support.</p>
<p class="contents">You are right about the need to protect consumers, the question is how. I believe the role of policy is to ensure that messages given to consumers are accurate and transparent, and I am glad that this is also stressed in the report. We already have protection against misleading claims, but we might consider going further and help engage the consumer actively in the ethics of production.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that there is scope for better information about claims schemes in general, and work is in progress on this. I will ask my services to look at how sustainability is enhanced by different certification and assurance schemes, including Fair Trade.</p>
<p class="contents">We will look at all the suggestions made in this report and of course keep Parliament informed of further developments. We need a dialogue with Parliament on a continuing basis. I am glad, therefore, that this report provides the framework, both for this dialogue and for the way in which we can, should and will take our commitment in this area further forward.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion I would like to thank the rapporteur again for the quality of this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although the topic has been dealt with by the Commission and Parliament on numerous occasions, there is always the need for further action so that fair trade can continue to develop efficiently and successfully. What is important here is that central standards and criteria are introduced on which basis the market should develop. However, as far as this fledgling sector is concerned, consideration must constantly be given to the fact that precipitous directives always involve the risk of schematic harmonisation and over regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">With a figure of 60-70% of total sales, Europe is the largest sales market for fair trade products and offers, based on my assessment, further opportunities for growth. In this regard, it is a matter of particular concern for me that municipalities, towns and cities, <span class="italic">Länder</span> and other regional administrative bodies are reminded time and again and asked to consider fair trade products in their invitations to tender as well as use them at various events and suchlike.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the meagre production diversity in fair trade products, the customer is often unsure whether the product designated as such is actually a fair trade product in the first place. The bigger this market, the greater the uncertainty. Therefore, we may have to consider a European fair trade logo in future.</p>
<p class="contents">For the producers of fair trade products, I am calling for price structuring which ensures their existence, fair production conditions and adherence to environmental standards in the context of sustainable development. Fair trade must be inseparably linked to key labour standards. Now that we have succeeded in creating positive framework conditions for developing and promoting fair trade, as Europeans, we are able to assume a very important role as a pacesetter in this sphere. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fair Trade can make a positive contribution to the development of poor countries by ensuring better conditions for producers and their families, as well as ensuring better access to world markets and promoting sustainable development. I would like to draw your attention to a number of points in the text which are problematic due to the substance of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, in my opinion, the report sometimes confuses the idea of Fair Trade (written in capitals) with fair trade in the general sense. The text will be the first in the history of European lawmaking to deal with the Fair Trade sector, or in other words with Fair Trade written in capitals, in the form of a report on goods labelled with the Fair Trade logo and marketed as such. The subject of the report should have been the labelling of products so that the guiding principles of Fair Trade would not be distorted at the cost of consumers who want to buy Fair Trade products.</p>
<p class="contents">The report concerns the Fair Trade sector. However, and I would like to emphasise this, the report being debated here is not a report on fair trade in sense of making international trade fairer. It is clear that fair trade (written using lower case letters) is something different. It is an attempt to make all trade fairer and this subject has been touched upon in many other European Parliament resolutions and reports.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, in my opinion, referring to the Cotonou Agreement in this context is inappropriate, as this Agreement deals with fair trade written in lower case letters and not capital letters. I also think that the issue of stabilising prices is a dubious subject and comments related to it will not help us to assess the report as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe he was one of the few working, because of the World Cup excitement. I asked him whether he liked living in France. He said it was OK, but he missed Ghana. Here in France, three of his children were able to go to university, something that was impossible to imagine in Ghana.</p>
<p class="contents">I was in Ghana last year. What the taxi driver said confirmed what I had seen there. I went to northern Ghana to meet tomato and rice farmers. They were unable to make a living wage and therefore unable to send their children to school or to have any access to medical care. At the same time, on the markets in northern Ghana, there was US-subsidised rice and EU-processed tomato products, cheaper than the local produce.</p>
<p class="contents">On the same trip, we visited Fair Trade cocoa farmers in central Ghana. They were certainly not rich people but they had a sustainable price, they had a long-term contract for their product. Therefore they were able to access medical care, there was a school for their children, and the Fair Trade premium meant that there was investment in water in their local villages. I saw the same differences between Fair Trade farmers and non-Fair Trade farmers in the Windward Islands, on the banana farms.</p>
<p class="contents">We want fair prices for farmers in all developing countries. We hope that the WTO will deliver a more just system, but in the meantime we need Fair Trade, with a capital ‘F’ and a capital ‘T’. I am pleased to hear that the Commission will support that.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of other labels, yes, other ethical labels are being developed. Some of them are very good, but we have to be careful here. We cannot have Fair Trade on the cheap. As the market gets bigger, there is a temptation for more and more players to want an ethical label, but they do not want to pay the real price. So we have to watch who we support and make sure the labels really are ethical. Fair Trade is about price and sustainability. It is about the Millennium Development Goal of tackling poverty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sure we shall all benefit greatly from following his recommendations. I also welcome the views as expressed by the Commission. I am sure that our partnership approach will deliver much good.</p>
<p class="contents">It is of particular importance, because today much of our food and drink comes from the developing world, where farmers and workers are finding it increasingly difficult to make a decent living. In our global marketplace, the use of internationally recognised labels or marks, which conscientious consumers can have confidence in, is a logical and significant contribution to economic and social improvements across the globe. Through the use of clear labelling, individuals are beginning to realise that they are able to play their part in tackling the problem of international poverty. The simple decision to buy products with a Fair Trade mark can have a huge impact, guaranteeing that growers and workers benefit from fairer wages and better working conditions, and can make a crucial different to their ability to provide for the basic needs of their families.</p>
<p class="contents">In the last five years, the United Kingdom has proved to have the most dynamic Fair Trade structures of all the EU Member States and is the fastest growing Fair Trade market in the world. A staggering 87% of the UK population would rather buy from companies that do something positive for the community. When asked which products fall into this category, 27% specifically noted Fair Trade products. This figure could and should be much higher and it is the duty of all responsible Members of this House to raise awareness of this necessary project.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own north-west constituency, we are determined to promote equality and sustainable development wherever possible. Garstang in Lancashire was the first town to achieve Fair Trade status in 2001. Thirteen north-west towns, including industrial powerhouses such as Manchester, Lancaster and Liverpool, have all followed. Kendal was the first Fair Trade borough and now Lancashire Council has pledged to become the first Fair Trade county.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as in the European Parliament, Fair Trade products are available in many Council buildings, tea and coffee served at meetings is Fair Trade and awareness days have been held to inform staff about the benefits of Fair Trade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know that this is still a drop in the ocean in terms of the global economy and that one million rural workers benefit from it today. This may sound like a large number, but it is actually not very many at all. The EU must therefore make a commitment to fair trade, if only to appease the conscience of a common agricultural policy that spreads hunger and poverty in the countries of the South. Fair trade could be a feather in your cap, Commissioner. Other people, farmers, trade networks and demanding consumers could breathe new life into it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Schmidt has put forward some good proposals, especially reducing VAT and the end of import duties, but the positive aspect of the report lies elsewhere; it shows the way forward and a principle of hope.

<p class="contents">Fair Trade is about paying poor producers a fair price and helping them gain the necessary skills and knowledge to develop their business and work their way out of poverty. I agree with the Commissioner. It is not the sole answer, but it is part of a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Shoppers who choose produce with the Fair Trade mark play a vital role in alleviating poverty and supporting marginalised producers in a manner that promotes dignity and self-sufficiency. New figures released today reveal that global sales of Fair Trade certified products reached 1.1 billion in 2005. That represents an increase of 37% over 2004. The message is obvious: consumers are happy to support Fair Trade. To generate greater sales of Fair Trade terms for the benefit of more marginalised producers, it is important to involve commercial manufacturers and to encourage Fair Trade supply to supermarkets, where most people do their shopping.</p>
<p class="contents">Fair Trade’s significant worldwide growth in 2005 also shows that more and more producers, traders and suppliers trust the Fair Trade certificate mark and like to join the system. However, the challenge ahead will be to make sure that the standards in that certification are maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">I recently visited Guatemala with Trocaire, an Irish NGO. During our visit we visited the Claremont coffee estate, where 50 families who have lived and worked on that estate for three generations, living in what can only be described as feudal conditions, were thrown off their farm because the owner, who happens to be the sister-in-law of the country’s president, decided that she did not want them on the estate and wanted to change what they were doing. They are a group of people who want to start a co-op to produce Fair Trade coffee. They know how to produce coffee; as I said, they have been doing it for generations. I just want it put on record that I have raised the plight of these people in Guatemala in this House, because I think it is an absolute outrage that people can be treated like that in this day and age.</p>

For me, it means free trade, trade without customs and quotas in an environment where free enterprising spirit and the right to property are respected. In parts, this report has a different perspective to mine, and in places it seems almost to strive for the opposite.</p>
<p class="contents">The report mixes up two different kinds of Fair Trade. When companies and organisations themselves define what they think is fair and then offer the consumer products produced according to the criteria thus defined, this is a demonstration of consumer power, which is a very good thing.</p>
<p class="contents">The other kind of Fair Trade is when politicians involve themselves in a voluntary business relationship and lay down conditions and prices that they deem to be fair so that they can then call this Fair Trade. For me, this is socialism and something very bad. The report proposes providing companies’ Fair Trade with a legal basis of its own and setting political goals and criteria. This is to take consumer power, which is so important, and turn it into some sort of socialist planned economy. It amazes me that so many MEPs think this is desirable.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the fact that Fair Trade labelling is an expression of consumer power and something very positive, I would still like to conclude by calling on everyone, both politicians and citizens, to continue to be critical consumers, particularly in relation to goods bearing Fair Trade labelling. They often give more money and influence to organisations controlled by leftist ideology and opposition to free trade than to the really poor in underdeveloped countries. Tropicana and Dole orange juice probably do more to contribute to development and fighting poverty than, for instance, the example we have here from Oxfam.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament’s unthinking embrace of Oxfam is in itself a good example of the crazy turn things can take when we are not critical in embracing Fair Trade products. The Oxfam orange juice sold here in Parliament, for example, comes from Cuba. Until someone has explained to me how it can be called Fair Trade when I buy state-produced juice and my money goes to a communist dictatorship I demand that all Oxfam products be removed from the range of goods on offer in Parliament, because that is not Fair Trade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a very fine report. In the case of certain speakers, one gets the impression that they have not read the report and are giving lectures they have brought with them from other political fora.</p>
<p class="contents">Irrespective of whether fair trade is written with capital or small letters, for me, it is very important that attention is drawn to the fact that the ‘fair trade’ label, under the corresponding conditions, can be a model for the global market. I am wondering why people in this House are so afraid of fairness in world trade. We would save ourselves numerous discussions on development and migration policy if the world trade system was structured more fairly.</p>
<p class="contents">We spoke with entrepreneurs from the ACP (Africa, Caribbean and Pacific) States when a parliamentary meeting took place two weeks ago in Vienna. Representatives of these small business employers told us about the important role played by the ‘fair trade’ label in their regions. They also mentioned that it would be a good example and a solution to the problem in their regions if international trade as a whole would move more in this direction. Reference was also made to the enormous influence of fair trade production on combating poverty in general and, specifically, on the lives of women.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that we state this clearly and I hope that we adopt the rapporteur’s report as is so as to support both the ‘fair trade’ label and fair trade itself in an energetic manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, although Fair Trade is growing in many places, it is much less developed in some Member States than others. EU support for Fair Trade through consumer awareness and information campaigns can help Fair Trade grow across the whole of Europe.

<p class="contents">No one can doubt the positive contribution of fair trade initiatives and programmes to the sustainable economic and social development of developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a well-known fact that the Union is one of the most open markets in the world, especially as a result of the 'everything but arms' initiative for the benefit of less developed countries and the preferential treatment of other developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, free access is not all that is needed. We also need more balanced access and a redistribution of resources between competitive exporters and small producers. We also need to combat social and ecological dumping.</p>
<p class="contents">The concessions made by the Union and its development policy need primarily to target vulnerable countries, especially those in greatest need. In other words, there is no point in opening up the European market for the benefit of large exporters in developing countries to the detriment of small and medium-sized European producers. The development of fair trade systems and the promotion of products which meet high social and environmental specifications are even more important in light of the absence of such matters from current World Trade Organisation negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I too should like to take my turn in congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Schmidt, for his qualitative contribution to the debate on international fair trade law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would also like to say that, like Linda McAvan, I have many experiences from developing countries, such as Uganda, where last year I met a farmer who had a kilo of coffee beans to sell for 150 Ugandan shillings. Subsequently I paid 1000 Ugandan shillings for one cup of coffee. This is the kind of injustice which the Fair Trade movement is dealing with.</p>
<p class="contents">My own country, Wales, has now voted to become a beacon of Fair Trade practice. This week our First Minister announced proposals for Wales to become a Fair Trade nation. We are now working to increase awareness of Fair Trade issues amongst the population in Wales. That means working in colleges, schools, the voluntary sector, across business networks and elsewhere, and increasing awareness amongst our population.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that in 2007 Wales will become a Fair Trade nation and our Fair Trade support will, as others have said, make an enormous difference to the lives of countless poor people and will mean that we will make our contribution to making poverty history. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In summarising the documents, I can state that fair trade is not simply about achieving fair prices and access to markets. Neither does it solely involve work to increase social standards, eradicate poverty, provide technological assistance and build skills. It also involves paying attention to the socio-economic situation of producers and their local communities. That is why, on behalf of the members of the European Parliament’s working group on the destruction of obsolete pesticides and the non-governmental organisations working with us, I would like to draw your attention to the problem posed by the tens of thousands of tons of obsolete pesticides stockpiled in African countries, former Soviet states, European Union Member States and countries applying for European Union membership. These pesticides are a serious threat to development. They restrict the production of healthy food and, as a result, affect these countries’ ability to participate in trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us please help these countries eradicate the source of this threat. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Just because Fair Trade schemes are not a panacea, that does not mean to say that we should fail to support them. Just because they are not a total solution, that should not blind us to the fact that they make a very important contribution to the overall solution that we want to see in putting trade at the service of development, to enable us to tackle poverty in the world. That is why this report and debate enable us to take a stand and deliver a message, not least because there is growing public interest and concern. I thought Mr Karim’s speech in particular illustrated the growth of activity, public opinion and consciousness. We as politicians need to express and reflect that opinion and find ways for it to grow.</p>
<p class="contents">For all those reasons, because consumers are becoming increasingly aware and want to make an informed choice, that translates into pressure on mainstream operators, producers and traders to raise their game in order to match higher public expectations and standards. That then also converts into pressure on governments to act to help raise those standards and to increase consumer awareness and information. So we have a ‘virtuous’ circle here, to which we should be contributing.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, what works in the private context and what works for an individual consumer choice does not automatically or neatly convert into a prescribed public policy. That is obvious. Nor is it the case that one particular Fair Trade scheme or Fair Trade label gives that scheme or that label an exclusive right to endorsement. There are other organisations and NGOs, such as the Rainforest Alliance, which deliver many of the same environmental and social benefits by working in collaboration with mainstream companies. The key policy challenge is to get the most out of all these efforts, not to identify some in order to discriminate, unwittingly and unintentionally, against others.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to re-commit the Commission to working with NGOs in this area and we welcome Parliament’s support. There is broader work being led by Mr Michel on commodity supply change, through which we are planning to support the creation of a web portal to serve as a clearing-house of information about consumer assurance schemes of all kinds.</p>
<p class="contents">There are other ideas and proposals that I want to take back to the Commission and to consider with my colleagues. We need to establish good models that provide for higher standards. That is what we are jointly committed to and I look forward to continuing this work with Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
