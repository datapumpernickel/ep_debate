<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, the European steel industry has been through a difficult period over the last 20 years. There was a need for an overall restructuring of the sector. Nowadays the European steel industry is very competitive. In order to maintain their global position, however, companies need to engage in a continuous process of adapting their structures.</p>
<p class="contents">The industry is still striving for efficiency, but even if remaining overcapacities are closed down, from an industrial point of view, we cannot talk about a real crisis on the scale that we had in the 1980s, but rather about a social crisis due to new closures. Restructuring is often a synonym for job losses which can have tragic consequences on the social fabric of any region, but in particular on those regions facing a low job creation potential.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is acutely aware of the need for citizens and workers to feel secure in taxing times. We have observed again in recent weeks extremely different experiences and approaches on how to deal with large-scale operations of corporate restructuring. In some cases, these operations are prepared well in advance, fully involving workers' representatives, with due care being taken to search for less damaging solutions, and seeking actively and in good time to prepare workers likely to be affected to face the challenge of sudden unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">In other cases these operations were launched and implemented with no care or concern at all for those affected. On every occasion in the past, the Commission has always highlighted the following basic principles. Firstly, decisions on corporate restructuring remain a prerogative, as well as a responsibility, of management. This means that when contemplating actions likely to have serious social consequences, companies should always actively search and choose the less damaging solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, when dismissals prove to be inevitable, the utmost must be done to improve the employability of those concerned. This requires anticipation and adequate management of those processes.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, nothing can justify the absence of timely and effective information and consultation with workers' representatives. These basic assertions attract a wide consensus in Europe. It is, thankfully, increasingly rare to see companies embarking on damaging restructuring operations, ignoring these fundamental concerns, but it does sometimes happen. The way in which Metaleurop conducted the closure of the Pas de Calais plant is the worst possible example of disregard for the interests, the concerns and the rights of workers, as well as for the health and safety of the surrounding population.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, of course, fair and necessary to underline other approaches: at the other extreme, Arcelor is also facing a restructuring process with unavoidable pain for its workers, but is tackling it differently. The Commission does not wish to interfere in the economic logic behind the management's intentions, it is the management's role to do that in close consultation with workers' representatives. Arcelor took a number of positive and productive steps, well before the recent announcement measures had already commenced, to anticipate the problems. Again recently, the management reaffirmed its intention to enter into effective consultations with workers' representatives at all levels. The consultation process encompasses: the economic reasoning behind the projected closures; taking independent expert advice on the whole affair; taking all possible measures to avoid the closures or limit their social impact; and seeking to clean the local environment and re-industrialise the closed plants.</p>
<p class="contents">This extensive programme is serious and is considered to be so by all stakeholders. It is the result of a different kind of industrial relations which have led, for instance, to an agreement on transnational information and consultation of workers that is widely recognised as being very advanced and effective. The three seats on the board for workers' representatives, although there is currently no legal obligation for this, also illustrate that same positive approach. This in fact anticipates the European Company Statute.</p>
<p class="contents">We have built over recent years in the European Union a wide range of instruments that meet these concerns. The directives on collective redundancies, transfers of undertakings, information and consultation and the European Works Councils directive are some examples.</p>
<p class="contents">The most recent texts clearly promote upstream worker involvement, notably on strategic issues and on the foreseeable evolution of employment within companies. This is the only way to help the European workforce face the challenges of change successfully in that it allows for the timely development of the employability and adaptability of workers.</p>
<p class="contents">The two cases I mentioned before can only confirm those assertions, one positively and one negatively. It is up to national courts and other authorities to ensure compliance with Community directives. The Commission will, of course, fulfil its ultimate role of control of the application of Community law if breaches are not effectively sanctioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Those aspects will constitute some of the main elements of the forthcoming revision of the European Works Councils Directive. More importantly, the Commission very much hopes that the European social partners identify and find the means of developing good practices of corporate restructuring throughout the EU, as they decided to do when responding positively to last year's consultation on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Those good practices go well beyond the information and consultation of workers. They cover actions with a view to anticipating the market and technological developments, investing in people on a permanent basis, developing employability, seeking alternatives to closures and redundancies, redeploying, whenever possible, workers affected by restructuring operations and so on - precisely those good practices which I hope will help Arcelor's workers overcome the present difficulties, and which are dramatically absent in the Metaleurop environment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also useful to recall in this context other initiatives of the Commission relating to corporate social responsibility, social dialogue and the European Monitoring Centre on Change.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides those policy aspects, our immediate concern today is the recent cases of restructuring. The Commission would like to state clearly that, above all, we share your regret and concern on the possible social consequences for those who may be affected. I sincerely hope that every effort is made to prevent or attenuate them through dialogue between all parties concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hansenne (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must admit to the Commissioner that I found his speech extraordinarily disappointing. He gave a series of general considerations on a situation that we are well aware of. Those considerations were centred around the restructuring of companies in a series of sectors, but did not specifically deal with the problems that we are currently experiencing in several regions. I must admit that I was very surprised to hear the Commissioner condemning the attitude of a company that everyone considers to have behaved in a particularly scandalous manner, Metaleurop, and at the same time praising another company which has been headline news in recent months, Arcelor.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision taken by Arcelor to gradually close its hot-working steel facilities on its continental sites was, of course, received with concern in the regions concerned. It was also received with anger, in particular in the Liège region, because it is ruthlessly breaking the commitment made by Usinor before merging into the new Arcelor group to invest in the smelting works in Liège, in order to ensure that hot-working production lines were maintained. Along with this commitment there was a commitment in return from workers to make efforts towards productivity to ensure that the site was competitive. The workers’ commitments were kept but Usinor’s have now been betrayed and the workers feel they have been duped. This is why all of the movements in the region and also the Walloon Government and the Belgian Federal Government are now asking Arcelor to explain itself.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is important that the European Commission also takes this stance. The resolution that we have all put forward together has the prime objective of ensuring that Arcelor keeps its commitments. There is all the more reason for Arcelor to keep its commitments given that you said – and this is the important element in your statement – that the steel industry was not in crisis, that companies in general were competitive, and that there is therefore no reason for Arcelor to want to go back on the commitments that it made unless it is for purely financial reasons. We should not therefore envisage first of all restructuring processes with Cockerill-Sambre, and then with Usinor. The Liège region has already experienced and paid heavily for the steel crisis. What is needed now to ensure restructuring is time.</p>
<p class="contents">What the Liège region does not accept is for commitments to be broken, shortening the deadlines that were set for us, and we therefore clearly ask the Commission to remind Arcelor of its commitments. We should also question Arcelor’s behaviour, as we are learning that it intends to purchase a number of sites in a candidate country that will be part of Europe in the future. That raises a number of questions at European level.</p>

<p class="contents">What I am saying is how much, like Mr Hansenne, we think that a Commission declaration was more necessary than ever, but we also think that it is largely inadequate. This is particularly true in my case, because I sent the Commission proof of Arcelor’s desire to set up on continental sites in Poland, while we have just recounted how in three European regions, continental sites are by their nature doomed to disappear. I will not say any more, Mr President, in order to allow my colleagues to speak. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The responsibility of the Commission today is effectively to take on the role of the public authority within the powers that it has inherited from the High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community. It should also be pointed out that the Commission should not be a spectator, but play an active public role in managing steel at European Union level.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution put forward contains some themes that we see as essential. I hope that the Commission is able to answer four quite specific questions on these four themes. First of all, being aware that European firmness is necessary in order for steel production to be fairly distributed at global level, is the Commission going to ensure that the Polish Government cannot intervene financially in the industrial processes to support any of the Arcelor’s group’s plans in Poland? Secondly, does the Commission consider that it is still entirely capable of ensuring that the European Union can choose and maintain a steel industry, or is it simply waiting for the industry to disappear? In other words, is the Commission aware that it still has a responsibility under Article 3 of the ECSC Treaty, or has it forgotten that article? Thirdly, regarding regional restructuring and social support, is the Commission prepared, from now on, to use the resources of all of the European instruments as part of a programme negotiated with the responsible authority, that is, the Walloon regional authorities in Belgium, to ensure that any aid is focused on social support and restructuring, while ensuring that state aid is not paid to other regions? The fourth question is: what measures does the Commission intend to take in order to ensure that existing European social law is respected before any decision is made by any group? In particular this involves respecting a number of collective agreements. Along the same lines, is the Commission prepared, as far as company law is concerned, to invoke Article 5 of the ECSC Treaty, according to which the Commission has the task of ensuring that social activity continues as long as general production at European level is not threatened?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, today Europe must, through the Commission, show the rest of the world that it is firm on commercial matters and make the industrial choice to be socially pro-active and restructure industry in a useful way. Finally, the Commission needs to play its role as a public power, to make European employment law and company law a reality. I am looking forward to hearing the Commission’s response, and I hope that the speech that will follow those of MEPs will not be of a general nature like the Commissioner’s first speech. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Indeed, one can only note and condemn the increasing number of companies being restructured, along with restructuring programmes and redundancies with disastrous consequences, of course for employees, but also for entire regions that are devastated as a result. Many sectors are affected by this, particularly the steel industry.</p>
<p class="contents">People say that the context of a slowdown in growth is not favourable. It is true that the majority of companies wear out this argument that restructuring and closures of sites are necessary in order to deal with international competition. However, let us state the fact that company management take a fundamentally financial approach and not always an industrial one, far from it, when defining their strategy. Their aim is to achieve maximum profitability, without worrying about the social or environmental consequences. That often leads to relocations to third countries where rules on such matters are practically non-existent.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you referred to Metaleurop. It is true that even though that is about the metal industry and not specifically steel, it is a useful example: this very polluting company is going to shed thousands of jobs without taking any social or environmental responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I think, however, that the situation raises the broader question of what ambitions Europe intends to have in terms of drawing up a new Treaty? Is the European Union going to accept such behaviour from companies which, we should remember, have greatly benefited from European political aid. You of course referred to existing legislation that needs to be applied. Nevertheless, I think that new measures need to be taken to inform unions and works committees about the aid received. Measures also need to be adopted forcing those companies to account for how they have used loans granted and to reimburse them if they do not respect the commitments made.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to enlargement, which was referred to with regard to another company, Europe needs to equip itself with further resources in order to promote an ambitious industrial policy that will ensure that a strong steel sector is maintained and modernised, incorporating the necessary social and environmental standards within a framework of sustainable development. If that is not done, Commissioner, we will not move towards a Union of solidarity but towards a Union of terrible opposition between employees and between citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to social governance, we need to legislate even more. I think that new European legislative texts need to be more effective in forcing companies established in the Union to take on their responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and the Member States need to adopt a more pro-active strategy in response to industrial restructuring and its social impact. I think that this is also a question of ethics. In a Europe that seeks to defend the fundamental rights of its citizens, can we stand by and do nothing while thousands of employees are thrown out onto the street as if they were just goods? It is precisely the opposite approach that we need to promote in order to have a fresh impetus for industry in Europe. Employees should have new rights in companies at all levels. I am of course referring to the legislation on European committees. However, I think that establishing democracy within boards of directors would prevent many companies from being forced into being restructured and into liquidation by management that is mainly bowing to financial pressure and is far from responding to industrial demands. I therefore think that the Union should force the companies concerned to do more to take into account the alternative proposals from unions before making any decisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Flautre (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Commissioner, you said that the restructuring of companies in the steel sector, but also in the metal sector, went back a long way. It goes back 25 years. What I would like to highlight is the difference that there is now in the nature of those restructuring processes.</p>
<p class="contents">You are aware that, 20 years ago, entire regions were abandoned and employees stripped of their jobs in the name of modernisation and productivity. It was extremely painful, but there was the feeling of understanding that a change was taking place, which rightly or wrongly was seen as necessary, so people felt abandoned but understood more or less why it had happened.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, the problem that we have is that it no longer makes sense, in other words now in restructuring what we see at work is the rule that anything goes, and in particular the rule of the shareholders that is imposed suddenly, unfairly, arbitrarily and unexpectedly.</p>
<p class="contents">These stories no longer make sense, which makes them depressing. In other words, people are either revolted or completely depressed by them. They particularly despair of Europe, because all of the restructuring processes are taking place at European level. So you see a sort of ping pong match going on: closing something here, buying something else here, in Poland in the case of that company. So everyone feels like they are competing with everyone else, which is a point that I would like to stress. How do you expect citizens to give any credit to Europe or have the slightest desire for Europe if that Europe appears to them to be first and foremost a battlefield of competition, with shareholders that are at times corrupt making the rules? Should we talk about Glencor, the corrupt shareholder, as there are people in this House who do not like names to be mentioned? Can we leave industrial and economic development strategies and thousands of jobs in the hands of a corrupt shareholder who is capable of sinking the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, buying some profitable gems within Metaleurop, and leaving a region with unacceptable pollution? I think that we should also mention the terrible pollution of sites and serious threats to the health of employees, their children and their families.</p>
<p class="contents">Who is responsible? Who should pay? Are companies predators taking advantage as the shareholders dictate and then leaving all the damage in the hands of the public authorities? Or will Europe equip itself to regulate that and impose some restrictions? There are some very simple things that can be done. It is essential that we increase the power of employees on a European scale. Employees need to be able to discuss and take part in company strategies, coordinate and fight their battles together.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone here has condemned the Commission’s declaration as lacking in ambition. It is true that it is lacking in ambition, I am not going to say otherwise. However, ladies and gentlemen, we also need to realise that while the Commission can say no to a merger due to a monopoly situation and competition law not being complied with, it cannot say no to restructuring which is ignoring legislation on informing and consulting workers. I would ask that this be considered in the debate on the social Europe within the Convention. There was a recent newspaper headline: ‘the Convention is pushing aside the social Europe’. Let us think about that. Do we want citizens to have lost all hope in Europe? I want the Commission to be able to say no to restructuring that is violating European legislation. However it is not the Commission that did not want that, but our Member States, in the Council, who chose to retain the legal and administrative means to allow it or not. How do you expect that to work? I want the Commission to have the power to say no to restructuring that is violating employees’ rights, and failing to consider the environment and the reclassification of sites. And in my opinion, that comes under the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I invite you to put pressure on all those involved with the Convention in your groups, all those that you have contact with, to make progress on the social Europe. Otherwise that Europe will be depressing, and believe me, the people will not support it when they are consulted by referendum. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Grosch (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, the steel crisis and, in particular, the recent decisions made by Arcelor, are not a Belgian regional problem, but a European problem. You do not need to live next to a smelting works in order to feel the whole human impact of the decisions that have been taken, the way in which they were taken, and to be aware of their economic impact, which will reach far beyond the Liège region and even across borders.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not the only thing, however, that demonstrates that the type of problem being raised here is not only regional but also European. The problem is not only confined to the steel industry. It is part of a business mindset in which financial profitability takes precedence over proximity – which was a genuine attribute – and in particular over respecting commitments made towards the sustainable development of the regions of Europe. As a result, if we respond to this with relatively weak declarations, we are confirming our inability, on the one hand, to ensure that basic social law is respected and, on the other hand to control or even prevent the use of public funds to create cheap jobs to the detriment of quality jobs that therefore have to be more expensive.</p>
<p class="contents">The action that we can take today involves enforcing the right to control the use of public funds, far beyond promises and declarations. However, currently it appears that the resources that we have are, in my opinion, insufficient. This raises the question: what is our ambition for the Europe of tomorrow? As we approach enlargement, it is vital that we define the social rules that the market will never define for itself, if we wish to prevent unfair and suicidal competition between the regions of Europe. Let us not forget that the financial rules, which are currently helping to drain certain regions of Europe to the benefit of others, will in the future drain Europe to the benefit of other regions in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate is, therefore indeed about the social future, but also about the economic future of Europe. National governments and parliaments, but also the Commission, therefore urgently need to equip themselves with effective tools to manage both an economic Europe and a social Europe. Enforcing the right to legislate in order to better manage the future is not a question of ability but a question of political will. What we need to do first of all is to get past the fatalism of liberalisation and the selfishness of certain regions and countries, entrusting to Europe what will be best managed at that level, so that we can have a strong economy but also a quality of employment that is worthy of the social model that we are always talking about. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Keyser (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, from left to right in this House, there is a consensus, and this time it is not a weak consensus, but a genuinely strong signal sent out to the Commission. A resolution on the steel industry will be adopted soon. We entirely support it.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, allow me, aside from the resolution, as a socialist from Liège living next to the first site that was affected by Arcelor’s restructuring, to express my anger. We are all suffering now, as we have said, as the result of the lack of a regulatory framework allowing us to deal with the ultraliberal actions of the multinationals. I am aware that this phrase might make people laugh, but I stand by it. We can no longer tolerate decisions that are based on purely financial considerations and which can wipe a region from the world map in one fell swoop, without considering the families that live there, the workers that have built it and the children that will grow up there. Now it is Liège that is the target, next it will be Florence, Brême, EKO Stahl; now it is the steel industry, next it might be the hi-tech industry. There is no end to this arbitrary phenomenon.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you presented Arcelor as the good student of Europe. In my opinion, this international steel company is doing a dreadful thing, which is both heinous and ridiculous. Not content with abandoning its commitments to Cockerill – developing technological innovation, renewing tools, promoting employment – Arcelor is making threats. Its directors are announcing that rationalisation must continue, otherwise they could close earlier, or even straight away. And the lock-out of nineteenth century capitalism is suddenly re-emerging out of the mouths of its directors. Moreover, at the same time as announcing the death of the European hot-working sites, the Arcelor group is seeking to purchase Polish companies, but above all it is heavily investing in the Brazilian continental hot-working steel industry. That it what is heinous, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">What is ridiculous, is the image that Arcelor portrays on its web site, a company, and I will quote without laughing, ‘that is socially aware and which, conscious of its role in the Community, is supporting and sponsoring science, medicine, sport and the arts’. Unfortunately we are not talking about sponsorship, art or sport today, but the future of a region. And on this subject, Arcelor sees itself as being reassuring. It is promising a restructuring plan and early retirement. But who is it trying to fool? Because as well as the 1 700 workers that are directly affected, who are therefore benefiting from a restructuring programme, what will happen to the other 5 000 or 7 000 sub-contractors, suppliers, who will be out of a job?</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, finally give us the means to support coherent, integrated European policies, bearing the stamp of the economy, no doubt, but also socially convincing. I ask the Council and the Commission to finally prepare a regulatory framework that will enable us to prevent the all-powerful financial considerations from shattering the alliance between Europe and its citizens. Because that alliance is fragile and what is the point in Europe being an economic giant if, like the ogre in the fable, it is now eating up its children?</p>

In the ELDR Group, however, we have had an extensive discussion on the ability of this industry to compete and in particular on the level playing field within which this sector of industry is supposed to move. I was therefore a little disappointed with your input with regard to what the European Union could do. After all, we must realise that the level playing field has not always existed throughout Europe – far from it – and indeed still does not exist in some places. In particular, the World Trade Organisation and the OECD still offer great opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">For the people in the region, whether we are talking about this industry, which is in difficulties or another region, it will be of great importance that much is done in the field of innovation and research. We have funds in Europe that we can work with. It is not as if the Commission is incapable of doing anything at all. I would like to remind you that when the European Union realised that we had fallen behind in the area of the information society, your predecessor Mr Bangemann brought into being a platform that encouraged European Member States to catch up. In this area too – in view of our imminent enlargement to include Eastern Europe – we should not be saying that companies must not relocate; we should be saying that we must try to retain control of innovation, and that means that the research funds can certainly have a part to play and that the European Commission can also be a source of encouragement.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I would like to draw your attention to the European social funds. It seems to me to be logical that wherever there is a good social charter and where companies make efforts themselves, an additional input should come via the European Social Fund so that if redundancies are in fact unavoidable, people are offered prospects for the future via retraining and are not left out in the cold. The question that we will be faced with in the future is whether we can work together to give Europe a different aspect from that currently presented to the world by the USA. I am very much in favour of a liberal Europe, but it must be a social liberal Europe. I also find that your speech gives too little indication of the incentives there could be both at European and at national level . </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The group, which is the most powerful group in the world steel industry and is collapsing under its profits, coldly announces that it is going to close a total of six smelting works in Belgium, Germany and France, throwing out thousands of workers, condemning their families to poverty and devastating entire regions.</p>
<p class="contents">For such a decision to be taken in secret by a board of directors, obeying the demands of a handful of financiers, shows the extent to which the system that you defend amounts to a dictatorship by money. The fact that this can happen, without even inciting a reaction from the political authorities aside from a few hypocritical groans, shows the extent to which the workers are unable to count on the authorities to defend them.</p>
<p class="contents">We are told that periodical restructuring is inevitable in industry, but why is it always the workers that have to pay for that restructuring, and never the shareholders or the owners of the companies?</p>
<p class="contents">I know that the problem is not only with the steel industry. At the moment in France the airline Air Lib is also shutting up shop and making 3 200 people redundant. Air Lib is not a steel company, but behind it, two years ago, was the same financial group, Marine Wendel, which made a fortune through the sweat and pain of generations of workers, steel workers, if not their blood. It is the shareholders of the group and their ringleader, Baron Sellière of the employers’ federation in France, Medef, who, by withdrawing their capital, were responsible for the collapse of Air Lib.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I say to the workers, both in the steel and air transport industries, and those going through the mass redundancies all over Europe, that we need to fight to establish a balance of power enabling workers to impose a ban on mass redundancies, on pain of expropriation. We need to take from the company profits or if need be from the personal fortunes of their owners and shareholders, in order to provide salaries for all the workers affected by the restructuring. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I felt as though I were looking at the list of contents of a first aid kit, when the accident has happened and, of course, we believe it is inevitable. We should not, however, bury our heads in the sand, because here we are facing a perfect example of deregulated globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">When in March 2002 – almost exactly a year ago, so it will soon be the anniversary – the protectionist measure in the American steel industry was justified by the wish to protect their national steel against an alleged invasion of low-cost products, Europe decided, through Mr Lamy and the Commission, to retaliate. Commissioner Lamy therefore told us, before this House, that the European Union intended to defend its industries and jobs by taking all available measures. Mr Lamy also stipulated that these defence measures should take place within the strict framework of the Union’s international commitments, namely within the World Trade Organisation. In the same speech, Mr Lamy described our steel industry as restructured, productive, strong and competitive, adding that he admitted we had paid an extremely high social and financial price between 1980 and 1990, but that we could now be proud because the overall result was positive and, in particular, because we no longer needed to fear the future. Around the same time, he visited the Sidmar de Gand factory, a production unit belonging to the Arcelor group, the same company that is now throwing thousands of workers out into the streets and plunging a region into despair.</p>
<p class="contents">It was clearly out of the question for Europe to become a kind of Wild West, where everyone can do what they like, with the strongest inevitably triumphing over the weakest. The Commission recognised that the lack of legal rules left the field open for power struggles alone, and that is why we reacted by observing the rules and the law. We are now facing a disorganised world trade system, where Arcelor did not wait for market regulation because in fact that is what this is about. American protectionism has consequences for all of us, which led Arcelor to impose market regulation, in other words according to its own criteria, with a view to reassuring its shareholders, who were hungry for high profit margins.</p>
<p class="contents">At European Union level, we are therefore becoming a real Wild West in social terms. On a daily basis, multinationals – and I shall spare you the large companies that consider workers and small companies as nothing more than disposable tissues that can be thrown away once they have served their purpose – decide to implement job losses and close factories in order to open others elsewhere. They force national social systems to compete with each other and drive countries to restrict workers’ rights. Furthermore, these companies receive subsidies and sometimes even privileges. They do not respect their commitments, and find every possible loophole, even those that can still be found in the enlargement system. The legislative arsenal of the European Union on social issues is clearly insufficient and there are still European political leaders, in particular within the Convention, who say that the European Union must not intervene in social policy matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Arcelor today, Renault Vilvoorde yesterday, these are the examples that have led us to fight, here in this House, to say that Europe must be a social Europe or nothing at all. In any case, we certainly cannot continue to infringe workers’ rights as we are doing. It is essential to ensure that companies shoulder their social responsibilities on a purely voluntary basis. In order to do so, we need a number of commitments. Europe is adept at pointing out the rules of an ambitious industrial policy: what can we do to remain competitive in the traditional production sectors such as steel, telecommunications, gas and electricity? This Europe could then, with no problems, observe in silence the restructuring and closures, and we, within this House, the elected Members of Parliament, representing the workers and the people, would accept that with our arms folded, opening the first aid kit and wondering how to call the Red Cross!</p>
<p class="contents">What is happening in the steel sector could have been anticipated. The Commission seems to be realising it for the first time, and we could be surprised. What I would like to say, Mr President, in conclusion, is that if the European integration process was conceived with the ECSC, whose obligations have already been recalled, if we do not want to tell the citizens once again that this Europe is not for them and that it is a Europe of money, I think we should develop a specific intervention model adapted to the steel problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I have listened with great care and attention and interest to this crucial debate. One cannot but be moved by the strength and passion with which Members of Parliament have expressed their views on this unfortunate issue. A number of interesting ideas were developed throughout the debate and the Commission will study all of them with great care.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the points raised were dealt with in my introductory remarks and I will not go into detail on them now. Let me underline again the basic principle according to which decisions on corporate restructuring are a prerogative of management, but also its responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">A wide consensus seems to exist in Europe on the way to address crises resulting from the need for companies to adapt, from industrial change and from corporate restructuring. Let me reaffirm again the importance of effective, timely and comprehensive information and consultation of workers' representatives.</p>
<p class="contents">You have nevertheless expressed other types of concerns to which I would like to give you the Commission's preliminary view. Before I do that I would like to pick up one or two points that were made. There were references, for instance, to the European Coal and Steel Community, and I was asked whether Articles 3 and 5 have any application in these circumstances. It appears to be the case that Articles 3 and 5 no longer have application because the ECSC is no longer operational. Nor indeed are state aids possible. We all know that. There is no competence at EU level to deal with many of the issues that have been raised by honourable Members in this debate this afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only quote what Mrs Zrihen said in her contribution just a moment ago, when she said the legislative arsenal is insufficient. That is indeed the case. There is not a lot that can be done in many circumstances in relation to some of the issues that you have raised because of the very point that Mrs Zrihen has raised.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now deal with some of the issues you raised. Firstly, with regard to the trade dispute in the steel sector between the USA and the EU, the Commission is pursuing a very active line with regard to the unilateral measures taken by the US to protect its steel industry. Those defensive measures include, besides intensive bilateral contacts with a view to solving the conflict, retaliation measures and using the WTO disputes settlement mechanism. My colleague, Commissioner Lamy, is forcefully pursuing that particular issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue that was raised in the debate was the issue surrounding the issue of enlargement. For the steel industry, as well as for many other industries, enlargement is above all a window of opportunity for them to develop their businesses in the interests of themselves and in the interests of their workers. There are issues related to compliance with standards in the new Member States, notably in the social and environmental fields. Those issues are, however, being dealt with through technical assistance to help their industries to adapt, as well as through the assurance that those new members will have to comply with the relevant Community law from the date of accession.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of Members made reference to Social Funds and so on, and particularly to the free use of Community funds, notably the European Social Fund, to support the training and professional reconversion of workers affected by restructuring.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make a few points on that. After the expiry of the ECSC Treaty, the only possibility lies in the European Social Fund and in interventions from the Structural Funds. The main goal in the long term must be the reconversion of local industrial activities. This will have a much greater impact on the regions than direct social aid to the employees, although some transitional measures can be considered. We should recall that aid for the rescue and restructuring of companies in difficulty remains prohibited, in principle, for the iron and steel industry, as does any investment aid. The same rules apply to the countries applying for accession and with regard to new aid.</p>
<p class="contents">There were also references to making public aid dependent upon the maintenance of employment. Generally speaking, public aid to companies is already subject to those kinds of conditions. A number of the existing instruments specifically link the obtaining of state aid funds to the obligation to keep people employed during a minimum period. The guidelines on national regional aid make it clear that aid for job creation must be made conditional on maintenance of the employment created for a minimum period of five years. Similarly, the Commission regulation on state aid for employment contains provisions stipulating that such aid can only be granted if the employment is maintained for a minimum period of three years, or two years in the case of SMEs. Continuous employment should also be granted to workers in the case of aid for the recruitment of disadvantaged and disabled workers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Structural Funds regulations do not contain similar conditions, but it is clear that in so far as Structural Funds are used to cofinance state aid schemes, relevant obligations to keep people employed for a minimum period of time have to be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">Some reference was made to the alleged ambitions of one of the companies involved to make acquisitions in Poland. Possible acquisition by Arcelor of certain factories in Poland or other third countries would be the subject of a survey by the Commission, pursuant to Regulation 4064/89 on the control of concentrations between undertakings. The Commission underlines that it only permits concentrations which are compatible with the common market. In its evaluation the Commission comes to a conclusion only about the competitive aspects without intervening in the industrial policy of a private company. I should also say that the Commission has no information to the effect that any such plans for acquisition by that company have been successful.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, industrial change has economic implications and an impact on employment and social cohesion. However, it also provides opportunities when anticipated, prepared for and managed. Dialogue, transparency, proper worker involvement, anticipation, risk prevention and the development of employability are the key elements of our European response to this phenomenon. Let us do our best to build the instruments of a legislative or other nature which can promote these principles. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
