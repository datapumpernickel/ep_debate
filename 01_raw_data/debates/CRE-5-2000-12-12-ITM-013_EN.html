<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Morgan (PSE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, I am more than aware that this report will not rate amongst the greatest, most radical contributions to the European debate. The fact that there is such a "huge" turnout here tonight is a recognition of that fact by others. Nevertheless there are a number of factors and issues within this report. It should be seen as an opportunity for Parliament to reassess its work in relation not only to budget control but specifically to the discharge procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget that it was the reluctance of Parliament to give the green light to the way Euro-taxpayers' money was spent in 1996 that precipitated the fall of the Commission in 1999. What we are seeing as a result of the resignation of the Commission is a radical reform process. However, we must be careful within the European Parliament not to miss seeing the log in our own eye because we are concentrating so hard on the splinter in our neighbour's eye – the Commission. We have problems as well, perhaps not quite as big as the Commission's, but it is important that we recognise we also have problems.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the nuclear button in the shape of the discharge procedure cannot be pressed at the first sign of trouble. So the European Parliament needs to use this powerful weapon at its disposal in an extremely sensitive manner. The discharge procedure gives Parliament an opportunity to assess the financial management and financial resources of the European Union, to propose measures for its improvement and to express an overall political judgement on its quality.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the main focus of our work, within the Committee on Budgetary Control, will be on Commission management, and that ultimately we recognise that the Commission bears responsibility for implementing the budget. However, we must not forget that 85% of the money is spent and misspent within the Member States of the European Union. For far too long the Member States have hidden their guilt behind the complex mass of Commission officialdom who cannot answer back.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take one example: late payments. If EU money does not arrive on time, people lose their jobs. This has happened on several occasions in relation to the structural funds, for example. We have EU laws to protect business from such mismanagement and the Commission has now promised to introduce its own regulations to ensure prompt payments. But if the Commission coughs up money just to see it sitting in a Member State's coffers gaining interest, the problem persists as far as the end-user is concerned. So, where are the reforms from these guilty Member States?</p>
<p class="contents">Here we have a problem, because we as the Committee on Budgetary Control and as a parliament are only as good as the information we have to work with. We depend on the Court of Auditors to provide us with the ammunition to fire at the problem areas. However, the reluctance of the Court – and for that matter the Commission – to name the guilty countries impedes our work. We are trying to extinguish a fire and are suffocating in the smoke. We need to know the source of the flames. The Court of Auditors and the Commission can hide behind the complication of the statement of assurance, but we will not be steered off our course. We have heard that, because spot checks are involved, it would be unfair to name the Member States. My colleague, Mr van Hulten drew an interesting parallel with spot checks on athletes who have had their whole careers ended. If they are guilty, they are named and shamed. We should do the same within Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to be given the complete picture when the annual report of the year under consideration is published. That means we need to know which countries paid back what. We need to know what is happening in terms of recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">It is imperative also that we stick to the remit required of us and that we concentrate exclusively during the discharge process on the year in question. We have other mechanisms to highlight previously undetected instances of fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">Another key recommendation in this report is to try to expand the responsibility of the discharge beyond the exclusive domain of the Committee on Budgetary Control. Controlling the Commission's management and spending is the main justification for the existence of the European Parliament and the discharge procedure is the chief instrument by which this is done. We have tried to get other committees involved in the past but they have not responded, so we want to try to change the regulations within Parliament. We are trying to watch the Commission and the Member States and this report is an attempt at doing that.</p>

It is shameful that we have to debate this and other important matters at night. It is shameful. And no one can understand it, including myself. Mrs Theato has come to this night sitting despite being ill and I have left a dinner with the representatives of "<span class="italic">¡Basta Ya!</span>", winners of this year’s Sajarov Prize. This situation has to change.</p>
<p class="contents">Next I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report, which is so important and, contrary to what has been said, so necessary. Moreover, I think that her report is part of our new way of understanding what should be politically correct in the institutions, and that is transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">In this morning’s debate on the European Council in Nice we criticised the fact that the meetings were held at night and behind closed doors. It would be good to know what goes on there and perhaps, if the doors were open, the Member States would behave differently. That is precisely the major contribution made by the Morgan report. Its aim is that in this whole process there should be transparency, that we should not beat about the bush, that fingers should be pointed and that it should be made clear that the services are doing things badly. For example, I would like to criticise the fact that, when the report of the Court of Auditors was presented, the Council was absent, as if it is not interested in this Parliament. I also think that it is worthy of criticism that the Council is not present at the meetings of the Committee on Budgetary Control, which is precisely where the faults that arise in 80% of the budget, which the Council spends, are discussed. One day we will have to change this sort of absence of the ‘innocent hand’ of the Council, which is never guilty of anything. Mrs Schreyer, you have just mentioned the Council, saying that there was a Member State that opposed the creation of a European Prosecutor. It is time for the politically correct thing to be to say which Member State it is and to give its full name.</p>
<p class="contents">This also happens in many reports. This very morning, for example, in the debate that we had in the Committee on Budgetary Control, we saw how the representative of the Commission, when we asked him to indicate the Member States that do things badly, answered: “Look, the monitoring of what the Member States do is done through sampling, and there is no reason to penalise the Member States whose irregularities have been revealed through sampling.” Well I do not care. They should say that, according to the sample, such and such a Member State is not doing things right.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish by saying that it is important for there to be monitoring of the approval of the accounts, and for me this is the most important thing, that is, that there is reason for amendment not only by the Commission but also by the Council. It is also important to include observations in the reports on the Member States about how they comply with or fail to comply with the conclusions on the approval of the accounts. I would like the Member States, at least the Presidency and the representatives of the Member States being discussed, to be present for debates in Plenary, and also in committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The aim of the discharge procedure is to analyse processes and procedures in force and to detect any inadequacies in them so that the institutions can then proceed to reform them. To achieve this aim fully, I shall highlight four requirements that I consider essential in the work of the budgetary control authority.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, balance in considering all the budget headings: it is unacceptable that the analysis of own resources performed by the Court of Auditors should explicitly exclude all revenue from undeclared economic activities, in contrast to the zeal with which it treats many administrative elements, sometimes with no substantive content, of various forms of expenditure. Secondly, transparency with regard to cases and events: whenever the Court of Auditors refers to specific cases it should identify the institutions involved, thus taking responsibility for the claims that it makes. Thirdly, thoroughness of analysis: it is incomprehensible that a large number of high quality special reports by the Court of Auditors are omitted from the Annual Report in favour of other matters treated without any prior analysis and on the basis of debatable criteria of political timeliness. Fourthly, accuracy in the use of statistics: statistics can be a valuable tool for analysis but they can also be a dangerous tool for distorting reality. Using statistics to compare irregularities detected by different institutions as a result of strict or not so strict controls may be more liable to hide what is happening than to expose it. High rates of detected irregularities may just as well indicate the zeal of enforcement authorities as suggest corruption in the regulatory system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As has already been mentioned, the instrument of discharge is one of the most important weapons that Parliament has. It is therefore absolutely vital that we treat it with care. The Court of Auditors supplies reports and one of the most important recipients of these reports is Parliament. I therefore feel that Parliament would be well-advised to let the Court of Auditors know exactly what it expects from these reports. Also, a number of people have already said that we want concrete, succinct reports so that we know where we stand, and reports which are easy to read. We must name countries, specific cases and institutions; all these things would make it easier to understand. My group also thinks it is extremely important for there not just to be an SOA for the entire budget, but also one per sector. In the final analysis, we must be able to assess whether it is getting better or worse. I also think the idea mentioned in the report that members of the Court of Auditors should appear in the specialised committees of this Parliament, is an excellent one, because we cannot follow everything ourselves, instead, we must combine forces.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Parliament itself is concerned, the problem is the Treaty. The Treaty states that we can grant discharge but it does not say that we are entitled to refuse to grant discharge. I feel Parliament must sort this out. We must be able to do it ourselves, but I feel that refusal to grant discharge is an extremely important political matter. Indeed that is why it says in the report that if it should come to that, Parliament must immediately hold a debate on the political consequences thereof. Amendment No 8, tabled by the Liberal Group, states that it is important for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to further elaborate the recommendations of the Morgan report so that they can be used. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stauner (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, this excellently crafted report shows that the Committee on Budgetary Control can take a coherent and convincing position on such a controversial issue as the importance of budgetary control procedures and bodies. Budgetary control will always be a tough and thankless business, because it is not a question of handing out compliments but rather of pointing out weaknesses, mistakes and omissions and thereby improving the way the Commission handles the European taxpayers' money.</p>
<p class="contents">In colloquial terms, what this report is saying is that in future the Committee on Budgetary Control will be more watchful and will want to hear names named when it comes to the unknown whereabouts of European tax monies. Neither the Commission nor the Member States will be able to absolve themselves of responsibility, certainly not by passing the buck from one to the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Point 21 of the report contains a very courageous decision in announcing that the discharge will be postponed if the Commission withholds information. I hope this obligation will actually be applied if it comes to the crunch. Had Parliament taken this decision sooner, it could not have given the 1998 discharge. For in fact, the Commission is still withholding information and has still not answered questions, especially with regard to the Fléchard affair.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to highlight point 20 of the report. It is a clear declaration of belief in the rights of each and every Member to request and obtain information from the Commission, including confidential documents. This declaration of belief in the rights of individual Members is particularly important because these are precisely the rights the Commission is calling in question. It does make us rather apprehensive, Commissioner, to find that the Commission as Guardian of the Treaties has to be referred explicitly to the need to observe MEPs' rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been the product good cooperation at the committee level and I want to acknowledge that Mr Pomés Ruiz and Mrs Theato made their contribution too. This report will go some way towards clarifying the responsibilities that we have and helping the European Commission as well to understand what its role is and what is expected of it. I would also like to echo the words of Mr Mulder when he spoke of the importance of the procedure for granting discharge and stressed that it must be taken extremely seriously. The people who work on the Committee on Budgetary Control sometimes do not realise the importance of this instrument in guiding the work of the Community in so many fields of their responsibility. We must pursue this task with firmness but also with moderation and understanding and we must understand that over the years – perhaps because public spending at European level was such a small percentage of the entire public spending of the European Union, 1% as against 40% on average by the Member States – it was seen as a detail. I think it is true to say that it was very hard to get the Member States to understand that they had to apply the same concern and the same care to guarding the resources of the Union that they did to guarding their own resources.</p>
<p class="contents">I heard – and it is not an isolated incident – the United Kingdom Minister for Social Welfare say on television that if he could stop fraud he could save GBP 6 billion. He said that quite honestly and regretted that it was so. But if a European Commissioner said that we would expect them to resign the next morning. So let us understand that fraud is not a problem peculiar to the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sure that this House wishes her every success in that particular project, although I am slightly worried that the baby's first words might include the words "discharge" and "procedure". I would also like to commend to the House the way in which from its conception this report was drawn up using other reports already passed by our committee. Some here will know of my interest in the budget in general, and as budget rapporteur for the Budgetary Control Committee, I wrote a report in which a number of conclusions that are included here were conceived, mainly in paragraph 16 of this report. From that embryonic stage, they have now come through their period of gestation and are born within this report.</p>
<p class="contents">They concern a number of courses of action that the Budgetary Control Committee can take when it finds problems in different areas, including recommending to the Committee on Budgets to freeze or reduce the amount of appropriations intended for the headings concerned in the following year's budget; to authorise no transfers of appropriations to take place involving increasing the headings concerned for a certain period until further internal investigations are concluded; up to asking the President of the Commission to ask for the resignation of any individual Commissioners concerned with the serious problems found, a kind of EU Caesarean.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would commend the rapporteur's proposals about speeding up the contradictory procedure and the various statements on the special reports, although I do have to say to the rapporteur that I intend to disagree with the five-month timetable proposed in the report for dealing with these. Perhaps a nine-month timetable would be in order.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that the rapporteur would be pleased to hear that there are few differences between the main groups to breach in these circumstances. Forceps are not required to tweeze out any agreements, and we will be voting for her report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you can tell from looking at it, Mrs Morgan, this report has taken a great deal of work and discussion within and outside Parliament, within and outside the Commission, and within and outside the Court of Auditors. But after all that shows just how politically significant it is. I want to congratulate you very warmly on this successful and balanced result.</p>
<p class="contents">After the events of the past year, your aim is to create a budgetary control and discharge procedure which is more transparent and above all more efficient and effective. I may assure you that the Commission is constantly seeking to improve its own procedures. It will therefore also take this report as food for further thought.</p>
<p class="contents">You took a very useful and I believe also a very self-assured step in involving the Commission as also the Court of Auditors in your deliberations before drafting the report. Those institutions made a targeted effort to find ways of improving the discharge procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding access to documents for the discharge report, which is indeed an important issue, let me point out that the Commission's point of departure in its activities is the Interinstitutional Agreement reached in July this year, especially Annex 3 on access to confidential information. I can assure you that the Commission will honour this agreement in full. Let me point out to Mrs Stauner who just raised certain questions that under this agreement the committee chairperson puts questions regarding confidential information to the Commission or forwards them to it. Let me tell you that the committee chairperson has put no questions on this to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The report calls for detailed reviews of operational activities, thorough checks of budget headings and irregularities together with an assessment of the Commission's internal performance. We are convinced that with its administrative reform the Commission has made and is still making substantial progress here. And indeed Parliament also paid tribute to this reform programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Morgan's report devotes much space to the question of whether in future the Court of Auditors should appraise the activities of each directorate-general and each department individually. In this context let me remind you that Article 276 of the EC Treaty refers to the discharge of the budget in general and not to individual parts or areas of the budget. In the same context let me observe that of course the risk of errors in implementing the budget regardless of whether they are major or minor ­differs widely from one department to another because they have totally different operational budgets and face different risks. In the agricultural sector, for instance, Mr Fischler's total budget comes to approx. EUR 443 billion, while the budget of the Directorate-General for the budget is almost non-existent, so that, of course, there is hardly any risk at all there. During the general debate it will of course have to be decided whether there will be different levels of tolerance of errors, because naturally it is very much easier to implement the budget in, for example, the administrative sector, where salaries are paid. I would say the tolerance of errors should be more or less zero there, while in the area of external services, of foreign policy, quite different risks arise if, for instance, we provide humanitarian aid in a war zone. That too would have to be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">You can see from what I said that I think it would be useful to discuss these proposals further in order to find out how to assign responsibilities more clearly here. After all, that is also what you seek to do in relation to the Member States. Let me point out that I will take the opportunity to discuss these proposals at the next meeting with the Member States' representatives concerned with financial control. And I will happily report back on this discussion to the committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, congratulations on your report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
