The European Parliament too has expressed its concern on previous occasions. The tendency is to want to break people down and frighten them into silence. There are regular and constant violations of the conventions on freedom of expression, religion and association signed by Vietnam. The list of methods of oppression includes the draft law designed to abolish the right of small farmers to demonstrate peacefully in pursuit of their rights. It is particularly serious when the laws are exploited to oppress people. If Vietnam is to call itself a state governed by law, the laws must protect people’s right to express themselves and freely to practise their religion. Vietnam must also stop detaining and harassing dissidents and journalists, and its prisoners of conscience must be released. In this connection, I want especially to mention the UBCV. One of this organisation’s leaders, Quang Do, has also been nominated for the Nobel Prize in 2003.</p>

Protestants, Buddhists and the members of the Hoa Hoa and Cao Dai groups are being persecuted, threatened and arrested for practising their faith openly. Church dignitaries are being placed under house arrest for years at a time. Information is being deliberately suppressed on a massive scale. For over a year, there has been a directive expressly prohibiting citizens from receiving satellite television broadcasts, and the Ministry of Information is harassing the owners of Internet cafés to log the on-line activities of their customers. The number of journalists and dissidents being intimidated and arrested is steadily mounting. Vietnam has signed the 1996 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which was sponsored by the United Nations. Yet national decrees are being adopted to circumvent this voluntary commitment by the back door, enabling penalties to be imposed on anyone who allegedly poses a threat to national security.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats calls on the Vietnamese Government to fulfil its obligations under international law, and to tolerate and guarantee full freedom of belief and opinion at last. Persecution, harassment and imprisonment of believers and regime critics must stop, and the free flow of information must finally be guaranteed. When human rights are violated on a sustained basis, the sovereignty of the states simply remains on paper, further proof that such governments lack something that is essential to act on a truly sovereign basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless Parliament's demands are met in the near future, there is only one option: that will be for the European Union to suspend its financial support to Vietnam. I very much hope, Commissioner Wallström, that the Commission will endorse this position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that we now have a text that stands out for its rigour in condemning religious persecution and for its boldness in defending human rights in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I wish to offer a word of solidarity and of faith to the Buddhist leaders and those of other religious convictions who are fighting for their inalienable right to express themselves in complete freedom and independence from political power, and to the enormous number of victims of the repression and arbitrariness of the regime, including citizens who have expressed their political disagreement by peaceful means, sometimes only through email, as well as small farmers, indigenous Christian minorities and journalists.</p>
<p class="contents">Almost three decades have passed since the fall of Saigon and since the reasons which, according to some people, could justify limitations on human rights, freedom and democracy have no longer applied. This is not how things have worked out, however, with the totalitarian regime that installed itself having survived even the fall of the Berlin Wall. Democracy and human rights are on the agenda in every country in the world and must accordingly also be on the agenda in Indochina.</p>
<p class="contents">As suggested in the joint resolution that has been proposed, the recent meeting held between the Vietnamese prime minister and the leader of the unified church of Vietnam is a positive sign, must be put to good use and is a good reason for extending the cooperation agreement between the European Union and that country. We must be clear, however, on the need for the human and democratic rights laid down in Article 1 of the agreement, which form the basis of the agreement, to be respected. We will not accept a merely rhetorical interpretation of this article and we believe it represents real progress in these fields, without which the agreement cannot continue indefinitely.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, the Commission must draw up an action plan and a precise and realistic timetable for the Vietnamese authorities to undertake urgent and fundamental reforms, release political prisoners, authorise freedom of worship and rescind recent initiatives that introduce further restrictions to freedom of information, such as access to satellite television.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore hope that the Vietnamese authorities heed the call represented by this resolution and quickly provide signs that they are willing to remedy the current situation. Unless they do, we in the European Parliament will be forced to draw the necessary conclusions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After all, that is where the call for independence is louder. The Vietnamese Government itself is to blame for this last-ditch, political cry for help on the part of the original inhabitants of the Central Highlands, namely ethnic minorities. It is responsible for discrimination against indigenous peoples by the ethnic Vietnamese, the so-called Kinh. It is also responsible for land robbery by the Kinh at the expense of the ethnic minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Central Highlands, the Vietnamese Government is also adopting a repressive policy against officially unrecognised Protestant churches. This mainly concerns indigenous peoples of the Bana, the Ede and the Zarai. The security services are extremely active in those areas. Soldiers are also billeted with the villagers. I would therefore question what remains of personal freedom and of any religious freedom in the private sphere. Not for nothing have the Vietnamese authorities stationed senior party members from Hanoi, outsiders in other words, in the three Central Highlands provinces. I am certain that the European Union can do something about this oppressive, explosive situation.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the Union should couple stringent, political conditions to the large sums of money it injects into Vietnamese government projects. In the final analysis, Hanoi has committed itself by international treaty to enforcement of the basic freedoms of expression, association and religion. In addition, following the example of the Dutch Government, for example, the European Commission should, via co-financing organisations, support projects which truly benefit the oppressed ethnic minorities in the Central Highlands. This is at present a major failing in European aid to Vietnam.</p>
<p class="contents">The Vietnamese Government refuses to put indigenous peoples from the Dac Lac, Gia Lai and Kon Tum provinces on an equal footing with the Kinh. It does not take them seriously, in other words. It is up to the European institutions to set an example which is worth imitating.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Council and Commission, in order to have any impact, the European Union should, however, insist upon the Vietnamese authorities’ opening up the Central Highlands to foreign observers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Of course, progress has been made towards political, economic and democratic openness, including the trade agreement with the United States, the release of prisoners, the announcement of free elections and the Internet. However, this facade of renewal conceals the tragic reality. The 20 000 prisoners released were common criminals, while the political prisoners are still being detained. The Internet, as other Members have reiterated, is actually used for control purposes and satellite broadcasting is banned. Freedom of religion, confirmed formally for both Buddhists and Montagnard Christians, is actually far from being implemented: religious leaders have been imprisoned, there are house arrests and the faithful are under strong pressure to forsake their religion. People are not just being oppressed for their religious belief, however: the rule of law is being violated in the name of national security, a concept we are very familiar with by now.</p>
<p class="contents">With our joint resolution, we call upon the European Union to continue its work and to pressurise the Vietnamese Government to pursue dialogue with the religious groups, to put an end to all oppression, to release prisoners and to allow the practical development of political and humanitarian organisations and NGOs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Vietnam has already made significant advances along this path which deserve to be recognised.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, there are still some very worrying developments. The ASEAN delegation attended the AIPO General Assembly in Hanoi last year and was prepared to visit the Vietnamese authorities and parliamentary colleagues for talks. However, when we were denied access to religious leaders, we felt we had no option but to cut short the visit. That is precisely the point that we want to highlight. There are worrying restrictions on human rights, especially religious freedom. The issue of religious freedom has nothing to do with how Vietnam conducts matters of state. It is wrong to seek to define the exercise of religious freedom as a threat to national security.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not interfering in Vietnam's internal affairs. Vietnam can decide for itself which path it wants to take. That is not our responsibility. However, there are fundamental and universal rights which are binding for all of us, and they include the right to practise a religion. There are eminent representatives of Vietnam who, for example, have been here in Europe, in the European Union, and now occupy key positions in the Vietnamese parliament. They know exactly what our positions are. They know that we have no desire to interfere in Vietnam's domestic decisions, and they know that we are prepared to provide help. However, we must insist that political and religious prisoners are released. That is what this House demands.</p>

There has been some progress, but quite frankly that progress is not enough. We are talking about fundamental and universal human rights.

What do we have to fear from people who have different ideas or different beliefs from us?</p>
<p class="contents">We must call upon the Vietnamese Government to do what is absolutely right, which is to respect universal human rights and release prisoners of conscience, to stop detentions and to allow journalists to go about their business, which is to report and criticise.</p>

Mr Mann, Mr Casaca and others have spoken about it at length. The situation is extremely difficult: human rights are not respected and neither are religious rights. There remains much to be done along the road to reform in Vietnam. Nevertheless, for once there are two extremely positive facts which I welcome. First of all I should like to congratulate those Members, and in particular Mr Nassauer, Chairman of the Delegation for relations with the Member States of ASEAN, south-east Asia and the Republic of Korea, as well as Mr Corbett and all the other Members, including Mrs McKenna, who have played a part in the drafting of this text, because it is an extremely good text, a text which does not moralise, but which highlights a certain number of violations of fundamental rights, a series of very specific cases: the case of the Venerable Thich Huyen Quang, Patriarch of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, of Thich Quang Do, the second in command of that church, of Father Li, of Mr Nguyen Dan Que, of Colonel Pham Que Duong and other very specific cases of dissidents who are victims because of their ideas and their convictions. Many thanks to all those Members.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks are also due for that small gesture, that light which was lit a few weeks ago in Vietnam, when the Prime Minister, Mr Phan Van Khai, met with the Patriarch of the Unified Buddhist Church, Thich Huyen Quang. This was a first. There had not been a meeting of this type since 1981. The Prime Minister addressed the Patriarch, not as ‘Comrade’, but as ‘Venerable’. Their meeting was broadcast on Vietnamese television. It was a first, and it was also an extremely positive sign.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to thank somebody who is not with us today, and that is Commissioner Patten, because it was his determined action, and that of the Commission delegate in Hanoi and of a certain number of European embassies, and also the United States Embassy, which made it possible for this small gesture, which is a step in the right direction, to take place. I believe that this is an extremely important element. However, we must obviously remain extremely vigilant, and hence the importance of this resolution. In particular we must verify whether the second in command of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, Thich Quang Do, is released on 1 June, as he should be under the terms of his sentence. Every day we need to verify whether specific reforms are being implemented in Vietnam. Nevertheless, this small light has been lit. It is an invitation to a dialogue, and I believe that we should respond to this invitation to a dialogue which has been extended by the Vietnamese authorities, by making another gesture of dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like to thank all those who, day after day, provide us with information, the Vietnamese committees on human rights, and in particular Quê Me, the committee which, for thirty years, has been fighting, day after day, to provide us with information. I should like to thank its President, Mr Vo Von Ai, and its Vice-President, Mrs Penelope Faulkner. It is thanks to them that we have been, and still are, able to draw up such precise and demanding texts, and that we are able to continue our dialogue with our Vietnamese friends. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, the Commission's overall policy towards Vietnam is to encourage and support continued progress on human rights and democratisation and to raise concerns where abuses occur or where a deterioration in the situation becomes evident.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission works closely with EU Member States in monitoring human rights developments in the country and participates in all démarches to the Government of Vietnam on human rights issues. I can assure honourable Members that the Commission and EU Member States have repeatedly urged the government of Vietnam to strengthen its respect for political and religious freedoms and to further strengthen economic and social freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 1 of the European Community and Vietnam Cooperation Agreement of 1995 states that respect for human rights and democratic principles is the basis of our cooperation. This reference has given the Commission increased possibilities to discuss human rights issues with Vietnam, for example in joint committee meetings held under the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">With the aim of encouraging and supporting the continued commitment of the government of Vietnam to human rights issues, the Commission is currently considering proposing a further reinforcement of the relations in this field. This could be done through the establishment of a mechanism for a structured human rights dialogue, taking account of the experience gained with dialogues that the EU has already established with other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me recall that the Constitution of Vietnam guarantees freedom of belief and religion and that the Vietnamese Government officially recognises six religions. The Constitution also specifies that it is forbidden to violate freedom of belief or religion or to take advantage of it, or to act against the laws or policies of the state. This provision is attributed to the desire of the Vietnamese authorities to control the pace of change and to maintain cohesion in their society during the process of transition to a market economy. However, it may also be used against non-approved religious groups which, according to the Vietnamese authorities, engage in political activities or are potential elements of disunity.</p>
<p class="contents">Reports of harassment of Christians in Vietnam, especially the Montagnards and Hmong Christians, have increased since the violent uprising in the Central Highlands in 2001, in which some religious groups were reportedly implicated. A number of so far unconfirmed reports since then have alleged repeated actions by local official forces aimed at forcing highlanders to renounce their faith.</p>
<p class="contents">Commission President Prodi and Commissioner Patten discussed the situation in the Central Highlands with Vietnam's Prime Minister, Phan Van Khai, during his visit to the Commission last September. They agreed that the Commission would explore, under its financial cooperation programme, specific activities involving, inter alia, ethnic minorities to reduce poverty in the Central Highlands and thus to deal with some of the root causes of problems in the area. A preparatory mission of experts is currently in the field.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Dupuis has already mentioned, recent, promising, positive signals have been sent out by the Vietnamese Government regarding the still unrecognised Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam. There has been a meeting between Prime Minister Phan Van Khai and the Supreme Patriarch, the Venerable Thich Huyen Quang. A meeting between the Patriarch and the Venerable Thich Quang Do, another prominent leader of the Unified Buddhist Church, has also been authorised. Although no change with regard to the church's legal status has so far taken place, we believe that these events, as mentioned, are encouraging steps towards enhanced tolerance of religious freedom in Vietnam.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by emphasising that I am convinced that what is needed in Vietnam is continued and more rapid progress in the country's reform programme so that the administration would learn to deal with a wider range of use and appreciate the value of accommodating dissent in the system of government.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank all honourable Members of the European Parliament for their very valuable and good speeches.</p>
