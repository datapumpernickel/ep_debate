<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – I would like to begin by extending my gratitude to the European Parliament for bringing up the important theme of AIDS in developing countries and by discussing the conclusions of the International Conference on AIDS in Africa which has just taken place in Lusaka, Zambia.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is very concerned about the devastating effects of AIDS in the developing world and the apparent inability to stem the epidemic drastically and provide appropriate care for all those affected and infected. The statistics and analysis show convincingly that developing countries and the global community cannot ignore the AIDS epidemic. In developing countries, where 90% of all HIV infections occur, AIDS is reversing hard-won gains in improving the quality of life. In many hard-hit countries AIDS has already reduced life expectancy by more than ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">AIDS is also rooted in and exacerbating poverty and inequality. Its effects are especially devastating for the poor, who have the fewest resources with which to cope.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to highlight some of the efforts made by the Commission and in particular some of the new initiatives envisaged. The Commission has been confronting AIDS since 1987 with widely-debated AIDS policies, strategies, actions, finances and, last but not least, through global and country partnerships. By the end of 1997 the EC had committed a total of EUR 200 million to HIV/AIDS projects in most developing countries. We are eager to do more both by providing more money, and by working with the countries, our Member States and international partners to devise effective strategies that curtail the spread of HIV, cushion its impact on the health sector and provide care for those already afflicted with AIDS.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we cannot confront AIDS without first acknowledging that it threatens every country and that each country has a core responsibility and potential to protect its populations through political leadership, sufficient resources and effective and equitable strategies. Country after country has ignored the AIDS epidemic, denying that the behaviour that spreads HIV occurs within its borders; and country after country has been proved tragically wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">It is particularly important that the authorities of these countries should be clear in their calls for prevention of the spread of the epidemic. Hiding the facts will do no good. The populations must be clearly informed of the danger they are in and about the possible prevention measures. Here I am thinking especially about the younger generation.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest post-Cairo-plus-five international conference on population and development debated the subject of sexual habits and rights, particularly of the young. It is necessary to focus more on this vulnerable part of the population if prevention measures are to have an improved effect. But political leadership and recognition of the problem of AIDS is only the first step. Our joint response to the epidemic must also be sufficiently wide and fair. Poor people and poor countries face many pressing problems besides AIDS, and government and international resources are scarce and even declining.</p>
<p class="contents">In a typical developing country it costs as much to treat one AIDS patient for a year as it does to educate ten primary school students for a year. Balancing these worthwhile objectives is difficult but essential. Therefore all partners should play an appropriate role and do so in genuine partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">This has been the spirit of the EU’s response in the past and will also be at its core in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Countries are looking for incentives as part of the solution for people to lower their risk and vulnerability even in the most difficult situations. Countries have to decide about sustainable and fair financing. In addition the international community, including the EU, can assist, for example by lowering the cost of condoms and providing clean needles and essential drugs. This should include those drugs that can have sizeable effects on reducing HIV transmission from mothers to children and those that provide primary health care especially for the poorest, most affected and most vulnerable.</p>
<p class="contents">Having mentioned condoms, it must be said that this is one of the best and safest ways of preventing the spread of the epidemic. Some people express moral reservations about using and promoting this type of prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to underline that, given the size of the public health problem we are facing, the interests of the population at risk must be given priority over dogmatic positions of principle. It is most encouraging that an increasing number of developing countries have already given priority to the interests of their population, but there is still a long way to go.</p>
<p class="contents">AIDS must be even more at the core of our development and poverty reduction efforts. We know that higher inequality is associated with higher HIV infection. This is especially so in the case of inequality between men and women. AIDS spreads more widely where women depend on men’s earnings, are unable to read and have limited legal rights to divorce, inheritance and child custody.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU, jointly with its international and national partners, has been generous and timely in its response to the AIDS pan-demic in several developing countries. Our support has not, however, always gone to the most effective interventions, and has not yet reached the level needed to have the impact required. We will therefore continue to work with developing countries to ensure that the available knowledge, and our funds, produce better results in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">However, only a joint action can reach the level required and we will therefore step up still further our efforts to coordinate with all those involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission welcomes the SADC Heads of States’ Declaration on HIV/AIDS, which was signed in Lusaka. We ourselves look forward to finalising, as soon as possible, the signing of an extra financial package for the regional AIDS Action Plan in the SADC region (EUR 5m) as well as an additional all-ACP regional initiative on AIDS for another EUR 20m. These additional resources may appear meagre in view of the problem; however, it should only be seen as an extra effort, providing a further catalyst to EU and global commitments to confront this devastating epidemic.</p>
<p class="contents">We must all work together in this effort. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maij-Weggen (PPE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, when the first grave reports about AIDS first inundated Europe and the United States at the beginning of the eighties, some very grave predictions were made as to the extent and the social implications of this disease. Now, twenty years on, AIDS is reasonably under control in Europe and the United States, although the situation still gives a great deal of cause for concern in certain areas and amongst certain groups. In Africa, however, all our worst fears as regards the disease have been realised and exceeded.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the situation varies from country to country, there are, in fact, a number of countries in which 20-30% of the active population is infected. These are mainly young adults, therefore people who are active in economic terms but who also often have family responsibilities; a generation of people who in most countries form the backbone of society. When such a group contains so many people suffering long-term illness and who are seriously weakened, and there is such a high number of deaths, then these countries suffer disastrous consequences. At the grass roots level of the family, we see the large scale on which families are without breadwinners and children without people to bring them up, whilst at local and regional level the social, health and educational problems are really getting out of hand.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, the problems experienced by the older generations, who often have to be cared for by these groups, are on the increase. We can see how, at the national level, the economy and foundations of society are weakening. That is what we have seen happening in Africa over the last twenty years. As a result, everything that has been built up in terms of aid and progress these last 25 years is at risk of being demolished. The question is, how can we help the African countries to ward off this fate? I believe it is Europe’s duty to share our knowledge and experience of this disease and to give financial aid to those African countries that want to participate in the process themselves, with a view to supporting them in their fight against AIDS and the consequences of AIDS.</p>
<p class="contents">African countries really got to grips with the situation at the eleventh conference in Lusaka. I want to express how much respect I have for the experts and relief workers, including those from the African regions, who made their contribution with such frankness and expertise. What needs to be done now in order to tackle the disease in Africa? What can we do to help? My group considers the following points to be essential. In each African country, an assessment must be made of the scale of this disease and of the proportions it threatens to assume. All efforts must be directed at achieving maximum openness and preventive measures. As far as openness is concerned, a lot still has to be asked of African leaders in terms of breaking through traditional African taboos, particularly with regard to speaking out about the dangers of unprotected sex. This is not just about traditional African taboos. There are certain churches, European ones too, that, to my mind, with all due respect for their teachings, ought to warn against unprotected sex, and that includes advocating the use of condoms. Prevention will only be possible if there is honesty and openness. Prevention is vitally important and must be encouraged in all sections of the African population, and particularly amongst young people.</p>
<p class="contents">People must grasp the idea that having unprotected sex puts your life at risk, all the more so in present-day Africa. This is not about preaching at people but it is about becoming fully aware of the dangers.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, when it comes to prevention, it is also important, of course, to avoid a situation in which pregnant women with AIDS pass this disease on to their unborn children. There are drugs for this and they must be made available. Lastly, Madam President, there is the help we need to give the children who have been left orphaned. They must be helped to go about their lives, to pursue an education and to make a fresh start. We believe these to be the most important points that need to be addressed. That is why it is so difficult to comprehend why the European Commission has reduced the original budget for the AIDS assistance programmes, specifically with regard to third countries. I was pleased to hear the Commissioner say that additional resources are to be made available again. That is a good thing. But I hope that this will also be taken account of in the Budget as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Do more and do it better. That was the theme of the Lusaka conference. We call upon the Commission to boost its programmes for Africa with this theme in mind. The disease is being tackled successfully in Europe and the United States. Let us help Africa to avert the disaster that threatens it. My group wants us to become involved here, even if there are budgetary consequences. The Africans are our neighbours and we must not abandon them.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

AIDS is threatening to become a health catastrophe on an unimaginable scale, particularly in the countries of Africa south of the Sahara. Children are affected above all. According to an estimate by UNAIDS and the World Health Organisation, 7 out of every 10 people newly infected with the HIV virus live in this region. In the case of children under 15 years of age, the figure is as many as 9 out of 10. Approximately 83% of deaths from AIDS take place here, and at least 95% of all children orphaned by AIDS are African boys and girls in this region. Of the 34 million people infected since the epidemic appeared in this part of Africa, 11.5 million have already died, a quarter of them children. </p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, reference has been made to the fact that all the successes there have been in terms of increasing life expectancy have been reduced to nothing. In many countries, life expectancy has even fallen again to the level recorded in the 1960s. To put it another way: a child who is born today in an African country badly affected by AIDS has an average life expectancy of only 43 years. Without AIDS, it could have been 60 years. </p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Eastern and Southern Africa is particularly dramatic. In Botswana, Namibia, Swaziland and Zimbabwe, a fifth of the adult population is infected or ill with AIDS. This dreadful situation could continue indefinitely. However, AIDS is no inevitable fate. A number of countries such as Senegal, Tanzania and Uganda committed themselves early on to prevention, and with success. It is high time that, where the politics of health are concerned, the emergency brake was put on throughout Sub-Saharan Africa and also in other affected parts of the world. Social, political and religious taboos have no place here. They must be cleared away; how and by whom is immaterial. </p>
<p class="contents">Trivialising AIDS and making it taboo are a direct route to catastrophe. The partnership, AIDS against AIDS in Africa, founded at the Lusaka Conference, deserves firm support from the European Union, both in material terms and in terms of visionary perspective. Civilian society, including the private sector, together with representatives of governments, international aid organisations and non-governmental organisations of various kinds have come together in order to declare war on the epidemic. They have undertaken to launch comprehensive AIDS or, rather, anti-AIDS programmes in all African States. One of the ambitious goals of these programmes is to achieve a 25% reduction in the number of young people between the ages of 15 and 24 newly infected by AIDS, and this by the year 2005 in the most badly affected countries and by the year 2010 in all countries. These efforts can and must be supplemented by the European Union and, above all, vigorously supported through cooperation with the ACP countries. </p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the European Union has not been inactive to date. Between 1987 and 1997, almost 200 million ecus or euros were spent on HIV/AIDS programmes in more than 90 developing countries. This fact should be expressly recognised. To this will be added, over the next three years, a further EUR 45 million in the context of a special budget strand for developing countries in regions around the world, together with EUR 20 million for a regional 5-year programme for the ACP countries and additional funds in the context of specific programmes such as those for the ACP countries. These figures do not include, for example, research programmes or co-financing by non-governmental organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">More than in Europe, it is young girls who are especially at risk in Africa. Nowhere are there more teenage mothers and nowhere do they give birth to a larger number of infected babies. </p>
<p class="contents">The main effort must therefore be to educate young people. This is a task which must be carried out in schools. The education campaigns and condom advertising in Tanzania and Uganda have shown that success is possible. Above all, the radio must be employed as a means of information to reach everybody. Here too, specific measures of support are absolutely necessary. Joint efforts in a spirit of partnership are the right path to go down. But if these are to be effective, more rather than less resources are needed and, in this regard, I am anxious about the Commission’s, as well as this Chamber’s, financial policy. Mrs Maij-Weggen, I hope that your group will help ensure that the decisions of the Committee on Budgets that I have heard about will be revoked or altered in the plenary sitting, while any watering down of the proposals tabled by the Committee on Development will be reversed. We must together ensure that whatever it is that we want can also be financed.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As far as policy in Africa is concerned, the figures speak for themselves. AIDS threatens the long-term development of at least ten African countries. The epidemic there causes more deaths than do armed conflicts on that continent. Two million people have died of AIDS-related diseases, which is ten times the amount of people that have died due to armed conflicts. In the year 2001 there will be more than 13 million orphans in Africa on account of AIDS.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, there is no, or at least not enough, money to pay for drugs in Africa. Of course it is not just an African problem, as the Commission rightly commented. The disease knows no boundaries. That is why it is our duty to do something about it, and I fully endorse what Mrs Maij-Weggen had to say in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, there are two issues I would briefly like to go into. Firstly there is the problem relating to compulsory licensing, which I believe will also come up for discussion at the WTO meeting soon to take place in Seattle. Compulsory licensing must not be allowed to lead to people in Africa no longer being able to afford anti-AIDS drugs. This really is a big problem over there. AIDS drugs can be produced more cheaply than is the case at present. That is an issue that needs to be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">My second question relates to the financial aid delivered by the European Union. I hear reports to the effect that not all this aid gets to where it is supposed to be going and that one of the reasons for this is that this aid, or at least a part of it, is distributed via national governments. If that is the case, then it would be worth looking into whether something can be done about this.</p>
<p class="contents">On a final note, I want to add my voice to the appeal made by the Commission. I have in mind its appeal to religious authorities to play an active part in preventive programmes, particularly where the distribution of condoms is concerned</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet, since 1996, the situation has further deteriorated – 89% of the people afflicted with AIDS are resident in the 10% of the poorest countries on Earth. This is clear evidence of the failure of a policy dedicated purely to limiting the illness without looking into the economic and social reasons for the spread of the disease.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, the economy of African countries is crumbling due to the structural adjustments made necessary by the World Bank and the IMF. States are making swingeing cuts in their social budgets, resulting in an inability to provide patients with minimum care. The European Union must assist these countries in providing this minimum care, and more, if possible. Indeed, we were stupefied to learn that, against the advice of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, the AIDS budget was to be halved, which would be a scandal, given the urgency of the situation, and contradictory to the comments made by Mr Nielson.</p>
<p class="contents">In the majority of African countries, there is no access to screening and, even if it were accessible, surely it is understandable that no one wishes to find out their status when discovering that you are HIV positive means that all you can do is wait to die. The fact is, treatment is practically non-existent in most of these countries. Confronted with this situation, the Lusaka conference maintained an often inappropriate line, promoting abstinence, moral order and traditional medicine. AIDS cannot be fought by ignoring the provision of medical treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, the States most affected by the disease ought to be able to benefit from compulsory licences permitting them to produce, at reduced cost, the generic anti-HIV treatments effective in preventing the development of the opportunistic infections which lead unavoidably to death. Today, this right is not applied due to pressure from holders of patents, from States or multinationals. Within the scope of the precautionary principle in health matters, the European Union must therefore defend the application of the entitlement to compulsory licences in the Millennium Round</p>
<p class="contents">Millions of people dead, millions of orphaned children, we cannot stand by and do nothing. This is why, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I ask you to support our proposals, so that we can give developing countries some real means of combating this scourge which is AIDS. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

HIV has become the principal cause of death in Africa. In some countries, it affects a quarter of the population. We may speak of a risk of humanitarian catastrophe.</p>
<p class="contents">In requesting, therefore, a debate in the European Parliament, I was hoping that we would show that Europe had heard this alarm cry. Since then, I have met some of the main NGOs involved in the fight against AIDS in the field. Arising from these discussions, there are three essential proposals which I would like to mention now.</p>
<p class="contents">The first, naturally, is to do with the budgetary resources which Europe assigns to the fight against AIDS in developing countries. I am not the first to remind you that the draft budget for the year 2000 anticipates a spectacular fall in the level of our aid, a two thirds reduction of the commitment appropriations from EUR 16.5 to 5.5 million, at the very time when, quite the opposite, it is the strengthening of international mobilisation which is needed. Consequently, we Members of Parliament shall soon have to face up to our responsibilities in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The second area where we can and must improve our intervention involves, in my opinion, the selection of our priorities in the field. The Commission favours prevention, which is indispensable, but it underestimates the possible inconsistency of access to treatment. For, indeed, how can people be persuaded to go in for screening if they know full well that they will not receive any treatment? It is a situation which promotes fatalism. We should therefore, in my opinion, see prevention, access to treatment and research as indivisible components.</p>
<p class="contents">In the third place, there is the necessary question of the cost of medicines and how to enable the countries of the South to have access to these. Commissioner Nielson mentioned this problem and, for my part, I would put forward two proposals. Firstly, the European Union can and should enter into negotiations with laboratories in order to obtain different prices for North and South. Secondly, Europe could in fact play a decisive role at the negotiations in Seattle on world trade. In fact, agreements on intellectual property signed within the framework of the WTO allow for States to authorise the local production and distribution at reduced cost of medicines, which are otherwise protected by patent, in “emergency situations”. So far this exists only in principle, but surely this is such a case. This is the matter of the compulsory licences which have been mentioned. In actual fact, implementing this clause exposes the countries concerned to the threat of sanctions by the most powerful groups and States. This must cease. Then, the European Union could take pride at Seattle by firmly defending the principle of a sort of exception for health, in other words, by demanding that the major imperatives of public health are not threatened by international trade agreements. The European Union could, furthermore, assist the countries of the South in preparing their legislation in this spirit in order to counter ultra-liberal pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, by adopting these proposals, Europe can affirm its own identity on the international stage while contributing towards giving new hope to millions of human beings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Though the number of people suffering from HIV has stabilised in recent years in Europe, the problem of AIDS is still a very real one particularly in the more deprived and disadvantaged urban areas and of course, within the African continent.</p>
<p class="contents">A recent study carried out by an organisation in my constituency called Cáirde points to the fact that 80% of people who contract HIV in Ireland are in receipt of welfare payments. Social exclusion and inadequate income, and living in a disadvantaged or deprived area, are all factors explaining why HIV as a disease mainly affects the more deprived communities in urban Ireland. There is no room for complacency when it comes to the issue of combating HIV and AIDS. Again according to the report of Cáirde, in Ireland almost 3 000 people are HIV positive, and a further 3 000 people are affected when one considers the family members and children of those who are HIV-positive. Medical treatments are certainly improving; however, they are not inexpensive and one year’s treatment for HIV illnesses costs an average of between IEP 12 000 – 14 000. Public information campaigns must be supported both within Ireland and the European Union, because prevention is the best cure in such matters. While medical treatments are improving, and while standards of care, standards of treatment and the cost of such care are paramount in our concerns, if one can prevent transmission of such diseases, then we may go a long way to reducing the number of those affected.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the European Commission, the European Parliament and the national member governments should redouble their efforts to publicise the public health information campaign; this should be done either via the respective Departments of Health or through voluntary groups who play such an important role in helping those who are affected by such diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">As a member of the Development and Cooperation Committee of the European Parliament, I recognise that AIDS is rampant, particularly on the continent of Africa. Health and education programmes must be targeted at the African continent where the AIDS plague is out of control. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank the Commissioner for his statement.</p>
<p class="contents">We are going to have to give particular attention in our debate on this subject to the solutions being proposed by the African scientists themselves. As affluent western countries, we must not start talking in a high-handed manner about what we consider to be the best approach. For it is heart-rending to think that, of all peoples, it is the impoverished African people who are having to endure this affliction.</p>
<p class="contents">On the occasion of the Lusaka conference some comments worth listening to were made on the question of how to tackle the spread of AIDS effectively. A case in point was the courageous contribution made by Professor Nkando Luo, the Zambian Minister for Public Health, who called for high moral standards to be maintained and for responsible sexual behaviour. In saying this, she reached the heart of the matter. Other speakers in Lusaka also suggested that this is not being made a subject for discussion in all candour, although everyone is aware that the spreading of the HIV virus is due, above all, to promiscuous behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that this should never give rise to the stigmatisation of those who are infected with the AIDS virus. Compassion and mercy are the key words when it comes to our behaviour towards these sick fellow human beings. Cheap drugs and the means to relieve their suffering ought therefore to be available. Where this is not the case, as affluent countries it is only right that we should make a contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">But what I have just said relates to curative care. Preventive measures are even more necessary. If we are to tackle a problem effectively, then we must always begin at its root. If we drop the moral standard advocating that sexual intercourse be embedded in a relationship based on mutual trust, in which the man and woman know each other inside out, then it is to be feared that this will bring about disintegration and breakdown in society. When people lead promiscuous lives we are not talking about relationships in which respect for the other person as a human being sets the tone. This means that we are destroying that which is loveliest. The comment made by the South African Zindaka Sibeko during the ICASA conference was telling. He said: “I believe that the longing for marriage raises a painful dilemma these days, for we have been completely robbed of the happiness, the joy that accompanies a wedding.”</p>
<p class="contents">Africa holds up a mirror to Europe in this respect: the selfish lifestyle, in which purely individual sexual pleasure without respect for the other person or responsibility to society is considered the norm, has a very high price. Too high. Perhaps there is a need for a European version of the Lusaka conference at which we as Europeans would reflect on our principal responsibilities, for the draft resolutions submitted to date do not contain so much as a hint of how badly this is needed.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is obviously a pandemic that is the primary cause of death for a citizen in an African country. This is far-reaching and of unprecedented seriousness owing to the way this illness is affecting, in particular, a continent which the European Union has special relations and links with. But in recent years, I think these have slackened and have completely missed the mark. I am referring, obviously, to the Lomé Convention, to this partnership pact that is a bit exclusive, a bit special, and that we have always described as the European Union’s response to the former colonies, as well as to other areas, but which mainly addresses the African continent. And the response, as Mr Wurtz and other speakers stated, was a bureaucratic response to initially reduce the expenditure linked to the budget as regards investment in the AIDS sector. Clearly, the response should be political, which it was not. We are undoubtedly dealing with this illness a bit differently, according to whether it is in this part or in the other part of the hemisphere. </p>
<p class="contents">Next week, when we meet our African partners in the ACP Parliamentary Assembly – European Union meeting, we must bear in mind that, while Lusaka was a failure, in part this is definitely down to the fact that we did not pay enough attention to this matter, along with other matters. We should therefore organise a large conference on AIDS, but not leave it only to those countries that must then deal with such terrible consequences in practice, but a conference that we have wanted for years, since 1993, on pandemics and AIDS. With us there to oversee things, we could meet this situation head on and finally agree on measures that are appropriate for an international authority, given that in this regard the WHO is completely incapable of offering specific responses. </p>
<p class="contents">I think this would be a wise and sensible measure, a measure which, up till now, we certainly have not taken. I hope that this will head our agenda next week in the context of the ACP and that it will become, Commissioner, a proposal that the Commission and the European Union will themselves make, so that we can finally approach this matter in a serious way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed the health implications are serious. In less than two decades, a very short time in the world of infectious diseases, AIDS has become the leading cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa. But the implications of this epidemic go far beyond the health sector. The loss of young men and women in the prime of their lives is devastating as regards economic development and productivity, education, agriculture and a whole host of socio-economic spheres. Hard-won gains in terms of development are being eroded and even reversed as a consequence of this epidemic. Reference has already been made in this debate to the demographic consequences. Countries where the population grew by 3% or more just a few years ago will experience negative growth. If a comparison is allowed, I believe that what several countries in sub-Saharan Africa are going through is something similar to the Black Death in 14th century Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Nielson referred to the response so far. There have been efforts at international level, I agree, but far too limited. I welcome Mr Nielson’s suggestions for the budget to be topped up, but more has to come. What is needed in the first instance is more money and support in terms of financial resources. Here the international community can do a lot. Then we have to bring about – and this is primarily the responsibility of the countries concerned – more openness. The whole area of HIV prevention has been surrounded by too much silence. There has even been a stigma attached to it. In such an environment prevention through education is difficult. In such an environment people are discouraged from seeking testing and counselling.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us hope that the recent conference in Lusaka represents a turning point. What is needed in the future is more funding, more concerted effort and more openness.</p>
<p class="contents">I have personally followed very closely efforts within the international community over the last couple of years to bring about a more concerted fight against HIV/AIDS. A joint programme, UNAIDS, was established a few years ago. It has done some good things, but efforts within that programme have been undermined by shrinking budgets within the UN system.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my absolute conviction that the European Union has to take a much stronger lead in international efforts in terms of AIDS and HIV prevention. Our aid budget is considerable. We ought to allocate a gradually bigger share of that budget in support of HIV prevention. If we are serious about development we have to do this. Otherwise all our other efforts in the area of development will be very much in vain.</p>
<p class="contents">I have four specific questions to ask the new Commissioner. Firstly, are you willing to work hard to ensure that a permanent increase in the Union budget will be allocated for HIV prevention? Secondly, are you willing to make sure that whatever the European Union does in this field is well coordinated with other donors? In few areas, I believe, are coordination and cooperation more necessary than here. Thirdly, are you willing to make sure that efforts go beyond the health sector, realising that the socio-economic and developmental consequences are so serious? Last but not least, are you willing to seek partnership with the pharmaceutical companies, on the one hand, to speed up work to try to develop a vaccine and, secondly, to make medicines more accessible to the poor of this world? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In 1998, Commissioner, 530 000 children were infected with the AIDS virus in Sub-Saharan Africa. The startling contrast is that 1 000 children in total were infected by the virus in the whole of Western Europe and North America during that year.</p>
<p class="contents">So we have to ask the question: why does such a discrepancy exist Why are there such stark contrasts in terms of the sheer scale of the poverty of people’s lives in Africa and, of course the resulting lack of proper health services, education, and AIDS treatments. Of course, as others have said, the neglect of Africa has very severe economic consequences. These include the suffering and death of productive members of their societies and, very importantly, the diversion of women away from employment towards the role as carers, and the diversion of resources in families and communities from savings to care, and indeed, as I am sure you are aware, to the endless funerals that you can witness in countries like Zimbabwe if you stand on a street corner.</p>
<p class="contents">The time has come to invest in programmes that target more effectively the health needs of the people in Africa. It is, of course, ironic, as we mentioned in the Development Committee yesterday, that the Budget Committee voted last week to cut the budget line on reproductive health care and HIV/AIDS work by half from EUR 25 million to 12 million, and that we are now discussing the need for investment in this area. In rich countries, anti-retroviral therapies are extending the lives of significant numbers of people in wealthy nations. But I have to say that these solutions will never be affordable or accessible to the tens of millions of the world’s poorest people.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that the European Commission is placing increasing emphasis on giving resources to support the development of an AIDS vaccine. Only last week, as I am sure you are aware, the British development minister announced a very large investment in research for that vaccine. Early clinical trials will begin in January 2000 in the United Kingdom, and afterwards in Nairobi. In countries like Zimbabwe where 20% of the population are positive, vaccines, in my view, are the only hope.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, in the short term, women are the key to progress. Adolescent girls in Sub-Saharan Africa are 6 times more likely to be infected than boys of their age. In a recent study in Kenya 25% of girls between 15 and 19 were HIV positive and 4% of boys. Women are literally silenced by ignorance, fear and stigma. Gugu Dlamini announced in a rally in Johannesburg last December that she was HIV positive. A week later, she was beaten to death by neighbours who said that she had brought shame to their community. That kind of situation, President, shames us all.</p>

The recent conference in Lusaka showed this quite clearly. Every year, two million people die of AIDS and another four million are infected. In total there are today in Africa 25 million people who have contracted AIDS and who are virtually programmed to die. In one tenth of the countries of Africa, life expectancy will not reach 60 or 70 by 2010, as might be expected, and will drop to 40, a rate similar to that we experienced in Europe in the Middle Ages.</p>
<p class="contents">This endemic is not just a catastrophe in humanitarian and health terms, it is also a threat to social and economic cohesion and to the demographic balance of the countries of Africa. In Kenya, therefore, 43 of the 50 employees of the tax department who died last year died as a result of AIDS. According to the Farmers’ Union in Zimbabwe, the virus is responsible for a drop in production of 60% for corn and 30% for animal husbandry. In Zambia, if projected figures are substantiated, in 2010 there will be a million fewer children than there are today.</p>
<p class="contents">In this situation, how can we accept reducing by one third, in the year 2000, the appropriations allocated to the fight against AIDS in developing countries? How, Commissioner, can we accept that the pharmaceutical companies have a virtual monopoly on manufacturing and distribution? We must re-negotiate the agreements signed on intellectual property. Solutions do exist. The pharmaceutical industry must no longer be content just to calculate its profit margin in relation to its profitability on western markets alone, and must urgently provide poor countries with triple-combination therapy – at cost price too. Right now, it is essential for the countries of the South to have the possibility of producing and obtaining for themselves the necessary medicines.</p>
<p class="contents">In a few weeks’ time, in Seattle, the forthcoming WTO negotiations may constitute a significant stage. We must do all we can to ensure that free and anonymous screening centres are set in place. This is an effective means of curbing the disease throughout the world. We must also intensify the use of condoms because, in countries such as Senegal, it is known that condom use has played an important role in the decline of the illness. But how many of us would agree to give half our daily wage for one condom? Because, for a farm worker in the Sahel, a condom costs 150 CFA francs, that is 1.50 Francs, half of his daily wage?</p>
<p class="contents">I invite you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, and you too, Commissioner, to together call upon the United Nations, the United States, and the European Union to create a world fund for medical solidarity. What could be more urgent than to save 25 million people from programmed death? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are looking at Africa but we must also look around us, to our own local societies. Northern Ireland is on the periphery of this Union and it is a peripheral part of the Union and yet we are seeing the start of a terrible spread in our country, greatly linked to drugs trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">Whether this Parliament likes it or not, when laws are violated there is always a sad reaping to the violation of law. The Bible says that if you sow to the flesh, of the flesh you will reap corruption; and that is a fact that has to be faced. Nevertheless, there must be infinite compassion for those who have been stricken. I am glad that my own church has a programme to that effect and is working hard on it. There must be compassion. We must sit where these people sit, we must recognise the circumstances that they are in, and we must do everything in our power to seek to help them in their dire plight.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a tragedy that this Parliament is meeting today in the shadow of the fact that our Committee on Budgets is cutting down on aid. We should be doing our best to get more finances to deal with this problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I only want to highlight three aspects. The first one – and I say this as a medical historian – concerns the fact that, in a continent that has been destroyed by colonisation, which is the case with Africa, it is not an accident that the AIDS epidemic has occurred, but rather it is a consequence of the impoverishment of that continent, and therefore we are responsible, as the former colonial power, for helping Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is that, given the prevalence of AIDS in Africa and knowing that thousands of young people cross the Mediterranean into Europe, via Spain and other countries, and also bearing in mind the incubation period of the disease, which is from five or six to twelve years, we can calculate that a third of these young people are infected with AIDS and are living in Europe. This issue, therefore, affects us directly.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly and finally, I would like to point out that the most suitable instrument we have – this has been demonstrated by the UN by means of the WHO in the fight against smallpox – is the WHO. It is incredible that we have abandoned such an important international instrument as the World Health Organisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was very happy to note that there is full agreement to what has been said by the different groups in Parliament. I also think that the nature of this problem demands a response which cuts across what otherwise often divides us in politics. I should like to give an assurance that the Commission wishes to increase its efforts in this area, not least in accordance with what has been the unifying theme and approach in the various interventions. </p>
<p class="contents">I have a number of more specific comments to make. Mrs Maij-Weggen stressed that this is a very serious issue for the younger generation. I, too, was making the same point, and others have also emphasised it. If we are to contribute some hope to Africa, it is here that something is to be done. The figures which a number of people have quoted, tell their own story. I think that the situation is very serious and I agree that this is something other and more than a health problem, as has been pointed out in the course of the debate. Mrs Maij-Weggen said that what we are seeing is a breakdown of the societies concerned and that the progress which has been achieved is being undermined. I think these figures are hugely important. Producing better statistics and providing better information to the rest of the world about just how bad the situation in fact is, could be factors in increasing understanding among our populations of the necessity of increasing our efforts on behalf of Africa, and also generally, because this particular problem is bound up with the general situation in Africa. </p>
<p class="contents">Statistics are also crucial for supporting those who wish to counter the taboo surrounding the problem. In Zimbabwe, it is very useful to obtain clear public statistics, not only about how bad things are there and how many people have been affected, but also about the results it has been possible to achieve over a number of years in neighbouring Tanzania and Uganda, and in Senegal. The more openly the authorities approach the problem, the more effective the results they can achieve. </p>
<p class="contents">I have also noted in the debate about condom use that there is very broad agreement as to the crucial importance of making condoms available at low cost and of providing the population with accurate and straightforward information, as has been the case in Tanzania, Uganda and Senegal.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I should like to talk about an experience I had in the Binga district in Zimbabwe. There, 25% of women giving birth for the first time are HIV-positive, and more than 30% of women giving birth in maternity wards at the local hospital are also HIV-positive. This is a dreadful situation. We visited a number of nuns involved in an AIDS project. I asked them if the question of condoms was discussed in their educational work. They answered that they could only accept and recommend the use of condoms where prostitutes or similar groups were concerned. Otherwise, they preferred that people should be protected through the use of moral strength. This was a hard line to take, I think. When we know what is effective, we also have a duty to share this knowledge with people who can use it; in fact, to force it upon them, I would almost say.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the moral aspect of the matter and the question of where our duty lies can also move the discussion on. Also, this discussion may be seen in the light of the concept of conditionality which we do not refrain from utilising in these very poor countries, which need our partnership and our support. It might also be said that when, in relation to formulating conditionalities, we talk about structural adjustments and macro-economic support for these countries, it might be worth discussing certain conditionalities in regard to the countries’ ability to ensure survival of their own population. We ought, of course, to avoid too rigid an approach to this problem, but there is, in any case, a moral aspect to it which means that it would be wrong of us to accept the fact that people close their eyes to what is going on in certain countries. Survival is also a human right. And when we talk about the broad modern concept of human rights, it is, therefore, the new-born child in Zimbabwe, infected with HIV, who is our partner in securing these and not those groups of people who deliberately close their eyes and do not share with the population their knowledge of how HIV can be treated and, especially, prevented.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget problem has been referred to by almost everyone in the debate. I should like to say that what we have here is a variant of a very general problem: that of how far it may be deduced from the budget’s various, and more or less specific, headings what the Commission, as a whole, is doing in a given area. In fact, it cannot be deduced. We are in the middle of an operation involving many more budgetary headings than the one discussed. It is an operation aimed at simplifying and clarifying the budget. That is what characterises the discussion. What we are doing about HIV and AIDS cannot be deduced merely by looking at the particular heading in the budget which has been discussed. That having been said, I would be the first to admit that it cannot properly be discovered from our own budget either (or, sadly, from our reporting) what, when it comes down to it, we are actually doing in this area. This is a significant weakness in the organisation of the whole reporting process and of efforts to make information available. It is a reminder to us that there is a lot of work ahead. The aim is that we should be able to report precisely, to our own public also, on what it really is we are getting for our money. </p>
<p class="contents">My answer, then, is that it is not very significant if there is this particular heading in the budget. As I said in the introduction, there are now EUR 25 million on the way as an extra input into this area, and this sum has been taken from a variety of resources. This demonstrates that it is not only this one particular budget heading which shows how much we are doing. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Wijkman mentioned relations with other organisations, and the WHO was mentioned by another speaker. We shall be doing more to open up the EU with a view to better cooperation and coordination with other players, including players in addition to our fifteen Member States. This is an important part of improving the quality of what we offer, especially from the recipients’ point of view. I can therefore answer positively that this is something of what we want to aim for. </p>
<p class="contents">Those are my comments. Thank you again for this debate. Finally, I would point out that, in a week’s time when we have the debate in the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in Nassau, I should very much like – if it is possible against the background of the questions I shall be answering – for us to discuss some of these themes there too and pass on some of the same messages which have characterised the present debate. </p>
