<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I am pleased to be here to discuss the Commission's proposal for a directive establishing quality and safety requirements for human tissues and cells, submitted to the Council and the European Parliament in June last year.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me first express my gratitude to the rapporteur, Mr Liese, and to the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for all their hard work on this important and ambitious directive: important, as it covers a very promising field of medicine; and ambitious, since it forms a crucial element in our overall health strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">May I also pay tribute to the successful and valuable work of the Council of Europe in the area of tissues and cells. Our proposal for a directive builds on these achievements. This proposal ensures that the increasing number of patients who are treated with human tissues and cells can trust that these substances are safe. It is a logical follow-up to the directive on the quality and safety of blood.</p>
<p class="contents">Human tissues and cells have become an important part of health care. Their therapeutic use continues to increase not only in the number of applications, but in the extent to which they can be utilised. With advances in technology, this is an area that is developing rapidly. However, the fact that the use of these tissues and cells can result in the transmission of diseases has focused attention on the need for increased safety measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal sets out requirements for the donation, procurement, and testing of all donations of tissues and cells intended to be applied to the human body. Quality and safety standards are introduced, whether the tissues and cells are used as source material for transplantation, or for the preparation of medicinal products and medical devices.</p>
<p class="contents">When specifically used for transplantation into the human body, the directive introduces requirements for all human cells and tissues at the additional stages of processing, preservation, storage and distribution.</p>
<p class="contents">Now let me turn to some of your key concerns. One of them is how best to deal with embryonic stem cells. This question has already been addressed in the framework of research. In the decision on the Sixth Framework Programme for Research, Parliament, Council, and Commission have agreed that Member States are free to regulate or ban the use of such cells, and that such decisions are respected at Community level. Specific decisions to this effect are expected by the end of this year, and this will be the appropriate context to address this issue. It does not, therefore, seem appropriate to use this public health directive to prejudge and pre-empt this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Further concerns have been expressed on organs. They are excluded from this proposal. This has been criticised by some of you, yet I remain convinced that it is not appropriate to include organs in the scope of this directive. The problems to solve in the area of organ transplants are quite different. We should not forget that the severe shortages, which result in many patients dying, remain a key problem. However, their transplantation requires a different policy approach due to their specific nature. As organ transplantation is a highly specialised subject in its own right, the Commission is currently conducting a scientific evaluation of the available options. At this moment we have not yet completed our assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the example of the blood directive and this proposal on tissues and cells, we would like to get the science right first, before tabling a legal instrument in this sensitive area. Let me assure you that it is a matter to which I attach the utmost importance and am following closely.</p>
<p class="contents">Further issues of concern are imports and exports. It must be acknowledged that the import of tissues and cells from third countries is on the increase. In order to protect the health of patients in the European Union, we need to ensure that high standards of quality and safety are also applied to these imports.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal provides for a mechanism to establish an EU procedure that will allow a coherent approach to the authorisation of imports and exports. It is equally important to ensure that no 'sub-standard' tissues and cells are exported to third countries. A certain flexibility to comply with third country legislation might be acceptable, but only if at least the same level of safety is ensured.</p>
<p class="contents">The ethical issues relating to the use of tissues and cells are indeed sensitive. But it is because of their very sensitivity that we must rigorously respect the limits of the Treaty. However well intentioned our motives, we must act within the Community’s proper competences. Here, I would like to underline a key point. Article 152 aims to regulate public health issues. It does not foresee an in-depth regulation of ethical issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that a well-balanced compromise has been presented in its proposal, which goes to the very limit of what is legally acceptable given the restrictions of the Treaty. The relevant Council of Europe documents and the European Group on Ethics have stressed the principle of not-for-profit procurement. We therefore consider it necessary that the directive does not contradict this principle.</p>
<p class="contents">This not-for-profit principle is relevant only for the act of procurement, not for further processing, manipulation, testing, or the manufacturing of products. For example, it is unacceptable to take a heart valve from a deceased donor and sell it. However, heart valves are usually treated to ensure the absence of infectious agents and to preserve them so that they can be stored for a longer period. These and other processes that serve to improve the quality of the heart valve can of course be carried out on a commercial basis.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's proposal provides, therefore, the opportunity for private companies to be accredited as a tissue bank, just like public organisations. And apart from procurement, it does not restrict services or further processing to be carried out on the tissues by a private company.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, another major ethical issue is the question of donor consent. The International Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine requires that the consent of donors must be ensured and that they receive appropriate information. While this proposal fully respects these established principles, it does not set specific ethical rules. It is for the Member States to set detailed ethical rules, in line with the requirements of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to addressing the Commission's position on the amendments proposed in the report at the conclusion of this debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liese (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking everyone involved in the intensive debates which contributed to the production of this report. They include our fellow Members in this House – in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, but also in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, with its rapporteur, Mr Bartolozzi – and everyone who helped us, here in Parliament and in the Commission, to pull in one direction. We can look back on an intensive process of debate, culminating in a public hearing on 29 January, which involved more than three hundred experts from the EU and the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy supports the Commission's proposal, but also shares the view of many experts, such as the Standing Committee of European Doctors, that the proposal merely points in the right direction. In other words, the Commission's proposal is good, but it does not go far enough. We have therefore introduced a number of detailed changes. This applies, for example, to the issue of voluntary unpaid donations. We want the Member States not only to encourage this principle – as the Commission proposes – but also to safeguard it. Compensation for donors should, however, be expressly permitted. Trade in unmodified cells and tissue should be prohibited, as required by the Charter of Fundamental Rights. However, we want to make it clear that the work with cells and tissue is a task which must involve both the public sector and industry – as the Commissioner has already explained. We believe that our phrasing is rather more precise and clear.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot keep industry out of this sector, for if industry upholds the standards, its involvement will promote innovation. We want to make the wording on informed consent more precise, for only then will it offer the protection that is very important, and protecting people who cannot legally give consent themselves is an issue which is very close to our hearts.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the sensitive areas of research with, and cloning of, human embryos, these are also the subject of proposals by members of the committee. I have not addressed this issue in my draft report, but I think that what the committee finally adopted is a good European compromise. For example, the phrasing in Amendment No 30 is exactly the same as that already agreed by the Commission, the Council and Parliament in the Sixth Research Framework Programme. The committee has not adopted any more far-reaching amendments. After all, the question of what happens to the numerous embryos is still unresolved in the context of the Sixth Research Framework Programme, and requires further debate.</p>
<p class="contents">As many of you know, I personally take a very rigorous position on this issue. I believe that embryonic stem cell research is the wrong route to take, but nonetheless, I think we cannot go further than envisaged by the committee, and that we must leave scope for the Member States to decide whether they want to ban or permit embryonic stem cell research on principle or not.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 19 on the Directive's scope of application prompted a great deal of debate. The issue is whether the Directive should cover, not only clinical trials, but also in vitro research. The committee is in favour of the Directive covering in vitro research as well, but only as regards the donation and procurement of cells and tissue. The reason for this initiative by the committee is that we believe that the protection of donors must be viewed independently of the question whether the tissue is to be used for transplants or for research purposes. The donor must be protected in every case, and his or her rights must be respected. How can we justify it to the public if we say that the donor has the right to informed consent, and trade in his/her cells and tissue is not permitted if it is intended for transplants, but all these rights can be disregarded if the purpose is research? We really cannot present that kind of proposal to the public. Amendment No 19 is therefore a good compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">There are individual speakers who say that Article 152 is not an adequate legal basis for the committee's more far-reaching proposals. I have spoken to many legal experts and my view on this issue is that the legal basis is entirely viable for the more far-reaching proposals that we have put forward, because everything we have proposed concerns not purely ethical issues but ethical issues relating to the health of donors and recipients. In contrast to the issue of anonymity or reconstruction of the cadaver – issues that the Commission has indeed addressed in its proposal – the relevance to public health can be presented in much clearer terms on the issues that we have addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore request the Commission to reconsider its restrained position on this issue. We should send out a clear signal to the other institutions and adopt the committee's report.</p>

The sector is also certain to expand, not only in the traditional field of transplants – for example, corneal and skin grafts and heart valves – but also, as a result of advances in biotechnology, in those of reconstructive surgery, reproductive medicine and the treatment of disorders such as cancer, diabetes and Parkinson’s disease. It is therefore undoubtedly of interest to research centres and European firms and must be allowed to develop.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, respect for ethical imperatives is vital in the use of tissues and cells of human origin. The proposal for a directive in question therefore lays down high safety and quality standards relating to substances of human origin, in order to protect health. However, these ethical imperatives need to be still better defined. The first issue concerns the need to ensure complete safety from the point of view of health, in order to prevent or reduce the risk of disease transmission in the case of human tissues and cells from third countries too. Secondly, respect for the human body must be assured with regard to removal from both living and deceased donors. In this connection, the requirement for informed consent on the part of the donor, supplied in a specific form either by the donor or by next of kin is particularly important, as is the prohibition of the removal of cells or tissues from foetuses originating from the voluntary interruption of pregnancy or from cloned human cells. The third issue concerns respect for privacy and protection of the confidentiality of the information collected when tissues are removed. Donation must be anonymous as regards both the donor and the recipient (except for the requirements regarding traceability). Personal and family data may not be disclosed to third parties (for example, employers or insurance companies); this is also to avoid the risk of unjustified discrimination. The fourth principle concerns the fact that donation is unpaid. This represents a voluntary act of human solidarity which may, however, be appropriately encouraged by specific measures and by proper information on the part of the Member States. This requirement must be retained, not least with regard to imports from third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of these considerations, I believe that, over all, the directive can be said to represent a step forwards in the harmonisation of Member States’ legislation, allowing Member States to provide greater protection for the health of the European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an important measure to regulate the quality, safety and procedures for cells and tissues used for transplants. The key is the protection of human health.</p>
<p class="contents">I echo the Commissioner's words in congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Liese, who has ably steered a path, strengthening the protection of human health, ensuring informed consent and avoiding most of the pitfalls of previous debates in this area of human endeavour. When I see amendments put down and signed in the names of both Mr Liese and Mr Nisticò, I know that this is a measure where there has been enormous effort to bring about a meeting of minds and views. That will stand this measure in good stead.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal was a good one but perhaps could be improved. The report to Parliament introduces improvements in some areas but perhaps left some issues needing clarification. Some of the changes may be unhelpful. The new amendments, such as the one excluding industry to which the Commissioner referred when he talked about industry's fears that trading activities might be affected or constrained, are also to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">I acknowledge that there is an issue over the Amendment 7, which included research in the scope of the directive. One could express mild surprise that it was deemed to be in order. It certainly exercised health charities and researchers. We need to consider whether it has a place in this measure or not. On the other hand there are issues that need to be clarified in the way that this measure does. We should not include organs in this measure on cells and tissues. Organs are for another day. Equally, this is not the time to permit cloned human embryos or hybrid human animal embryos to have their cells and tissues used for transplants.</p>
<p class="contents">The demise of Matilda, the Australian sheep which disintegrated, serves as an awful warning that this is a very young area of science and experiment and, leaving aside the ethical issues, one that should not be permitted now, simply on the grounds of the potential severe and uncertain impact on human health.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue is the question of remunerated donation. It is a problem that arose in Mr Nisticò's report on blood. It was recognised then that we have different traditions and needs. Voluntary donation is preferable but not always possible. We will have to look again at this to see if we can find a form of words that will cover our many traditions and needs. I suspect that we will end up not a million miles from the excellent formula that Mr Nisticò incorporated in his blood and blood products directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The proposal is indeed needed to set EU-wide minimum standards on the use of human tissues and cells. There is a growing and cross-border trade in human tissues and cells across Europe for research in laboratories and clinics and for the production of medical and pharmaceutical products. We now need to bring forward a European-wide framework in which to control this. It is currently controlled only by a patchwork of national laws.</p>
<p class="contents">But with this increasing trade we need basic standards to guarantee human health, and safety standards on the issues of donation, procurement, compensation and consent. We need to establish a clear European-wide framework in which the industry can operate and in which people can be confident and public safety ensured. We can guard against profit-driven markets that might exploit the vulnerable individual and the possible transmission of disease or infection.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to operate on a not-for-profit principle and apply that to all donations in all Member States across the whole of the European Union. There is a danger that some people, driven by financial necessity, might perhaps be persuaded to donate cells, either here within the European Union or perhaps in the developing world, for financial gain. We must find a way to stop that. We must get the balance right. We want to rule out the sale of human tissues for cash, but leave the door open for limited financial compensation for the donor. It is quite clear to me that if you need two weeks off work for a bone marrow transplant it is not unreasonable for some form of payment to be made to your employer.</p>
<p class="contents">These new rules will set the necessary minimum safety criteria for the use of tissues and cells across Europe. Minimum standards on donation and compensation based on a not-for-profit system are essential.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also have clear rules on the issue of stem cell research, including embryonic stem cells but excluding cloning for human reproduction. If we can establish these minimum standards of donor consent, we will protect the vulnerable individuals who could be persuaded into donating cells under pressure. However, I cannot entirely support all the amendments tabled by some of my colleagues. Those amendments seeking, for example, to ban or restrict the use of embryonic stem cells totally are doing the European public no favours. They are not protecting human health, nor are they protecting the vulnerable.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish that MEPs and pressure groups that argue the need so strongly to defend ethical principles were equally vocal in their defence of the sick and the vulnerable, like my young constituent Zain Hashmi, who this week was able with his parents to get permission to utilise these new technologies to protect his life and safeguard his future. Without these kinds of new technologies, the future for young men like that is extremely bleak.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely hope that we can take this proposal forward with sensible steps, bearing in mind the key issues of protecting human health and safety and protecting the public and vulnerable individuals from exploitation. I commend the report to the House, but not all of the amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This compromise was difficult to achieve, between the advocates of subsidiarity, the supporters of ethics at any price and all those, including myself, who want to respond to the expectations and hopes placed in us by millions of patients in Europe, without, however, hindering the development of the European biotechnology sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, thanks to the grafting of corneas, heart valves, bones, tendons and skin, the lives of patients are actually prolonged and improved. Just to give one example, repairing the damage caused by major burns involves nearly twenty thousand European citizens every year, while 60 000 diabetics had to have amputations in 2002 because of the lack of any effective procedure for reconstructing skin. We must be clear about this: all these people awaiting treatment will either not be treated or will be badly treated if tomorrow the European Parliament adopts a moralistic stance and prohibits, directly or indirectly, research into stem cells, embryos and germ gene therapy. That is the reason why the majority of the Liberal group is firmly opposed to a good thirty of the amendments, in particular Amendments Nos 30, 31, 36, 37, 46 and 50, but I do not propose to list all of them here.</p>
<p class="contents">One fundamental reminder is necessary: we are concerned here with a public-health issue, based on Article 152 of the Treaty. It is therefore a matter of quality criteria, approval standards, qualifications, staff training, traceability tests, and the setting up of a European network bringing together the registers of national tissue banks. This is what lies at the heart of the proposal, and I have heard very little about it, since ethical issues have overtaken it. Nevertheless, at the committee stage we did reach a compromise on organ donations, on the highly sensitive question of voluntary and non-remunerated donation, on umbilical cord blood donations and on fair access to the various treatments for all patients.</p>
<p class="contents">We are determined not to let all these advances be reduced to nothing here because some people are confused between the European Parliament and the Council of Europe. It is not Europe’s objective or ambition to harmonise ethics, and having a conscience in matters of science has never treated anyone. For all these reasons, the Liberal group, in self-defence, reserves the right to vote against this report and to go back to the Commission’s balanced proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are hundreds of thousands of such treatments every year. It was therefore a matter of urgency that the Commission should propose a draft directive seeking to draw up new quality and safety standards in order to increase public confidence in the use of such tissues and cells in and on the human body. I therefore approve the Commission’s action without reservation, and I support it.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, as someone has already said this evening, there are too many amendments, leading in every direction, and this threatens to change the nature of the initial draft, thereby depriving us of regulations which are, however, urgently needed. This is why this evening, in this debate, on behalf of the GUE/NGL, I should like to remind the House of the three fundamental principles which lead me to oppose many of these amendments. The first principle is that we must not take advantage of a draft directive, the need for which nobody would deny, in order to broaden its scope so as to include sectors which will have to have special regulations, or which have such regulations already. Above all, we must not use this draft as a means of opening debates about stem cells, embryonic cells and supernumerary cells, about research into these subjects, or even about voluntary termination of pregnancy. Many amendments contain these objectives, camouflaged, to a greater or lesser extent, by good intentions, and for that reason we shall not be voting in favour of them.</p>
<p class="contents">The second principle is that research and science should be enclosed by ethical rules in order to avoid irresponsible actions which are dangerous to the human species, but they must not be prevented by religious prohibitions, from whatever quarter. This is a basic rule of secularity. It is a necessary condition in order to guarantee progress. Here again, there is no shortage of amendments which should be rejected in the name of this principle.</p>
<p class="contents">The third principle is that the human body should not be available for sale, for purchase or for theft. On this point at least we must all be agreed, and we must also be agreed on the fact that this principle implies, firstly, a real and explicit willingness on the part of the donor and, secondly, explicit protection of the anonymity of the donor and of the recipient. Any exception would be a source of all kinds of abuses and excesses. However, that does not prevent traceability, which guarantees that the quality of transplants can be controlled. Thirdly, the fact that donations should be given without remuneration should not even be a matter for discussion: human bodies are not commercial goods.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I repeat that the development of these therapeutic treatments is such that a European directive is essential. However, this development also makes it essential, at the same time, for the European Parliament, in other words for us, to show rigour and respect for the great principles which very many of us have in common and which we cannot allow to be called into question, even insidiously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular we support the amendments which seek to exclude from the scope of this directive tissues and cells originating from human embryos or genetic engineering, insofar as there is no European legislation defining the use of gene therapy.</p>
<p class="contents">One compromise, however, is causing us problems, and that is the one concerning voluntary and non-remunerated donations of human tissues and cells. What we want is a guarantee that such donations will be unpaid. In order to achieve such a guarantee, it is necessary to define specifically, in this directive, the legitimate and acceptable level of compensation, which in our opinion is the reimbursement of travelling costs and income lost during the period required for the journey, the donation, and any rest period which is necessary, plus refreshments and that sort of allowance, but nothing more. Otherwise we shall be leaving the door open to compensation – or even remuneration – for such donations, with all the foreseeable abuses in terms of quality and safety, and the risks that would result for both donors and recipients. As the previous speaker said, bodies are not commercial goods. Our cells and tissues are not for sale.</p>
<p class="contents">Another fundamental principle of this directive is that of anonymity, which must be compatible with the traceability of the tissues and cells. The proposal by the European Commission, enhanced by the amendments of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, has succeeded in taking both of these principles into account. The plenary session of this Parliament should not call into question this fragile equilibrium by adopting amendments seeking to remove anonymity from donors of gametes and therefore of sperm donations, or to make tissue and cell distribution records available to the public, and I am referring here to one amendment in particular. The transparency argument is ill-advised in this case. The need to trace tissues and cells destined for transplantation from the donor to the recipient should not work to the detriment of anonymity. That would be to leave the door open to abuses of an ethical, eugenic or even racial nature.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we would ask the Commission, which did not want to include organs within the scope of this directive, to propose as a matter of urgency a specific text for establishing quality and safety standards in respect of organs.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this report is a balanced one. We should continue to work in this direction, including during subsequent readings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know that he has consulted widely with the political groups in order to make his report as reflective as possible of the various concerns and opinions.</p>
<p class="contents">I commend the Commission for taking this initiative under Article 152. This is a relatively new area for EU legislation. It is important, as with the blood directive, to get things right. It is also important that actions taken in the medical sphere be properly positioned within the ethical framework. This framework must naturally take due account of national practices. The Commission is certainly aware of the speed and efficiency with which this proposal was dealt with in Parliament. I sincerely hope that the very helpful set of amendments proposed by the rapporteur on behalf of the committee will be taken on board.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of areas in which Parliament has clearly improved on the original proposal. As far as ethical principles are concerned, I welcome the more specific language to reinforce the principle of voluntary, unpaid donations of cells and tissues. There are clear public health risks involved in attracting the wrong type of donors through turning tissue procurement into a commercial activity.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly support the reinforcement of the consent principle so as to give the maximum protection to donors. In this respect it is important that the use of aborted foetal tissue be excluded. Similarly I am opposed to the notion of creating human life for the sole purpose of harvesting tissues, after which this human life is to be disposed of. This would be in total violation of the concepts of human dignity and the right to life as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. I also endorse those amendments that exclude from the scope of this directive any cells or tissues that are derived from cloned material. This Parliament has repeatedly voiced its opposition to human cloning.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to ask the Commission when we can expect to see a proposal for a directive on organ transplants. I call on the Commission to give Parliament a commitment in that regard before we cast our vote on this proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A tissue is a group of cells with the same structure or function. Organs in their turn consist of different tissues. Cells, tissues and organs can all be donated, so the quality and safety standards must apply to all three – to organs too. The transition between organs and tissues is a fluid one.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of the scarcity problem that exists with organs, which in fact is also the case with different tissues, a separate directive is perhaps required, but that does not alter the fact that the same quality requirements with regard to donating, etc., must apply to organs.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, will the structure of a directive on organs not correspond closely to the present directive on tissues and cells? Do I understand the Commissioner correctly that what is requested in Amendments Nos 6 and 62, that is a proposal for a directive on organs before the summer of 2003, is not feasible? May we hear something more about the timetable for a directive on organs?</p>
<p class="contents">In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, the Commission’s representative supported my Amendment No 99 on cells. The rapporteur has objections. Therefore Commissioner, I would like to hear from you what you think. Otherwise we warmly support this directive, certainly because it refers to fundamental ethical principles that trade must meet. All praise too for the substantial expert work of the rapporteur, Mr Liese. On the basis of what I have just said, I am prepared to withdraw my Amendments Nos 96 to 98 and 100 to 102 on organs and I have also secured the cooperation of Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on this, who at the time tabled these amendments with me. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Cell therapy and tissue grafting are areas which offer the hope of treating incurable diseases which leave so many people in pain and anxiety. However, mastery of this technique alone is not enough to respond to the expectations of sick people. That is why we need this proposed directive, the objective of which is to ensure that there is a framework of safety and quality standards for human tissues and cells.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as voluntary non-remunerative donation and donor anonymity are concerned, the directive cannot impose obligations on Member States by virtue of the European Treaty, but can only make recommendations. Donation must be non-remunerative. How could anyone ever imagine trading in human products? The saving of a life is a disinterested action, taken with no reward in mind. Donation should also be voluntary, and therefore requires obligatory informed and written consent by the living donor. This is why it is essential to inform society about the advisability of these treatments and about the responsibilities of each of us, in a spirit of solidarity, because the health of thousands of human beings can be improved in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">The people of our countries are not sufficiently aware of the benefits of human tissue and cell donations. How many lives have been saved, how many patients treated, by bone-marrow grafts? The directive should be accompanied by much more detailed information. This information should be more reliable and should be based on authentic scientific research. For example, how many times have we been told that embryonic stem cells would treat incurable diseases, whereas so far nothing has been published to prove this? It would be wrong to say that prohibiting the use of embryonic cells would prevent lives from being saved. There are other alternatives, in particular techniques involving adult stem cells. Moreover, this observation makes us wonder just which cells are covered by the proposed directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall be supporting the position of the French Government on three points. Under Article 152(4) of the Treaty, it is not our task to regulate the use of cells of any particular type, such as germ cells or embryonic cells, by means of this directive. That falls within the jurisdiction of national governments, as do ethical issues involving embryos. Finally, gametes are not included within the scope of the directive. I shall be voting in favour of this report, but I shall continue to pay great attention to the issue of respect for the dignity of both the donor and the recipient. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I shall mention just a few points this evening – four, in particular. Firstly, I feel that it is right – as Mr Liese said – that the donation of cells and tissues should be on a voluntary basis and unpaid, a principle already endorsed when the report on blood was adopted. However, where industry has helped to improve the quality and conservation of cells and tissues, for example by using genetic engineering techniques to make tissues histocompatible, it is right to allow for appropriate payment.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I hope that Amendment No 83, proposed by myself and Mr Liese, will be adopted. It calls upon the Commission to draw up new legislation on the use of retrodifferentiation to create stem cells from adult cells as soon as possible. The retrodifferentiation of adult cells, achieved by transferring their nucleus, rather than to an egg cell without a nucleus, to a medium rich in nutritive elements and other growth factors, could make it possible to overcome the current ethical problems connected with the therapeutic use of stem cells from human embryos.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, as regards the use of stem cells for research purposes, I hope that the rules laid down in the Sixth Framework Programme will always remain in force and that we do not let anything in by the back door today that should not be there.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly and lastly, I support the Commission’s proposal that the directive should cover the use of cells and tissues for research purposes where this is carried out on human beings but not where experimental research is carried out <span class="italic">in vitro</span> or on animal models. I would therefore call upon the rapporteur, Mr Liese, should Amendments Nos 7 and 19 be adopted, to introduce more flexibility at second reading to avoid unwieldy administrative procedures slowing down research in Europe in key fields such as pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics, for example, whose objective is to develop new drugs which are much more effective and have no toxic action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This also applies to the use of human tissue and cells. We should capitalise on the positive opportunities afforded by these new developments as far as possible, even if it is clear that from today's perspective, the prospects are not always as promising as is suggested in some quarters. However, we should certainly utilise the opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">The use of these new technologies must, however, be measured against the fundamental principles and rules which define the community of values that constitutes the European Union. A fundamental pillar of this community of values is the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Its basic values include, in particular, respect for human dignity, the principle of non-commercialisation of the human body, and the guarantee that cell and tissue donations may take place only on a voluntary basis, without pressure, and with an understanding of all the implications.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the Commission's proposal touches only on these issues, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which is designated as being responsible for ethical issues in this House, has adopted a number of relevant amendments. In our view, it is absolutely essential to make it clear that, as in the legislation on donations of blood and blood components, the provision of human tissue and cells should be permitted only on a donation basis, in order to counter any trend towards the commercialisation and objectivisation of the human body. Let me make it clear: donations of human tissue or cells may only take place voluntarily and without any financial remuneration. They must also be anonymous, and persons who cannot legally give consent themselves require special protection, for their bodies may not be disrespected, and it must be clear that donations may only be used in the interests of their own health, not for research purposes. I am thinking specifically of disabled people here.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me underline one point in particular: respect for the traditions and cultural differences within the European Union requires that in this law too, Member States must be granted the right to ban the donation and use of cells from specific origins. This applies particularly to the renunciation of the use of embryonic stem cells in favour of adult stem cells, which have been shown to be just as useful and, indeed, more promising in many cases.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, a number of proposed amendments which I cannot support under any circumstances, and where I am absolutely of the same opinion as Mr Caudron, who unfortunately has already left. These are the amendments which try, through the back door, to circumvent abortion, and I think this is something which we cannot accept under any circumstances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to pay tribute, in particular, to his efforts to include social groups in the work on the report as well. That is very commendable, for the real task here is genuinely to bring together all the social groups – patients' organisations, but also scientists and others – round the table, and he has been at pains to draw the different positions together.</p>
<p class="contents">For us Greens too, it is very important – indeed, I would go as far as to say that it is the priority – to send out a very clear signal to the Member States that embryos may not be used for research purposes. We do not want to create any incentive for embryos to be produced solely for research purposes. We also do not want women to be degraded into egg cell or embryo donors. This is something we must reject, loud and clear. We must also make it clear that no tissue or cells from embryos in general may be used.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of embryonic stem cells, too, my position is quite clear: what we are saying is that adult stem cells are just as, if not more suitable. We cannot awaken any false hopes here. I would like to mention the damaging reports on gene therapy, which have recently been circulating, in this context. In this area, far too many false hopes have been awakened for many years, instead of genuinely looking at alternatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Science and research without a conscience would be humanity's ruin. For this reason, the task must be to send out very clear signals here. It is also important to emphasise in the report, yet again, that the cloning of humans or embryos is not permitted. In my view, it cannot be stressed often enough, here in Parliament and indeed elsewhere, that we need a very clear limit. A great deal has already been said about donations without remuneration, and it is clear, as has already been discussed, that the human body is not a commodity.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, Commissioner, I would urge you once again to respond positively to the demand which we Greens have tabled. We are calling on the Commission to put forward a legislative proposal before July 2003, for the situation on organ donations in particular is making it increasingly clear that the human body or parts thereof are indeed becoming commodities. In my view, we need very clear European legislation in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Liese has certainly striven and is continuing to strive to achieve an acceptable compromise in the House, but I believe that the greatest threat to the quest for such a compromise and to the thorough work of the Commission and many of the Members of the House is the attempt – made by some of the Members – to include issues in the report which have nothing to do with the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I feel that Mr Bartolozzi’s opinion and the position of many of the Members who have attempted and are still attempting to surreptitiously introduce the issue of the interruption of pregnancy and embryonic stem cells into the directive are severely jeopardising the good work which many of the Members are striving to carry out. For our part, as Radical members of the Emma Bonino List, we can only vote against all the amendments which seek to introduce such issues in this way. This does not mean – and I am addressing Mrs Montfort and the other Members who have raised the point – that we are claiming that embryonic stem cells are the magic answer to all genetically-related problems and disorders; we merely feel that these research possibilities should not be eliminated and that they should certainly not be eliminated through a directive which is concerned with other matters, which seeks to regulate pragmatically a promising market and an activity which is necessary for the life and health of many European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not become a Parliament which persists in making every vote a vote on a moral principle, as if we were trying to establish a ‘single European moral code’. Let us rather find political, pragmatic, practical solutions to the issues raised by the directive, which, through the directive, the Commission is attempting to resolve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has developed and improved upon the Commission’s proposal. I think both the approach and the scope of the Liese report are excellent. Work on this directive began during the Spanish Presidency of the European Union. It is no accident that in 2002 Spain was the international role model for donations and transplants for the tenth year running.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore have a good understanding of this subject. We are also aware of all the problems involved in the transplantation of tissues, cells and organs. In recent years, very significant advances in transplant technology have been made, and the public has become more aware of the need to come forward as potential donors. In this context it is appropriate to establish specific European regulations to control such activities. The regulations are needed to guarantee all these activities can take place within the appropriate ethical, health and social framework in all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As previously explained, donation and transplant procedures rely on solidarity. They rely on people playing their part in the donation system in an altruistic and disinterested way. It is therefore very important to ensure people will still volunteer to become donors for no reward. We must encourage people to come forward and increase the number of potential donors. Above all, we must ensure families respect donors’ decisions when the time comes.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been much debate on whether organ transplantation should be included in this directive. While I believe we need Community regulations on organ transplantation, I think it would be wrong to include the issue in this particular directive. The directive would have to be substantially modified and this could undermine good organ transplant practice. I therefore believe Amendment No 6 provides a sensible solution to the problem. It rightly calls on the Commission to present a proposal on the matter in 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I think the Commission’s initial proposal, which would exclude cells to be used in the preparation of medicinal products from the directive is improved by Amendment No 21 which does include such cells.</p>
<p class="contents">The most controversial aspect of this directive is perhaps the use of tissues and cells from cloned human embryos, because of the important ethical and moral implications. In my opinion Amendment No 30 establishes a number of basic conditions on respect for human dignity. I think these should apply in all Member States, although some of the latter may wish to take either a stricter or more liberal line on the basis of these common fundamental conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, as a Member of this House, I would like to convey my full support to those anonymous European citizens who, by donating tissues, cells or organs, offer patients hope and a new lease of life. They are indeed helping to achieve miracles. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we are well aware that such a text could not fail to mention ethical principles, and that is why a large part of the debate has centred on those issues. Keen as we are on the concept of voluntary, anonymous and non-remunerated donation, we would have liked to see a firmer stand taken on this subject, and we had already expressed this desire when we had the vote on the report on blood, and had occasion to reaffirm it when we examined the report on organs. We therefore regret that the objectives of voluntary, anonymous and non-remunerated donation are the subject of mere recommendations, rather than clear commitments, since the absence of any timetable for achieving these objectives means that Member States are not obliged to take all necessary steps to implement projects and policies towards achieving those objectives. We deplore this and we therefore ask the Commission to carry out a regular evaluation of the progress made in this area at Member State level.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not ignore the fact that the safety and traceability of donations will be better guaranteed if those donations originate from a country within the European Union which is subject to our legislation. Another of our objectives should be self-sufficiency at EU level.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, trafficking linked to trade in cells and tissues in certain third countries should make us extremely vigilant when we import such products, because if we are not vigilant we might be regarded as passive accomplices in such activities.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the European Union’s Charter of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms states that it is prohibited to make the human body, and parts thereof, a source of profit. This is why we should vote in favour of Amendment No 77 and Amendment No 1.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to donor anonymity in the case of gametes, and the proposal which has been made, to the effect that such anonymity should be removed, I wonder whether, if this happened, there might be a risk that donors of sperm and oocytes, of which even now there are not enough to satisfy demand, would be put off from entering into such a commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it seems to me important that the Member States and the Commission should establish a centralised data bank which would receive all available information on approved establishments, on the products handled, and on bio-monitoring. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The proposed directive 'on setting standards of quality and safety for the donation, procurement, testing, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells' is a very important piece of legislation and much to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">I rehearsed the full title of this directive because it is important to recognise what it does encompass and what it does not encompass. Specifically, recital 6 states: 'this Directive does not cover research using human tissues and cells'. It is a public health measure under Article 152 of the Treaty. Unfortunately, and quite unacceptably, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy's Amendment 7 proposes to change recital 6 to: 'this directive also covers research using human tissues and cells'.</p>
<p class="contents">In similar vein, its Amendment 19 to Article 2(1), proposes to delete the limiting phrase 'for application to the human body', thus opening the directive's full provisions to <span class="italic">in vitro </span>research in laboratories, or even school rooms, where no application to the human body is involved.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not have time to go into all the other problems with this report. There are technical difficulties concerned with consent by donors, and anonymity of donors. There are highly questionable forays into areas of ethics which are irrelevant for the purpose and legal basis of this directive. Even the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has seen fit to insert the legally undefinable term 'fundamental ethical principles' into what purports to be a legal legislative text. Very importantly, there are attempts to impose European prohibitions on ethical aspects of research and therapy which are clearly the subject of the subsidiarity principle and which it must remain the right of Member States to decide.</p>
<p class="contents">I have the greatest regard for my colleague, Mr Liese, and I accept his assurances that he tried to maintain a balanced approach to this subject. Unfortunately, the result contains many unacceptable points. Only if these are eliminated between now and the final vote will it be possible for me to support his report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a vast subject, so I will just focus on one detail: the processing of stem cells. It is part of a direct continuum with the work we tried to do in Parliament’s Temporary Committee on Human Genetics the year before last.</p>
<p class="contents">We got the message: the business aspect was the hottest area. Investors were in expectant mood. Expectations were not so much connected with new medical breakthroughs, but mainly the possibility of making lots of money. The following business hype applies to the field of genetic engineering: you expect to get at least as much for your money out of it as you would out of IT. In the end what is actually discovered in the research studies does not matter that much.</p>
<p class="contents">While we waited for the hype, the fact that there was also an alternative to the cloning of embryonic stem cells – treatment with adult stem cells – was entirely overlooked. Of course, embryonic stem cells have a greater capacity for differentiating into any sort of tissue. Recently, however, studies have also opened up promising possibilities in the use of adult stem cells. The first cells in the human embryo are ‘totipotent’, which means they can differentiate into any cell type. Pluripotent stem cells, on the other hand, can differentiate into any cell type but they can no longer be used to create a new human being. Multipotent stem cells can only produce the cells of a certain tissue type, such as nerve, liver or blood cells. These are also found in adult cells, and it is those that are more interesting from the point of view of therapeutic cloning. The latest research points to the fact that some stem cells thought to be multipotent might well be pluripotent. This would mean that there would be no need to make stem cell chains from human embryos after all.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Liese’s report recognises the situation for what it is absolutely correctly, at the same time recognising the ethical problems that are encountered in the processing of embryos. It is important to say here that a medically sound approach and one that shows ethical wisdom are not necessarily mutually exclusive. We Christian Democrats say an emphatic ‘yes’ to research, at the same time wishing to preserve the sanctity of human dignity right from its frail beginnings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur, Mr Liese, has added some important dimensions by also choosing to address the ethical aspects of a number of points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, a new introductory recital on the human body, reading as follows, has been incorporated from the Charter on Human Rights: ‘The human body is inviolable and inalienable. It is prohibited to make the human body and its parts as such a source of financial gain’.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Amendment No 79 proposes the compilation of a code of conduct, if possible at UN level, for the protection of human dignity. The amendment states that account should be taken of principles involving, for example, a ban on making the human body or its parts as such a source of financial gain, of the principle of informed consent and of that involving a ban on cloning.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Amendment No 46 points out that the removal of tissues from foetuses originating from the voluntary interruption of pregnancy shall not be permitted. That is an important position if it is not to be possible to use a distorted utilitarian argument to put pressure upon someone facing a possible decision concerning abortion.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, Amendment No 31 contains requirements for regulating, in particular, the use of germ cells, embryonic stem cells and foetal stem cells. The use of cells that are of sensitive origin from an ethical point of view needs to be specially regulated, if that is not already the case, in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 82 addresses the issue of donor consent. Clarification is needed of what should apply in the case of donation and of what is entailed by the obligatory requirements relating to consent. There are important clarifications of what should apply in the case of persons who cannot legally give consent themselves, as well as in the case of deceased or, as the case may be, living persons.</p>

After the committee adopted Amendment No 30, I felt a real need to add here that the Member States should, at the least, uphold the ban on research involving the destruction of human embryos.</p>
<p class="contents">You see, I would now like to exercise one of the great achievements of our European continent. I would like to exercise the achievements of freedom of thought and freedom of conscience. Please do not try to make matters easy for yourselves by claiming that we are not here to preach morality! What else is at stake, then, when embryos are destroyed? We do not need to harmonise at all, for we all share a common set of ethics which states, at least: you shall not kill! I respect your opinion, but please respect the opinion of others who say: I will not kill! Someone once told me that at the very moment when the egg and sperm cells join, a unique person is created – not just anyone, but a person with a specific hair colour and individual qualities – in other words, a human being.</p>
<p class="contents">I know there are the famous fourteen days, Mr Purvis. I am afraid that we do not entirely agree on this issue. Has individuation occurred or not? Am I not already killing? Please recognise that people are afraid of having to kill.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet perhaps we are discussing all this quite unnecessarily. Let me tell you that a few days ago, Professor Huber of Vienna University presented his most recent research achievements and findings. In many years of work on blood obtained from umbilical cord, he has achieved massive successes which give him the justified hope that in a few years, he will be able to generate organs from it.</p>

<p class="contents">Let me come first to Mrs Ries. Unfortunately, she was unable to stay for the rest of the debate, but as I have already told her in person, it would be a great shame if, due to the 10% on which we disagree, the Liberal Group were to vote against the entire report. I think that many of Mrs Ries's amendments which have been included in the report are worth adopting by this House in the end. I therefore appeal to the Liberal Group to reconsider whether they really are prepared, ultimately, to vote against the entire report.</p>
<p class="contents">On Mr Bowe's points regarding a case from his own constituency, where stem cells offer hope for a boy suffering from a serious disease: after he spoke, I went to him and tried to clarify this issue, as it is very important, in my view, to make it clear that these are not embryonic stem cells but adult stem cells from bone marrow. The experiment nonetheless raises a number of serious ethical questions. However, it does not involve embryonic stem cells. This point is very important, to my mind, because at the hearing too, it was made clear that embryonic stem cells have not been transplanted into any patients anywhere in the world. Apart from the ethical issues, the associated medical risks are simply too great.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to Mr Caudron, I would like to say that I am aware of this and I also appreciate the fact that he is so consistent in defending his position that research on human embryos and embryonic stem cells should not be ruled out. In fact, the committee's report does not do so anyway. Amendment No 30 is the compromise which Mr Caudron negotiated with the Commission and the Council on the Sixth Research Framework Programme, and Amendments No 86 and No 92 go beyond that.</p>
<p class="contents">In my heart, I am with Mrs Flemming, and I endorse her arguments. However, my head tells me that the compromise identified by the committee is possibly better and forms a better basis for the European Union and the European Parliament. We should therefore certainly support Amendment No 30, and on Amendment No 86, I recommend as rapporteur that we respect freedom of conscience so that everyone can vote as his or her conscience dictates.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me make one comment about the legal basis. I have difficulties explaining to the citizens of Europe that the Commission considers it feasible for us to ban tobacco advertising in regional newspapers but does not ban the trade in cells and tissue running into thousands of euros. That is not a very coherent position. Commissioner, I gave you my full support on the ban on tobacco advertising, although on one or two points, I felt that it went too far. Nonetheless, I was in favour in principle and therefore supported you against a great deal of opposition in Germany. I therefore ask you to reconsider this issue. Perhaps you are not yet able to make concessions to us today, but you may be able to do so in the coming weeks and months. I would like to be able to defend the Commission in Germany and the other Member States, and I do not want to have this lack of coherence which I can no longer defend. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td width="70" align="center" valign="top"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="photoframe_blue"><tr><td><img alt="MPphoto" src="/doceo/data/img/photo_generic.gif" align="right" width="50" height="63" /></td></tr></table> </td><td width="5"> </td><td align="left" valign="top">
<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, this interesting debate has highlighted the importance and the sensitivity of this proposal. I note that many of you, including Mr Liese, are disappointed that the Commission has not offered to go further on the ethical issues. This is not because we do not consider ethical standards to be important – quite the contrary. It is precisely because ethical standards are so important to our citizens that we must not overstep the mark.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is the guardian of the Treaties. We have to respect the advice of our legal service – advice also echoed by the legal service of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said in my opening address on this point, the Commission's proposal aims to take to the very limit what is legally acceptable, given the constraints of the Treaty. We simply cannot push this any further. That said, I would ask you to consider that if we discount those amendments that go beyond the scope of Article 152, we can accept, fully or partially, a majority of them. I am pleased to note that most of those amendments substantially improve the directive. Article 152 still allows us to take all necessary precautions to enforce the central requirement of the European Group on Ethics, namely in the protection of the health of the recipient.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the detail of the amendments before us today. On the scope of the proposal I can accept some clarifications, but the wording has to ensure legal clarity. A series of amendments aimed to limit the use of certain types of cells, such as cells derived from cloning or abortion. I share many of your concerns with regard to these issues. However, with this proposal we seek neither to mandate nor to prohibit the use of specific types of cells because the EU does not have the competence to do so. It is neither legally possible, nor appropriate, for the Community to act in an area where it is best left to the Member States. I wish to emphasise that decisions on the use of any specific type of cells and tissues – whatever the type – are a matter for our Member States. If, however, any particular use of such cells is authorised in a Member State, then the directive kicks in, to require the application of all provisions necessary to protect public health.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the exclusion of organs from the proposal, I reiterate that the Commission does not intend to drop the subject of organs from the agenda. I attach the utmost importance to taking forward a legislative proposal based on sound science, and will follow it closely. We are presently engaged in the acquisition of the information and the scientific advice to enable us to bring forward legislation along these lines. This will take some time. I appeal to Members of the House, particularly to such distinguished Members as Mr Blokland and Mr Ó Neachtain, to think twice before holding this piece of legislation to ransom and perhaps even taking the step of voting against this report and legislation because the Commission cannot move at a speed that people believe is more appropriate. As representatives of our various institutions, we both respect the other's institution. No-one respects the rights of this institution more than I do myself. But I seek the same respect for my institution, which includes the right of initiative. It is one of the fundamental requirements of the Community method that we all enjoy and support.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the justifications for the retention of this right of initiative is that the Commission brings forward a proposal when and if it is ready – but in this instance, when it is ready. I have said I will, but I cannot do it now. I cannot give a promise that I will have a legislative proposal before this House before this summer. If, with that information, you feel it necessary to vote against this legislation, so be it. But I would ask you not to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, the issue of organ trafficking is being addressed by a new initiative of the Greek Presidency under Title 4 of the EU Treaty. This initiative, which I support wholeheartedly, aims to make organ trafficking a criminal offence in all Member States. In addition, we hope that a conference on organ transplantation, organised by the Italian Presidency in Venice this September, will help us to determine the way forward in this area. In the meantime, the Commission is compiling information on the current situation with regard to organ transplantation in the Member States and applicant countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I appeal to Members to look to their own responsibility and not to hold this particular piece of legislation to ransom because of the views they have about the speed of bringing forward this piece of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Returning to ethical issues, I have made clear that because of the legal position that has been underlined repeatedly by the legal services of the Council and the Commission, I cannot agree with a large number of the amendments on the table today. These amendments concern, in particular, voluntary unpaid donation, the principle of not-for-profit procurement and the requirements for donor consent. The question of voluntary unpaid donation was discussed at length during the codecision procedure on the blood directive. In the light of this experience, and also in view of the results of the debate in the Council health group so far, I believe that it would save a lot of crucial time if the Council and Parliament did not seek to re-open this debate, but instead stayed with the blood solution, as a number of speakers have already said.</p>
<p class="contents">On donor consent, I pointed out that the proposal states that the use of human tissues and cells should take place under conditions protecting the rights and health of all parties, and that the consent of donors and recipients should be given, following the International Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine.</p>
<p class="contents">With these basic principles in our proposal, we adhere to international standards. It is then for the Member States to introduce detailed rules. I do not recommend going any further than that.</p>
<p class="contents">Provisions on consent vary across the Member States. For example, if the donor is deceased, some presume consent whereas others do not. On the other hand, consent issues are well regulated in all Member States and applicant countries, so the added value of binding provisions at EU-level is, in my view, very doubtful.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I am very pleased to be able to accept, at least in principle, the majority of the technical amendments on the table today. A full listing of the Commission's position on each of the amendments is being made available to Parliament. I trust that this will be included in the minutes of this session.</p>
<p class="contents">This dossier is one of the Greek Presidency's priorities as regards the health sector, which we hope can achieve a common position in the Council, following Parliament's opinion. Through this proposal the Community can establish significant new standards for the health of our citizens. I thank you all, once again, for your efforts on this dossier. I trust that you all share my desire to see this through to a satisfactory conclusion. Protecting and improving public health is, after all, at the very centre of our citizens' concerns and expectations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
