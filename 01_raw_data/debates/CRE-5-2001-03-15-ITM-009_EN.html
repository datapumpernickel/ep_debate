This democracy was to lead to an independent judicial system and separation of political and judicial powers.</p>
<p class="contents">Twenty years after Zimbabwe’s independence, we can only establish that the Mugabe government has not achieved a great deal. The economy is in decline and, as for human rights, it is questionable whether the present situation is so much better than twenty years ago. But what is most surprising, is the fact that the rest of Africa, especially South Africa, is looking on in silence. My group is of the opinion that the European Commission must come down as hard on this regime as it did on any other regimes in southern Africa which rode roughshod over people’s rights. If not, this problem might well contaminate the rest of Africa, which could have disastrous consequences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It simply cannot afford a war, but instead of withdrawing from it, it seems that the Zimbabwean government has chosen to create new problems for itself and look for scapegoats. The way in which the land reform has been handled has made the economic and social situation even worse, and now that the success of the opposition parties, despite all intimidation attempts which we have witnessed with our own eyes, has become apparent, Mr Mugabe is resorting to human rights violations. Zimbabwe is not only in chaos, it is under a reign of terror. A Head of State who plunges his own country into chaos, and persecutes his own people does not really deserve our respect. The dialogue between the European Union and Zimbabwe must, therefore, in the context of the ACP, be employed to reverse this situation. We therefore understand that any official contact with Mr Mugabe is only acceptable to the extent that it is aimed at reinstating the rule of law and human rights, and takes place within the framework of the peace negotiations in Central Africa. In that sense, we distance ourselves from Paragraph 16 of the compromise resolution, because we make allowances for the Belgian government, the French President and Commissioner Nielson who received President Mugabe in the framework of those peace negotiations. We will therefore support the amendment from the liberal group, but our population and the people of Zimbabwe do expect to see results very soon. We expect the pressure to be stepped up in such a way that the cynical stance of Mr Mugabe, who is indeed still receiving support from his old companions, will be brought to an end and the rule of law restored instead.</p>

They told me that Zimbabwe is going through hell. Europe's efforts at quiet diplomacy just have negative results. Mugabe presides over a state that day in and day out subjects innocent Zimbabweans to untold misery, murder, brutality and intimidation. They pleaded for the same standards of democracy, the rule of law and human rights to be applied in Africa, as would be expected in Europe. They told me that they do not want some second-class status in these matters. They would like to see Mugabe arrested as soon as he sets foot in a European state. Instead, it seems there is one standard in Europe for handling right-wing dictators and another for socialist tyrants and terrorists, such as Mugabe. Instead of handcuffs he gets champagne in Brussels and Paris.</p>
<p class="contents">In our strong resolution, thoroughly approved by the MDC representatives we have seen today, we condemn Mugabe and his regime and call for suspension of EU assistance directed through Zimbabwe government channels, identification of Mugabe's extensive overseas assets, invocation of the Cotonou Article 96 procedures and insistence that the Zimbabwean government respect its own laws. Our message is clear. I commend the resolution unamended to the House.</p>

If black people kill other black people, we avert our eyes and let them get on with it. It is all right for a right-wing dictator like Pinochet to be arrested for human rights violations in Chile. Why do we treat people with a different skin colour in a different way? We are supposed to have one standard for all. We are supposed to be not only a global economy but a one-world family. But is that the way we react? No! We need to do something about it.</p>

<p class="contents">What is clear is that Zimbabwe is in chaos. Human rights there are being trampled underfoot. Do we now need to erect a cordon sanitaire, which effectively means there will be no dialogue? No. We do need a cordon sanitaire but one which clearly expresses what we want to achieve when we meet with these interlocutors. I would like to say to the last speaker that there was no champagne in Brussels. There was a reminder of resoluteness and there was a reminder of values, because if we want to safeguard the interests of the people of Zimbabwe, we must continue to get our position across to everyone, including the authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, what I am asking is that the amendment we have tabled and which highlights the fact that we must invoke the law each time and we must specify what actually the scope of human rights is. This is an important element. So, let us not condemn those who defend this point of view, but let us call on the entire European Community – be it the Commission, the European Parliament or the Member States – to reiterate just how important human rights, and the law itself, are in this very sensitive area. That is why I sincerely hope that the European Parliament will vote in favour of the amendment we have tabled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, he is unwilling to listen to advice, whether it comes from his own country or from abroad, unless it is accompanied by concrete measures. That is why we are urging the EU to suspend all cooperation directed through government channels. It is also important to send Mr Mugabe the message that Europe no longer has a relevant political camp to act as his political sponsor.</p>
<p class="contents">But I would also like to hear the Commission and the Council speak the same clear language. It is true that bilateral cooperation for development has been greatly scaled down, but I would ask the Council presidency to make the necessity of joint action clear to the Jospin Government in particular. If France wants more influence in the region, it must back the forces of the future. In this part of Africa civil society sometimes manages to overcome autocratic structures unaided, and then they remember who in Europe backed the wrong horse.

I am motivated to do so because the shock waves and repercussions of what is happening in Zimbabwe have reached even my constituency in the in Yorkshire in the North of England in a number of ways in the last couple of weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">It started with a visit from a young Zimbabwean with our local asylum seekers' organisation. He was an active member of the MDC. He and his fiancée had fled in fear of their lives, first to South Africa and, finding that not safe, they had come to the UK, but unfortunately his fiancée is likely to be returned. We do not know to what, but we can suspect.</p>
<p class="contents">Then last week in Ripon in Yorkshire, I was asked to share a platform with a Member of the Zimbabwean Parliament, a shadow minister. Quietly spoken, he told of his aspirations for his country, a country of great potential but where, as we have heard, democracy and human rights are now denied and the rule of the law flouted. He told how he had been beaten, how he feared daily for his wife and his family and, just as we have also heard, he feared what would happen to him when he returns on 17 March.</p>
<p class="contents">When people are fleeing for their lives across the world and when democratically elected politicians are in fear of their lives, Europe needs to make a response that this is not acceptable. I believe our resolution is clear and I hope it gets the support it deserves.</p>

The reason why this topic is on the list of urgent questions today is because, thanks to the efforts of the Belgian government and pledges of President Arap Moi from Kenya, there is a chance of breaking the deadlock in this case in the short term. All it needs now is a little nudge from this European Parliament to guide it onto the right track. But the fact that we are discussing this case here today should not make us oblivious to the fact that the Limet case is only the tip of the iceberg. Many of us are involved in cases of parental abduction, sometimes even as a country’s go-between. I myself know of many dozens of cases of parents in Belgium whose children have been kidnapped and taken to Tunisia, Morocco, Lebanon and even to America, and also in the European Union many children are denied the right to one of their parents. Only recently, I was reading a report which stated that, in 1999 alone, cases were recorded under the Convention of The Hague involving more than 1 800 children. And that is only covering the 47 countries which have ratified the Convention and excluding the cases which are being considered under the Convention of Luxembourg. All these children are entitled to both their parents, and the European Parliament has ensured that this is clearly spelled out in the EU’s Fundamental Rights Charter, promulgated in Nice, even more clearly than in the Convention of New York. And that is another reason for making sure that this Charter is included in our Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that approval of this resolution will help guarantee the Limet children their right to both parents, but I am just as much convinced that the European Parliament, and the Commission too, I hope, will need to take many more initiatives in order to restore the rights of all these other children and parents. I am convinced that this House has the political will to carry this through. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although it only deals with one case, it still reflects the issue which has a European and even international dimension. These are facts that are, unfortunately, increasingly common and which constitute a violation of the international treaties. It has a devastating effect on the life of a father or mother, of children and of an environment. Mr Limet has now been fighting for his children for more than two years. He had been given custody over his children, but they were abducted by his ex-wife and taken to Kenya. The mother of the children was recently found guilty of abduction and given a one year unconditional sentence, but despite the legal steps and mediation by both the Belgian and European political authorities, especially Mr Prodi, the chances of Mr Limet seeing his children again are as good as non-existent. A solution is therefore needed and, where this particular case is concerned, I would ask the Commission and the Council to call on the Kenyan government to ensure that justice ultimately prevails. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are all familiar with the many conventions, Article 24 of the EU’s Fundamental Rights Charter, the treaties of The Hague, and the many real-life cases, as Mrs Van Lancker mentioned a moment ago. I can foresee two large obstacles which will stand in the way of finding solutions. First of all, many of the existing agreements between countries, and even within the European Union, are different and not harmonised, as a result of which it becomes extremely difficult, if not impossible, to reach a solution. This is therefore something we need to work on. Secondly, if a parent who kidnaps a child is domiciled in Germany, for example, but actually lives in Greece, then a solution is often ruled out. That means that the professional NGOs, of which Belgium has many, have to start their own investigations and try to track down children and bring them home. That is why the Group of the Greens/Free European Alliance hopes that this resolution will not be swept under the carpet but may signify the necessary step forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First I wish to reassure other victim parents, some of whom have expressed concern that this resolution deals with a particular case, that their tragedies too are just as important to me. My primary concern today is to ensure that the channels of communication, which seem to be opening for the first time since the onset of the Limet tragedy, are strengthened and that progress can be made to return the children to their home as soon as possible. This is the primary aim of this resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">All too often in Member States, the abduction of a child is treated by the police and other authorities simply as a domestic rather than a criminal matter. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Kenyan authorities, and in particular President Moi, for any assistance they can provide to ensure a positive outcome. It is my firm belief that the children have the right to know both parents and this right was scrupulously respected until the failure to return the children to their father in Belgium in August 1998. However, since then the children have been denied access to one parent, in this case their father. He has given undertakings that once the children are returned to his custody their mother will continue to have visiting rights as before, thus restoring the children's right to have a relationship with both parents.</p>
<p class="contents">Next week, I will be travelling to the Hague conference, where the special commission will meet to review the practical operation of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. We have a big task ahead of us, but I would like to take this opportunity to remind all the signatories of the Hague convention that they signed up not just to protect their own nationals who may become victims of child abduction, but also to use the convention to assist those who are victims of child abduction by their own nationals. It is not a one-way process. For the convention to succeed, full cooperation by all the signatories is essential. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a moderate motion, which is designed to condemn the unacceptable fact that innocent people have been kidnapped for political ends. The motion does not discuss the basis of the issue, simply whether it is legitimate for a so-called revolutionary organisation to kidnap innocent people from other countries and to use these kidnappings to put pressure on the political powers of other States in order to achieve some form of recognition. This is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">What is even less acceptable, however, is the fact that people who are political refugees – and I have a great deal of respect for political exiles, because I myself spent many years in exile – take advantage of the countries in which they now live, particularly France, for example, and make threats to exact reprisals on the interests of other countries, such as, for example, Portugal, in order to achieve a political end. This is totally unacceptable. I therefore call on this organisation – the LFEC, to accept that, by using these terrorist-style methods, it is discrediting itself and will certainly fail to achieve its ends. I also call upon Parliament and upon the Council and the Commission to adopt a position of total condemnation of these methods, which could encourage others to act in the same way. Many countries are undergoing major conflicts and it is crucial that people’s rights are always safeguarded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also wish to express my sympathy for their families and to state my heartfelt desire that these hostages are unconditionally released as quickly as possible, and I therefore believe that the Portuguese Government must make every possible effort to achieve this. As a matter of fact, this was precisely the thrust of a letter that I sent to the Swedish Presidency, in due time and with the utmost discretion, asking it about the possibility of the various Member States adopting measures in conjunction with the Portuguese and Angolan Governments which would facilitate or improve the likelihood of the immediate release of the hostages.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, I feel that it is appropriate to emphasise that these actions by the LFEC must be explicitly and roundly condemned. These are criminal acts that are designed to aggravate the political and military situation in Angola and which are also intended to give an international profile to a group that has no compunction about resorting to such actions in order to achieve separatist objectives, which are also completely unrealistic.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, it is worth pointing out that Angola’s territorial integrity must be scrupulously respected, also because no legitimacy has been conferred on this type of separatist objective by the international community, specifically either by the Organisation of African Unity or the United Nations.</p>

These people are workers who were forced by necessity to leave their country and they are also citizens of the European Union to whom all the governments of the Union have responsibilities. The fact that, on our initiative, Parliament is discussing this issue is therefore to be warmly welcomed. We feel that a very clear position of principle is involved: it is unacceptable to imprison peaceful citizens in order to make political demands. I therefore call on all those who are detaining these Portuguese citizens to release them immediately, in a gesture of humanitarian good will, which is the only thing that can help their captors' cause.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation of our fellow citizens is obviously close to our hearts and, in order to ensure their release, we will do whatever is necessary, in accordance with our principles. This does not mean, however, that we are unaware that there are many conflicts, including the conflict in Cabinda, that do not reach the public’s attention as a result of the way we ignore Africa. We know that the current situation in Cabinda is extremely harsh for the Cabindese. Although they coexist with powerful international interests, in a territory that produces hundreds of millions of barrels of oil, they endure the most extreme poverty. Let no-one be under any illusions, because these ghettos of prosperity in which huge international companies set up on the coastline, protected by mercenaries and government troops, are an echo and a portrait of a colonial-style situation. We also know that there is no real political freedom, freedom of expression or free opportunity for the people of Cabinda to develop fully their cultural and religious identity which would allow them to argue for all that they want in a legal and peaceful way. We know that war is raging in most of the territory, together with human rights violations against the people of Cabinda, which have been condemned in all international reports.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no need to look any further than the reports by Amnesty International, which detail the extrajudicial executions, the systematic use of torture, the murder of civilians and the destruction of villages all suffered in Cabinda. These are facts that it would be hypocritical to ignore and that it suits many people to conceal. I shall not do this! Just as I call on those who are holding our fellow citizens to release them immediately, given the possibility of their release, I urge the Angolan authorities not to initiate or intensify military operations that could put the lives of the Portuguese who are being held at risk. They share responsibility for the situation that has arisen and we will be watching events closely. The adoption of a constructive position by the Angolan Government would obviously be welcomed by the international community. As a matter of fact, in the recent past, contacts have been established and direct negotiations have taken place between the Angolan Government and those fighting for independence in Cabinda, and the international community can only support this approach. Whatever reasons the men and women of Cabinda may have, making these Portuguese workers suffer will not help their cause. This is a unique opportunity to release these people in full view of the international community. We call once again for this to be done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Bearing this in mind, those who wish to see this initiative as an attempt to use the media to take advantage of a situation that is of legitimate concern to the whole Portuguese and, of course, international community, or to exacerbate political or party-political quarrels, which have no place at all in this context, are deluding themselves. We are acting on principle here and in order to achieve a result.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us clearly state the principles that are guiding us: we consider the use of kidnapping to express political opinions in any part of the world and for whatever reason to be unacceptable. This means that we cannot associate ourselves with any attempt to raise the profile of Cabinda’s political situation unless the Portuguese citizens are released.</p>
<p class="contents">The result that we wish to see forces us to make a sincere appeal that is not tainted by any party-political affiliations with the parties involved in the conflict in Cabinda. From this rostrum I appeal urgently to the sense of humanity of the leaders of the LFEC, so that they free our fellow citizens, some of whom have been detained for around nine months in extremely harsh living conditions. If I may put it like this, the LFEC must not be in any doubt as to the appreciation of the Portuguese and international communities of the historical aspirations that motivate their struggle. The simple release of the hostages, of their Portuguese brethren, from the very country with which the LFEC wishes to reopen relations that were cut off more than 25 years ago, will encourage a positive reaction and closer attention to the LFEC’s historical and political aims by these two communities. When the hostages are released, for our part, we shall not forget what we am now stating, particularly because we are aware of the difficult conditions in which the citizens of Cabinda are living. The release of the Portuguese citizens is, in this sense, also an act of political clarity and affirmation of humanitarian principles that we all need in order to bring about the resolution of this unfortunate episode. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For a number of years, there have been problems in Timor, mainly concentrated in West Timor at the moment, as well as in the Moluccas, in Aceh, in Irian Jaya and now again in Kalimantan. The old Suharto regime has in the past forced more than 8 million Indonesians to move from overpopulated regions to regions with a low population rate. For example, a few hundred thousand people moved from the island of Madura to Kalimantan, formerly Borneo. The migrants are often given a considerable degree of preferential treatment. For example they receive land and living facilities, sometimes at the expense of the indigenous population. That is the case in Irian Jaya and the Moluccas, as well as for the people from Madura in Kalimantan. It is therefore understandable that difficulties should arise, and neither is it all that difficult to let the tensions between population groups escalate. Unfortunately, there are quite a few people and groups in Indonesia who stand to gain from an escalation in tension between regional population groups, causing the government in Jakarta to become destabilised. This whole situation has now led to hundreds of killings, and tens of thousands of refugees, in addition to more than a million internal refugees which Indonesia was already grappling with. It is a huge problem, which is threatening to get the better of the Indonesian government.</p>
<p class="contents">In our resolution, we call on the European Commission to address the Indonesian government in a bid to halt these brutalities, and we urge the Commission to implement this resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Were it to disintegrate, the implications for its neighbours would be catastrophic.</p>
<p class="contents">I was there two weeks ago. It is a young democracy emerging from the oppressive years of Suharto. Habibi gave it press freedom, which is surviving, Wahid came in as symbol of the drive against fraud and corruption and there are still high hopes of his policy of devolution. He is under pressure from Parliament and street demonstrators and those ambitious to replace him.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the benefits of dictatorship, of course, is often that the lid is kept on social, religious and racial tensions. Sadly the end of dictatorship so often opens the box and releases these ills. Timor, Moluccas, Aceh, Papua and now Borneo-Kalimantan all show this. The situation in parts of Kalimantan is intolerable and I back this motion totally.

If you do start to think about it, then you make a mistake. These are revealing words, with a double meaning, spoken by a German businessman working for the regime of President Saparmurat Niyazov, the Leader of the Turkmen people.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkmenistan, a republic in Central Asia, is blessed with generous oil and gas reserves. No wonder that the Head of State, Mr Niyazov, has promised his people an ‘Altyn Asyr’, a golden era.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Turkmenbashi, the pet name for the country’s great leader, has no intention of keeping his promise. Quite the reverse, in fact! President Niyazov has spared neither cost nor effort to glorify his own persona in the form of prestigious constructions. For example, word has it that every street corner in the capital, Ashgabat is adorned with a bust of Turkmenbashi in gold and bronze, while the ordinary citizen is somehow having to survive in a society overrun by corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">What is also shocking is the complete neglect of the national health care system and of education by Niyazov's regime. Examples of this are the decisions by the powers that be to close down hospitals in the provinces, and the imminent resignation of thousands of teachers, despite overcrowded classrooms.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkmenbashi’s megalomania and mismanagement have instilled a general climate of fear in the country. Whoever dares to speak up is immediately imprisoned for years. It is the frank belief of a Turkmen lecturer, who for obvious reasons prefers to remain anonymous, that human rights count for nothing at all in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of his fellow-sufferers avoid frank discussions about the abject conditions in their home country. In the final analysis, Turkmenistan’s political leaders are just as much at the mercy of Turkmenbashi Niyazov. In front of running cameras, the President brings shame on ministers in public, and sacks them at will.</p>
<p class="contents">As a former communist, President Niyazov has a great affinity with Sunni Muslims – he has already completed the pilgrimage to Mecca – and the Eastern Orthodox Church. Members of other religious communities in the country, on the other hand, are liable to downright persecution, which is completely at odds with their constitutional right to freedom of religion.</p>
<p class="contents">The present joint resolution asks, in this connection, for special attention to be given to the position of the condemned Baptist minister Shagildy Atakov. According to the latest reports, this prisoner is said, because of his faith, to be in a prison hospital in the town of Mary, where he is being administered highly infectious and tranquillising injections. I therefore also call on the Commission to obtain information about Shagildy Atakov and to intervene with the Turkmen authorities on his behalf.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Netherlands, the Protestant churches held a prayer day yesterday. There is no doubt that the Turkmen Christians, as well as the entire Turkmen population, were placed before God on that occasion. In that spirit, due to Man being a Creation of God, we would ask the Council and Commission to employ all diplomatic means in order to improve the situation in Turkmenistan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maat (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, as rapporteur for a new Interim Agreement between the European Union and Turkmenistan, and having consulted the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I have delayed the parliamentary discussion, despite the hesitant go-ahead received from our Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy. The reasons for my action were that democracy is increasingly becoming a sham, and that there is even a president who has had himself appointed for life. There is no political will for reform in Turkmenistan, as that country is riding roughshod over human rights, especially the rights of religious minorities, both Islam and Christian. Additionally, the proper implementation of European-funded TACIS projects is being frustrated by poor management and by a lack of adequate information and sound financial accountability.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, it is only natural that all fledgling democracies will struggle at first, but riding roughshod over human rights cannot be tolerated and cannot be reconciled with a new Interim Agreement between the European Union and Turkmenistan. As MEP and rapporteur, I warmly recommend the urgency declaration to my fellow MEPs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I shall start with Zimbabwe. In 1999, the Commission took steps to re-orientate its cooperation with Zimbabwe in favour of social sector actions – health, education and AIDS, democracy and support to civil society. The Commission and the Member States have opted for confidential political dialogue under Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement in order to influence the Zimbabwean government and to seek improvements in respect for the fundamental principles of human rights, democracy and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">Sanctions are not considered appropriate at this stage. The Commission believes that sanctions should be kept as a last resort to discourage major setbacks such as the suspension of the constitution or the cancellation of the 2002 presidential elections. While President Mugabe is closely associated with these undesirable events, his public demonisation is counterproductive since it encourages support for him by dissenting factions in Zimbabwe African National Union/Patriotic Front and by neighbouring states.</p>
<p class="contents">Overemphasis on the plight of whites risks encouraging a revival of the independence theme supported by many blacks in Zimbabwe and in southern Africa. It neglects the plight of many very poor black people in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on trans-nationally abducted children: the Commission shares the concerns expressed by the honourable Members in the case of international child abductions, often by one of the child's parents. Within the Community the Brussels II regulation entered into force on 1 March this year. This regulation sets out rules on jurisdiction, automatic recognition and simplified enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and matters of parental responsibility for children of both spouses. Therefore custodial decisions at the time of divorce taken in the Member States in accordance with Brussels II can now be enforced throughout the Community. Admittedly the regulation does not go far enough in that it is limited to custodial decisions for the children of both spouses taken at the time of divorce.</p>
<p class="contents">Later this month, the Commission plans to present a working document on the mutual recognition of decisions on parental responsibility, to be followed by a proposal for a regulation extending the scope of the Brussels II regulation to cover all children and situations.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as cases that transcend the borders of the Community are concerned, the Commission also supports the ratification, or the correct application, of the 1980 Hague Convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction, which is indeed a very valuable instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">On Cabinda: the Commission agrees and deplores the situation of the eight European citizens who have been kidnapped in Cabinda. The Commission hopes that a solution can be rapidly found to allow them to regain their freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">On Kalimantan in Indonesia: the Commission shares the honourable Members' concerns about the conflict in Kalimantan, which resulted in injury and serious loss of life. Clearly several factors have influenced the outbreak of violence and massacre: a decade-old and badly implemented policy of trans-migration, genuine poverty in some parts of the area, misadministration and provocateurs who, for reasons we may only speculate about, create the violence.</p>
<p class="contents">To address the poverty in this region, the Commission has in place development projects in southern and eastern Kalimantan, which include support for sustainable management of tropical forests. The Indonesian leadership currently faces some extremely difficult policy choices. They must establish temporary shelter for the refugees in Kalimantan. However, they also need to consider whether to assist those who want to leave Kalimantan permanently and return to Madura. They must also show determination to restore law and order and pursue the perpetrators. Failure to do so would send bad signals about the commitment of the Indonesian leadership to the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is closely following the situation and would stand ready to assist if the situation justified it. However, our current assessment is that most of the 50 000 refugees intend to return to their place of origin – Madura – where they have families who will be able to support them.</p>
<p class="contents">On Turkmenistan: the Commission is fully aware of the case of Mr Atakov, a Baptist pastor, who was sentenced to four years' imprisonment. It supported the EU démarche in Ashgabat by the EU Presidency and the Member States in February this year, asking for the release of Mr Atakov. The Commission has expressed concerns about the human rights situation in Turkmenistan. It supported the EU presidency démarche earlier this year in order to release Mr Primukuli Tanrykuliev and Mr Nurberdy Nurmamedov. The release of these two prisoners was ordered by President Niyazov later in an amnesty allowing the release of 12 000 prisoners. The Commission fully supports Parliament's resolutions. External pressure has to be maintained to achieve results in the fight for human rights and freedom of religion in Turkmenistan.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to Mr Staes’s question about assistance through TACIS, I would add that EU assistance provided through the TACIS programme is mainly oriented towards agricultural development, which directly benefits the population. In addition, the Commission develops TACIS democracy projects mostly through local NGOs in order to enhance civil society. As requested, I will refer this to Mr Nielson and Mr Patten for further action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
