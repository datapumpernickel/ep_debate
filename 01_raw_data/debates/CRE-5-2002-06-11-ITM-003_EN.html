The Commission encouraged Parliament to give its approval to this agreement as quickly as possible. The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy has already had a first exchange of views on this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares most of the views expressed during this debate, especially as far as the human rights situation is concerned. In particular the issues of missing persons and access by certain human rights organisations to Algeria are worrying.</p>
<p class="contents">The troika, headed by Mr Pique, met last week in Algiers with Algerian authorities, and in particular with President Bouteflika and Mr Belkhadem, Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Pique has indicated, the political dialogue was rich, free and fruitful. It was the first troika visit since the signature of the association agreement, which opens a new chapter in our bilateral relations. The possibility of negotiating an interim agreement was considered, although there is no agreement on this for the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency expressed our satisfaction on the establishment of regular political dialogue, which will be reinforced when the association agreement enters into force. It was recognised that the recent parliamentary elections constituted substantial progress in the strengthening of the democratic process in Algeria.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of human rights and missing persons was tackled, but unfortunately, taking into account the brevity of the meeting, too briefly. The Commission recalled that a list of missing persons was transmitted to the Algerian authorities and that the Commission was still waiting for a response from the Algerian Government. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">General Morillon and myself are presenting a joint report on EU/Maghreb Arab Union relations. Mr Morillon, who is currently contesting an election campaign, is unfortunately unable to be here today, but his colleague, Mr Galeote Quecedo, will be standing in for him.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the report is to define the nature and the structure of EU/Maghreb Arab Union relations. By this, I do mean Maghreb, and not the individual countries of Arab Maghreb. That is the fundamental idea behind the report. Although we state there is a need to draw up reports on the situation of and relations with the individual countries, such as Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Mauritania or other Maghreb countries, our original idea was to try to see if we could move forward relations between the South Mediterranean as a whole, as a possible collective subject, and the North Mediterranean, in other words, the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware that some Members were not or are not entirely in agreement with the position that has been adopted. Although we have not discussed the specific situation in certain countries in this report, this is not because we believe that this would be the wrong approach, but because we feel that this approach is not suited to the structure of our report.</p>
<p class="contents">Our essential aim is to force the hand, as it were, of the Maghreb countries so that they create a Maghreb Union, in other words, so that they succeed in developing a form of cooperation and that they present themselves as Maghreb to the people of Europe. That is why we want, for example, the assessment of the association agreements of each country to be carried out within the framework of a structure that is common to the European Union and the Maghreb Union, in other words, a joint delegation, and that Members of Parliament also take part in this assessment and not simply governments or the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, Article 2 of the association agreements stipulates respect for human rights. To some extent, Article 2 is a phantom clause. It exists, but we do not really know how to apply it. To the best of my knowledge, there has, so far, been no genuine dialogue, no genuine assessment of the progress made in developing freedoms in the region, nor any debate in Parliament. What we want, first of all, is an initial debate on the development of democracy within the Maghreb countries, and secondly, a debate with the European Union on secularity.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the main problem of all the Maghreb countries relates to the fact that, in the name of the fight against terrorism and against religious fundamentalism, increasing numbers of laws and government measures have been adopted whose ultimate effect is to suppress these freedoms. The idea of the report is to establish a structure, to create a Maghreb Union, as a whole, and to form an alliance between the collective of the Maghreb Union and that of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add some of my own thoughts on Algeria. It is still hard to believe that a troika has visited Algeria, and is discussing a situation where 45% of the population did not even participate in elections; where, in Algiers, this figure was not even 25%; where, in a region like Kabylia, the participation level was barely 2%. It is still hard to believe that the troika is telling us that yes, Sir, everything is going well, that democratic change has begun in Algeria. Algeria is experiencing economic crisis, Algeria is experiencing political crisis, it is experiencing democratic crisis, and the European Union must really ask itself whether it has chosen the right time to sign an association agreement that does not tackle any of these problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We in my group are very pleased to congratulate Philippe Morillon because we think he does almost everything well, and I am therefore going to sing the praises of the two rapporteurs who have reached an agreement on a text which has won the almost unanimous support of the parliamentary committee and I hope that there will also be such unanimity in the vote in plenary, because relations between the European Union and the Maghreb and the impetus we are generally trying to give to the Barcelona process undoubtedly require a generalised political will, as we saw with the Valencia Ministerial Summit, since this process will no doubt meet with difficulties along the way.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the keys to the success of this report has been the consensus reached by the rapporteurs in order to provide the report with a strategic vision of this relationship, thereby preventing – as Mr Cohn-Bendit has just said – getting bogged down in the debate on the internal situation of any one country in the region and I therefore call on the different parliamentary groups to ensure that we maintain this consensus and do not accept the amendments presented on certain specific countries, which the European Parliament will no doubt have to give its opinion on, but there will be other opportunities to do so. Furthermore, in the cases of Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia there are various reports under discussion in other places.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the rapporteurs, my group believes that this is not the place to begin this debate. On the other hand, I am glad that there have been amendments on three issues I consider to be essential to the report.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the commitment to the fight against human trafficking, for which the European Union must provide countries of origin with incentives, using association agreements and its policy of cooperation in order to combat the mafias which promote illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, and in parallel, we must also commit ourselves to the development of those countries and therefore the fact that the European Parliament has not missed the opportunity in this report to promote the creation of a specific financial body for the Euro-Mediterranean area also seems to me to be worthy of praise.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I believe it to be essential that we develop a parliamentary dimension for this Euro-Mediterranean relationship by creating a joint parliamentary assembly similar to the one which exists with the ACP countries. I hope we will be practical and that this formula will be applied in the debate next week in Bari. And here in this House I hope we conform to our duty of mutual loyalty which the rapporteurs have given an example of and that their work therefore receives the support of the whole House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It also informs the Commission and the Council of the European Parliament’s desire to make the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership a political, strategic priority for the Union, and the Maghreb dimension of this partnership must be fostered and supported.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Cohn-Bendit is right: we need to progress from a bilateral to a multilateral vision of this relationship. Moreover, there are positive signs coming from the countries which have resumed contact and cooperation after many years; the desire for cooperation is clear from the fact that a meeting of Arab Mahhreb Union Foreign Ministers was held last January and that it has been decided to hold a meeting of these countries’ Heads of State in Algiers on 21 and 22 June next.</p>
<p class="contents">This signal must therefore be sustained, not just as regards regional free trade but also as regards social issues, the management of complex phenomena such as immigration and the development of human rights and the rule of law in these countries. In this regard, I would point out that there is a desire on the part of these countries to cooperate in the management of immigration policy, and this is important for us if we want to protect the Union’s external borders, but we cannot, as Europeans, focus solely on this aspect: we must also be open to discussions with these countries on how and under what conditions managed, lawful immigration is possible. Often, however, European governments’ policies run counter to these principles, and that could place us in a position of conflict with these countries too.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, as regards human rights, I will not repeat what Mr Cohn-Bendit said – with which our group fully agrees – about using Article 2 to introduce dialogue and evaluation with a view to advancing the development of the rights of the people and institutions which enforce it.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Algeria, I too am a little disappointed by the Commissioner’s words. I myself had the opportunity to be in Algeria during the recent elections with a Parliamentary delegation and I would warn that the situation in Kabylia should not be underestimated, for the rift is deep. Similarly, we need to encourage greater openness on the part of this country for its attitude towards other countries is still too closed and lacks transparency. I feel that we should pursue this objective through the association agreement, but dialogue on these issues is a requirement of the association agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, we will do everything possible to ensure that the consensus approach will allow this report to be effective.</p>
<p class="contents">I am going to refer directly to the issue of human rights, as Mrs Napoletano did previously. It is especially appropriate that today’s debate on Algeria, proposed by the Liberal Group, is taking place so soon after the elections that a delegation from Parliament attended.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also say that I was surprised by the Commissioner’s comments on human rights in relation to the visit of the troika, a visit which furthermore took place after the elections; I would like to remind you that our visit took place before the elections.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee for Information on Algeria is at work and will publish its conclusions at the appropriate time, in expectation of the work on the report on ratification which is being prepared by Mr Obiols i Germà.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that the almost complete lack of participation in the elections in Kabilia, the very low turn-out in Algeria as a whole and the fact that the majority of the population has not been involved and that there have been significant complaints about human rights is extremely worrying.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I would like to insist once again that in our resolution on the Valencia Conference, we express our unanimous concern at the human rights situation, we defend the need for the situation not to worsen in certain countries with which we have signed association agreements – and the conditions are worsening – and we propose the establishment of mechanisms for applying the democratic clause. If we do not move in this direction, our credibility will hit rock-bottom.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr President, I insist that the report by Mr Morillon and Mr Cohn-Bendit moves in the right direction; we will try to persuade them to support our amendments, at least the general ones, not those relating to specific countries. If over the coming months we are not effective in our defence of human rights, through mechanisms and instruments rather than through declarations, I do not believe we will be moving in the right direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to use my speaking time to describe the expectation and hope that many Algerians have placed in relations with Europe and to describe their thoughts and demands as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, Algeria has, of course, passed a milestone, shall we say, by holding elections, in which the absolute majority was gained by the so-called new FLN. First and foremost, however, Algeria is a country with disastrous social conditions in which hundreds of thousands of families are struggling for survival. Eighty per cent of the country's population consists of young people, whose sole future prospect is unemployment. An additional concern is that the acceleration of the liberalisation process and our future privatisations risk making the situation worse. This social situation is, without doubt, connected to the record level of non-participation in the last elections. The Algeria of today is defined by the citizens’ movement in Kabylia, formed in spring 2001 to condemn the repression and killing of 115 young people, is still active in Algeria. It is defined by the women’s collective, by the lawyers who are defending more than 150 of the movement’s militants who have been detained, some for more than two months. Algeria is also defined by remarkable aspirations to construct a society which reconciles its identity, fundamental freedoms and development which will benefit all people.</p>
<p class="contents">The future of Algeria certainly does not lie in repressing democratic aspirations, in restricting the freedom of the press. Instead, it lies in taking into account the often courageous action of many different associations which defend, for example, women’s rights, which call for the family code to be repealed, which care for children who have been scarred by violence, or which defend human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, we must revive formal EU-Algerian relations, since the Algerian people have almost single-handedly been coping with an explosion of terrorist extremism for a decade now, whereas other countries only realised the extent of the danger after 11 September. A great deal of criticism and also many expectations have been expressed by our Algerian counterparts, originating in particular from associations, independent trade unions, students and the Kabyle movement, regarding the lack of prior consultation in Algeria and also the content of the association agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the latter, Algeria must, first and foremost, respect its international commitments on freedom but there is also the question of the social consequences of opening-up the borders and markets and of a policy that, it is claimed, is entirely liberal, at a time when the Union is presenting itself as a fortress.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it would, without doubt, be tragic if the genuine democratic potential that exists in Algerian society continues to be wasted, or even stifled. The Algerian authorities, as well as the European Union, must listen to these aspirations. I support what my fellow Members have said with regard to the Union; namely, how can the troika that visited Algiers some days ago openly bring up the question of human rights, which is a positive step, and also welcome the organisation of elections, which caused a general uproar among many Algerians? Given that these elections were boycotted by several democratic parties and by an entire region, Kabylia, I feel that we should, at least, be slightly dubious. It is true, the economic and social situation of the Maghreb people is explosive and the measures introduced by the partnership to defuse the situation have fizzled out!</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by warning the European Parliament against taking any decision contrary to international law which, since 1991, has been calling for a referendum on self-determination in Western Sahara. Parliament has so far resisted giving in to the politics of the fait accompli and any deviation or change of position is not likely to be of help to the Arab Maghreb Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not believe in this solution, because I think that it is impossible to promote integration mechanisms between such different countries, some of which are fundamentally anti-democratic, several of which are becoming increasingly so. I wholeheartedly support the criticism of the Commission expressed by Mr Cohn-Bendit and other Members on the question of Algeria.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of Tunisia still remains. I think that the problem faced by the European Union today is that of strengthening democratic opposition in these countries. We cannot be seen to be demanding with regard to the extremely poor countries of Central or Western Africa, and totally indulgent, as we are, with Tunisia led by President Ben ‘<span class="italic">à vie</span>’ – you are aware that he has changed his name and is no longer President Ben Ali, but President Ben ‘<span class="italic">à vie</span>’ [for life]. This is the result of a referendum in which 99% of voters voted in favour of this change to the Constitution. It is absolutely intolerable!</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mrs Napoletano, because we have at least managed to ensure that the Commission undertakes to no longer admit defeat by the local governments in the democratisation programmes. I think that this reform is fundamental and we will closely monitor the way in which the Commission implements this.</p>
<p class="contents">I have taken careful note of the comments made by Mr Galeote Quecedo and other Members. Specific reports must at once be drafted on each country, particularly Algeria and Tunisia. Mr Cohn-Bendit undertook to do this in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. I note that the Group of the European People’s Party agrees with the position adopted. Mr Esteve’s comments lead me to believe that he also agrees with this. I therefore feel that the calendar of the Committee on Foreign Affairs must include the reports on each of these countries which, I reiterate, differ greatly from one another, because most of them have very little democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Last year, more than 100 000 Maghreb citizens tried to enter the European Union illegally. The differences in economic growth and wealth and the democratic differential between the European Union and the Maghreb is increasing. The gulf is widening.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the most recent political processes in the European Union are demonstrating the extent to which this tragedy of the mass exodus of population leads to greater social and political upheaval, with the risk that this may lead to a growth in populism and the extreme right.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not have much time left to reverse this trend and it seems to me that neither the Council nor the Commission realise how extremely serious the problems relating to the development prospects of the Maghreb and the countries of the South and East of the Mediterranean in general are. There is not much time left, perhaps a decade, but not much more.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament had expressed the view that Euro-Mediterranean policy should be the top priority of the European Union’s external policy.

<p class="contents">However, despite the work done, our group cannot vote in favour of the report because certain elements we consider to be important are lacking and this could be corrected. One of them relates to the respect the European Parliament must show for international law. The European Parliament draws up laws and directives and therefore its relationship with the UN must be one of respect and support. We are therefore concerned about the fact that a crucial issue such as the holding of a self-determination referendum for the Saharaoui people is not suitably dealt with in this report. This would mean guaranteeing and promoting greater democratic respect in that region, both for the countries of the Maghreb and in their relations with the European Union. We are therefore presenting an amendment in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue, which is also very important, and which is partly included in the report, is the recognition that our influence and participation in the economic development of the Maghreb is contradictory. We are investing and increasing trade and, nevertheless, the consequence of that investment is that the rationalisation of the countryside, and that of trade and services, is creating more unemployment and depriving young people of their future prospects, which is leading to an increase in emigration, which is horrendous but understandable.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the fact that this report does not adequately deal with this crucial phenomenon is a shortcoming which must be corrected, together with others which relate to improving democratic conditions, as other speakers have already said. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There has recently been an extremely serious incident in these very countries in which a Jewish religious building was damaged, and this should have been mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we cannot continue to maintain the populist stance that opening up our borders is a way to help these countries in future. Exactly the opposite is true: if anything, the solution is to set up effective measures in fields such as small and medium-sized enterprise and European craft trades in these countries, but such measures are not receiving support. Therefore, we oppose the indiscriminate opening up of our borders to immigration but we would like, if we may, to stress a fundamental point, namely that the Maghreb countries must undertake to take back the illegal immigrants which the Member States are labouring to repatriate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fate of thousands of Western Saharan men, women and children is at stake, people who, for 26 years, have been living in extremely harsh conditions and are awaiting a solution that recognises their rights and their dignity. To resolve the situation, a good-will agreement must firstly be reached between the main countries that are directly involved, namely Algeria and Morocco.

<p class="contents">We all have an interest in there being a constructive relationship between the European Union and the Arab Maghreb Union, but surely that constructive relationship must be based on a whole range of aspects, including political ones.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Union wishes to act correctly on an international level, that action must be based on conflict prevention and crisis management and regrettably there is an historic conflict in the Maghreb region involving several countries and peoples which has not gone away: the Sahara conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">The positive thing about the report presented by Mr Morillon and Mr Cohn-Bendit is firstly that it acknowledges the existence of that conflict, something which the European Union had not done for many years. This conflict was not on the Union’s agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">This conflict must now appear on that agenda as a priority so that we can contribute, on the basis of international law, to the quest for a fair and negotiated solution which safeguards the rights of the peoples, beginning with the Saharaoui people’s right to self-determination and so that we can thereby put an end to an issue which causes great instability in terms of the future of the Arab Maghreb Union and the countries it consists of.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, the situation is still regrettably deadlocked and it falls to the European Union to apply pressure so that it ceases to be so, and to apply pressure in a good sense, because it would benefit the region and would benefit Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, the meaning of this document is, as usual, elusive. In reality, Europe says a lot but does very little, simply because, deep down, it attaches little importance to its relationship with the Maghreb. This situation arises from the distribution of power in Europe: this European Union, which is dominated by the northern countries – and, what is more, the list of speakers this morning shows this very clearly – is somewhat indifferent towards the Mediterranean. It could also be due to the fact that, for certain Atlantic interests, it is important that the Mediterranean does not become an autonomous framework for cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">We talk about it, but we almost always talk about it from the point of view of human rights. That is a way of not talking about it and, what is more, I would point out in passing, allowing ourselves to be used by an opposition which is never asked to justify itself with regard to democracy. This being the case, our Maghreb neighbours need not fear: France will do what Europe does not. France will do it because of its history, its natural inclination, its interest, and also because it naturally cooperates with the Maghreb countries as part of the French-speaking community and also, in quite a broad context, as part of the community of French-speaking culture. I do not think that Europe’s lack of concern about the Mediterranean matters much. In fact, it is better for it not to be concerned, for France will implement a policy dictated by the historical and geographical context, even if, for now, its politics and Eurocentric perspective tend to somewhat hinder its actions in this field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Regional development cooperation with a grouping such as the Arab Maghreb Union is entirely in keeping with the policy guidelines formulated by the Euro-Mediterranean foreign ministers at their summit in Valencia on 22 and 23 April.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to seven newly signed association agreements, North-South cooperation between the EU and its Mediterranean partners now has a proper legal and economic framework. An agreement will be signed with Lebanon on 17 June and negotiations with Syria are continuing. Once these are finalised, the whole set of association agreements between the EU and Barcelona Process partners will be completed.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is something more we have to do if we want to put this on a really solid footing. We have to persuade our partners to engage in South-South cooperation. That point was made again at Valencia. It was made in the decisions on trade taken by the Barcelona Process trade ministers when they met in Toledo on 19 March. The same issues were also raised at the meeting of the industry ministers which I attended a week later.</p>
<p class="contents">This decision sets out to facilitate trade and investment amongst the countries of the southern Mediterranean. Working parties will look in detail at how this closer regional cooperation will function. From a more general political point of view, the Commission welcomes more frequent meetings between the Arab Maghreb Union countries and looks forward to an AMU summit in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another initiative that the Commission wants to encourage: the Agadir Declaration of 8 May 2001 in which four Arab countries – Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt and Jordan – proposed the setting up of a free trade area. The Commission hopes that other countries in the region will join this initiative. In addition to political support the Commission is willing to provide technical assistance, not just for the AMU but also for the Agadir Declaration.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two additional points I would like to make on the report. As far as democracy and human rights are concerned, the Commission obviously shares the view put forward in the draft resolution on the importance of respecting the provisions of the association agreement. In this respect, sustained action is needed by the EU institutions to improve the situation. The Commission is currently planning programmes in Algeria and Tunisia through MEDA and the European initiative for democracy and human rights, and will continue to do so independently.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to financial cooperation the Commission is fully aware of the importance of covering the regional dimension. Ten per cent of funds available under the MEDA programme will be earmarked for regional measures. Some of these resources could be dedicated to fund intra-Maghreb cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I will pass on the message from the debate to Mr Patten, who is responsible for this dossier. Unfortunately he is on mission today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
