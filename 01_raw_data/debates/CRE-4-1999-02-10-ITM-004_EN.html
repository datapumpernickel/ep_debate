<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Gutiérrez Díaz </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL), </span><span class="italic"> rapporteur. – (ES)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this House is today considering the report on strengthening the Union's institutions with a view to establishing an area of democracy and liberty. This report is the result of the contributions from the Committee on Institutional Affairs and includes the valuable opinion by the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, which Mr Goerens drafted.</p>
<p class="contents">The initial consideration of this issue stemmed from the contributions by Mr Herzog, whom I replaced as rapporteur. In replacing him, I hoped to be able to complete the definitive version of the report we are considering today, which takes account of the debates held and includes most of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Institutional Affairs designed to increase the involvement of the general public and social players in the operation of the European Union"s institutional system.</p>
<p class="contents">The key aspect of the report is based on the belief that it will not be possible to construct a democratic Europe unless its citizens are recognised not only as being the direct beneficiaries of the integration process, but also – and perhaps, fundamentally – as subjects who actively help to formulate common objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite its inadequacies, the Treaty of Amsterdam does offer us some new elements that strengthen the guarantees provided at European level for the respect of fundamental rights. It also reinforces the social dimension of European integration by coordinating national employment policies and incorporating the requisite legal bases for the formulation of European social legislation. Finally, it enhances the free movement of persons.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, this should all be brought together within an overall plan for a European area of freedom and democracy built on strong foundations. To construct such an area, we will need to specify the common objectives of European society, to upgrade the rights accorded to Europe"s citizens, to reinforce the rights of minorities, to determine the legal instruments for the implementation of such rights, and to provide for citizens to participate in the creation and enrichment of this area. The report sets out three major objectives here: freedom of movement, social rights and European citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards freedom of movement, I would like to point out, in particular, that security and justice must be accompanied by the necessary democratic and judicial guarantees.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as social rights are concerned, the concept of European integration is based on solidarity between the Member States. As a result, enlargement to embrace the countries of Central and Eastern Europe should not be regarded as an extension of the internal market but as a duty imposed by the requirements of solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards European citizenship, I would like to highlight the final proposal in the report that calls for the Treaty to bring all the rights conferred on citizens within the ambit of a specific title.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that if we approve this report by a wide majority, we will be contributing to the much‐needed construction and reinforcement of an area of democracy and liberty within the Union. I would therefore urge you to vote in favour of this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, allow me to thank those who tabled amendments to the report. As I mentioned, I generally tried to incorporate them, except in two cases: when the amendments did not conform to the vision of European integration that I support, or when they introduced points, albeit legitimate ones, regarding competitiveness, which I felt did not belong in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to thank you all.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Manzella </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, we are indebted to Mr Gutiérrez Díaz for this excellent report. As he has just said, the area of freedom, security and justice introduced by the Amsterdam Treaty represents the Union"s most ambitious forthcoming programme of integration. And because of the way it connects with daily life in families, cities and businesses, the programme is also arousing great public interest. Furthermore, it establishes vital links between the roles of this Parliament and the national parliaments. I think this five year transition phase does involve Europe"s entire parliamentary system, but during transition there must also be pressure to start applying the community method and the codecision procedure as soon as possible to a field as vital as this to integration.</p>
<p class="contents">In a sense this programme has already begun to form part of our legislation and it is natural that it should become the focal point of the wider vision which inspires this report – the establishment of a European area of political freedom and democracy. Encapsulating the catalogue of fundamental rights and social rights in a single vision, and developing programmes for freedom, security and justice is exactly the right way to set about promoting and actually achieving the concept of European citizenship introduced at Maastricht. Indeed, this is the essential constitutional institution on which to build the very idea of a European public and political area, an area where rights and duties – all rights and duties, with no special emphasis on any one – are balanced in the European Union"s framework for inclusive democracy. Mr President, that is why we should vote for this report.</p>

That is what the report is endeavouring to safeguard. There is a great deal in the report about social rights, but rather less when it comes to establishing a legal base for them.</p>
<p class="contents">Up to now, we have held fast to the idea that in Europe, citizens should enjoy the same rights as the citizens in the countries in which they work. At the beginning of paragraph 14, however, the rapporteur proposes that citizens should be provided with guarantees at European level equivalent to those provided at national level, which in some cases would be absurd. Therefore, we strongly support the indents calling for an improvement in cross‐border coordination of civil legislation. We would also stress the need for the mutual recognition of judicial decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Observance of the Union's pension provisions is abysmal. They should be made more effective, so that citizens are granted pension rights irrespective of their place of residence or work. In that respect, the rapporteur is right. However, we should be wary of any change that would lead to the adoption of a rate based on the highest common denominator, which would in turn lead to a very high level of taxation. It can be difficult to reconcile social legislation of this kind with the overall objectives, for example stimulating employment, reducing unemployment and enhancing the quality of life, because of the different levels of development and economic progress that obtain in the various countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Sometimes social rights that are appropriate in one country are inappropriate when translated into another country's social and economic system which is based on a different set of priorities. Imposing social rights on others may lead to a hypothetical quality of life, but in reality only serves to undermine the general well‐being – this is always so where the welfare system is financed through taxation. We should approach the problem from the other direction, by ensuring that the Union has in place the right structures for strengthening competitiveness and providing a climate that is conducive to business development. After all, it is enterprises that will generate a better quality of life and, as a result, an improved social welfare system.</p>
<p class="contents">The main aim of the report is to strengthen citizens' rights, and in particular to protect them against crime. It is essential for the Union to make progress in this respect, particularly in view of future enlargement. In this context, we have tabled an amendment on the incorporation of Schengen into the Treaty. Accordingly, we should like to see an end to the Council's tortuous decision‐making process during the five‐year period with regard to certain legislative issues. What is needed in that area is a clear and unambiguous taking of positions, just as Mr Bourlanges has done in his exemplary and practical report.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Brinkhorst </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – Mr President, I should like to compliment Mr Gutiérrez Díaz on his report which covers a wide range of issues. Originally it did not quite do justice to the crux of the matter which is the strengthening of the institutions involved in the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice. After the Amsterdam Treaty comes into force that will be one of the major achievements of the Intergovernmental Conference. These areas of asylum, immigration and border controls are now going to be common policies.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this has come about at a cost. Member States have watered down the role and the competence of the European Union's democratic and judicial institutions, notably the European Parliament and the Court of Justice, and also the decision‐making procedures for a period of at least five years. This undermining of the Community must not create a precedent. Rather, it must be reversed. Against that background, I tabled amendments and I should like to thank Mr Gutiérrez Díaz for accepting them. The key points are that the unanimity requirement stands in the way of efficient and rapid action in this field. Action in the field of freedom, security and justice must be accompanied by the necessary democratic and judicial guarantees. The Council must start applying the Community methods in full.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately the Treaty must also remedy the very bizarre position of the United Kingdom, Denmark and Ireland which have opted out of the new policies, although, in fact, a country like Denmark will apply the policies as they stand but on an intergovernmental basis. For the time being – and this is a point I have always emphasised very strongly in this hemicycle – there is the continuing failure to incorporate Schengen into the first pillar. We still do not have the final division between the first and the third pillar.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, the report has now developed these concepts and my group will vote for it. However, I hope that we see it only as the beginning. We have only started the common area. The final development will take place in the coming years.</p>

Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam provides a legal basis for the action necessary to prevent<span class="italic"> </span> discrimination on the basis of disability, age or gender, among others. How much weight Article 13 will carry in the future very much depends in the long run on political will. Take the guidelines on employment, for example. There was sufficient political will there, and hopefully this will also be the case with Article 13.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy to see that the Commission has embarked on preparatory measures as a result of Article 13. I also hope that Germany, as the current presidency, and its successor – my own country, Finland – will be active in the Council in exploiting the opportunities presented by Article 13. Our citizens have considerable expectations. It is also important that the European Parliament has a major influence on what is contained in Article 13 in practice.</p>

This is logically linked to the idea of supporting the steps required to achieve freedom of movement with accompanying measures to respond to the citizens" need for security following the opening up of the borders. The security summit it has just been decided to hold, and which the Finnish Presidency has undertaken to organise, is also a sign pointing in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">So I regret the fact that the report we are debating today treats the subject of security in a rather summary manner and is reduced to a report on democracy and freedom rather than on security. As I find in my daily dealings with them, our citizens take the subject of security very seriously. The Commissioner has also emphasised its importance. Of course it is important to take a visionary approach. But as the representative of the people, the European Parliament would be well advised to attach greater importance to the citizens" need for security and to focus particularly on looking after their interests within the institutional system.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Iversen </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, the Amsterdam Treaty is a good starting‐point for achieving a more democratic and open EU with freedom of movement and more fundamental rights for our citizens and a stronger social dimension. I think there are many sensible things in this report. The new Treaty opens up a host of new possibilities, but whether or not they are carried out in practice depends, of course, on the political will. There is no doubt that we in Parliament will have to exert pressure if it is to succeed. There is no other way. Some decisions still require unanimity and some countries, including Denmark, still have reservations about participating in supranational cooperation, for example in the area of refugees and asylum. That is a decision taken after a referendum on the Maastricht Treaty and it should of course be respected, until the people decide otherwise. I would like to stress that it is also part of democracy that people in nation states can form an opinion on these things on the basis of how they see them, and that only the people themselves can change the decisions they have made.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur is very concerned about a multi‐speed Europe, meaning that countries opt out of some areas of cooperation, or that a group of countries begin to cooperate more closely. I too can see that this danger exists, but sometimes it is necessary, not least when more countries join in cooperation, to respect the fact that there may be different speeds within that cooperation. I also believe that we shall face such a dilemma in future when people have different ideas about what we should cooperate on, but I agree with the rapporteur that a multi‐speed Europe should naturally be a last resort. I think we should be aware that the pragmatic cooperation we need to have, at the same time as our visions, may also make it necessary for there to be different speeds.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Nicholson </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN).</span> – Mr President, I welcome Mr Gutiérrez Díaz' report. I have known the rapporteur a long time and I know him well. He has produced a very good report but there are a number of points I find it difficult to agree with. We must remember that Europe is an area of democracy. There are 15 Member States with democratically elected governments. There are also numerous regional governments and local government. And that is all the democracy we require. We are in danger of going too far. I do not believe we need further levels of bureaucracy paid for by the European taxpayer.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are areas where we could bring Parliament and, indeed, Europe closer to the people. I feel very strongly that anywhere there is a Commission office in the Union there should also be a Parliament office. This is necessary because the people of Europe can identify with the European Parliament more easily than with the faceless bureaucracy of the Commission. That has been proved in this Parliament in recent times. So, where you have regional parliaments or assemblies Parliament should also have an office. That would go a long way to counteracting the remoteness of Brussels and the European Union.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Coelho </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a great deal has been said about the democratic deficit in Europe. As a result of that legitimate and well‐founded accusation, the European Parliament"s powers have been increased as each successive new Treaty has been approved. The democratic deficit in Europe"s institutional architecture has naturally made it essential to strengthen a body with the direct legitimacy bestowed by European citizens. But sometimes this debate has concentrated too much on the relationship between the European institutions, the balance of power and their operational and decision‐making procedures. The initial success of the introduction of the euro and the resulting dynamics have once again highlighted the economic side of the Union, thus accentuating the delays in other areas, that is the political, security and social fields.</p>
<p class="contents">That means tackling institutional reform not so much in terms of distributing powers between the Community institutions, but rather in terms of stressing the link that gives our mandates their legitimacy: the people we represent here. There is a need for a continuing debate, to which the report by Mr Gutiérrez Díaz has just given a further boost.</p>
<p class="contents">We certainly want a more efficient Union, but we also want a Union that is not so much a bureaucratic monster or a complex and impenetrable web of vested interests and influence, as an increasingly important reference point for our citizens. We need measures to strengthen the rights of European citizens, improve labour relations and social welfare, guarantee genuine freedom of movement, and improve information systems and administrative transparency. These are measures that would help to reinforce European citizenship, which is so often spoken about and so seldom practised.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to these measures to simplify and strengthen people's rights, I should like to emphasise two more: </p>
<p class="contents">‐ first, the need to simplify the Treaties, creating a clear body of law, accessible to ordinary citizens, thus making European law a benchmark that everyone can understand instead of an impenetrable mass of rules and regulations; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ second, we need a charter of citizens" rights guaranteeing all Europeans that, regardless of the Member State where they were born, live, study or work, they are assured of a set of economic and social rights that safeguard our civilisation and our standard of living. Mr President, Europe will go no further unless Europeans can feel, experience and desire a Europe that is a genuine area of democracy and freedom.</p>

The answer is a resounding nothing!</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Gutiérrez Díaz is to be congratulated on his report, in particular in respect of a proposal he makes to create a special charter for the rights of European citizens. However, I have to say to those European citizens who are listening to us today in the public gallery that we turn our minds to them once every five years, just before the elections. The Parliamentary groups, in particular the two large groups, the Socialists and the Christian Democrats, present them with ideological manifestos which are utterly remote from reality and which bear no relation whatsoever to what they do and to their voting record over their five‐year term of office.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a great pity that the Council of Ministers appears to be too busy to come here and attend the debate today. And the citizens of Europe must know that there are just two institutions in the entire world which meet behind closed doors: the National Assembly of China and the Council of Ministers of the European Union. How is it possible for this to go by the name of democracy and how is it possible that, in the name of this democracy, we call upon you to vote in the June elections!</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Collins, Gerard </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – Mr President, I wish to begin by complimenting Vice‐President Gutiérrez Díaz on his interesting and thought‐provoking report.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Union and its institutions are to continue to develop and become stronger over the coming years, it is vital that the citizens of each of our countries continue to accept the democratic legitimacy of these institutions. We are all citizens of democratic countries and, as far as I am aware, the vast majority of the citizens of each of our countries accepts the democratic nature of our national governments.</p>
<p class="contents">However, at European level serious questions continue to be raised by many of our citizens concerning democracy and the European institutions. It is important that the European institutions that are directly accountable to the electorate – in other words, Parliament and the Council of Ministers – should continue to have – and be seen to have – the final decision‐making authority on issues of importance to our citizens. It is equally important that the Commission, as the institution charged with implementing European policies, should have a reputation for efficient, fair‐minded and even‐handed administration of European policies agreed on in Parliament and the Council. This could be best achieved by first ensuring that the interests and concerns of the citizens of each of our countries are made known at the highest level in the Commission. The present system, whereby there is at least one Commissioner from each Member State, has worked well in the past and should be maintained. Those who advocate the end of this guarantee of one Commissioner per Member State, supposedly in the interests of efficiency, risk the creation of a Commission which is remote from the citizens of our individual countries. This, in turn, would weaken the Commission as a European institution.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, the basic structures of the Union, which existed at the time individual countries joined the Union and which enjoyed the support of the majority of our electorate at that time, should be preserved as far as possible. Foremost amongst these basic structures was, and still is, the principle that each country should have representation at decision‐making level in all the major institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Council, the Commission, Parliament and the Court of Justice all have representatives from each Member State at present, a fact which contributes significantly to the legitimacy which these institutions enjoy in each of our countries.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Oreja, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. – (ES)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to congratulate Mr Gutiérrez Díaz and the Committee on Institutional Affairs on this excellent report.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the Treaty of Amsterdam is inadequate in some respects; it has both good and bad points. However, it has allowed us to make significant progress in the area of citizenship, although it is currently difficult to assess the full scope and implications of this. The Treaty provides us with the possibility of creating the largest ever area in which people can move and work without any obstacles, with equality and with full respect for their rights and for the foundations of the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission presented a communication in July 1998 on the creation of a European area of freedom, security and justice. As you all know, and as Mr Hager just pointed out, during the informal meeting of the Heads of State and Government in Pörtschach, a decision was made to hold a special Council meeting dedicated solely to issues relating to justice and home affairs in October of this year in Tampere in Finland.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully understand your concerns over certain issues raised by the Treaty and, in particular, the question of how to establish the conditions required for its implementation. The Treaty of Amsterdam does not precisely define the objectives to be met by the institutions, as Mr Kaklamanis pointed out. However, this lack of precision is to a certain extent necessary since an area of liberty can never be fully consolidated. It can only exist if it is capable of constantly adapting to reality and of guaranteeing freedom and rights along with security and justice, to all people in general and to its citizens in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">The definition and implementation of these objectives require democratic participation, which, in the long term, should come to mean full participation. Unfortunately, as Mr Brinkhorst pointed out, the Treaty specifies that a period of five years must pass before the Commission will have the monopoly of initiative in this area and before it can apply the codecision procedure in decision‐making. Parliament must fully exercise its democratic control in this area by continuing to cooperate closely with the national parliaments. This cooperation is something that Parliament has been building on and that will continue to develop.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, we must make full use of the role of the Court of Justice in order to assert respect for the law as a condition for creating this area. One possibility here would be for the Court of Justice to sanction the actions of the institutions if they did not respect fundamental rights. There are limits to the jurisdiction of the Court in Luxembourg, particularly as regards the second and third pillars, but these must be progressively overcome.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the rapporteur that it will not be possible to build an area of liberty unless we fully respect certain rights inherent in freedom of movement, which are only partly respected at the moment. We must ensure that we adapt our rules to the reality of civil society. We have social standards that were perfectly adapted to the type of freedom of movement that existed 20 or 30 years ago, but these might prove ineffective in the future. Equally, the restrictions demanded by the Member States in days gone by may seem unjustified today. We need to create an area of liberty like that so skilfully described by Mr Manzella. In addition, we need to realise that we will only have achieved complete democracy when European citizenship is fully consolidated in that area and fully accepted in our daily lives.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the key here is to go back to the heart of the process of European integration as it was conceived in the 1950s. We need to get rid of the feelings of hostility and rejection or even the idea that a European from a neighbouring country is a foreigner, and we must replace them with the firm belief that the process of integration is, above all, a process of solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say that I am convinced that if these principles had formed the starting point for the actions of the Member States, our institutional system would have been able to adapt much more quickly to citizens" needs. I therefore fully agree with the opinion expressed by the rapporteur, Mr Gutiérrez Díaz, in this respect. Moreover, if these principles were truly followed, the intergovernmental conferences would concentrate more on the common interest and be able to take some of the drama out of negotiations that are so important for the continuation of the process of European integration. At the same time, we would move towards a Union that is more closely linked, that has a greater sense of solidarity and that is more in tune with the concerns and needs of its citizens.</p>
