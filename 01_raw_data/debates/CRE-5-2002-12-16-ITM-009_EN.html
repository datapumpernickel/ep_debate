<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Langenhagen (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, it was not automatic that this House should decide to debate the Socrates and ‘Youth for Europe’ Community action programmes here today.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the case that our new Rules of Procedure state that a topic adopted unanimously by a committee no longer needs to be discussed in plenary, and the Committee on Budgetary Control welcomed my report and adopted it unanimously. I took the view, however, that Socrates and ‘Youth for Europe’, being topics of overall relevance to many areas of European policymaking, have to be presented to a broader public, as this public has had various grumbles and complaints about the way they have been managed. These aches and pains have ended up under the care of the European Court of Auditors, which details in its Special Report a range of major weaknesses that it has uncovered.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors confirms that some resources have not been used in accordance with the programmes' objectives, and that, in some cases, the goals have not been clearly defined. The necessary advance financing was not in place for certain projects, and this made the work of the project leaders and participants substantially more difficult, if not, indeed, impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">An increasing number of schools, universities and other bodies are turning their backs on these programmes, and I can well understand that they do not lack good reason for doing so. Moreover, the disproportionately high cost of administration and the cumbersome administrative procedures bear no relation to their usefulness. The resources made available cannot be allowed to simply get caught up in the administrative machinery instead of finding their way to the people for whom they are made available in the first place.</p>
<p class="contents">Other faults found included delays in the payment of grants, deficiencies in overall coordination, and the absence of real structures for monitoring and evaluation, mainly as a result of the programmes' complexity.</p>
<p class="contents">That the Commission has delayed presentation of its evaluation report is truly beyond comprehension. It is this that caused the consequent delay in the subsequent report from the Court of Auditors. That is actually inexcusable, as this involved an assessment of a report covering the period from 1995 to 1999 and it will soon be 2003, nearly four years later.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1999 we were prepared to follow up the first programme by launching a second, which was to take six years between 2000 and 2006, without giving due time to evaluating the problems I have mentioned. Despite this, my report on the Special Report and on the Socrates and ‘Youth for Europe’ programmes has something very positive to say. I have no doubt that these programmes are important for transnational cooperation in the united Europe, and indeed necessary for it, and that they supplement the education system.</p>
<p class="contents">But that is not all: these programmes are, at the end of the day, about Europe's citizens, whether they be students or young workers, and they are being drawn ever closer together, as exchanges of views, what is termed active dialogue, and targeted teaching on European affairs, are promoting mutual understanding in the areas of social affairs, European policy and the economy and are moving deeper European integration further forward.</p>
<p class="contents">In the five-year programme that ran from 1995 to 1999, funds totalling EUR 920 million were released for Socrates, and EUR 126 million for ‘Youth for Europe’ – quite considerable sums. This amount doubled in the following programme for the years from 2000 to 2006. That is remarkable. Rather than reducing its significance, the fact that we are on the threshold of enlargement makes our task of considering Europe's young people and their education an even greater one.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call for the so-called technical assistance offices to now, at last, be replaced by public organisations and for clear delimitation of competences between the Commission and the national offices to be guaranteed, in order to eliminate the differences in the individual Member States. The national offices must be equipped with adequate human, material and financial resources in order to effectively perform the tasks entrusted to them.</p>
<p class="contents">For we are, after all, agreed that good education is the basis for future economic success and for Europe's ability to compete in the world. The report lists specific measures to deal with the problems; these represent a step in the right direction and are intended to ensure that, in future, the predominant characteristics of the Socrates and ‘Youth for Europe’ programmes will be greater efficiency, transparency and enthusiasm. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, rapporteur, the report drawn up by Mrs Langenhagen, which was adopted unanimously at the last meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control, principally reiterates the main criticisms contained in the special report by the European Court of Auditors concerning certain shortcomings in the design or management of the programmes. It concerns, in particular, recourse to a Technical Assistance Office and, although this is not clearly defined, to national agencies, as well as delayed and incomplete implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commission indicates in its response to the Court, it has already introduced improvements with regard to the implementation of the new Socrates and Youth for Europe programmes, which replaced the programmes examined by the Court as of the year 2000. This is, in particular, the case as regards relationships with national agencies in managing the decentralised parts of the programmes, or its intention to make progress, as soon as possible, in the direction indicated by the Court, in other words dismantling the temporary Technical Assistance Office as soon as the Commission is able to use an implementing agency for the educational programme.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards improving the management of the decentralised parts of the programmes, the Commission decisions adopted in 2000 establish, with the necessary changes made, for each programme, the responsibilities of the Commission and the responsibilities of the national authorities with regard to national agencies and beneficiaries. These decisions also specify in their annexes the tasks to be carried out by the agencies. Furthermore, the clauses of the contracts between the Commission and the national agencies have been clarified and simplified.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to control of the national agencies, the Commission decisions adopted in 2000 stipulate that the ministries are to establish systems to control and audit the operation of the agencies, including their management of decentralised actions. The Commission, within the scope of contractual relations with the national agencies, carries out controls and audits of both their operation and projects funded. The control carried out by the Commission on the national agencies and regular exchange of information between the national authorities and the Commission allow increased monitoring of the implementation of decentralised actions by the agencies. The agencies’ financial accounts are certified by approved bodies before being submitted to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Progress has also been made in terms of the management of centralised actions. The internalisation of certain tasks, some of which fall within the public sphere of competence, that were previously entrusted to the Technical Assistance Office, has taken place, until the Commission can have recourse to an implementing agency. The preparatory work for the establishment of the agency has begun, and the agency should be operational in 2004 with a view to taking on tasks currently carried out by the temporary Technical Assistance Office as well as certain management tasks currently carried out by the Commission. At her request, various documents attesting to this progress were given to Mrs Langenhagen after she had drawn up her draft report.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite a number of shortcomings in the design or management of the programmes during the period 1995-1999, it should be emphasised that the Court recognises the European added value of these programmes since it also indicates, by way of introduction, that these two programmes have contributed to increasing cooperation between universities in the Union and in other participating countries and have enabled young people to take part in multicultural exchanges and, in conclusion, they have had an undeniable impact on young people and students.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the Commission will give the greatest consideration to the opinion of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which stresses the importance it will attach to the interim evaluation of these two new programmes for the period 2000-2006 and to the simplification of the new generation after 2006, in order to guarantee the implementation of more effective management as well as simplified procedures, in particular where the granting of small subsidies is concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to nip in the bud any tall tales about post-2000 implementation, I would also like just to remind the Commissioner – and I know this is not exactly his area of competence – that, as at 6 December this year, we had EUR 500 million left over in the B31 budget line covering education and youth programmes. EUR 500 million, Commissioner – and I would like to tell you what it means when money is paid out in this area so slowly as to become indefensible. It means that class war is being waged. Under those circumstances, the first to be prevented from taking part in programmes of great value to Europe are students from poorer backgrounds. As a representative of the Socialist Group, my comment on that is that these are not bureaucratic difficulties that just happen to have cropped up; people are actually being prevented from receiving anything, and that is something we quite emphatically will not stand for.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the giving of discharge for the coming year, Commissioner, we will be casting an eye over what happens when payments are made in future, and what will be done about delays to this programme, and I also hope that our rapporteur will be examining it with great care. Otherwise, the devil will take the hindmost – in this instance, those whose parents' income is rather more modest, to whom we feel we have especial obligations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that when we embark on a process of creating new agencies – and I believe that several dozen agencies are now being thought of to create programmes on a similar scale – I think that before embarking on this process, we ought to think very carefully about the problems we want to resolve, if an agency is indeed to be different and will resolve issues that these scientific and technical offices have not been able to resolve.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that what is more important than thinking about the agencies is considering how to make this entire matter more straightforward, accessible and uniform in all the Member States so that everything can be processed more rapidly, both in terms of payments, as expounded on by Mr Bösch, and also in terms of the concept of the programme itself. And this invitation to consider the matter is particularly what I wanted to convey to the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
