<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Peijs (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, by 2002, every citizen in the euro area will have euros in their pockets and expect certain benefits from this new currency. These benefits will not just appear out of nowhere. We will need to work on those. I would like to see the Commission communication on retail payments in that light.</p>
<p class="contents">What should we all do to ensure that the European citizen, who has relinquished his own familiar currency, will actually benefit from this new currency? We simply need to make transfers cheaper, quicker and safer. I therefore expect the Commission simply to transpose the recommendations to change the 1997 Directive, which I made in my report on behalf of Parliament, to a formal amendment to the directive without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">What is it about? At the heart of the matter lies the fact that transferring small amounts still leads to major frustration in SMEs and among individual citizens. This frustration is the result of the high charges and length of time involved. This leads me to conclude that the effect which the 1997 Directive had was inadequate. We need to go further. The consumer and SME do not benefit enough from the internal market which was completed following the introduction of the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">One solution which this report offers is that the infrastructure of these cross-border credit transfers must undergo a thorough overhaul. It appears that at present, a number of actions are still carried out manually, which leads to high charges and extended handling times. I therefore call on the banks to take all the necessary measures in the shortest possible time, so that cross-border credit transfers can be carried out fully automatically and thus become a great deal cheaper.</p>
<p class="contents">In my report, I have listed systems such as IBAN, SWIFT, STEP 1 and IPI. These systems can make payments between banks in different countries easier, quicker and cheaper, provided that the banks talk to their customers and make it clear to them that in addition to the permanent VAT number, their IBAN code should now also feature on their letter-headed paper.</p>
<p class="contents">In order for this standardisation process to work, we need coordination. That is why we have tabled an amendment which urges the European Central Bank to assume this coordinating role very quickly, based on its responsibility for payment systems, such responsibility being imposed on the Bank by the Treaty. We would ask the European Central Bank to do two things. Firstly, to develop a European standard format for data transmission. This could be done very quickly, for that format already exists. This is to replace the national format which is already widely in use.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, to create a European bank number, like the IBAN, for example. It is vital that such harmonised formats are used universally in the euro area. We might need to consider introducing them as a compulsory requirement if this is not done sufficiently promptly.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have stated in my report, this automation and standardisation process should be in place three months before the introduction of notes and coins. That would be ideal. However, the banks keep maintaining that this is impossible. By way of compromise, I have proposed an amendment in this respect which states that the banks must be ready by 1 January 2002. In this way, as soon as the public actually gets to handle the euro, they can straight away benefit from the change in cross-border credit transfers.</p>
<p class="contents">The banks alone cannot reduce the total cost of transfers more or less to the level of the cost price for domestic payments. They need the help of the Member States. After all, banks have so far been obliged by the Member States to notify their central banks of any cross-border payments over EUR 12 500, for the benefit of balance of payment reporting statistics. This notification procedure cannot be standardised and is therefore carried out manually. A very costly matter indeed which will be rendered completely redundant in one market with one currency. After all, they do not keep records in France of how many francs leave Paris for Auxerre, so why should we?</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, volume and number of retail payments only form a small percentage of the total number of credit transfers. Your rapporteur is convinced that there should not be any objections to abolishing the report duties up to the full amount stipulated in the directive, namely EUR 50 000. The loss of data for balance of payment reporting statistics brought about by this change is minimal.</p>
<p class="contents">A change related to this is that the money-back guarantee must be increased to EUR 50 000. At present, banks are almost rewarded when they lose your money. If you transfer EUR 30 000 and the bank loses that money, it only has a duty to pay you back EUR 12 500. Banks should of course not lose any money at all, and they must stand surety for their organisation. This is why we propose increasing the money-back guarantee limit up to EUR 50 000, the amount stipulated in the directive. According to the banks, nothing ever gets lost, so that can never be an issue.</p>
<p class="contents">On a final note, I would like to give consumers more options to transfer money. I am thinking of insolvent consumers or consumers with no bank accounts. I would ask the European Commission to investigate whether companies such as Moneygram and Western Union could also fall within the scope of the second Directive on banking. As a consequence, these companies could have their base anywhere in the European Union, even though they are not banks. Needless to say, these companies will be subject to the same strict conditions in terms of security and money-laundering.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this report will encourage banks sufficiently to continue on their path of innovation towards better functioning, cross-border credit transfers. But in order to grant banks absolute certainty and clarity in their heavy investment programmes, I am expecting the Commission to change the directive by return of post. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At that time we had to note on the one hand that freight transport had been made considerably easier, but that on the other there were still major barriers and costs associated with making the corresponding payments. The first study on this subject, which was carried out at the instigation of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, showed at the time that cross-border transfers of over DEM 1 000 cost 25% on average, and as much as 75% in individual cases. You have to bear in mind that small and medium-sized businesses are of course the ones primarily affected by this. When the markets between the Member States of the European Union were opened up, our ambition as Members of the European Parliament was never to create access for large companies, which they had of course had for a long time already; it was always to open up this large European market to small and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am extremely grateful to our rapporteur, Mrs Peijs, for the persistency with which she has pursued this objective for many years, that is to bring down the costs of making transfers between the Member States of the European Union. I have to stress that there have already been some improvements here, that average transfer costs are much lower than they were when the borders were opened between the Member States, but I should like to emphasise just as clearly that they are still far too high and that further action is needed here. The banks repeatedly tell us – and with some justification – that the necessary facilities to effect transfers of this kind, the giro systems which exist in the individual domestic markets, are still not fully operational at European level. A major effort is needed here.</p>
<p class="contents">This remark is not directed solely at the European Central Bank, but also at the various banking associations which we have in the European Union. What we wish to see is not just one single transfer system – which would once again be a monopoly – but competition between different transfer systems set up by different banks and groups of banks, competition which will at long last work in favour of the public and in favour of small and medium-sized businesses.</p>

After all, we expect credit transfers to strengthen economic integration in the European Union and not to throw a spanner in the works. That is what they are doing to this day, as we can see from the many complaints made by small and medium-sized businesses and the complaints made by the public about the high charges for transferring small amounts, which are quite simply very much in evidence. We even know of cases in which transfer fees for cross-border payments increased when the euro was introduced, and not only by a modest amount.</p>
<p class="contents">The monthly cheque to a daughter or son in another EU country, the cross-border transfers for books or services, hotels or trips are being subjected to additional charges, despite the fact that the logistics of cross-border trade are supposed to be less complex and less expensive. There is even talk of it being possible to reduce costs by 90%, although the financial services institutions impress on us time and again that the higher costs are linked to processing the transfers and not to the technicalities of making cross-border payments. Nevertheless, it would have been good if a TARGET system for small payments and retail payments had been introduced at the same time as the TARGET system for wholesale payments, because technically that would have been possible; it is just that there was not the same determination to do so as there was for wholesale payments.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Parliament in our work in committee, we also very much regretted the fact that the offer made by the European Central Bank was not accepted. Here, too, we endorse the statement made by the European Central Bank that one day it should not be any more expensive to effect a cross-border transfer to another EU country than to transfer money within one single EU country.</p>
<p class="contents">For years we have been pressing for the efforts being made to be harmonised. After all, it is in fact very possible to set up a quick, secure and cheap system, and fortunately the financial services institutions have now also come on board; they are on the right track. But it would have been good if we had already made use of the transitional period. The many complaints made by incensed members of the public speak for themselves, and I have to say that particularly at this time these are, of course, not likely to increase public acceptance of monetary union.</p>
<p class="contents">The political objective is clear and is supported by the European Central Bank: what we need is a European payment area within which everything works just as smoothly as it does in a single EU country. Small customers are just as much part of the internal market as major customers; there should be no discrimination here. I believe, however, that there is also more that the governments must do, and I support the rapporteur's report. At the same time, the reporting requirement for balance of payment statistics should be abolished for small-value cross-border payments for amounts of less than EUR 50 000. Samples are actually sufficient. The European Central Bank could help by creating a single European data format for credit transfers and by supporting moves to create a uniform European bank sort code within the international IBAN system. It is important for all those involved to do what the European Central Bank is obliged to do as one of its tasks laid down in the Treaty, namely to promote the smooth operation of payment systems.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission does not have the right to set the level of bank charges, but it can use its influence to bring down transfer fees. In the Union, charges sometimes vary very considerably, but sometimes they are also very similar. They therefore play a part in restricting freedom of movement in the internal market. I think that the Commission needs to be much quicker than it has been up until now about finally tabling the results of its investigations into whether there are, in fact, restrictive agreements between the banks. What is becoming important – and the report rightly refers to this – is consumer preference for electronic payments, and here we call for progress to be made so that here too an interoperable multi-currency standard for electronic purses can actually be introduced. This initiative, which so far is operational in Luxembourg, France and Germany, needs to be extended to the rest of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this report is of central importance if we are truly to succeed in integrating the public and small and medium-sized businesses into the euro area and for increasing public acceptance of economic and monetary union. We need security, speed and also low costs. Living in the monetary union also means counting on a reliable cross-border credit transfer system – this is the battle cry for the remaining 432 days. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She expressed her views in no uncertain terms. I am also delighted that the European Commission, especially Commissioner Bolkestein and also Commissioner Monti, are putting this matter high on the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumers and companies are becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the high costs for cross-border bank transactions in the internal market, which is completely understandable. Consumers pay far too much for any type of cross-border bank transactions, as well as for cash, credit transfers, credit cards and cheques. For large sums, there is a refined network in place in which transfers are carried out as quickly and cheaply as for domestic transactions. However, the private individual still cannot rely on sufficient support, a reduction in costs and efficient processing of small amounts.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to stress once more the need for efficient, safe and cheap services for retail payments in the internal market to go hand in hand with the introduction of the euro. The acceptance of the euro also depends greatly on whether consumers and companies are able to use the euro area as an internal payment zone. It is crucial for consumers to accept the euro. When euro coins and notes are introduced on 1 January 2002, consumers will start to use the euro frequently, and how are we then to explain that there are differences in its use, even though there is one currency and one euro area?</p>
<p class="contents">The idea that transfers in two participating euro area countries will no longer be considered as an international transaction incurring international costs but as a national transfer, will need to become universally accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">The high bank charges involved in the completion of the internal market constitute a barrier. Consumers are discouraged from shopping internationally. For example, they will not subscribe to a foreign magazine if the international charges amount to double the price of the magazine because of the high bank charges. In the free movement of capital involving the single currency, there should not be any restrictions or huge discrepancies. The objective must be to establish one single payment area, where cross-border payments are subject to the same conditions and accompanied by the same costs as domestic transactions.</p>
<p class="contents">That, in our eyes, is the only possible and logical consequence of the internal market and a single currency. The free movement of people in the euro area requires a flexible labour market. If there are still payment commitments with the home country, this should not prevent people from working abroad. It is a fact that banks throughout the euro area took a reserved stance before the implementation of the Directive on cross-border retail payments. Following implementation, a large proportion of the problems also remained unsolved. Now that the switch-over is drawing ever closer, it really is time for action, by banks and Member States alike. Banks must commit to implementing the existing standards for account numbering and payment instructions.</p>
<p class="contents">In this age of modern technology, the electronic highway could offer a way-out. Maybe, in fact most probably, the time has come for an Internet bank to be set up which does not charge any costs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berthu (UEN).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, Mrs Peijs’ report on retail payments in the internal market takes up Parliament’s longstanding complaint about the high cost of cross-border payments within the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite true. The cost is very high and we know exactly why that is. The interconnections between the computer systems of the various banks in the various Member States are poor, hence the need for expensive manual operations to process payments from one national system to another. This is not some fiendish ploy by the bankers, just a technical reality temporarily resisting resolution, but bound to evolve in the right direction in time.</p>
<p class="contents">So I think we should put the problem into perspective, especially as cross-border payments represent a very small part of total payments. The documents I have looked at put their share as low as 0.2% to 0.04%. In every case, it is really microscopic. Yet the European Parliament and the Commission genuinely attach vast significance to it. Why is that?</p>
<p class="contents">The first answer is that the European institutions tend to prioritise everything that is cross-border, which is not surprising, after all. But nevertheless, this bias towards cross-border issues must not mean the great majority of citizens is penalised for the benefit of a tiny minority. Investment leading to significant reductions in the cost of cross-border payments would not be profitable because it would be amortised over far too few payers. To that extent, the conclusion must be that making that investment under these conditions would mean applying the costs to all bank customers, most of whom have nothing to do with the matter. I do not really think that, in all fairness, that is a desirable outcome. It is highly dubious politically, and we must also stop giving the impression that something that is expensive for technical reasons can suddenly become free because a directive has been passed saying so. I would remind you of the basic maxim everyone learns in the first year of economics: there is no such thing as a free lunch.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, there is a second reason for the European Parliament’s perseverance. The Peijs report makes the point in recital D of the motion for a resolution, and I quote: ‘the high level of charges for cross-border credit transfers is damaging the confidence of consumers in the euro’. But why should it damage the confidence of consumers in the euro? I have just explained why these two problems are not linked, at least not apparently. The fact is, several years ago, people were led to believe – who knows why, no doubt to get the euro accepted more easily – that this type of cost would completely disappear with the single currency. Here is a little leaflet. Millions of copies of it were distributed in public places in France, not least post offices, and this is what it says in the section on foreign exchange commission: ‘in the euro area the commission on foreign exchange will disappear’. Of course, in the strict sense that is true, but the naïve reader, the non-specialist, thought that all the costs of cross-border payments would disappear, when in fact foreign exchange commissions only represented a small part of those costs, just a small percentage.</p>
<p class="contents">So now we are facing the consequences of the hard sell of the euro, and that brings me to a conclusion on this issue of cross-border payments, but also, Madam President, on the euro generally. One can deny reality using words. You can tell people stories, but sooner or later, your fudging and lies will come back to haunt you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is only right that the banking sector should be tackled and given a stiff talking to, for while the most important techniques and standards are in place, there is still no flexibility in sight for cross-border credit transfers for amounts up to EUR 50 000. One would almost be inclined to think that none of the commercial banks stand to benefit from modernising their present working methods.</p>
<p class="contents">I endorse the dual-track policy, by means of which the rapporteur hopes to spur the slow banks into action. In my view, it is not sufficient to exert pressure via legislative measures. These could prove less effective than putting the pressure on by giving rival alternatives generous elbow-room to transfer money within the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission might well want to give this latter option serious thought, for I assume that the Commission too would prefer to see a reduction in the costs via increased competition.</p>
<p class="contents">I have my reservations about one aspect, however. The demand to bring the costs for transferring money within the euro area into line with those within a Member State could well lead to a situation where the costs for domestic transfers will go up. This is certainly true of the Netherlands, where for years, customers were not charged for domestic transfers.</p>
<p class="contents">This objection does not detract from the fact that I give the rapporteur, Mrs Peijs, all credit for her thoroughness in this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Rarely in this House has there been such strong consensus on how important the report we are dealing with is. I share the concerns of those of my colleagues who have already spoken and agree with what they have said.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning the euro sank to an all-time low. It was quoted at 0.8240 against the US dollar. That is a new record. We therefore have much to do in this area but the political resources and remedies politicians possess to deal with that are fewer than those we are able to employ to resolve this problem of Internal Market payments. I also wish to thank the Commission for the fact that you have taken legal action against one hundred and twenty banks and banking associations as a result of suspicions over a cartel relating to payments charged for currency exchange in the euro area exchange rate. This is excellent work on the part of the Commission. On the other hand, I do also understand the point of view of the banks to some extent. Although we in the European Parliament now criticise the banks we have to understand that cross-border payments account for only a six-percent slice of all payment transactions, so development of this area is an expensive investment in the eyes of the banks in relation to the benefits gained, from the point of view of the banks at least. On the other hand, the largest item of expenditure in cross-border credit transfers is manual handling, and a decision should be taken quickly to dispense with that.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as Mrs Randzio-Plath said, we cannot order banks to reduce charges as a result of political decisions. What we can do is compel or put pressure on the European Central Bank to invite banks to attend immediately a meeting of a working party on standardisation at which decisions could be taken regarding the technical circumstances under which costs could be reduced. We cannot force banks to engage in unprofitable business, but, as politicians, what we can do is support the amendment tabled by Mr Radwan and Mrs Peijs, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, which calls for measures to be implemented before the end of next year, and, preferably, for these standards to be in place when the euro coins and notes come into circulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know that it is 17 times more expensive to make a cross-border transaction transfer in the euro area than it is to make a domestic one. People joining the euro thought that if it did nothing else, it would make it easier and cheaper for them to take their money abroad. We see that this is not happening.</p>
<p class="contents">This promised benefit has not materialised; and indeed, as the Commission candidly admitted when this report was discussed in committee, no improvement is expected in the situation after the introduction of notes and coins. This is another blow to a currency already struggling, a currency that hits a new low on the international market virtually every week, a currency with the bank president continuously under fire for his ill-judged comments to the press, a currency where, on the only occasion when the people of Europe were asked to cast their vote on whether to join or not, they voted "no" in the recent Danish referendum. We now hear that the printers responsible for producing the notes are threatening to go on strike. Above all, even the most basic benefit that the euro enthusiasts promised the people of Europe, the reduction of transaction costs, is not being realised.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the benefits for the people of the euro area from this currency that has been foisted on them by a political elite in Europe? This project is not about economics. This project is not about giving practical benefits to European citizens. It is and always has been a step on the road to creating a United States of Europe, a political project.</p>

On 1 January 2002, the euro will also become a reality for the public, because then we will have the euro in our pockets. Today the average fee for transferring EUR 100 to another country in the internal market is EUR 17.10, many times more than the fees for domestic transfers. In the future, the euro area will also feel like a domestic area and the public do not understand why in this area, in which there are no exchange-related risks and in which electronic payments with Internet banking are increasingly becoming a matter of course, transferring money from Munich to Salzburg is considerably more expensive than transferring money from Munich to Kiel.</p>
<p class="contents">The advantages of the euro need to be demonstrated to the public and also to small and medium-sized businesses, precisely because we are having problems at the moment with the acceptance of the euro and it seems to many as though large companies and banks are benefiting from it, but not the man in the street.</p>
<p class="contents">For me, the argument that nowadays very few transfers of euros are made to other countries in the euro area does not count either. That is a chicken-and-egg debate. We in Brussels are of course experiencing this ourselves as Members, but our colleagues are too, that we do not make transfers abroad because of the high charges linked to the euro. I am firmly convinced that if prices fall the number of transfers will increase in leaps and bounds and people will avail themselves of this possibility. I welcome the fact that the Commission is maintaining its pressure on the banks and that it may increase the pressure further with the action it is taking against 120 banks. The European Central Bank should also exert increased pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal by Mrs Peijs and myself also seeks to bring the banks together around one table, not to lay down the law, but because we simply cannot increase the pressure any further from the political side. Neither do we want any price regulation in this sector, but we should at least coordinate this. The ECB would seem the ideal candidate to make progress on single data formats and uniform bank sort codes in Europe. I also hope that the low prices will not come at one fell swoop in five years' time, but that they will come gradually and that it will already be possible to see some progress as early as 2002. At long last we will have achieved our aim if the banks compete on offering customers cheap transfers abroad. Then we will have a real market in this sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, I would like to start by extending a warm thanks to Mrs Peijs for her excellent report on the establishment of a unified, uniform area for payments. Upon completion of the internal market and the introduction of the single currency, we need a unified area for payments more than ever. Borders should no longer play a role in future. In fact, in time, there should not be a discrepancy at all between cross-border and domestic payments. Both the Commission and Parliament will need to invest many more years of work in order to realise this objective.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I would like to draw your attention to the date of 1 January 2002. That date must be considered as an extremely important and symbolic milestone in the construction of the European Union – and I am also addressing Mrs Villiers with this observation. After all, on that fateful day, 1 January 2002, all citizens of the euro area will have the same coins and notes in their purses and wallets. After the European passport, this is the second concrete proof, which will actually make a tangible difference on a day-to-day basis, that we all belong to the European Union. We therefore need to pull out all the stops to turn this new phase into a success. After all, if the systems for making cross-border payments remain as expensive as they are today, the credibility of the new system of coins and notes will be called into question. This is why it is crucial that well before 1 January 2002, a whole host of measures are taken, so that these are in place when the new coins and notes are introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will take a very close look at all the proposals made in the report. We will especially study the problems in the field of competition. In this respect, I would like to say in response to the observations made by Mrs Kauppi and Mrs Randzio-Plath, who unfortunately had to leave the Chamber, that the Commission has looked into possible agreements between banks. This investigation took place in February 1999. The Commission has sent declarations of objection to banks in six Member States. That was done in July of this year and the Member States involved are Portugal, Ireland, Belgium, Finland, the Netherlands and Germany. The relevant procedures and the investigation into the costs charged for cross-border payments is now under way.</p>
<p class="contents">In more general terms, the Commission is of the opinion that technological development enables the competition in this field of credit transfers to intensify, for competition will of course lead to lower costs. We will be exchanging ideas on this topic during the large round-table conference to be held on 9 November next in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">In the summer of 2001, the Commission will also be presenting a report on the improvement of cross-border credit transfers. That report – and I am turning to Mrs Peijs in particular – will contain legislative proposals amending the 1997 Directive which entered into effect last year. I am addressing Mrs Peijs directly because I know she appreciates a clear response in this matter. Once that report has been drafted – and that will not be by return of post as Mrs Peijs requested, but in any event reasonably promptly – I can promise Mrs Peijs that the Commission will produce legislative proposals in this respect. On that occasion, we will also be looking into reducing the implementation period for cross-border transfers, which Mrs Peijs calls for in her report. Even now, transfers take place within three days in 85% of the cases. It is, of course, our aim to increase this to 100%. The Commission is trying to exert pressure on the banks with this aim in mind. Once again, it will be some time before this becomes reality, but next summer, the Commission intends to make a statement on Mrs Peijs’ proposal to reduce the period by half. It will attempt to meet the requirements of the House.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur’s report also focuses on the declarations of statistical data which banks need to produce for each cross-border transfer. These declarations are imposed by the Member States and not by the Commission. We are of the opinion that this form of collecting statistical data on the Union’s internal credit transfers is a vestige of the past which can no longer be justified in an integrated, unified area and which forms an obstruction to the proper running of the market. I therefore hope that the Member States too will take prompt action to update their systems for collecting statistical data.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Commission fully backs Parliament’s proposals to encourage electronic payment. It is important, however, that technical and legal security are guaranteed, especially with regard to direct debiting.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot, on the other hand, endorse the report by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, because this Committee is asking us to take a legislative initiative to bring the costs of cross-border payments in line with those for domestic payments. We can, of course, agree on the principle of this proposal, but not on the proposed working method. As you know, we are in favour of free competition, but not of administrative price regulation. Furthermore, as Mr Blokland was quite right to point out, such a measure could immediately have the opposite effect, because the costs of domestic payments could then immediately increase. I do not believe that that news would be well-received by consumers who never make cross-border transfer payments.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to the end of my brief clarification on the action the Commission intends to take on the report by Mrs Peijs. I hope that the appeals you have made, particularly those directed at the banking world, will be heard. The Commission and European Central Bank are in constant, and often difficult, dialogue with the banking world to achieve tangible results, and your support in this is much appreciated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
