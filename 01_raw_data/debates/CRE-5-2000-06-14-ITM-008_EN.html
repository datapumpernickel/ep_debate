<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Boudjenah (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I should like first of all to welcome Moncef Marzouhi, spokesman for the National Council for Liberties in Tunisia, and Khemmaïs Ksila, from the Tunisian League for Human Rights, who are present in this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I, together with other Members of this Parliament, have spared no effort to ensure that this debate was held. Why should we discuss Tunisia? This is not a question of interference, as that country’s future is in the hands of its citizens. What we wish to do is open people’s eyes to the hidden reality of Tunisia and to shoulder the responsibilities that are incumbent on the European Union, which is linked to that country by an association agreement that was signed five years ago now.</p>
<p class="contents">The hunger strike by the journalist Taoufik Ben Brik lifted a corner of the veil that conceals the lack of press freedom and the persecution of the men and women with alternative views to those of the regime of President Ben Ali. No, Tunisia is not the smiling land trumpeted in the advertisements aimed at the 4 million European tourists who go there every year. Tunisia also comprises militants fighting for human rights, women fighting for democracy, students who are spied on, harassed, and deprived of their telephones, passports, sometimes even of the freedom to travel within Tunisian territory. An administrative action, which, on the face of it, is quite commonplace, becomes a genuine political fight. This is what happens, for example, to the militants of RAID, the Tunisian branch of the ATTAC movement – the Association for the Taxation of Financial Transactions for the Aid of Citizens – whose association is not allowed to exist, and three of whose members have been held in prison.</p>
<p class="contents">Tunisia has also become a judicial system that is controlled from above. Militants are imprisoned and tortured. I still remember the suffering endured by young Nourredine, whom I met when four of us visited Tunis a month ago. Nourredine was tortured and kept in prison for more than 20 months simply for having organised a strike at the university.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, in the last few weeks, several prisoners have been released and passports have been returned. In short, I would like to see the Tunisian authorities express the will to take account of the calls for democracy. If measurable progress is to be made, however, more must be done, much more. Hundreds of prisoners of conscience, who are locked up in intolerable conditions, must be released. Organisations that are not recognised, such as the RAID and the TNLF, must be decriminalised, and the cases against the three leaders of the RAID, whose trial will be held on 27 June, must be dropped.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us therefore not weaken in our support for those who are taking action to condemn a police state. The desire for freedom has, moreover, become so unbearable to some parties that they, sometimes with violence, try to prevent public meetings about freedom in Tunisia, even in France. I witnessed this myself around a week ago in Paris. Such acts within the European Union itself are quite unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore point out that the association agreement, which contains a clause on respecting human rights, the non-observance of which can lead to suspension, is not being respected today. I urge all honourable Members to vote in favour of the compromise resolution and I particularly urge the Council and the Commission to implement all the methods provided for in the agreement to ensure that democratic freedoms are respected, by involving civil society and preparing if needs be, for this agreement to be suspended. </p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, the economic policy set by the Tunisian government, which gives liberal experts the impression that it is a model student, is under threat from various social forces. The partnership proposed by the European Union, which is essentially based on free trade, is liable to exacerbate the harmful effects on the population to the extent that, as the parliamentary delegation for relations with the Maghreb noted, the association agreement is considered to be harmful by all Tunisian organisations, in both the public and the private sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore urge the Commission to review the European Union’s Mediterranean policy in the light of its economic and social consequences for the Tunisian economy and for employment there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, Tunisia is the first country with which the European Union signed an Association Agreement within the context of the 1995 Barcelona Process.</p>
<p class="contents">We attach great importance to preserving and consolidating this Agreement, and I would like to make it quite clear that, as far as we are concerned, there is no question about this. On the other hand, it is true that we are following the development of the situation in Tunisia closely and with a sense of involvement, and we appreciate the positive factors such as economic and social progress, which we do not deny, particularly in relation to the region’s situation and the role played by Tunisia in the Arab Maghreb. We do not, therefore, intend to interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign country at all, and it will be more useful if today’s debate serves to bring about renewed commitment on both sides to the values and undertakings entailed in our partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in all honesty, I must also say that we are extremely concerned about the human rights situation in this country, particularly because we are convinced that, given the socio-economic and cultural context involved, there is the possibility for substantial improvement in the degree of freedom of the press, of speech, of association and of movement, conditions in prisons and the autonomous exercising of justice, so that the country can move towards full expression of the rule of law. And this is the moment to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we call upon the Commission and the Council to support this process by joining us in making representations to the Tunisian authorities. We must not forget that the creation of a free trade area is not the sole objective of the partnership policy, nor, moreover, that the partnership does not just consist of an exclusive relationship between the governments but has to ensure support and due respect for civil society, for the autonomous associations which uphold human rights and freedoms and for the role of women, whose lives in this country are full of sacrifices and who are often at great risk and undergo indescribable suffering. </p>
<p class="contents">For our part, we must prove that the Euro-Mediterranean policy is a priority for the Union as a whole and that it is not based on the egotism of those of us who are motivated by the desire to conquer new markets for our goods or obtain cheap labour for our businesses. It is also based on shared values, on respect for cultural, religious and linguistic differences, and on policies capable of producing prosperity and security for the entire Mediterranean area. </p>
<p class="contents">Today, may this debate serve to remind us and our partners of all these things.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Is it on account of the stability and economic progress which this holiday destination enjoys? Is it because of the political links with France or the European socialists? Or because it has adopted a constructive stance in the peace process in the Middle East? Or do we see Tunisia mainly as a bulwark against the rise of Islamic fundamentalism? At any rate, President Ali only has the religious fanatics in mind. He seems to be obsessed by them. But this concern is more of an alibi than a justification for the human rights situation in his country. Not only Muslim fundamentalists, but all political opponents are systematically silenced. Tunisia calls itself a democracy, a democracy without opposition that is, without freedom of the press, without fair judicial processes and with torture and the elimination of political prisoners and their families. Tunisia has concluded an association agreement with the European Union which contains a clear human rights clause. There can, of course, be no question of President Ben Ali’s claiming rights under the agreement but shirking his obligations under it. If the violations continue, the Treaty will unfortunately need to be suspended. Would Commissioner Patten agree with me there?</p>
<p class="contents">Tunisia is the first Mediterranean Sea partner with which this association agreement has been concluded. Given its economic development, it can act as a model for the entire region, but it should then, of course, meet the political criteria. The European Union cannot allow one agreement partner that which it denies another. The Association Council must, therefore, look into the human rights situation as a matter of great urgency and draft a democratisation programme. If the European Union keeps quiet any longer, it will be partly responsible for the human rights violations in Tunisia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These obstacles will be familiar to all the democrats who, at some time or another, have sought to speak freely about their situation.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the fate of Sihen Ben Sedrine, who is being prevented from carrying out his professional duties since his publishers, Aloès, were closed down for having taken on the journalist, Taoufik Ben Brik. Furthermore, his passport is still being withheld.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the high-school students’ uprising, Taoufik Ben Brik’s hunger strike finally brought into the open, into the public domain, what international human rights organisations and some Tunisian democrats had been saying and writing for several years: the repressive police regime uses harassment, random punishment, torture, imprisonment, attacks on personal dignity, and prohibits people who wish to live freely from speaking, writing, travelling and meeting. Who today can still deny the truth of this or claim that they were unaware of it? </p>
<p class="contents">We should be talking about the Tunisian ‘mirage’ rather than the Tunisian ‘miracle’. What good is economic success if it is achieved by force and benefits only one particular clan? What good is the praise of international financial organisations in the face of UN accusations of torture?</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The fact that democracy and the rule of law form an essential integral part of our association with Tunisia means, quite simply, that there can be no genuine association without democracy. All those, like myself, who are working for a closer partnership, for a fair association and for lasting cooperation are faced with a difficult challenge: to put democratic flesh on the bones of an agreement signed with a regime which proclaims it in theory but declaims against it in practice. In order to achieve these objectives, we must use the whole legal and institutional arsenal available to us – including, of course, the terms of the agreement itself – in order to bridge the gulf between form and content, words and deeds and between declarations and actual decisions. The fact that this debate, which we have awaited for several years, is now being held, is an achievement in itself. For democrats on both sides of the House, it marks the end of the strategy of polite pressure, which has been as secretive as it is inefficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, we want a meeting of the Association Council, which was created as a result of the shortcomings observed in the way Article 2 of the agreement was being implemented! Yes, we must begin a process which is well organised, binding, and which signposts tangible and demonstrable progress: a halt to torture, the return of passports and the reconnection of telephone lines can and must be implemented immediately! There must be a precise timetable, which is respected, for the recognition of associations and independent political groups such as the CNLT (the National Council for Liberties in Tunisia), the RAD and the Democratic Forum, respect for union freedom, for the integrity of the judicial system and the reform of the press code. Yes, the European Union must be capable of supporting projects which strengthen civil society and democracy, without being at the mercy of the dictates of the Tunisian authorities! Yes, we must broaden the dialogue to include all the diverse and independent operators in Tunisian society! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has taken us four years to hold this debate, four years, because the Socialist Group and the European People’s Group have blocked this debate for four years. That is the reality of this Parliament’s position on the Tunisian question.</p>
<p class="contents">The Tunisian question is an incredibly depressing one, and it is depressing because of our attitude towards it. The Tunisian question, Madam Napoletano, is not a human rights issue, but an issue of democracy and rule of law, and yet, once again, when it comes to Tunisia, we prefer the guarantee of a strong man. We are prepared to have his son to replace him when he dies, as we are doing in Syria and say nothing about it. We close our eyes to the reality of the situation. We do not wish to see the fact that Tunisia, which is in an infinitely better state than any of its neighbouring countries, such as Morocco and Algeria, has not taken a single step towards developing the rule of law in the last twelve years, since Mr Ben Ali came to power. We do not wish to see the fact that strengthening and even, in some cases, improving the economic and social domain, although the point could be argued, is not the same as developing democracy; it is not the same as developing the rule of law. It guarantees nothing. It only provides guarantees for the despot in power.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">So what can we do? We have an association agreement that has been presented to us as a model agreement, while other countries, again Morocco and Algeria, are making progress. We concluded this model agreement with the country which seemed to have all the right assets to take the great leap forwards into democracy and the rule of law. Our intransigence – and our right to intervene, Mrs Napoletano – must therefore be tough, even ferocious. We can no longer tolerate the fact that a regime such as Tunisia’s, with all the advantages that it has, locks its citizens up, imprisons and tortures them a stone’s throw from the coast of Sicily, a stone’s throw from the coasts of France and Spain. It is unacceptable. An extraordinary Association Council meeting must be held in order to put an end to this situation and finally to do something to help, to be Tunisians ourselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hernández Mollar (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, in March, the Delegation for Relations with the Maghreb countries and the Arab Maghreb Union, of which I am vice-chairman, made a visit to Tunisia, where we observed that, while there has been undeniable economic progress, there exists a democratic deficit in the field of freedoms, particularly in the area of the press and the audiovisual media.</p>
<p class="contents">We were also able to observe – and I think this should be stressed – that the Tunisian authorities are aware of this deficit, which they justified time and time again through the need to temper their political openness in accordance with their particular idiosyncrasies and culture as well as the danger to Tunisian society of the growth of Islamic fundamentalism. They therefore asked for understanding and patience. I must say that the Tunisian Government has made gestures which indicate goodwill. They made these gestures during our visit and this is reflected in the report which the delegation has presented to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In the view of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats and European Democrats), we are therefore holding a debate which is necessary but which should not take the form of an exaggerated and alarmist condemnation, which is often what happens, but which should recognise certain facts which concern us because they affect the areas covered in the association agreement, such as the respect for human rights and democratic principles. This issue must be resolved by means of political and social dialogue, and an effort on the part of the Tunisian Government to implement legislation which will guarantee political pluralism in a real sense and not in a purely formal sense and, above all, provide the necessary freedom so that the citizens can express their opinions and the media can reflect them.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the message which this House must send to the Tunisian authorities, who must receive them in the positive light in which they are intended.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, within the framework of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, the Commission, the Council and Parliament must not go into reverse with regard to the aid programmes which must be implemented within the framework of MEDA II.</p>
<p class="contents">Education and training in democratic principles are a fundamental element of sustaining a plural and democratic society. Young people, judges, the police and journalists need to have full knowledge of the rights they must exercise and defend. This is the area in which the European Union can and must cooperate.</p>
<p class="contents">It also concerns me that Commissioner Patten, who is present, is not sufficiently sensitive to the serious problems currently faced on the southern side of the Mediterranean, where Tunisia plays a very important role.</p>
<p class="contents">Emigration, fundamentalism, poverty and political instability cannot be resolved by pronouncements and good intentions alone. We need true political will and the economic and human resources to put it into practice. In any event – and this could serve as a summary of the debate – we cannot restrict our cooperation with third countries to purely trade and economic issues. To this end, we also ask Tunisia, together with economic reforms, also to make progress with political reforms aimed at guaranteeing freedoms, but with the aid and cooperation which, of course, they receive and will continue to receive from us, at least from my Group.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe that we need a common strategy in the Mediterranean, as the resolution states, and that, together with political, social and security aspects, special attention is paid to the cultural and human dimension. This is why we need to strengthen the interparliamentary dialogue and the dialogue with the representatives of civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">As we say in my country, By talking we come to understand people’. If one thing characterises the people of the Mediterranean, it is the wealth of their thought and their words, and that, ladies and gentlemen, costs very little. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU has a set of values and principles which it naturally tries to promote in its relations and which it tries to use in all areas of its associations with third countries. Contrary to what may be inferred from one honourable Member’s intervention, the European Union does not act according to geographical position by being more demanding on countries which are closer and less demanding on countries which are further away. We do not work in this way. We usually use uniform criteria and, in particular, the idea that it is preferable to open areas for dialogue in order to encourage countries to make regular bilateral assessments of what is causing exclusion factors or misunderstandings. In this respect, the work of the Council and Commission is totally coherent. In particular, and I do not really need to say this, Commissioner Patten has more credentials than most of us on the issue of respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">On the specific issue of Tunisia, I must say that the Council is fully aware of the human rights situation in this country. It has noted all the concerns expressed on various occasions by this House. Naturally, it has also noted the considerable concerns expressed here today.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has on several occasions emphasised to the Tunisian authorities its concern about the occurrence of certain situations, particularly the lack of general freedom and press freedom in particular. Human rights issues are frequently discussed, as the speakers have noted, within the political dialogue which the Council is conducting with Tunisia within the Association Council and through the Heads of Mission of the Member States in Tunis who have regular meetings with the relevant Tunisian government officials in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment this dialogue is centred specifically on the current reforms of the new press law, the operation and functions of the penalty enforcement judge and the amendments of electoral law. The possibility of such a dialogue, which Tunisia did refuse for some time, represents significant progress. During the two meetings of the Association Council which took place as part of our relations with Tunisia and which I attended, the Council reiterated the fundamental importance to relations between the European Union and Tunisia of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and, naturally, it used the opportunity to highlight certain specific cases, some of which have been mentioned here.</p>
<p class="contents">On a more national note, during the State visit by President Ben Ali to Portugal at the beginning of May, the Foreign Minister, Jaime Gama, had the opportunity to raise with his Tunisian counterpart the human rights situation in Tunisia and in particular the case of the journalist, Taouffik Ben Brick. He underlined the constant need to respect fundamental freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">We realise that any kind of action in terms of political pressure can have advantages where carried out through the media. We believe that there is room for several dimensions to be used in the international arena on this type of issue and we do not reject the efficacy of these actions. However, the Council prefers to use the opportunities for influencing the Tunisian authorities more discreetly, and perhaps more effectively, by maintaining constructive pressure on them through political dialogue and various meetings at different levels. We do not consider it appropriate to initiate the procedures needed to suspend the Association Agreement or to convene an extraordinary session of the Association Council which would probably be reported in the media but which would have no practical effect in specific terms. Maintaining regular dialogue and continuing all the steps which have been made so far, when and if appropriate, is the right way to proceed in this context. Despite these difficulties and the problems in moving this process forward which we all recognise, we must accept that there have been positive results. We cannot ignore, and it would be politically incorrect to so do, the gestures of openness already made by Tunisia, particularly in freeing 600 political prisoners, returning passports to certain members of the opposition and being clearly willing to reduce tensions in the case of the journalist, Taouffik Ben Brick, and accepting his specific claims. The Commission has also tried to finance actions in order to promote human rights and democracy in Tunisia through the MEDA programme for democracy and may provide further information in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in the Barcelona Declaration, Tunisia, like the other Mediterranean partner countries, signed up to certain principles involving respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Within the EU-Mediterranean framework and in reinforcing this framework as we are trying to do at the moment in close cooperation with the European Commission, we are also insisting on the importance of actively promoting the rule of law and the good management of public affairs which constitutes a key area in the dialogue between the two sides of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I must assure you that the Council remains committed to promoting and reinforcing in Tunisia, as in other countries with which the EU maintains relations, respect for human rights, democratic principles and fundamental freedoms, and to establishing a true democracy with an open civil society based on a rule of law. A measured policy is, in our opinion, the best way to achieve these objectives. The Council will continue to pursue discreet but firm diplomacy and will continue its policy of encouraging all forms of progress towards democracy and the rule of law.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – I am extremely grateful to the House for the opportunity to comment on these extremely important matters. As a number of honourable Members have noted, Mr Taoufik Ben Brik's hunger strike is over, but it has had a major impact both on the authorities in Tunisia and on civil society. It sparked a public debate in Tunisia on the human rights situation in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to make it clear that the Commission shares the view of the UN Special Rapporteur who states in his report to the Commission on Human Rights that: "Tunisia still has a long way to go to take full advantage of its favourable economic context and adopt measures designed to strengthen the protection of human rights and, in particular, the right to freedom of opinion and expression".</p>
<p class="contents">But how can the Commission and the European Union in general influence Tunisia's rate of progress in this area? This is best done by looking at the three main instruments provided by the association agreement linking the European Union to Tunisia.</p>
<p class="contents">The first, to which my colleague referred, is political dialogue. This dialogue has already given us the opportunity to comment on Tunisia's human rights situation twice at ministerial level at the two Association Councils that have taken place to date. The Union has made a point of addressing the human rights issues in Tunisia in our many contacts with the Tunisian authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The second instrument is the financing of positive measures in the form of grants from the Community budget for projects promoting the exercise of political and civil rights. The MEDA programme for democracy, on which Parliament has strong and positive views, has financed training, information and awareness-raising projects for NGOs and for public opinion in this field. A programme of support for the Tunisian media has already been included in the programming of future financial cooperation with Tunisia and should be the subject of necessary consultations with the Tunisian Government.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Dupuis reminded us, sustainable economic development and political stability depend, above all, from Russia to the Mediterranean, on strong institutions, not on strong men. It sometimes requires strong men to ensure that the institutions themselves are strong and operate within the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">The third instrument is the European Union's option of adopting restrictive measures, the most radical of which would obviously be the suspension of cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that, before having recourse to any restrictive measures, positive means offered by the partnership should be pursued to the limit. There is still significant scope both at the level of political dialogue and the financing of support programmes. I would like to explore this further with Tunisia. Specifically, the Commission wishes to see to what extent the Tunisian Government will implement its promises regarding reform of the press code and facilitating freedom of association. We also wish to see if our efforts to support the desired reforms by providing funding from the Community budget prove successful. I will keep Parliament informed of developments in all these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The issues that we have been discussing this afternoon are extremely important. I know that Parliament is aware of the whole picture. Mrs Napoletano, in her interesting address, pointed out the economic and social progress that has been made in Tunisia. Others could have referred, for example, to the position of Tunisia on the sharia law. Nevertheless, there are issues which give considerable cause for concern. It is best at the moment to proceed by dialogue but, as the House will understand, I do not equate dialogue with being supine. Parliament has legitimate concerns and a strongly felt point of view. That can be expressed firmly but courteously, as Parliament is doing today.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to put the debate on Tunisia in context and to take up a point that was made by Mr Hernández Mollar and some other honourable Members as well. Of course there will be events and developments that crowd in on us. Today, inevitably, we have to give a good deal of attention to our efforts to rebuilding in the Balkans and, in particular, to prevent further social and political disintegration. It is a policy in south-east Europe which, I should add, is not irrelevant to stability and prosperity in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">But if I have to judge where we are going to face the main challenge in the medium and longer term, it would be, to be candid, our policy in and around the Mediterranean. What is at the heart of the Union's common foreign and security policy? It is the projection of stability. That is the crucial element in our policy in the Mediterranean. What are we trying to do there? It is true that we are trying to create, if you like, the Mediterranean equivalent of NAFTA. But there is more than that, which I will come to in a moment. I just want to make it clear to the honourable Member that my commitment to making this policy a success is total.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the things that most offends me at the moment is that our record in supporting it through development assistance is not nearly as good as it should have been. For year after year we have only been able to spend 40% or less of what we have committed in the Mediterranean, partly because of absorption problems in the region, partly because of our own failures, which I am keen to address.</p>
<p class="contents">I will make this bargain with the honourable Member: if, by the time I leave my job as a commissioner in 2005, our record in closing the gap between commitments and payments is not a hell of a lot better than it has been in the last three years then he can have a contribution to his favourite charity. That is what I would like to be taken as a mark of whether or not we are committed to making a success of our policy in the Mediterranean. It is extremely important that we use our existing instruments much more competently, much more effectively. That is what I would like to be judged on.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to repeat: this is not just about creating a free trade area, important as that may be. Free trade is not the end; free trade is a means to an end. The end is the creation of an area of prosperity and political stability to the south of the sea that we have shared with North Africa and the Middle East for all these millennia; it is about the sharing of values, as well as the sharing of trade. It is not about creating hub economies which will make Europeans more prosperous: it is about working in partnership with Mediterranean countries in a partnership of values as well as trade, for the good of people to the south of the Mediterranean as well as those of us in Europe. It is an enormously important part of Europe's endeavours over the next few years; as important, in some ways in projecting stability, as the whole process of enlargement. I very much hope that in the next five years we will be able to carry that programme forward in Tunisia and the rest of the region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There has been particularly widespread coverage of these events in the media, and this has, let there be no doubt about it, enabled pressure to be put on the Tunisian authorities to remedy the situation as quickly and as humanely as possible. The huge media coverage of the affair, however, has also led to some people assuming that it reflects the situation in Tunisia as a whole, which runs quite counter to the facts and the reality with which we are familiar. </p>
<p class="contents">As my friend and colleague, Mr Hernández Mollar, pointed out, the EPP hopes that, today, we will be able to give a message of hope and support to all Tunisians who are committed to their country pursuing the path of political as well as economic reform. The European Parliament has a duty to act fairly and straightforwardly with all the Mediterranean countries that are part of the Barcelona Process.</p>
<p class="contents">We are sometimes criticised – particularly in Tunisia – for treating some countries more harshly than others, and on this issue, I should like to point out that the principles and the values contained in the Barcelona Declaration, and reiterated in every partnership agreement with a Mediterranean country, are the same for all countries, including Member States of the Union. Tunisia is not being treated differently in any way.</p>
<p class="contents">This message of hope is founded, in part, upon the economic and social achievements that we have seen Tunisia make. We must, however, also respect our commitments and our convictions, and I think that we would be doing Tunisians a favour by convincing them that our Parliament will always pay close attention to developments in the political situation and in civil society in their country, regardless of the good economic results that may have been achieved. We must also persuade all of our Mediterranean partners that the commitments which they have given through taking part in the Barcelona process, specifically in the field of democracy and human rights, are not negotiable.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, then, I would urge all Members to staunchly support the motion for a resolution that we have tabled today, which, I think, provides a balanced picture of Parliament’s views on the situation in Tunisia. I have no doubt that this message will be received in the appropriate way by the Tunisian authorities, who will step up and continue the initial measures that they have already adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I could not hope to emulate the crushing brevity of this, in my view, brilliant journalistic comment. However, my question is practically the same. Why are we arguing about the situation in Tunisia? Why is there a certain crisis in the relations between Europe and Tunisia at the moment which, in one way or another, no doubt affects the relations between the institutions of the European Union and the Tunisian authorities within the framework of cooperation and the association agreement?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is a useful question to ask, because only by understanding as accurately as possible what is happening in Tunisia and the challenges faced by that country, will we be able to find the tone of moderation and effectiveness which we must develop within the framework of cooperation. There is a great paradox in Tunisia at the moment and my concern is that this paradox may be becoming increasingly dangerous. Tunisia is the most peaceful and prosperous country of the Maghreb, but also has the most closed press and media in the Maghreb. It is the country with the greatest growth and with the greatest advances in terms of social modernisation, particularly in terms of education and the status of women; however it is the country in which the emergence of a civil society, which is born of this economic and social growth, does not have adequate means to express itself in complete freedom. It is a country which is, and has been, in the forefront of the association agreements and the agro-Mediterranean policy, and which has signed all the international conventions on human rights but where, nevertheless, time and time again problems arise relating to human rights which are exaggerated by sections of the European media.</p>
<p class="contents">Believe me, I am sensitive to the question of human rights. I have spent fifteen years of my life without a passport or driving licence. I have had experiences, which I will not describe, in the police stations and prisons of the Franco dictatorship, but I believe that the fundamental problem in Tunisia at the moment is a different one: the future of Tunisia. We will only be fulfilling our obligations if we in the European Union find the tone and the effectiveness to help the sectors in Tunisia who are in favour of the development needed to accompany and safeguard the future of economic growth and social modernisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by saying that I share to a large extent the points which Commissioner Patten has expressed, but I would also like to hear from the Commissioner that he also feels a deep concern for Euro-Mediterranean policy, for the policy relating to the Maghreb. Only by ensuring that we are not in a situation where the Council is giving less priority to the Mediterranean, the Commission is hindering the implementation of programmes and the European Parliament is simply giving lectures, will we be able to find the tone and effectiveness of a policy which will help the future of Tunisia, in friendship and solidarity, towards a situation which brings both socio-economic growth and full democratisation. A lot is at stake, not only in Tunisia, but also in the whole of the region, when it comes to achieving the objectives of this task. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Having said that, I must wonder, apart from the normal, accepted role-playing that goes on between the institutions, what good it will actually do and above all, apart from the ideas put forward by Commissioner Patten just now, what the Commission will really do. How dynamic will it be? How determined will it be? What involvement can it guarantee? I should also like to know if Commissioner Patten’s irritation at the Commission’s foreign policy might not bring about a certain change of attitude towards the issue that we are considering here.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to this matter, Commissioner, I harbour doubts as to the formal, practical will of the Commission as an institution, as the driving force for European construction . What you ought to do, perhaps, is to tell us quite precisely what your specific approach will be, so that in one or two months’ time, we will not have to say that the text on which we are voting has once again become dead letter at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two very specific questions. Paragraph 11 of the motion for a resolution suggests that we will be entrusting our parliamentary delegation with the task of studying the situation. Will you be producing a specific Commission document, in order to assist the work of our delegates? My second question, which concerns the very short term, is this: a special meeting of the General Affairs Council has been announced for 18 June, in order to prepare the dossier on the Mediterranean region. What exactly is the dossier that will be tabled next Sunday, concerning that region?</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">This is the specific political follow-up that I expect, and which will perhaps enable you, Commissioner, and perhaps your fellow Commissioners too, to dispel what I called the climate of irritation where the efficiency of the Commission’s foreign policy is concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Having returned from a mission to Tunisia with three of my colleagues, I shall talk about the problems of union freedom. The great wave of repression that has swept over the opposition of all political hues since the 1990s has allowed the government to seize control of the General Union of Tunisian Workers, the GUTW. Arrests, sackings of union leaders, threats and pressure of all kinds have combined with the authoritarianism of the union hierarchy in order to subdue one of the most combative labour organisations in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">The extremely severe legal restrictions on the right to strike have been made even harsher by the current leadership. For a strike to be legal in Tunisia, the executive of the GUTW now has to give its approval. Meetings, which cannot normally be held in the workplace, are also regularly banned on union premises. Union leaders have been stripped of their powers and taken to court for having criticised the management of the trade union group in a simple internal petition. 12 of them were arrested by the police in April 1999 and spent more than 48 hours at the Ministry for Internal Affairs for having questioned the irregular conditions in which the GUTW congress took place. Amongst these, we wish to mention Abdeljalil Bedoui, Ali Romdhane, Abdelmajid Sahraoui, Abdennour Maddahi, Hamed Bennjima, Noureddine Ounissa, Chaker Ben Hassine, and many others.</p>
<p class="contents">Ben Ali’s regime is exercising tight control over the whole world of labour. The repression is not only aimed at political opponents. It affects the whole of the population, particularly in working class neighbourhoods, and the small towns and villages in the underprivileged regions. The report by the National Council for Liberties in Tunisia estimates the number of policemen at 130 000 for a population of 9.5 million inhabitants. To this figure we should add the unofficial policemen controlled by the network of neighbourhood committees, reporting directly to the Ministry of the Interior, which monitors and subdues a defenceless population. These facts give us a better understanding of this pseudo-democracy, in which the President wins the elections with 99.44% of the vote.</p>

We do not hesitate to set about installing a political regime in Kosovo which is antidemocratic and made up of only one ethnic group, from which the non-native populations, if I may call them that, will be excluded. We do not hesitate to sign trade agreements with China, a totalitarian country if ever there was one, which ordered 1800 executions last year alone – that is the official total – and at the same time, we allow ourselves to pass judgement on the Tunisian government with what is, to my mind, uncalled for severity.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that not all of the Union’s Member States have, like France, had the privilege to have developed very long-standing links with Tunisia, which enable France to understand that the reality of the situation does not match up to the caricature that some fools in the media have managed to spread throughout Europe. It is true that Tunisia does not match up to our idea of democracy, but how many countries in the world and even in Europe, live up to the idea of what democracy is according to a person who is already a democrat?</p>
<p class="contents">Tunisia is actually the first country in the Maghreb to have signed an agreement with the European Union, and everyone recognises the progress that Tunisia has made in adapting its economy and its social fabric to the modernisation required by its links with the European Union and, unfortunately, by acceleration due to liberalisation through globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say that the results that Tunisia has achieved make a good case for the country and that is why the trial it is being subjected to seems somewhat disproportionate given the reality of the situation. We must, in any event, remember that Tunisia was in the front line of combat when, a few years ago, Muslim fundamentalism threatened the whole of the Maghreb. In my opinion, Parliament would be doing something it could be proud of if it took into account the whole geopolitical context of the region instead of behaving like some kind of activist cell. Such behaviour is not even worthy of a non-governmental organisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to make two comments. Based on Christian beliefs, we denounce this ultimate means of self-defence. However, we are quick to add our condemnation of authorities which force their citizens into such extreme despair. </p>
<p class="contents">The present Tunisian regime does not tolerate any independent minds. Hence the repression which has lasted for years and is even becoming increasingly harsh. This is why I wholeheartedly concur with those who submitted oral questions today, particularly Mr Van den Bos. He is quite right in asking the Council for real action because the EU’s own credibility as a partner of the association agreement with Tunisia is in the balance.</p>
<p class="contents">“It is not a case of the population being denied its rights”, according to a Tunisian defender of civil liberties.

<p class="contents">For several years now, those who have promoted human rights have suffered, together with their families, continual harassment by the Tunisian authorities and some of them have been given prison terms. They are regularly followed by members of the state security services; their passports, and those of their families, are confiscated; their telephone lines are cut off or tapped; they are subjected to defamation campaigns or to verbal and physical threats; and finally, their relatives are regularly interrogated.</p>
<p class="contents">Given this kind of abuse, the European Parliament today reiterates its conviction that there should be no exception to the respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms. This rule cannot be flouted without damage being done, because Tunisia is the first European partner to have concluded, in 1995, as a matter of fact, an association agreement with the European Union. This agreement contains a clause which calls for human rights to be respected, with suspensive effect and provides for political dialogue. </p>
<p class="contents">I certainly prefer political dialogue to unilateral sanctions, but, for this very reason, it is our duty to tell our partners that we are extremely concerned about the situation in Tunisia. It is our duty to ask the Tunisian authorities to undertake all possible initiatives to establish a genuine multiparty political scene, and to guarantee the freedom of the press and freedom of association.</p>
<p class="contents">But what form will this dialogue take, Mr Patten? What practical and specific steps can we take? How can we make the positions that we adopt here effective? We can start by asking how things are going to develop in Tunisia. The Ben Brik affair alone has come to symbolise the exasperation of many Tunisians in the face of the depletion of their freedoms, with the press being only one of the many areas lying in ruins. There has been a Ben Brik effect, which goes beyond his individual case and in three months, we have seen a whole civil society, which has demonstrated its determination to end the police state, suddenly gain a new dignity. Over these three months, President Ben Ali has continued to wield the carrot and the stick at those who question his methods or who criticise the state of freedoms in his country.</p>
<p class="contents">Given this attitude, we are entitled to wonder if, tomorrow, Tunisia might not become a new hotbed of tension on Europe’s southern border. Tunisia’s rulers have two solutions today. The first is to continue to refuse to accept the reality of the situation in line with the principle – quite common in this type of regime – of insisting that everything is fine until the final moment, with civil society having to suffer a new wave of repression and to face up to it with courage and determination. It would then be the international Community’s task to isolate a power that would be an outlaw and to support the fight of the Tunisian people to regain their sovereignty. </p>
<p class="contents">The Tunisian government can also, however, choose the path of dialogue with civil society, in order to decrease tensions and to negotiate a way of pulling Tunisia out of this impasse and to lead it towards democracy. I think that it is important, as Mr Abitbol said, that we choose our words carefully. In any event, we must implement every measure that we can to ensure that that is the path they choose to follow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Out of all those countries, Tunisia has certainly made the greatest progress in terms of its economy, stability and social services, and Tunisia is the country which is most aware of the importance of a Euro-Mediterranean dialogue on economic, political and cultural issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we clearly cannot disregard the suppression of civil liberties taking place in that country, but I feel that it would not be sufficient or effective for us to adopt a purely condemnatory position, although we must show our disapproval. We need an action programme which is capable of genuinely improving the situation step by step, through dialogue and by supporting Tunisian society by means of joint agreements and<span class="bold"> </span>specific programmes on respect for human rights, as we planned to do with the Cards programme for the Western Balkans</p>
<p class="contents">In effect, we have to take into account the fact that countries with different traditions from those of Western democratic countries have to mature culturally in their growth towards the full implementation of civil liberties, and that this happens one step at a time, with the result that the whole process takes longer. Isolation would not pay off and would be likely to undermine the endeavours of those who are working in Tunisia to improve the quality of its democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore to be hoped that the EU-Tunisia Association Council will assume the responsibility of continuously monitoring the human rights situation in Tunisia by means of a joint action carried out together with the equivalent Tunisian representatives, and that it will create a joint system to monitor the issue which can only bring social improvements to the human rights situation in Tunisia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Naturally, we shall be taking up these violations and criticising them whenever we have the opportunity to do so. This is an extremely serious matter.

I think that the best way of levelling criticism is by means of dialogue. This means people’s real respect of one another, and if Tunisia and its leaders are prepared to respect our views on these matters, then I believe that we, in turn, should note that, in Tunisia, they take quite a negative view of the agreements we have in place. </p>
<p class="contents">I cannot find it stated anywhere other than in point 7 of the motion for a resolution of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left that all Tunisian organisations, within both the private and the public sectors, are in fact critical of the association agreement, a state of affairs which we in the EU should, of course, also take on board and respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I did, however, see a country which is firmly committed to modernisation and I witnessed the great enthusiasm with which the sectors of environmental development, land reclamation, agriculture, tourism and the construction of large infrastructures are being identified. </p>
<p class="contents">I saw that they are attempting to boost their economy in order to avoid further migration which could certainly affect relations between the Mediterranean countries and the countries which are now part of the same European Union as well. I personally witnessed cultural exchanges taking place between universities and saw that the country is regaining a strong cultural identity and is committed to restoring historic town centres, rural tourism and craft trades. </p>
<p class="contents">I noted the high level of involvement of schools in educational programmes with a series of interdisciplinary activities. And I saw absolutely no evidence pointing to an absence of associationism. On the contrary: very strong, living associationism exists between young people and women, in particular, and there is also a remarkable spirit of partnership between institutions. </p>
<p class="contents">I learned from a question that we are lamenting the fact that the local press refuses to report cases of human rights abuse. If this is so and censorship is taking place, it means that the freedom of the press does exist there, to the extent that the local press can even refuse to report any of Tunisia’s positions which do deny human rights. </p>
<p class="contents">Well then, I do not feel that the situation is so bad. Rather, I suspect that the European Union is taking political action against not just Tunisia but also the Balkan countries, for example, in deciding to provide greater or lesser financial incentives for the countries depending on the internal policy adjustments which the countries can guarantee.</p>
<p class="contents">This would indeed be an operation totally removed from the real meaning of applied and shared democracy; it would have very little to do with human rights and still less to do with relations between potential enlargement countries and the European Union itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Tunisia is our neighbour, because the Mediterranean does not divide, it unites us.</p>
<p class="contents">These concerns, as expressed here today, are not born of a colonial or neo-colonial attitude. We are not talking about unacceptable interference in the internal affairs of a third country. No, we are talking, as Commissioner Patten has stressed again and again, about critical dialogue based on the agreements which we have signed with Tunisia. It would therefore make no sense to cancel these agreements. On the contrary, we must use them to shape this critical dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about creating a common area of security, stability and peace, and that includes democracy, that includes respect for human rights, that includes freedom of the press. When Tunisia keeps insisting that we are also talking about fighting extremism and terrorism and preventing extremist views, attitudes and organisations, then I agree with it wholeheartedly. But how else is this fight best fought, if not through democracy? This is also being demonstrated by Tunisia’s neighbours.</p>
<p class="contents">Which is why we cannot do without it. Tunisia keeps saying that it is a question of economic and social development. But this totally positive economic and social development in Tunisia is precisely the best basis for developing democracy still further and fighting the fight against extremism on democratic soil.</p>
<p class="contents">One last comment: we want to help Tunisia, about that there can be no doubt. We must help Tunisia, just as we must help the whole area, the whole region. The Balkans are not our only priority. The enlargement of the European Union is not our only priority. The Mediterranean is not in the third division, it has equal status and importance. When Commissioner Patten states, for example, that we are talking about reforms, about closing the gap between commitments and payments, then that deserves our full support. But we must do that all together and sensitively. We must do it in a way which does not repulse our Mediterranean partners but which invites them back into the fold. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, the Council has taken due note of the legitimate concerns expressed by the Members and we will definitely bear these in mind in our dialogue with Tunisia within the existing institutional frameworks. Secondly, to enlighten Mr Ducarme, the General Affairs Council planned for 18 June will basically aim to secure approval, within the Council framework, for the common strategy for the Mediterranean which will then in principle be submitted to the Feira European Council. This common strategy has formed part of the Portuguese Presidency’s programme and may constitute an added value in the Barcelona process. It contains some extremely important elements for reorganising and siting the whole external policy of the EU in this area in a more integrated manner.</p>
<p class="contents">At the last General Affairs Council we made an effort to deal with this issue which has some delicate aspects given that these questions are complex and multi-dimensional. The extraordinary General Affairs Council, which will be held immediately before the European Council in Santa Maria da Feira, will allow this common strategy to be approved. This strategy will surely form an element which will greatly assist the EU’s overall action, particularly within the Common Foreign and Security Policy, in respect of the whole Mediterranean region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I just want to touch on two other points he raised. First, to say that, speaking for the Commission, we very much hope to bring forward proposals in the next few months – or weeks, if we can manage it – for revitalising the Barcelona process, a contribution to the debate about how that can be done five years after the original agreement. If the honourable Member needs more information on Tunisia or on the Barcelona process as a whole, I hope he will let me know and I shall try to oblige as rapidly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
