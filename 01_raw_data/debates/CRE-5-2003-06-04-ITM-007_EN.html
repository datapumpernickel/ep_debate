<p class="contents">Firstly, because of an apparent lack of respect for the separation of powers, in view of his public statements telling the Spanish Supreme Court that it should agree to the annulment of 240 electoral candidatures which had been legally admitted by the ordinary electoral courts, and secondly for creating a law prohibiting Basque prisoners from studying and taking examinations at the Public University of the Basque Country, the only university that offers education in the Basque language, which may be a violation of the right to linguistic diversity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In her question, the honourable Member touches on certain points on which the Council would comment as follows:</p>
<p class="contents">In its Athens declaration of 16 April 2003, the European Council reiterated the values on which the European Union is based and confirmed its intention to continue to defend fundamental human rights, both inside and outside the European Union. The European Council specifically undertook to continue to fight against all types of discrimination, as can be seen from the work which is under way in connection with the fight against racism and xenophobia or even the trade in human organs.</p>
<p class="contents">The ratification of the additional protocol to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime signed in Palermo in December 2000 is a matter of national sovereignty for the states which sign it. The Council therefore invites the honourable Member to contact the relevant authorities directly.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a Council directive on short-term residents' permits granted to victims of organised illegal immigration or people trafficking who are working with the competent authorities is the focus of the Council's attention. The examination of the directive has commenced and work will continue in conjunction with the various priorities set by the European Council, and the resources available.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the final question, the Council would note that it is not competent to reply on the methods used by the national authorities of the Member States to repatriate persons who have fallen victim to this sort of trafficking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sorry if I made a mistake about the content of the 17 April conference but nonetheless, on many occasions, EU ministers in the Council have called for combating people-smuggling, people-trafficking and criminal gangs.</p>
<p class="contents">I was disappointed that the Minister was unable to answer most of my points, saying that this has nothing to do with the Council and is more a matter for Member States. I would have thought that under Title VI of the EU Treaty – police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters – the Council could at least coordinate and give a fuller answer.</p>
<p class="contents">The motivation behind my question is the gap between rhetoric and reality. It seems to be a low police priority in most Member States. The problem is that these women are both victims and illegal immigrants, but most governments treat them principally as illegal immigrants only. This misses two goals: giving them protection and catching the trafficking gangs. Governments have to decide if they really want to catch the traffickers, or if they only want headlines about how many illegal immigrants they have deported. Unless they make those choices they will never get to grips with the traffickers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today's agenda contains a question by Mr Sacrédeus – which I support – on the violation of human rights in Cuba. It is clear that taking measures to free the political prisoners in Cuba does not fall within the competence of the Council. That is clear, but this question has been allowed. However, I firstly presented a question on the deaths of protesters caused by US troops in Iraq – thirteen deaths in an Iraqi town – and I was told it contained value judgments. I amended the question, in order to remove the value judgments, and once again I am told that it is not admissible, because I asked whether the Council was concerned about the death of protesters, particularly in view of the fact that the US troops are supported by Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I am wondering why a question on Iraq is not admissible but a question on Cuba is – although I consider that question to be legitimate since it is a universal issue. Mr President, it seems to me – because this is not the first time this has happened – that there is censorship on Iraq, which is unacceptable. In any event, I demand a reply, because I am finding it impossible to raise universal problems in this House which affect us directly.</p>

It is also known that an extraordinary meeting of the Council of Health Ministers has been requested to coordinate the 15 Member States’ actions.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Council consider that the network for epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases set up by Decision 2119/98/EC has responded quickly enough to SARS?

<p class="contents">The Council considers that the network for the epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases in the Community has provided a very effective basis for the rapid exchange of information within the EU and for a coordinated response, in which the acceding countries have fully participated.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council recalled that the application of health protection measures falls to the authorities of the Member States, and confirmed the benefits of effective coordination of such measures through the epidemiological surveillance Network Committee. It also endorses the orientations for immediate and future actions agreed on 10 April by the epidemiological surveillance Network Committee, which are summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="contents">- rapid detection of all suspect cases of SARS through good surveillance;</p>
<p class="contents">- protection of those at risk of infection from the cases through effective isolation of SARS patients in hospitals, including measures to protect carers;</p>
<p class="contents">- particular attention to be paid to air travel, which has been an important factor in the spread of SARS, notably through standardised screening of passengers leaving affected areas, onboard advice to passengers and effective information at ports of entry from affected areas and</p>
<p class="contents">- the particular importance of raising awareness among professionals and the public and the timely and accurate reporting and sharing of information with other countries, in particular the ΕEA/ΕFTA countries, acceding and candidate countries and with the WHO. Cooperation should also be developed with other partners, such as airline companies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council urges the Member States and the acceding countries to implement effectively the orientations for immediate and future actions by the Network Committee and contribute actively to setting up a specific expert group on SARS under the Network Committee to develop common modalities and advice on health measures across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council underlined the need for continued cooperation between the Member States, the Commission and the WHO and called on the Member States to ensure, inter alia:</p>
<p class="contents">- prompt and effective identification of all suspect and probable SARS cases, and their appropriate isolation in hospitals;</p>
<p class="contents">- appropriate protection of hospital personnel treating the patients;</p>
<p class="contents">- provision of guidance and information to health care workers and the public;</p>
<p class="contents">- measures, consistent throughout the European Union, to provide and acquire information and traceabilty of international travellers arriving or in transit from affected areas;</p>
<p class="contents">- timely and accurate reporting and sharing information with the Commission, WHO, other countries and other partners (for example, airline companies).</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Council encourages the Commission to</p>
<p class="contents">- continue coordinating EU action on SARS;</p>
<p class="contents">- keep the orientations for immediate and future actions under regular review, notably in the light of advice from the WHO;</p>
<p class="contents">- consider developing a general preparedness plan on communicable diseases and health threats;</p>
<p class="contents">- coordinate and network laboratory expertise;</p>
<p class="contents">- financially support research and development of validated diagnostic tests, therapeutic interventions, and vaccines.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council reviewed the situation and developments at its meeting on 2 June 2003, took note of the Commission's progress report on recent developments in connection with SARS and exchanged views on the current situation. All the Member States approved the Commission report and the initiatives taken or planned in this area. The Presidency emphasised the importance of coordinating the exchange of information at European level, given the cross-border nature of SARS. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Ukraine is an important strategic partner and will soon become a neighbouring country of the ΕU. The Union is dealing positively with Ukraine's European aims, but underlines that the development of relations between the ΕU and the Ukraine depends, among other things, on the favourable outcome of continuing internal reforms. The new coalition government and cooperation between the majority and the opposition in the Ukrainian parliament in certain legislative sectors can be seen as positive signs. The government and the parliament are working together to adapt national legislation to the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. However, a great deal still needs to be done. In particular, reforms are needed in the fields of the mass media and the judiciary. The situation regarding arms exports, including Kolchuga, still needs to be clarified.</p>
<p class="contents">Ukraine's candidacy for the WTO is an important step in the development of the country, but the rules of the WTO need to be kept and applied. Within these frameworks, policies and important structural reforms are still outstanding. Cooperation between the ΕU and the Ukraine is based on the partnership and cooperation agreement which introduces the legal framework for cooperation in a broad range of sectors; I would especially mention, among other things, energy, trade and investments, justice and internal affairs, legislative rapprochement, the environment, transport and regional and cross-border cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The ΕU will continue to provide assistance within the framework of the TACIS programme, based on the priorities agreed between the two parties. With the ‘Wider Europe’ initiative, the ΕU has made an important step as regards strengthening cooperation with the Ukraine, which is a neighbour following enlargement. Within the framework of this initiative, a clear action programme is defined as regards medium-term neighbourly relations with the Union, with a view to promoting policies for political rapprochement and the gradual joint completion of social and economic structures and increasing political, economic and cultural momentum, on the basis of common values. The competent Council services are drafting specific measures in order to implement this initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union vigorously supports regional cooperation in Europe and beyond and is urging the Black Sea states to promote good neighbourly relations through the Black Sea Economic Cooperation pact. This regional organisation provides important momentum, thereby contributing to a considerable degree to the implementation of the stability pact for south-eastern Europe. By promoting economic cooperation as a means of preventing conflict, this organisation seeks to resolve conflicts peacefully on the basis of the principles of the OSCE. The Union notes these developments with satisfaction and supports the integration of the participating states in the European economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even before the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Bavaria maintained a close partnership with Ukraine and my colleague Mr Radwan and I have just given a massive boost to trade with Ukraine. Trade and business need a framework, however.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, I would like to raise two quite specific questions: first, to what extent is the TACIS Programme being intensified, with a focus on <span class="italic">institution building</span> and training up a new, younger generation of executives to work in the government, the judiciary and the administration? This, after all, is where the shortage is greatest, and the reason why the economy is unable to function. The framework for the rule of law is not functioning.</p>
<p class="contents">My second specific question, Mr President, concerns the geostrategic situation that you mentioned. Here, of course, the countries in the southern Caucasus play an important role, although they will not be direct neighbours of the EU.

<p class="contents">According to a report published in the Financial Times on 28 April 2003, GALILEO – the ambitious European satellite programme – will be delayed further because of a funding dispute.

I would like to point out at this juncture that although GALILEO is primarily a private-sector project, and one in which we also want to have private-sector services, in a common project for a stronger European Union foreign and security policy we should be setting the course now to ensure that in future infrastructure services and information services will be available and can be purchased at European level. Up to now, unfortunately, we have not had the infrastructure. We talk about a rapid reaction force, and in order to be able to act in future in the area of foreign policy, we must be able to rely on GALILEO.

<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I therefore have some very specific questions for you. Would the Council be willing to supply the European Parliament with the documents detailing the charges levelled against all the groups you consider to be terrorist organisations? Would you also be prepared to define the criteria you applied in establishing whether or not the group was a terrorist organisation?

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Violation of human rights in Cuba</span></p>
<p class="contents">In March this year, 78 opposition figures were imprisoned in Cuba. Summary trials with no chance of a proper defence or the presence of independent individuals were held in April, followed by sentences of 15 and 28 years. The prisoners are now serving their sentences under inhuman conditions, in solitary confinement or together with hardened criminals, most often so far from home as to make visits by relatives impossible. These conditions are clearly a violation of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">What does the Council intend to do to secure the release of political prisoners in Cuba? What is the Council doing to ensure that the treatment of the Cuban prisoners improves and that they are moved nearer to home? What steps will the Council take to support the prisoners and their relatives? What consequences will these jail sentences have in terms of further negotiations concerning Cuba's possible membership of the ACP? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In their bilateral contacts with the Cuban authorities, the Member States also protested strongly about the arrests and executions. The Council welcomes the resolution by the European Parliament of 10 April reinforcing the Union's clear stand against these measures.</p>
<p class="contents">At its meeting on 14 April, the Council approved the following conclusions:</p>
<p class="contents">‘The Council condemns the recent actions of the Cuban authorities, notably the executions, the large-scale arrests of dissidents, the unfair trials and the arbitrary and excessive sentences imposed. It calls for the immediate release of all political prisoners. These latest developments which mark a further deterioration in the Human Rights situation in Cuba will affect the EU's relationship with Cuba and the prospects for increased cooperation. The Council will keep the situation under close review.’</p>
<p class="contents">The Union also supported resolutions on the human rights situation in Cuba passed within the framework of the 59th session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. As a general comment, the Presidency of the Union issued the following declaration stating that the ΕU condemns the large-scale arrests, the unfair summary trials and the arbitrary and excessive sentences imposed on numerous dissidents for peacefully expressing their political, religious and social opinions and because they were exercising their right to take full and equal part in public life.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the ΕU demands that those persons, whom it considers prisoners of conscience, be released without delay and also calls for the immediate release of all political prisoners. It is also deeply concerned at the continuing repression of members of the opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">The ΕU roundly condemns the recent executions of Cuban citizens carried out following summary trials and expresses its regret that the moratorium on the death penalty in the country has come to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">These latest developments, which mark a further deterioration in the human rights situation in the country, will affect the ΕU's relationship with Cuba and the prospects for increased cooperation. The ΕU will monitor violations of personal and political rights, which continue to affect the Union's relationship with Cuba, very closely.</p>
<p class="contents">The ΕU will continue to keep the situation under close review, especially as regards the possible exercise of legal recourse for the 78 persons convicted.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to point out that the Union is continuing to make efforts to get the political prisoners released immediately and to ensure that, in the meantime, they are not suffering or being treated inhumanely.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Cuba's application to accede to the Cotonou Agreement is concerned, the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs withdrew its application on 17 May. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">After more than a month, the repression continues in Cuba and the situation remains more or less the same, which is proof that we must go beyond statements of condemnation. These are important but are not enough and we have a particular responsibility because we awarded the 2002 Sakharov Prize to Osvaldo Payá. This is the time for us to show that the Sakharov Prize is not a nice school prize; it is not a moment of ‘glamour’ like the Hollywood Oscars. It represents a commitment given by the European Union, through its Parliament, to the cause of democracy, human rights and freedom throughout the world. Eleven of our fellow Members, myself included, have sent a letter to the President of the Council, the High Representative, the President of the Commission and the President of Parliament, asking them to work together to invite Mr Payá to come here and for the Council to draft a recommendation to this effect to all Member States for their ambassadors in Havana to do the same and invite Mr Payá to come to Europe, to visit our capitals, our ministers, our prime ministers and the President of the Commission and, in the international limelight, tell us the tragedy of what is happening in Cuba. This is an active way of our expressing solidarity, and of showing that the prizes we award here have real meaning. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Perhaps it would have awarded them a prize? How does this activity stand in relation to the exercise of human rights? What comments does he have on the fact that the conspiratorial meetings organised by the US representative in Havana are also attended by Greece's diplomatic representative? How does he justify the silence of the European Union about the Cubans being held in the United States because they uncovered plans to assassinate Fidel Castro and other Cuban leaders, and the failure to extradite to Cuba the Cuban hijackers who are now circulating freely in the United States?

However, I should like to add that, as this concerns the first version of the annotated agenda, which was also submitted to the recent meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, the Presidency intends to limit the agenda for the European Council in Thessaloniki to the following items:</p>
<p class="contents">- results of the Convention on the Future of Europe and decisions for the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference;</p>
<p class="contents">- asylum, immigration and borders, which are all interrelated;</p>
<p class="contents">- enlargement issues;</p>
<p class="contents">- the question of EU policy in the Western Balkans;</p>
<p class="contents">- Wider Europe, New Neighbourhood;</p>
<p class="contents">- work following on from the spring 2003 European Council and, finally</p>
<p class="contents">- certain issues in the fields of external relations and security and defence.</p>
<p class="contents">These items may be included in EU-USA relations: the Middle East and Iraq and recommendations by the High Representative, Mr Solana, on an overall strategy in the field of foreign policy and security, together with a wider strategy to deal with the spread of weapons of mass destruction. The General Affairs and External Relations Council noted these intentions on the part of the Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the issues touched on in the second part of the question are concerned, the honourable Member will know that the European Council has to examine two important reports. The first is on the actual application of the guidelines agreed at the European Council in Seville on measures relating to illegal immigration, the more flexible introduction of coordinated and integrated external border management, the incorporation of immigration policy into the Union's relations with third countries and the speeding up of the legislative work to formulate a common policy on asylum and immigration issues. The second report examines the efficiency of common financing resources available for the repatriation of immigrants and asylum seekers who have been rejected, for the management of external borders, for programmes in the field of asylum and immigration in third countries and for the application of the principle of the distribution of burdens.</p>
<p class="contents">Our aim is for the Council to examine these two reports so that the European Council can issue guidelines for further action in these sectors. Within this framework, it is expected that, in accordance with the conclusions of the spring 2003 Council, the European Council will re-examine the issue of immigration, the integration of legal immigrants into European society and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Presidency would remind you that the agenda for the Thessaloniki Council will be approved, in accordance with the Council's rules of procedure, by the General Affairs and External Relations Council at its meeting on 16 and 17 June 2003. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Greek Presidency has been particularly good, in my view, in taking on positive issues in migration such as family unity and now integration. On the issue of the integration of migrants, which you mentioned in your reply, is it your view that this is an issue primarily for Member States, or do you see a valuable coordination role? We sometimes forget that there are many within our European societies who want to see better integration methods employed as well as coordination. Is it your personal view that this is a matter for coordination, or is it primarily for Member States? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can reply both personally and as the Greek Presidency. This does not mean that my reply reflects the position of the 15. As you know, there are countries which consider that these issues – relating to the integration of immigrants, in other words – are internal issues. On the other hand, however, failure to integrate immigrants living, in their millions no less, in the Member States of the European Union, often causes particularly acute social situations and these often also have serious repercussions at political level, with highly undesirable consequences. Given that the European model – this social, political and economic model – is characterised by internal social convergence which perhaps is hard to find in many other countries of the world and, consequently, we need to keep it as a very basic element both for our countries and our continent, I personally consider that, on the issue of the integration of immigrants, there must also be coordination of policies at Community level, because any serious social and political tension in one country is something that is also of particular importance to the other countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The relevant work is continuing. I should like to remind you that, at the initiative of the Greek Presidency and in a letter which we sent at the end of last year to the President of the Commission, we supported precisely the need for initiatives such as these, which come within the line of thinking of the question formulated by the honourable Member. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr ElBaradi, the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, expects to submit a report to the board of governors of the Agency in question on 16 June, containing his findings on Iran's nuclear programme. This report will contribute to the greater clarification of the situation as regards the existence of a nuclear weapons programme in Iran. The Council will take account of this report when it discusses issues relating to Iran at its next meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">The question, which concerns the opinions expressed on this issue by the Commission, should rightly be submitted directly to that institution. Similarly, the Commission will need to explain what is happening within the framework of what is referred to as the ‘constructive dialogue on energy’ with Iran, given that this dialogue is being conducted on behalf of the Union by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council, especially within the framework of the broad dialogue between the Union and Iran, regularly raises the question of weapons of mass destruction and their non proliferation; the last time was on 29 April. The Council calls on Iran to sign, to ratify and to implement fully the relevant international agreements, especially the Additional Protocol to the ΙΑΕΑ guarantee agreements. These issues were raised at the round of negotiations for a trade and cooperation agreement between the Union and Iran held in Teheran on 1 and 2 June. The Council clearly stated to Iran that it expected that deepening of economic and commercial relations between the Union and Iran should be matched by similar progress in all other aspects of the EU's relations with Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would add that the Union attaches great importance to achieving global compliance with the Non-Proliferation Treaty and in the establishment of a verifiable nuclear weapons free zone in the Middle East. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Union is also encouraging Iran to participate fully in the work which will lead to the sixth conference to review the Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention, which is scheduled for 2006. I should like to point out that the round of negotiations held in Teheran on 1 and 2 June on an EU/Iran trade and cooperation agreement provided an opportunity at just the right time to raise the above issues with this country.</p>
