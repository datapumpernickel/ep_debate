<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Sarnez (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, before presenting my report, I should like, first of all, to thank all my colleagues for their amendments, which have improved this text, and also the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, who has delivered an extremely good opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the report I am presenting is to consider, on the basis of the communication by the Commission, ways of making the Member States more competitive and attractive in the international training market.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that the issue of training is of great importance for the coming years. Students the whole world over are increasingly looking beyond their own borders for the training that offers them the best prospects. Consequently, we are seeing the burgeoning of a real international market in training. It so happens that in Europe we have fewer students from third countries than the United States, Australia or Canada, to give a few examples. We therefore have a great deal of ground to make up and this is why my report makes a number of proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we must have a detailed survey on the international mobility of students, since none exists at the moment. It would, therefore, be useful if the European Commission, through the good offices of Eurostat, could work in close cooperation with Unesco and the OECD in order to give us a clear and detailed overview of the mobility of foreign students. And it is finally time, I believe, to propose a harmonised definition of what constitutes a foreign student.</p>
<p class="contents">My second proposal is that we must move towards harmonising the quality of higher education and the recognition of diplomas and studies. The European Union must be able to provide high-quality training, whatever the university or the host country. It is crucial for students to be able to start a degree in one Member State and complete it in another with the guarantee of seeing the knowledge they have acquired validated by a diploma that is recognised in all Member States. I therefore propose that the Commission continue to improve and to promote the university studies validation system known as the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) and that this should inspire it to develop new programmes for mobility. We must also promote the creation of joint courses between Member State universities in order to achieve, wherever possible, the award of joint diplomas.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I propose that a European university label be established, which would be awarded to training modules provided in higher education establishments recognised for the quality of their teaching and of the reception they give to students of third countries. This university label would focus less on the quality of the university as an institution than on the modules it teaches. I feel sure that this will enable us to help promote European higher education and will send a clear signal to foreign students.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we must also encourage the promotion of language learning. Language learning is an undisputed factor of mobility and this is why it would be desirable for the Member States to systematically establish the teaching of foreign languages in the form of modules in all institutions of higher education and also for teaching of the language of the host country to be made available to foreign students.</p>
<p class="contents">My fifth point is that we must also guarantee high-quality reception facilities. Universities must now focus their efforts on ensuring that they provide these high-quality reception facilities for foreign students. They must be helped to deal with the administrative arrangements that they will necessarily have to face. They must be helped to find accommodation and to obtain grants. These high-quality reception facilities will be one of the criteria on which the award of the European university label will depend.</p>
<p class="contents">My sixth and final point is that we must make use of existing programmes of cooperation that have already proved their value, such as the ALFA programme. Consequently, the new programmes should take account of the enormous importance of the drawing up of joint study programmes and the development of systems for the reciprocal recognition of courses of study and diplomas and partnership with undertakings, with local authorities or with multilateral organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of this report is, therefore, to urge the European Union and the Member States to take action to make European higher education dynamic, competitive and attractive. The competitiveness and attractiveness of European higher education must, of course, start taking shape in the Member States first of all. The Member States’ Ministers of Education are aware of this and raise the point at every Education Council meeting. I am sure that the European Commission and Parliament are today willing to do everything they can in order to achieve the creation of a European area of knowledge that is attractive and competitive, and ultimately able to make its presence felt in international competition.</p>

Mrs De Sarnez’s work is excellent and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy has made a positive contribution. In addition to the communication’s huge technical content and the many considerations and proposals we are presenting to the Commission with a view to strengthening cooperation in the field of higher education, there is another, extremely important issue: the quality of the training provided.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft resolution contains over ten paragraphs on guaranteeing high-quality higher education, but it can clearly go no further, given the technical nature of the suggestions and proposals. The issue of the quality of training warrants further analysis, for the quality depends on the extent to which the training fosters the human development of the young generations. Cultural and vocational development is based partly on the development of the human dimension, on respect for one’s own life and the lives of others. When young people are committing suicide for what appears to be no reason at all – as happens in the West – or when they use their bodies as instruments of death to kill defenceless people – as happens in the Middle East – we must look closely at the causes of this distortion of values and at what we can do in terms of training, understood, not least, to mean fostering human development and an awareness of the dignity of the individual, in order to prevent such unusual behaviour. This is no longer just a technical issue: it is a question of philosophy and education too. In this regard, I wonder whether we should not start to extend the Union’s responsibilities beyond the limits of harmonising rules and do more than just develop cooperation tools.</p>
<p class="contents">We fully support the creation of centres of excellence, towards a European university label, just as we are in favour of the Union taking on a role in promoting high-quality university teaching. It is worth trying to set every possible wheel in motion to harness the high-quality human resources available in order to improve the quality of training, so that culture and education become sources of life-giving energy which remains with people throughout their lives. Quality in the sense of providing tools for intelligent living, then: that is the primary goal of training. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to point out that this ‘Europe of knowledge’, which we have come to use as a common expression, has to give an account of itself at an international level. This is an important challenge, and the declarations at Lisbon and Barcelona, or what was adopted in Bologna or Prague, are also important. If, though, they only result in everything being done, at the end of the day, in a so-called open coordination that bypasses Parliament, then that is something we simply cannot agree to. We agree with the contents, but also want to be involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenges we face are great. As I have said, we have to give an account of ourselves, and I agree with Mrs De Sarnez that we must increasingly see to it that our education becomes more appealing and more competitive. In the European Union, we need something like a community with a first-rate knowledge-based society, of which we can then make real use. For that, we need more mobility. As Mrs De Sarnez has already said, mobility and the quality of our education are the most important things, and so there are of course a number of things we have to do.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also make it our concern that more languages are taught and learned in higher education institutions. We must make it our concern to have more common leaving certificates. The Franco-German college in Germany, at which common leaving certificates can be taken, could serve as an example for many other European higher education institutions. In competition, we should stand or fall by whether we get this on the move. The university label proposed by Mrs De Sarnez strikes me as excellent, and so we must work at making it a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also act more quickly than we have in the past to ensure that leaving certificates and diplomas are at last recognised. We have been saying this for ever and a day and yet progress is being made at a snail's pace. This is damaging our young people, and I do think this is a challenge for all of us and one that we should take up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Zrihen (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, now that we have this report – for which I should like to thank Mrs de Sarnez – the time is right for the European Union to reflect on what it means by the right to education, and more specifically higher education, and how it intends to implement this right. The twentieth century has seen human rights universally accepted as the main guiding force behind what we do. Our responsibility has to be to see them fully respected and put into practice, because education is not only an individual right; it is also an essential means of promoting peace – a crucial issue today – and ensuring respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in general.</p>
<p class="contents">If its potential for building a world of peace is to be realised, education needs to be widely available and made equally accessible to all. It is a huge task, but let us not forget that even today we live in a world where there are more than 800 million illiterate adults and almost 100 million children of secondary school age who do not have access to a school. Moreover, millions of those in school today are not able to benefit from high-quality teaching that meets their basic educational needs. It is therefore increasingly urgent for us to meet these needs in a world where the upheaval caused by globalisation and by the revolution in information and communication technology is marginalising entire peoples, who have been plunged into the most extreme poverty and who are easy prey for extremists of all kinds.</p>
<p class="contents">Making the right to education a reality is now less a question of access to education than of access to adequate training programmes for everyone so as to meet basic needs. From this point of view, the right to higher education is – on our own evidence – not yet a reality, in particular for women. Higher education shall, according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit, but in Africa and Asia fewer than one person in ten in the age group concerned is in higher education, and the gulf is continuing to widen between these regions on the one hand and Europe and North America on the other. There is no doubt that considerable progress has been made in the last 50 years towards making the right to higher education a reality throughout the world, but we should not forget that this vision, which is laid down in Article 26, is not only quantitative but also qualitative because it encompasses the aims and objectives of education and thus its content.</p>
<p class="contents">Mindful of the task which remains to be accomplished – and with repeated thanks to Mrs De Sarnez for her report – I therefore think that it is essential, as far as those who are still excluded from any form of education are concerned, for us to be aware that it is not a question of choice, but that a great many people do not even know that they have a choice. If we are talking about dignity, demands, and equal and inalienable rights, I hope from the bottom of my heart that this report will enable the European Parliament to continue to fight for these things and that it will not stop fighting when the battle is only half won. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Such mobility greatly contributes to mutual understanding within Europe. It is truly the shop floor on which understanding is shared. The Commission is now calling for this process to be extended and intensified so as to include third countries. In her thorough report, Mrs De Sarnez makes the correct assumption that high-quality higher education is required. That the European Credit Transfer System must be improved and promoted in this respect goes without saying. As does the fact that closer cooperation with third countries also requires the development of new cooperation programmes in higher education. The EU has already set up cooperation programmes with America and with Canada, but I should like to fight for cooperation in the field of higher education with the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Commission, one of the objectives of cooperation with third countries is to train highly qualified people. This is certainly very important for developing countries. The mobility of people and ideas has an extremely stimulating effect on all participating institutions within and outside Europe. Education in general is the best way of eradicating poverty in the world, and this certainly applies to developing countries. Strict exchange arrangements will be needed to stave off a brain drain. I would therefore call on the Commission, in its incentives policy, to pay extra attention to cooperation in the field of higher education</p>
<p class="contents">A second point I should like to bring up is the use of <span class="italic">e-</span>learning. For many universities, especially in Developing Countries, it is not always financially possible to fund extensive exchange programmes. Precisely for them, the use of <span class="italic">e-</span>learning is extremely important, with a view both to gathering knowledge and to spreading their own knowledge. The Commission should therefore pay extra attention to this aspect in its policy in the field of development cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Collaboration at the academic and cultural level in Europe does of course need to be improved, but educational differences in certain areas, which produce different results, form part of Member States' national traditions. This only becomes dangerous if education fails to reach a certain standard. In the past, for example, this often led to the situation in which graduates in medicine from one Member States were not, because of educational standards, permitted to work in others. Crossing borders when changing from one university to another also becomes impossible if the same minimum standard is not guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">The announcement of academic and cultural cooperation with candidate states is, however, particularly to be welcomed. We who live on the border with Eastern Europe know these countries very well. Many here will be astonished to learn that, in the twin areas of culture and education, we might even have a few things to learn from the Eastern European candidate states. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The summary she gave us a moment ago is excellent.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Seventeenth century, some 40% of all students at the universities in the Netherlands were of foreign origin. With the advent of the national state, education became increasingly national. We now see another trend towards internationalisation, and this is also necessary. With the enlargement and extension of Europe, we need more people whose hearts are in Europe and who have a feel for Europe, together with a knowledge of, and a feel for, the various countries, languages and cultures. But the world extends beyond Europe, and it is becoming, as it were, increasingly smaller due to growing mobility and further internationalisation. Not for nothing is the term ‘global village’ used. The digital knowledge-based society turns the world into a single coherent whole. This creates a demand not only for citizens who have technical and scientific knowledge, but also for citizens with a feel for world citizenship. And this is precisely why cooperation with third countries in the field of higher education is important.</p>
<p class="contents">A society must be supported by its citizens. The Ancient Greeks already recognised the significance of education towards citizenship. They observed that politics, training and education towards responsibility belong together. Education plays an important role in integration. It is a well-known fact that it can contribute to greater understanding and, as a result, to better relations. It is important for the EU to seek, and intensify, cooperation. Even if education is a national competence, more harmonisation is possible and necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is about cooperation with third countries. As has been said before, Europe does not appear to be the first choice of students who wish to study aboard for a while. The US is still far more appealing. This is partly due to the language problem, but this is not the only reason. The quality of the curriculum, the reputation of the institution, as well as the recognition of qualifications play an important role. I agree with the report that we in Europe must work towards a consistent and high level of education, which inevitably goes hand in hand with a command of languages, international recognition of qualifications, a Credit Transfer System, at least at European level, and more flexible opportunities for students from third countries who study in one Member State to also study temporarily in another EU country.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to focus on the importance this has for development cooperation. It is crucial for the advancement of a country. It is a sound proposal to critically analyse the EU programmes in this respect and to look for other options. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The initiation of this debate and the excellent report by Mrs De Sarnez would appear to be extremely important within the European Union, particularly in the field of higher education, for they highlight how little Europe has been involved thus far. Evidence of this is the mere existence of national bilateral exchange programmes developed by the Member States. However, I feel that the two goals identified for cooperation between the EU and third countries are particularly positive: firstly, the development of high-quality human resources, which can only be achieved through high-quality training or education; and secondly, the promotion of a world centre of excellence for study, training and research situated in Europe. I would also have liked to see some sort of reference to Cedefop and the Turin agency, which contribute a great deal in this field, particularly as regards research.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the issue is not just the quality of courses and programmes but the mutual recognition of qualifications too, an area in which we are guilty of being severely behind schedule. We therefore need to establish transnational training modules of certified, recognised quality, provide incentives for student exchange programmes and language learning and improve the study grant system, providing vocational integration grants for students from third countries, who, although certainly free to choose where to settle down and work, might be more useful if a vocational integration grant were available to enable them to go home to their own States and contribute to their development.</p>
<p class="contents">This is certainly a major challenge – a challenge for the Europe of culture and values – which we cannot afford not to take up and in which we must succeed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am saying nothing new when I tell you that education does not fall within the competence of the Community. Furthermore, in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, of which I am a member, each time we talk about education issues, one of our colleagues takes note of how many times the word ‘subsidiarity’ comes up in the debate. However, one of the fundamental rights of EU citizens is the free movement of persons, a right denied to European citizens insofar as there is no recognition of qualifications that enables citizens to go and work in another EU country.</p>
<p class="contents">At this very moment, the large number of students on the Erasmus programme who spend a whole year studying in another Member State come back to find that this year abroad has been a waste of time, because it is not recognised in their country of origin. This is a totally unacceptable situation, all the more so because, when faced with this situation, many of these students, instead of going to another EU Member State, prefer to go to the United States or to Canada and spend a year there to master the language. I believe that we should avoid this situation by improving conditions within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important for students to have the opportunity to spend a year outside their own countries, for the opportunity to live alongside other EU citizens, for the training that this experience provides and for the opportunity this offers them to learn and perfect another European language, which is so important for us as EU citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, I would like to express my support for Mrs De Sarnez in her call for the creation of a European university label, for improved international student mobility, the promotion of further language learning and, above all, for the harmonisation of higher education that will, without a doubt, have to lead to the recognition of qualifications. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is very important for Parliament and the Commission to work side by side. As others have stressed, it is not easy sometimes, given the lack of legislation, to establish a system for collaborating directly with Parliament in the field of education. I regret this and hope that it will change. I have already said several times to Parliament, when I have appeared before the relevant parliamentary committee, that I will keep it abreast of any new developments and that I would welcome initiatives from Members to enable the Commission to take account of Parliament's proposals, which are very important in this particular field.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the communication which was adopted last July by the Commission sought to launch the debate on cooperation with third countries, taking into account many of the points which have been made by honourable Members: globalisation, increasing international mobility, Europe's lack of competitiveness in the international education market, and the need to foster an understanding of other cultures amongst our own young people and those in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission reiterated that cooperation with third countries is based on Article 149 of the Treaty. I would also add that above and beyond the Treaty this cooperation is one of the ways of fostering dialogue between civilisations. On this basis, the Commission drew two conclusions: firstly, that if we build bridges between universities within the European Union – which is what we are in the process of doing – we also need to build bridges between these European universities and those in other continents. This is precisely the subject of the report before us.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must ensure that our work in this area is more visible, so as to promote Europe as a centre of excellence and so as to attract students seeking an international education. We have identified two objectives: firstly, to train high-quality human resources in the partner countries and in the Community through our system of reciprocal development of human resources. We do not want a brain drain, but we do want the students who have been trained over here – not in one single country but in several because this is where the European added value that we have to offer lies – to return to their countries and, in a context of globalisation, we want them to know what is at stake when, as adults, they are called upon to make decisions in the private or public sector. Secondly, obviously we want to promote the Community as an international centre of excellence for studying. We have centres of excellence – they exist – but we need to link them up and make them more competitive because they will already be well known.</p>
<p class="contents">We are making progress, ladies and gentlemen, by taking specific action. The first specific action is the Tempus programme, which has been extended to our MEDA partners. This initiative is, of course, part of the Barcelona Process, but it also fits in with the idea of strengthening cooperation in the field of higher education, which is the subject of the communication.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur mentioned the ALFA programme. I can tell her that we are in the process of developing ALFA Plus for the countries of Central and South America. Within the institutional framework of inter-university relations, ALFA Plus proposes to award more than 3 000 study grants to postgraduate students, who will be admitted to our universities. You can see that we are working at a very practical level to develop pilot actions in other continents. Moreover, we intend to continue working on similar initiatives. We fully agree with the basic analysis of the European Parliament and the Member States. Here, for once, we have a wonderful unanimity on the issue which concerns us.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission has taken note of the requests to draft a framework proposal in response to the analyses that have been made. We are already working on this and I might even be able to launch the proposal this year. You will understand, Mrs de Sarnez, ladies and gentlemen, that I am not at liberty to divulge the details now, but we will most certainly take account of the many ideas contained in Mrs de Sarnez’s report. I will of course keep the parliamentary committee concerned informed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, with your permission, I should now like to respond very briefly to some of the proposals made by Mrs de Sarnez. I think that I have already answered her questions on the pilot actions, ALFA, Tempus, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur asks us to analyse quality in universities and to establish joint courses of study with joint diplomas, using the ECTS validation scheme. Well, that is what we are in the process of doing. We are setting up pilot projects whereby three or four universities from three or four countries will collaborate on the basis of a joint curriculum leading to a European Masters degree. There are plans for the university chancellors to meet for a major conference in Berlin in 2003 where they will make presentations on the pilot actions, which will have been launched by then; some of them will get underway during the current academic year, but in the majority of cases it will be during the 2002/2003 academic year. We will, therefore, analyse the initial results in Berlin, and I very much hope that the initiative will snowball and that, when they see how positive it is, many universities will want to be involved in this new system.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the detailed survey on international mobility is concerned, I think, Mrs de Sarnez, that this analysis is something that will have to be done mainly by the OECD and Unesco. We are in discussions with these two institutions, but, to conclude their analyses successfully, they need to overcome problems with the comparability of statistics and statistics which are outdated and which have therefore been overtaken by events. But we think that these are the institutions that should do this. We will be collaborating closely with them.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the quality of the reception provided, administrative procedures, accommodation and grants, I should like to reiterate that the French Presidency organised a major meeting of education ministers at the Sorbonne who spent a whole day discussing obstacles to mobility. All of the results were put on paper and signed by our Heads of State and Government at the Nice Summit. The high-level political decision exists. The problem that we have is that progress is not being made as rapidly on the ground because these are issues which need to be addressed by national governments. And I am not even talking about education ministers because often it is Social Security ministers or Home Office ministers who need to get involved here. We therefore need to exert friendly pressure on our governments to remove these barriers to mobility, which often are relatively trivial. We are however making progress here too. Let me give you an example: in some countries the grants awarded by the State to their students were not exportable, which seriously hampered mobility. However, most of the ministers concerned have taken measures making it possible for their students to continue to benefit from a grant whilst they are studying abroad.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is languages. As you know, 2001 was the European Year of Languages. This has set things moving. I say this full of admiration for the speedy response of many Education ministers, who have undertaken reforms of their school systems to enable children to learn one or more foreign languages from an early age. I can tell you that at the Barcelona Summit the Heads of State and Government adopted our slogan of ‘mother tongue plus two’.</p>
<p class="contents">Things are moving then and progress is being made, not quickly enough, but we are going in the right direction. With Parliament’s help, I am sure that we will be able to move forward more quickly towards our shared vision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
