<p class="contents">On the same issue, the European Union-Russia Summit in St Petersburg in May 2003, which I attended, agreed to examine the conditions for visa-free travel between the European Union and Russia. The Commission, in close consultation with Member States, is considering how best to launch these discussions with Russia in the framework of the EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Some media outlets appear to have misinterpreted comments made by the Head of the Commission's Delegation in Moscow on this matter. I can clarify that he rightly said that the European Union is prepared to discuss with Russia the conditions for visa-free travel as a long-term issue, and that this question is linked to a number of related matters which also need to be addressed, such as the need for more effective border management, cooperation in the fight against organised crime and illegal immigration. The conclusion of a readmission agreement with Russia will be an important confidence-building measure in this context. That is a point which I have put to my Russian colleagues and interlocutors on a number of occasions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council adopted a comprehensive plan comprising, among other measures, joint operations to be carried out by the Member States. In June 2003 the European Council of Thessaloniki confirmed this priority and carried out a first assessment of the results achieved so far, while setting new priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">These joint operations are unprecedented and represent a first effort of cooperation in tackling the smuggling of illegal migrants. The Ulysses joint operation, for example, has been organised and led by Spain, but other Member States have also participated. This is a first attempt to pool the efforts of the Member States in addressing the tragic situation of migration flows by sea and in attempting to put and end to, or at least diminish, the risk of the kinds of tragic accidents that regularly occur on our seas as a result of the criminal actions of smugglers and traffickers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission did not take part in planning or managing the various off-shore operations, but – via the Argo Programme – we co-financed these external border management operations to the tune of EUR 670 000.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will receive a final report on the results and the impact of the activities undertaken in accordance with the relevant procedures of the Argo Programme before the end of the year. In the light of the objectives of the Argo Programme, the Commission will then be able to evaluate the impact of such an operation for the management of common external borders.</p>
<p class="contents">At Thessaloniki the Greek presidency presented a report on the implementation of programmes, ad hoc centres, pilot projects and joint operations. A chapter of this report is devoted to the Ulysses operation. I suggest that Mr Medina Ortega takes a look at this report, where there is a comprehensive description of the operation's content. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, I am in a position to verify what the Greek Presidency has said on the issue, but, given that the Commission will have to evaluate the project, I would like to warn you of the following:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, that perhaps the way in which the Ulysses Project was implemented – a first phase in the Mediterranean and then another phase in the Atlantic – meant that during the Mediterranean phase immigration was diverted towards the Atlantic and during the Atlantic phase it was diverted towards the Mediterranean, and therefore in practice the effect was minimal. It would appear, furthermore, that, at least in the first part, there were understanding problems between the different operations.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now talking about a second project, the Neptune Project, for the central and eastern Mediterranean – I imagine the Commissioner will be up—to-date with this issue – and the question I would put is whether, as a consequence of this second project, by focussing on one area – the central and eastern Mediterranean – there will be a danger of increasing the pressure on the western Mediterranean and the Atlantic. In other words, to what extent the second project can produce that result because it appears that the total flow is always the same: if one side is closed off, immigration is diverted towards the other. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Additional Protocol on safeguarding nuclear material</span></p>
<p class="contents">Since August 2002, following documented reports by the Iranian resistance, the Iranian regime’s illegal activities connected with developing Iran’s nuclear capability have come to light and been referred to openly not only by the US authorities, but also by the press and specialist bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">In June the International Atomic Energy Agency fully confirmed the reports and the European institutions were at last forced to acknowledge the evidence.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, in statements and answers to parliamentary questions the Commission has always maintained that the accusations by the Iranian resistance and their confirmation by the US authorities were not credible and even went so far as to claim that in general Iran had complied with the relevant provisions and had even allowed its nuclear installations to be inspected, which any observers in possession of even the minimum of information at the time knew to be absolutely untrue.</p>

<p class="contents">In the meantime, on 26th August 2003, as a follow-up to the June report, the IAEA issued a new report with further findings. The August report highlights that while Iran has demonstrated an increased degree of cooperation, this cooperation was at times slow in coming and some of the information contradicted what had previously been provided. This report will be analysed by the IAEA board of directors at a meeting in the week commencing 8 September 2003. It is also likely that European foreign ministers will discuss this matter at the Gymnich meeting in Italy this weekend.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has called for full transparency from Iran on this issue and has consistently stated that the issue of weapons of mass destruction constitutes one of the major concerns in relations between the European Union and Iran. Through contacts at ministerial and official level, the Commission has asked Iran to proceed to a prompt signature and ratification of the additional protocol and to cooperate fully and in a transparent manner with the IAEA. Without such a protocol in force, it would be hard for the IAEA to assure itself that there was no undeclared nuclear activity in Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission makes every effort to base itself on available objective information, in particular IAEA sources. We will be following developments within the IAEA closely, not least in view of the meeting I had a couple of months ago with Dr El Baradei. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The honourable Member cannot have been concentrating when I have said, on a number of occasions, that at meeting after meeting with our Iranian interlocutors we have stressed the importance, for example, of their signing the additional protocol. I have been to Teheran twice to make that point. In the last few weeks I have spoken twice to Foreign Minister Kharrazi. I spoke to him in the middle of August and it is a wonderful coincidence that this question is being asked this evening as I spoke to him this morning on exactly the same point.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleague Dr Solana, the High Representative, has been in Teheran this week making the point we have been making month after month: we wish to see Iran sign the additional protocol as a necessary, but not perhaps sufficient, condition for convincing the rest of the world that its civil nuclear programme and ambitions are what they are said to be. I have no doubt at all that we should press Iran on this issue. Iran wants to have a better relationship with us and the rest of the world. What the Iranians have to recognise is that it is not just the United States that is concerned about this issue: we are also passionately concerned about it.

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 36 by Monica Frassoni (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2003-0432_EN.html">H-0432/03</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Spain's National Hydrological Plan (NHP) and Mediterranean agriculture</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Ebro transfer scheme will directly provide some 600 hm<span class="sup">3 </span>of water for agriculture in the Mediterranean. In addition, the re-use for agricultural purposes of water transferred for urban use will provide a further 150 hm<span class="sup">3</span>. Added to this will be more than 200 hm<span class="sup">3</span> of desalinated water. Finally, the NHP provides for investment in improving the efficiency of existing irrigation systems, which could generate hundreds more cubic hectolitres. In total, the increase in agricultural water supply under the plan would be well in excess of 1000 hm<span class="sup">3</span> per year. In modern Mediterranean agriculture every cubic metre of water generates 3 euro worth of agricultural production. In many cases, hothouse production exceeds 6 euro per cubic metre. The Ebro transfer scheme will therefore boost current production by several billion euro. Aside from the question of how officially irrigated areas are monitored, these new resources will increase production levels, since they are bound to be used somewhere. Has the Commission considered what effect this massive increase in supply might have on farm prices? Mediterranean agriculture markets are already virtually saturated in the case of some products and North African countries are starting to penetrate these markets. The precarious balance currently prevailing in Mediterranean agriculture, which essentially keeps it outside the CAP subsidy system, could well be upset by the Ebro transfer scheme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission does not at present have any detailed information or studies at its disposal that would indicate what effect such availability of additional water would have on production in the European Union and on agricultural prices. So we can only estimate it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission estimates that the increase in water resources will have only a very slight effect on the extent of the agricultural products supported by Community agricultural funding. The fact is that there is already an upper limit for Community support for most irrigated cultures, and this upper limit relates either to surface area (as in the case of maize or rice) or to guaranteed national maximum authorised quantities (as in the case of cotton, olive oil, or processed products from fruit and vegetables). Payments are reduced in proportion to the extent to which the cultivated areas exceed the areas dedicated to crops eligible for support. The increases in yield or the extension of the irrigated areas, which are the possible consequences of the Spanish Hydrological Plan would thus have no effect on the total amounts paid, nor could the implementation of the plan have any effect on the production of milk, to which quota rules apply.</p>
<p class="contents">The only sector in which production could increase is the fresh fruit and vegetables sector, which is, however, already very strongly market-oriented, and production would increase only if the necessary market potential were present. An additional consideration is that irrigation could improve the quality and competitiveness of fresh fruit and vegetables.</p>
<p class="contents">So, were the invisible balance of Mediterranean agriculture to be affected by the Spanish plans, such a development would not be supported by the Community, as increases in production do not automatically entail an increase in Community support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They will probably cultivate those fruits that open up the best economic opportunities to the individual farmer, but what I can make clear from the outset is that such changes will not give rise to the topping-up of this or that milk quota, nor will the Community be willing to accept such things as, for example, higher hectare premiums or additional reference areas for any crops.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: New reform of the CAP and highly disadvantaged (Objective 1) areas of the EU</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency's 26 June 2003 undertaking regarding the new reform of the CAP contains only a timid, rhetorical reference to disadvantaged regions and cohesion within the EU. An analysis of the proposals put forward by the Commission and agreed by the Council does not enable what is meant by 'desire to support' to be either qualified or quantified.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the EU there are highly depressed agricultural areas which by themselves will be unable to achieve the degree of competitiveness required on account of the new decoupling of aid and the additional demands imposed by the reform. Only some fresh agricultural-training and -promotion and commercial-distribution policies, together with special programmes to boost agricultural and commercial development, will be able to counter the heavy impact of the reform, thereby preventing economic depression and the abandonment of farming.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the above, what action is the Commission planning to take in order to prevent the reform of the CAP from having a harmful effect on the most disadvantaged parts of the EU? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If, in the field of agriculture, we speak in terms of less-favoured or of especially disadvantaged areas, we have to distinguish between two things; firstly, those less-favoured areas in which hectare premiums are paid as part of the rural development programmes, in order to compensate for their disadvantaged situation, and, secondly, those areas categorised as Objective 1 areas by reason of their generally backward state of development. As you know, the Community can, in these Objective 1 areas, do such things as grant investment programmes higher cofinancing rates. There are also, in addition, quite specific conditions for what we term the outermost regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me start by establishing, in the context of reform, that it will continue to be for the Member States to decide what value and priority they attach to the measures for the less-favoured areas under the rural development programmes. They will, in any case, subject to modulation, have more funds at their disposal for this purpose. It is also the Member States who decide how much by way of structural funds they want to spend in the Objective 1 regions under the Guarantee Fund, how much they want to allocate to the Social Fund and how much to the Regional Fund. Nothing about this is changed by the agricultural reform.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also true, though, that there are some less-favoured regions in which the reform could cause agricultural production to fall, and this leads the public in the EU to fear that more and more land in especially disadvantaged areas could be left uncultivated. The reform of income aid will, however, link direct grants to the role played by the farmer as a manager responsible for his land and for the rural environment. The new farm payment will in fact be cut if management obligations are not discharged. We do not pay our farmers for doing nothing, and nor will we do so in the future. Those who receive premiums must manage their land in line with agricultural and environmental standards; moreover, the premium for less-favoured areas will be paid only if the land is properly managed.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not therefore go along with you in the conclusions to which you have come, and which underlie your question on the less-favoured areas. All the same, I would like to point out that the Commission will continue to closely monitor the effects of the new common agricultural policy on the less-favoured areas, for the reform does indeed provide for the possibility of appropriate adjustments being made, should it prove necessary to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The people who will have to reform and convert their crops and their farming are the farmers, not just the bureaucrats.</p>
<p class="contents">In the countryside there is great uncertainty and worry about the consequences of the reform at the moment. In less-favoured regions, there is much more. This is because, as you know, new commercial policies will be needed, and in less-favoured regions – objective 1 regions, apart from the terminological issue – new commercial measures, education and training for farmers are going to be needed. In this reform, however, you have not planned for anything like this for the regions in the worst situations.</p>
<p class="contents">In Andalusia this will mean more than EUR 1 000 million. Throughout this summer there has been talk of a hard blow. Furthermore, your proposal is bureaucratically much more complex. In other words, rather than being simplified, the bureaucracy is increasing. From the point of view of social cohesion, moreover, this represents a retrograde step, especially when Mr Prodi commissions reports from his advisers which may be the final straw for social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">You are not replying to my question, Commissioner. To what are you referring when you say that it is true that certain areas – the least-favoured – may be subject to reductions? What does this mean? A little more formality, and a lot more with those who are worst ...</p>

You take the specific example of Andalusia and say that it will be necessary to inject more funding in Andalusia in order to give farmers better training in order to enable them to adapt to the new situation – well, that is a matter for the Andalusian Government. It will have to put forward a proposal for reprogramming its rural development programme. If it complies with the general conditions, we will certainly approve it. I do not see a problem in that.</p>
<p class="contents">I might add that the time for discussing my proposal has been and gone. A decision has been taken; the ministers took it unanimously – and that means that Spain voted for it. This means that discussion of changes to the proposal is now idle talk. The reform stands. What is now far more important is the question of how you implement this reform in Spain, for you will be aware that the latest decision made a certain degree of flexibility possible. What matters now, for example, is whether, in Andalusia, you decouple everything or whether, in animal husbandry perhaps, you retain certain coupled elements, with the stipulation that this task could, under certain circumstances, devolve upon the rural communities. Such a possibility exists, but it is now for you to make your move. It is you who must decide! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The branches of the two companies in Congo place (European) foodstuffs on the market at dumping prices. The development project CDI-Bwamanda, for its part, states that local agriculture has to contend with far too high general costs. The European Commission, among others, purchases maize locally for double the price as farming is so inefficient, Trends points out. However, the FAO considers that Congo has the potential to feed some 2 billion people.</p>

On the one hand, legal proceedings are currently under way against European food surplus exporters in relation to a money laundering and diamond trafficking affair. The Belgian magistracy has dispatched an investigating committee to the Democratic Republic of Congo. That investigation is secret and falls within the competence of the Belgian Courts. The Commission therefore has no information on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the Commission is currently allocating significant resources to the development of local agriculture in the DRC. Under the European Development Fund, projects to boost agriculture and rehabilitate rural roads, along with phytosanitary measures are under way to the tune of EUR 13.2 million. An agricultural support project worth EUR 12 million is awaiting approval.</p>
<p class="contents">The food aid supplied by the Commission amounts to nearly EUR 5 million and consists, inter alia, of amounts made available to the NGO, CDI-Bwamanda, to purchase maize from local producers at the Kinshasa market price. This approach enables Congolese farmers to continue producing in a domestic situation, characterised by a patent lack of purchasing power, and therefore to prepare themselves to compete on the national and regional markets when the post-conflict economic upturn begins.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission's intervention, via this NGO, will help avoid a situation where food aid produced outside the country weakens an agricultural sector already hard-hit by the country's political conditions, which are having huge repercussions on production. All this has given rise in Kinshasa to a steep increase in the market price for maize.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be noted, however, that since the conclusion of the 'global and inclusive' Pretoria agreement in December 2002, and the official reunification of Congolese territory at the end of June 2003, commercial navigation on the river Congo is returning to normal. This will in all probability bring the market price down. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 44 by Eija-Riitta Anneli Korhola (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2003-0474_EN.html">H-0474/03</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Linking Kyoto mechanism credits to development cooperation</span></p>
<p class="contents">The EU is drafting a directive on credits obtainable from Joint Implementation (JI) and Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects which comply with the Kyoto Agreement, which credits would be convertible into emission rights that would have a monetary value for purposes of emissions trading. An instrument would thus be created which would enable some development projects to earn money. At the same time it is likely that this will make one more tool available which could help to attain the UN’s target of 0.7% of GNP. The EU also intends to hold emission rights itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the bright prospects, a satisfactory outcome will be attainable only through careful planning and a well-considered strategy. Is the Directorate-General which is responsible for development cooperation at the Commission aware of the nature of CDM projects and the opportunities they create for additional funding of development cooperation? Will the Commission guide the Member States towards a common approach? How will CDM projects be integrated with the EU’s own financial planning of development cooperation? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For developing countries, the CDM should be a good vehicle for the transfer of clean and modern technologies, which will contribute to their development efforts. However, the CDM is not a substitute for funding in the framework of development cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the CDM is primarily a private sector or business sector instrument and public funding would be used only for enabling and capacity-building purposes or similar catalytic actions. Secondly, even though the certified emission reductions that will be generated by a CDM project will have an additional value, that value may not be 'reportable' as official development assistance according to the reporting rules of the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is supportive of the opportunities that CDM may bring in terms of technology transfer, but is aware that not all developing countries will be equally interesting to the business sector in terms of investments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has proposed an EU strategy and action plan for climate change in the context of development cooperation, in which support would be given to partner countries for CDM project preparation activities, including capacity-building. The communication on climate change in the context of development cooperation also explores the possibility of funding CDM projects in the category of least-developed countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards guiding Member States towards a common approach on CDM, we hope that the discussions in Council on the Commission’s communication will lead to agreement on an EU action plan, including actions related to CDM activities. I invite the European Parliament also to give its opinion on the communication.</p>
<p class="contents">Assistance for the CDM activities included in the action plan may be funded from geographical budget lines on request from countries, and from the research budget. Assistance can also be provided from the budget line 'Environment in developing countries and tropical forests', for which CDM activities will be one of the priorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 50 by Alexander de Roo (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2003-0431_EN.html">H-0431/03</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Spain's National Hydrological Plan (NHP) and conservation of the lower Júcar river</span></p>
<p class="contents">The plans for the river Ebro in Spain’s National Hydrological Plan (NHP) have aroused major controversy. Nothing has been said, however, regarding the fate of the river Júcar, the second largest river in the Spanish Mediterranean region, which under the NHP is to be used as a centre for hydraulic redistribution in the Mediterranean area, with three transfers within a 200-kilometre stretch, namely the Tajo-Segura transfer, in operation since 1980, the Júcar-Vinalopó transfer, already being slowly introduced, and the Ebro transfer scheme, under which it is planned to transfer 63 hm<span class="sup">3</span> of water in the vicinity of the Tous dam. The lower and middle sections of the river Júcar are of major environmental interest. The stretch of river from Tous to the sea has been proposed as a site of Community importance by the Valencia Generalitat (LIC ES 5232007). Furthermore, the final stretch of the river and the adjacent coastal waters are included on the list of wetlands of the Community of Valencia. The Júcar basin was recently chosen as a pilot river basin (PRB) as part of the procedures for applying the framework directive on water. Is the Commission aware that neither the Júcar basin hydrological plan nor the NHP make provision for environmental flow for the Júcar between the Real del Júcar irrigation system and the estuary? Does the Commission think it possible to ensure the conservation of a stretch of water of such major environmental importance without using hydrological planning to provide it with a minimum maintenance flow and prevent biological pollution through mixing with waters from other basins?</p>

<p class="contents">Does the Commission agree that the twin objectives of prevention of deterioration of current status, and the characterisation of what should constitute 'good' ecological status in the whole of the Ebro basin need to be fulfilled before further evaluation of whether the Ebro transfer is technically possible and which regions could finally benefit from it? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a major aim of current Community legislation on air quality and emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">In compliance with the reporting obligations of the Air Quality Framework Directive, Greece has reported the 2001 concentration levels for the pollutants regulated in the first daughter directive. According to this information, the limit values for PM10, as well as for NO2, plus the margin of tolerance, have been exceeded at several stations in Athens.</p>
<p class="contents">As Greece has not yet provided the necessary justification to demonstrate that such excesses of PM10 are due to natural events, the Commission expects to receive plans and programmes in accordance with Article 8 of the framework directive by the end of 2003. These should show how Greece intends to achieve the limit values by 2005. The same applies to NO2 where, however, no derogation for natural sources or events is allowed.</p>
<p class="contents">For NO2 the directives also set an alert threshold which is surpassed when concentrations exceed 400 micrograms per cubic metre over three consecutive hours. The Commission must be informed of any exceeding of the alert threshold within three months. No information from the Greek authorities on such an event has been provided up to now.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also received findings from a research programme indicating an increase of mortality in cities where high PM10 concentrations are accompanied by high NO2 levels and a warm climate. We need to study these findings carefully to conclude whether there is sufficient evidence for such a relationship. However, there is no doubt that unfavourable climatic conditions are always an additional threat to human health.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States are obliged to ensure that up-to-date information on ambient concentration of air pollutants, such as NO2 or PM10, is routinely made available to the public. According to the honourable Member, the ministry has stopped issuing information on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the above, the Commission will open an own-initiative case to investigate whether and to what extent the Greek authorities have not complied with the relevant EC regulations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The rules of Article 4 of the Habitat Directive 92/43/EEC<a href="#def_1_4" name="ref_1_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> including Annex III, Stage 1 govern the procedure for the first (national) stage selections of NATURA 2000 sites. The national stage has legal effects on landowners, governments and the Commission, according to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruling C-371/98 point 20. These effects relate to the conservation objectives of each site, that is, the objectives identifying the habitat types and the species (including birds) to be protected also under Article 6.3 of the Habitat Directive. It is essential the Commission guarantee that the rules of the first national stage are correctly incorporated into national legislation, following the guidelines set forth by the ECJ, and that national authorities do not arbitrarily misinterpret the rules when drawing up the national lists.</p>

At present the Commission is of the opinion that the Articles referring to the procedure of establishing the Natura 2000 network have been correctly transposed.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Natura 2000 network has caused a considerable amount of controversy in Finland, the Commission has looked into the national procedure for site selection and has in past years notified Finland of some shortcomings, both in the number of sites to be protected and the quality of the data. Finland has endeavoured to address these shortcomings. The present quality of the data is acceptable to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The complaints from Finland seem to contain some misinterpretations of the evaluation principles. The Commission bases its evaluations on the latest submitted data, not on the oldest information. The Commission is aware that some landowners in Finland have been dissatisfied with the Natura 2000 proposals. The Commission has been informed that all landowners have had the possibility to see the proposals and to lodge complaints against them before Finland officially submitted the proposals to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Finnish courts have examined the complaints on a case-by-case basis, considering each time the validity of the data. The majority of the complaints have been rejected by the courts. The directive does not establish any requirements for consultation at the national level and thus, in respect of the principle of subsidiarity, it has been for individual Member States to exercise their responsibilities, taking account of national laws and procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's concerns are therefore limited to respect the scientific selection criteria as set out in the directive. Although the Commission can understand that in these cases the dissatisfaction might persist, it cannot conclude that the Finnish authorities have arbitrarily misinterpreted the rules or proceeded in a way that has been contradictory to those rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When this was implemented in Finland it was mainly based on old protection schemes, which do not meet directive criteria for Natura 2000 sites.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, you must understand the position of the private landowners. Their right to use their own land was wrongly prohibited and in fact, contrary to what you say, the appeals in the Finnish courts were handled en bloc. 99 times out of 100 they were rejected outright. People therefore feel frustrated and powerless. We believe in Europe, but how do we convince ordinary European citizens or the Finnish farmer if they feel they have been steamrollered by Europe and, in this case, by the Finnish authorities?

<p class="contents">I hope that we will also be better able to assist Member States in giving good examples of how to communicate the directive, but I am not convinced that we will ever be able to solve this problem of the Finnish Government and authorities having to introduce a consultation process with, for example, Finnish landowners. We will never be able to solve that from Brussels, but hopefully we can do better in giving good examples of how this consultation process can be implemented and carried out in different countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that we also make clear where the responsibility lies with the Commission and where there is a case for subsidiarity and we will thus have to rely on a Member State – in this case the Finnish Government and authorities – to also organise work on this.
