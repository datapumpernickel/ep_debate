<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Sierra González </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL), </span><span class="italic">rapporteur. – (ES)</span> Mr President, the Commission"s annual reports on monitoring the application of Community law have two main functions: to provide information on how the Commission is monitoring the transposition of directives by the Member States; and to provide an account of the use made by the Commission of its discretionary power as guardian of the Treaties to initiate non‐compliance procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the first of these objectives, it has to be said that the Commission has made a significant effort in terms of the transposition of directives, particularly the directives relating to the internal market. As a result, the number of directives transposed into national law increased in all the Member States in 1997, and the results were particularly significant in some countries, such as Finland, Denmark and Sweden.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we must also point out that the national transposition measures taken have not always resulted in the correct transposition of the directives into national law. Moreover, the majority of Member States did not adopt the national measures needed to transpose the directives until after the deadline for doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the second objective concerning non‐compliance, considerable progress has been made following the entry into force on 1 January 1997 of a new instrument – the voluntary notification procedure – which seeks to facilitate the swift and uncontentious processing of disputes on the basis of transparency and mutual trust. The introduction of this new procedure coincided with the proposal made by the Commission to the Court of Justice to the effect that once non‐compliance has been established, a daily fine should be imposed until compliance is achieved, and this has led to substantial progress. The threat of such a fine has had a particularly dissuasive effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Much still remains to be done, however, as regards the implementation of decisions arrived at. Delays in their implementation have created a lack of trust in such decisions. In fact, 87 decisions handed down by the Court in accordance with Article 169 have yet to be implemented. Nevertheless, this represents an improvement on the previous year, as in 1996, 98 decisions were still awaiting implementation. Moreover, 34 decisions relating to Article 171 have still to be implemented. Not only do such delays in the implementation of the rulings detract from the credibility of the decisions taken by the Court of Justice, but they also have a deleterious effect on the image of all the institutions, making them appear inefficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to other areas, an overall reduction in the number of infringement proceedings in progress has also been recorded, following the reform of the procedure to shorten the period of time between lodging a complaint or recording a case of non‐compliance and the first decision on the basis. The number of infringement proceedings initiated concerning environmental issues and discrimination on the grounds of nationality has nevertheless increased in relative terms.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the progress made – which certainly deserves recognition – much remains to be done concerning certain specific features of the procedures, such as the strict observance of the terms of any injunction and of the time allowed to evaluate a complaint or a petition, and giving plaintiffs the opportunity to have access to legal arguments which could affect the final decision on a complaint so as to facilitate possible appeals. All these issues will have to given serious consideration in the near future, in the interests of legal efficiency and of the transparency of proceedings as well as to guarantee the credibility of non‐compliance procedures in the eyes of the public.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end also, we will have to encourage more detailed knowledge of Community issues among the legal profession and the general public. Subsidising training programmes and simplifying regulations would help in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would simply like to say that it is unfortunate that this annual report has not followed up the recommendations made in the previous report, namely, extending the scope of the report to include new material relating to the implementation of international agreements the Community is party to, petitions and the transposition of social policy directives.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Anastassopoulos </span> <span class="bold">(PPE). </span>‐ <span class="italic">(EL)</span> Mr President, this report by Mrs Sierra González is characterised by new proposals and new improvements, involving the simplification of Community law, better transposition of Community law into the national laws of the Member States, and easier access to Community law for the people of Europe. The fact that the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens" Rights has unanimously approved this text is proof of its more general acceptance, for which the rapporteur deserves our congratulations.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur, I monitored the implementation of Community law in 1994, and since then I have not ceased to stress how important I believe it is to familiarise jurists with Community law. My amendment, which was incorporated into the motion for a resolution, calls once again on Member States and universities to make such study compulsory. The Schuman action plan to teach Community law to lawyers is an important move in the same general direction.</p>
<p class="contents">On the eve of the new enlargement of the European Union, the procedures to successfully incorporate derived law into the national laws of the applicant countries are of almost self‐evident importance. This is the basis of my other amendment, also incorporated into the motion for a resolution, which calls on the Commission to provide all possible technical support.</p>
<p class="contents">For the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, there is of course the PHARE programme, but Cyprus and Malta, with which we hope negotiations will begin shortly, are not covered. The report now before us is the last in this fourth parliamentary term on the annual monitoring of the application of Community law, and it gives us the opportunity to point out the improvements made over those years thanks to the pressure brought to bear by the European Parliament, which has the power of codecision following the Treaty of Maastricht and is therefore a co‐legislator.</p>
<p class="contents">The progress made in incorporating Community law into national law has been quite spectacular, and the implementation by the Commission of Articles 169 and 171 of the Treaty, with the imposition of penalties, has, as Mrs Sierra González has pointed out, compelled Member States to respect the decisions of the European Court far more than used to be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">In a few weeks, the Amsterdam Treaty will enter into force. The European Parliament will gain significant new powers of codecision, as well as powers in other areas. I would like to express my firm belief that this change will make a significant contribution to ensuring that European Community law moves closer to the people of Europe, and that there will be more transparency in the decisions of the European Union.</p>

We should like to see the procedures speeded up, for example by having regular three‐monthly Commission meetings on these issues, a six‐month time‐limit, and so on. I hope that the new incoming Commission will adhere to any undertakings in this respect so as to ensure that the reforms can be effectively applied.</p>
<p class="contents">We were also pleased to hear the rapporteur mention that there should be more rapid access to the reasoned opinions of the Court of Justice; my colleague Mr Wijsenbeek is still waiting for an opinion on his case from the ECJ.</p>
<p class="contents">Much attention has also been focused on the clarity of Community law. We know that Parliament approved the guidelines set out in Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi's proposal for better Community legislation. Unfortunately, I have to say that the comments of the language experts relating to these guidelines have not been particularly encouraging: no language experts have actually been consulted. At the same time, we know that the English translation service is forging ahead with its attempt to ‘fight the fog'. The Liberals have tried to focus attention on these efforts, but unfortunately we have still not succeeded in getting everyone to understand that Parliament should put pressure on the other translation services to make them see matters in the same way. The written language should be made more user‐friendly. It is not we who draft the legislation who have to understand it, but the people who actually apply it. This would also allow us to make considerable administrative savings.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope and firmly believe that the Finnish Presidency will make this a matter of priority in the autumn, thereby enabling us to promote a better understanding of Community law.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Palacio Vallelersundi </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, it is difficult to say anything new when discussing a report such as the one before us today which enjoys such broad consensus. Not only has it been approved unanimously, but it goes forward without a single amendment. I should like to congratulate the rapporteur and express my support for what Mr Anastassopoulos has just said.</p>
<p class="contents">However, a moment"s reflection is called for. The Commission"s annual report concerns the issue of monitoring the application of Community law. So, it primarily relates to monitoring and thus the way in which the Commission exercises the monitoring powers entrusted to it in the Treaty as guardian of the Treaties. These powers – I am referring in particular to Article 169 and Article 171 of the EC Treaty – have been increased and strengthened. And yet as other speakers have already pointed out, we need to increase the transparency of this procedure, particularly as regards the administrative procedure, which takes place within the Commission behind closed doors. The Commission is currently under review and amongst other challenges it is being urged to devise a clearer and more transparent procedure with a timetable we are all aware of.</p>
<p class="contents">But what is at issue here is monitoring application. Application means knowledge, knowledge means understanding and understanding means clarity first and foremost. Community law lacks clarity. Mr Anastassopoulos referred to a representative from a country in Eastern Europe, and I remember him saying to me: ‘Mrs Palacio, you require us to incorporate the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> , but you are constantly changing it". We have had experience of this recently in the Committee on Legal Affairs. We were dealing with a matter relating to consolidation. From the start of the consolidation initiative to the time when Parliament began its report, two directives which should theoretically have been consolidated were amended twice. This is a typical example of the lack of visibility, the complicated web of rules which has such a negative effect on Community law in general. This is what Declaration No 19 of the Treaty of Amsterdam relates to.</p>
<p class="contents">Another declaration to mention in this respect is Declaration No 39 annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam on the quality of drafting. Legislation is being drawn up in 11 languages, embodying legal institutions drawn from different legal traditions. All this needs to be harmonised, so we must make a special effort to ensure that the end product can be understood by everyone, as Mrs Thors says. Crucially, it needs to be understood by the experts. Initiatives such as the Grotius and Schuman programmes should receive every support, because if Community law is to be correctly applied, the experts, the judges, the lawyers and, more generally, all the courts must to be the first to apply it correctly.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I should like to conclude on a positive note. I believe that as Mr Anastassopoulos has pointed out, this review of the application of Community law, the application of the articles on monitoring in the Treaty and, in general, knowledge of Community law have all improved since 1994. We must maintain our efforts in this direction as a great deal still remains to be done.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Brittan, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission</span>. – Mr. President, I have to compliment Mrs Sierra González on her admirable report. Monitoring the application of Community law is an essential part of what we are doing in Europe. The task of the Commission is to be a guardian of the Treaty. We have to make sure that the citizens affected enjoy the benefits that Europe provides, and I am grateful for Parliament's support in this difficult, unending task.</p>
<p class="contents">The Fifteenth Annual Report for 1997 shows that we have taken several important steps in ensuring respect for Community law; and Mrs Sierra González, in her speech today, has referred to a number of them.</p>
<p class="contents">We have substantially improved our working methods. Good examples are the efforts to speed up the handling of cases and to encourage the transparency of our actions and all that has been done in close cooperation with the Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">To enforce effectively Community law, we have used all the instruments that we have. Cooperation and peer pressures are often an effective tool to increase transposition and correct implementation of Community law. That is demonstrated by the successes of the single‐market action plan and the bilateral meetings on directives with Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also agree with Mrs Sierra González that producing simple and clear legislation is one of the best ways to avoid problems later. Mrs Thors was right to talk about the importance of having user‐friendly language. I also agree with Mr Anastassopoulos and others who spoke about the importance of teaching law so that those who are lawyers understand what the Community law is all about.</p>
<p class="contents">That having been said, there are occasions when we have to use our powers under Article 169 of the Treaty to launch infringement proceedings; and we, of course, do so. We are currently handling more than 3, 200 such cases.</p>
<p class="contents">Our reforms have improved the working of the proceedings, and that is very important for citizens who are at the origin of nearly 50 % of the cases. We are handling cases much faster than a few years ago, and the main reasons for that are that we now decide letters of formal notice, recent opinions and referrals to the Court on a more regular basis. Cases are now decided on a bi‐weekly basis.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past, the system was more rigid and did not allow one to come to a decision as soon as the case was ready for action. Secondly, decisions are implemented more rapidly. In the past, it could take several months to send a 169 letter. Today, the formal notice will often reach the Member State a week after the decision. And finally, we enforce deadlines for reply or compliance much more strictly although, of course, the rights of defence of the Member State have to be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">We use all opportunities to solve infringement problems as quickly as possible. Only 10 % of the cases go to Court, and reference has been made to the penalty system which now exists, and requests from between 7, 000 and 260, 000 euros per day have been put forward by the Commission. It is all for the benefit of our citizens so it is quite right and normal that we should inform them of all the steps of an infringement proceeding which concerns them. Here the European Ombudsman as well as the Parliament have played an important and instructive role. Information on respect of Community law in general must also be more widespread, and I welcome the support of the Parliament to increase transparency in this area still further.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, respect for Community law is essential to bring Europe closer to its citizens. We are using all the powers we have to prevent, and if necessary, pursue infringements by Member States. That is what our citizens are entitled to expect, and that is what they are getting.</p>
