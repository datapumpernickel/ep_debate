<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ferber (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has again presented a supplementary budget in order to set the Common Foreign, and Security Policy and defence policy in Europe on a broader basis.</p>
<p class="contents">We examined the original draft supplementary budget sent to us by the Council very closely and came to the conclusion that it was not acceptable as it stood and I should like to say why in no uncertain terms: what we need in this important political field is to safeguard the necessary transparency and the necessary controls. The common foreign and security policy of the European Union is one of the core elements in the further development of this European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot withdraw control functions from the national parliaments in this important area without giving them to the European Parliament and we felt that this democratic gap needed to be closed. I should like to say quite clearly that interinstitutional agreements are all well and good, but they are not the right tool for effective control. Nor are the Western European Union and its parliamentary assembly the right tool for effective control. That is why it was clear to us that transparency can only be reasonably guaranteed and this important political field can only be controlled within the framework of the budgetary procedure. That is why I am most grateful to my fellow members for staying the difficult course which we have taken together and seeing the tough negotiations with the Council through to the end and for supporting the line which I, as rapporteur, have taken from the outset.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to thank the Swedish Presidency of the Council for making it possible to broker a solution now which guarantees the Council's ability to act in the area for which it is responsible under the Treaty and which also guarantees Parliament's right of control. That was the brief which we stood up for and which we negotiated.</p>
<p class="contents">We resisted the temptation – and I am most grateful to my fellow members for this – to make a distinction between administrative expenses and operational expenses. That would have been too confusing. You cannot distinguish, post by post, when someone is administering and when they are operationally active. But now that we have succeeded in ensuring that a separate title in the Council budget includes activities in the area of the common foreign and security policy, this distinction – and hence controls – are guaranteed in an optimum manner.</p>
<p class="contents">The supplementary budget, in terms of numbers, totals EUR 9.846 million. It makes provision for 51 new posts in this area and for the further technical resources needed in order to refurbish the buildings. I should like to say quite clearly at this point that we shall of course check the Council budget in general and this new title in particular very closely during the course of the 2002 budgetary procedure. We cannot allow the Council to build up powers which the European Union already has, for which provision has been made under the Commission budget, especially in the area of crisis prevention and civil crisis management, as a parallel structure. And, as long as that is not the case, I see no need to recommend that the House reject the Council's supplementary and amending budget.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall also ensure in future, as regards heading 5, that the European Union's ability to act is still guaranteed when it comes to administrative expenses. I should like to urge the Council not just to deal with this important area in supplementary budgets, but to include it once and for all in its normal budget, so that we have a reasonable set of figures at our disposal when discussing other areas under heading 5.</p>
<p class="contents">My thanks to the honourable members from nearly all the groups for supporting me. However, I must say that I am somewhat disappointed that the Greens have moved to reject the supplementary budget. The chairman of the Committee on Budgets will cast our vote on this motion tomorrow. Until such time as we can prove – and we need ammunition here – that there are twin structures, it makes no sense to reject <span class="italic">en masse </span>something which represents a huge success for the European Parliament and, by extension, for the citizens of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Orden (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, we object on principle to the accelerating growth of European Union military structures outside the NATO Alliance, with all their attendant costs and politically divisive intent. We believe that the duplication of decision-making bodies and the development of a military staff separate from NATO will inevitably exacerbate policy differences between allies, to the detriment of the transatlantic relationship and the long-term security of our people. The European Union should be focusing its efforts on economic, administrative and humanitarian contributions to crisis management, to complement the military capabilities which should properly be a NATO responsibility. The European Union has not yet learned to deliver and manage its external assistance programmes efficiently or to properly spend the resources that have been allocated to these purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">Now it wants more money to spend on yet another ambitious and seriously misguided project. Parliament is being asked to approve a draft supplementary and amending budget of nearly EUR 10 million to fund staff and equipment for the separate European Union military bodies. In addition to some 90 staff redeployed from other tasks or seconded from Member States, 51 extra personnel are now to be recruited to expand the European Union military structures. Can we have an assurance that this total of 141 personnel will not be exceeded? How long will it be before there is a further increase in staff for the European Union military structures?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Blair tells people at home that European Union's defence policy is all about strengthening NATO. Mr Hoon has even said that there is no concept of a European rapid reaction force as such. From what I hear, everyone speaking on this side of the Channel has an entirely different perspective. The aim is to establish an autonomous European Union military capability to underpin a distinctive EU foreign policy in which the Americans are not involved – in due course, a European army. That is a reality. That is what it is all about. It is very dangerous.</p>
<p class="contents">Tonight we are discussing an unnecessary EUR 10 million. I wonder how long it will be before we are discussing a defence budget of EUR 10 billion or more. The development of an autonomous EU military capability, separate from NATO, has come about as a direct result of initiatives by the British Labour Government in 1998. Now their project has run out of control. We know who is to blame and we cannot support this budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Walter (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, I am truly amazed – I freely admit – by the last speaker as the official spokesman of the PPE group. I really expected nothing of the sort. I would have expected him to be closer to us, now that we know that the Greens have tabled a proposed amendment rejecting this supplementary and amending budget. But nothing should come as a surprise in the European Parliament, especially not in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The common foreign and security policy is one of the policies of the European Union which, to all intents and purposes, has yet to be developed. In the past, it is true, we had a situation in which several Commissioners had to agree between themselves as to who was to look after and deal with which part of the world. At times we remember this and smile. But, when you look at politics from the point of view of content, it is irresponsible of the European Union not to speak with one voice and to behave like a dwarf in the world when it is in fact an economic global player and – to put it nastily – could in theory push the Secretary-General and representative of the common foreign and security policy around like an operetta general.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we are convinced that anyone who wants to take the common foreign and security policy seriously and really implement it, anyone who wants to prevent the lack of European policy in the foreign policy area that we have seen over recent years, must support the common foreign and security policy. This morning, Mr Brok said in the debate on the transatlantic dialogue that we, as the European Union, had no profile in Ukraine and that blunders had been made, which is why we must take the Council's desire to make real progress here seriously and support it. So support in principle is there.</p>
<p class="contents">When the supplementary and amending budget was presented to us – and here I concur fully with Mr Ferber – not only did it fail to convince us; on the contrary we got all worked up and opposed to it. It is wrong to try and hide such an important area which is so crucial to the future of the European Union beneath a gentlemen's agreement between Parliament and the Council in a budget over which only the Council has any influence. All that does is to demonstrate that you do not want any parliamentary control or any parliamentary support. Which is unacceptable. We said as much from the outset and we shall continue to take this view and to formulate our policy and vote accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">But if you enter into negotiations and can clear up this point, i.e. if you can demonstrate that the supplementary and amending budget has been changed so that we can assume in future that we have are involved and have a say, when there is a separate chapter under which the Council shapes future policy in the common foreign and security policy area with parliamentary support and control, then you have to agree to it if you really want to make progress. That is not the time to stand on the sidelines and say, we are waiting to see what happens next.</p>
<p class="contents">In all events, one thing is clear: when in reply to questions from the relevant Commissioner one is told in the Committee on Foreign Affairs or in the Committee on Budgets, with the wink of an eye, according to my sources, that there is no overlap, then it is hardly surprising that people ask questions and want to know exactly how things stand. What we shall not support – and I say this now as a member of the budgetary authority, we are talking here first and foremost as the budgetary authority – are overlapping structures. We cannot stand and watch two different people doing the same work under the same structures for the same tasks in the European Union. That cannot be.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, we have to know what the common foreign and security policy should look like in the future and who is to be responsible for it. We need concepts here and the Council and Commission need to know where they stand here. We shall, of course, bring our standpoint very clearly to bear in the overall debate. We shall wield our power as budgetary authority on every future demand in order to stop this sort of blunder. Now is not the time to be petty. Europe's share of the common foreign and security policy is still very small. We should not start by being petty. But we shall monitor how everything develops very closely, we shall address painful subjects and say stop as soon as we get the feeling that we are being taken for a ride. That cannot be. We shall agree here, but everyone should know that we shall be extremely vigilant in connection both with heading 5 and with how expenditure develops and with future developments in the common foreign and security policy. Of course, we shall also give our input so that a forward-looking policy for the world and for Europe as a whole can be developed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know that it was the result of hard negotiations in which the rapporteur and the other representatives of the Committee on Budgets successfully defended the rights of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">With the supplementary and amending budget the Council intends to set up three new directorates within its General Secretariat to implement the common European security and defence policy. These directorates are: 1. a Political Affairs Directorate, 2. an Operations and Exercises Directorate, and 3. an External Action Mechanisms Directorate. There would be a total of 140 employees involved in this new organisation, of which 51 would be in newly created posts. One’s attention is drawn the urgency of the situation. Why is there such a hurry to create the new posts immediately, even though the actual budget is to be discussed in a few months’ time?</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem is the overlapping of functions. The structure of the organisation menacingly indicates that the same functions are to be discharged in the areas of both crisis prevention and civil crisis management in the Commission and the Council. This overlapping must definitely be prevented.</p>
<p class="contents">Under pressure from Parliament, the Council is now creating a special Title in its budget for the common security and defence policy. It is obvious that this will involve the creation of an entirely new Council activity, which will, in fact, have nothing to do with normal administrative expenditure. For this reason the ‘gentlemen’s agreement’ between Parliament and the Council, according to which they undertake not to interfere in each other’s budgets, cannot be extended to these actions. Expenditure relating to the common security and defence policy falls within the competence of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it should be noted that the margin for ‘Administrative Expenditure’ in heading 5 is now only EUR 34 million. On the threshold of enlargement this is so little that it does not make possible any operative additional expenditure at the cost of administrative expenditure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We already had a taste of it in committee when Mr Laschet suddenly stepped forward ardently advocating rejection, despite belonging to the same group as the rapporteur. If we are in favour of rejection today, it is not because we do not appreciate Mr Ferber's work. On the contrary, we truly believe that Mr Ferber was a tough negotiator. We have the greatest respect. Nonetheless, we take the view that one voice here in Parliament must give a clear warning because a development is being introduced here which should give us all cause for concern.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the previous speaker, I consider that this agreement cannot come under the gentlemen's agreement because it does not concern administrative expenditure. These are politically charged questions, as Mr Ferber has already made clear in his speech. They are also questions of transparency and control of the common foreign and security policy and of defence policy. Here too we are of one opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">But Mr Ferber believes that introducing a separate title is sufficient guarantee that Parliament will be able to exercise control in the future. We have our doubts. We take the view that this separate title alone does not empower Parliament; on the contrary, because these posts are the Council's responsibility, they are beyond our influence and control. I think this is the deciding factor; not just the overlap, but the question of who can exercise control. What is at stake here is the delicate balance of power between Parliament, the Commission and the Council. The Council is taking on more and more, trying to resolve more and more intergovernmentally rather than by really communitising these areas. That would mean making the Commission responsible and strengthening Parliament's right of control. That is our one great fear, namely that we have no real control.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also another point which must also be addressed. In our view this question should be resolved in a conciliation procedure, not under a trialogue, because that would demonstrate exactly how much importance we attach to this question and just how much store we set by Parliament's having full right of control.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the Council should be quite clear that Parliament will not brook this policy of using supplementary budgets to alter political relations and the political balance of power. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First, may I assure you on behalf of the Commission that we shall make very sure that no overlapping structures are created – and I say that not just as the member of the Commission responsible for the budget. Secondly, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur and the Committee on Budgets on using their initiative and exerting pressure to bring about a change in how the budget is represented, a change which affects not just how it is represented per se but which represents an important contribution towards both enhanced democratic control and transparency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
