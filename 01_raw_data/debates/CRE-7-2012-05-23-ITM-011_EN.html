<p class="contents">It is indeed with deep concern that we witness increasing tensions between these two countries. We reached a critical stage last month with South Sudan’s seizure and occupation of the Heglig oil fields and Sudan’s ongoing aerial bombardment of South Sudanese territory.</p>
<p class="contents">The High Representative strongly condemned these acts by both sides and urged both parties to end hostilities immediately and return to the negotiating table. President Van Rompuy telephoned South Sudan’s President Salva Kiir to call for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of its forces. On 23 April, the Foreign Affairs Council welcomed South Sudan’s withdrawal from Heglig under strong international pressure and called for an immediate cessation of hostilities, including an end to attacks by the two countries on each other’s territory, whether directly or through proxies, the withdrawal of all security personnel from Abyei, and the avoidance of further provocation, including inflammatory rhetoric.</p>
<p class="contents">On 24 April, the African Union Peace and Security Council adopted a road map with a series of clear steps and timelines for ending hostilities and bringing the parties back to the negotiating table. Following that, on 2 May, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2046 which endorsed the African Union’s road map. This is a major step. It reflects a high degree of consensus in the international community. It is also significant that this initiative came from the African Union (AU). Sudan and South Sudan have both accepted the road map and a cessation of hostilities. Now they must match their words by action. The parties must take the necessary steps to activate the Joint Border Verification and Monitoring Mission immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">In her statement on 5 May, the High Representative warmly welcomed the road map set out in UN Security Council Resolution 2046. The EU calls on the parties to implement it without qualification or delay. The EU welcomes South Sudan’s withdrawal of its forces from the Abyei area and calls on the government of Sudan to do so too. Both parties must also stop supporting rebels and proxy forces in each other’s territory.</p>
<p class="contents">The parties now have three months to reach agreement on all outstanding issues. If they fail to do so, the UN, the AU and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) will present detailed proposals for a settlement. In the event of non-compliance, the Security Council has threatened to impose non-military sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">The road map also addresses the conflict in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile State, which is linked to the current tensions between Sudan and South Sudan. The government of Sudan must allow immediate humanitarian access to all civilians affected by the conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that an inclusive political settlement is needed to resolve this conflict. The EU would urge the government of Sudan and the Sudanese People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM) in the north to comply with the requirement in the Security Council resolution to reach a negotiated settlement. The EU thinks that progress on inclusive governance and democratic reform is needed in both Sudan and South Sudan to allow the root causes of internal conflicts to be addressed. The national constitutional review process in both countries is an important opportunity in this respect, provided the process is fully inclusive.</p>
<p class="contents">In the north, we remain seriously concerned about the detention of human rights defenders, journalists, opposition politicians and peaceful student protestors. One of the basic principles of the comprehensive peace agreement was the establishment of democratic governance, based on respect for diversity and basic freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">In the south, the human rights situation is also of concern. We welcome the recent visit of the UN Human Rights High Commissioner, Navi Pillay, to South Sudan to help the government address these challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU remains committed to the concept of two viable states. We were pleased that President Salva Kiir, when he visited Brussels in March, informed us of his government’s wish to accede to the EU-ACP Partnership Agreement, the Cotonou Agreement. This will provide us with a framework for future development cooperation. As partners, we can establish a dialogue on the issues which are the core principles of this partnership: democracy, the rule of law, and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has mobilised substantial development assistance for South Sudan in the form of ‘special funds’ from the European Development Fund to a total of EUR 285 million. We will support South Sudan’s development agenda and nation-building efforts through support for rural development and agriculture, health and education, as well as the rule of law and democratic governance. The EU is also planning to deploy a Common Security and Defence Policy mission to increase security at Juba International Airport.</p>
<p class="contents">In the north, we find the government’s decision not to ratify the revised Cotonou Agreement of 2005 regrettable. Nevertheless, the EU has made development funds available to assist the most vulnerable populations in conflict-affected areas such as Darfur, eastern Sudan, Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile. This is in addition to our substantial humanitarian assistance programme. We also support democratisation, human rights and grassroots inter-community dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget the conflict in Darfur, where the situation is still of great concern. Although there have been some voluntary returns, some 1.7 million internally displaced people are still living in camps, and there has been fresh displacement. The joint UN/AU peacekeeping mission, UNAMID, still faces restrictions on its freedom of movement imposed by the government of Sudan. Humanitarian access to much of the Jebel Mara region remains blocked. We welcome the Doha document on peace in Darfur as a positive first step towards reaching a comprehensive and inclusive peace settlement, but it needs to be fully implemented. The Council of the European Union has repeatedly recalled the government of Sudan’s obligation to cooperate fully with the International Criminal Court pursuant to UN Security Council Resolution 1593.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Sudan and South Sudan remains one of great concern. I have made clear that the EU continues to promote all efforts to bring peace and stability to both countries. We remain committed to supporting the emergence of two viable states living in peaceful coexistence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a very worrying situation. This is a country that has been devastated over a prolonged period of time by violence in one shape or another, and it was presumed that the secession of South Sudan would at least produce some agreed route to peace and stability in that region. People are suffering, people are hungry, and people are displaced, despite the fact that this is a region with the potential for very profitable oil exports.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very difficult to deal with the situation but, at the present time, we have to try to contain it. We have to deal, in particular, with the humanitarian crisis there. I would ask us to ensure – especially in those refugee camps outside Sudan where people are gathering – that there is sufficient support and supplies for those people, and that we do everything possible to provide for their security.</p>
<p class="contents">Events in the region of Sudan and South Sudan are an indication of the sort of thing that can happen when there is secession or when there is no stability. Many of us here celebrate the Arab Spring, but in fact, we are not sure what is going to follow it, and good governance simply has not been the tradition in many of the countries concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is time that we worked with the African Union, in terms of training and supplies and resources, to try to get them to build their capacity to make this region a stable region. The European Union cannot do everything. The United Nations cannot do everything. When these problems arise, they are very costly – costly not only in terms of lives, and in terms of disruption for people, including in regions like this where people perhaps depend on oil and exports, but also in terms of the humanitarian aid we are going to be required to supply. It is costly.</p>
<p class="contents">Why can the resources not be found early on to invest with the African Union in trying to ensure that they are equipped to prevent this sort of situation, to develop good governance, and to enable them to be the first port of call when such events do take place? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It heavily funded South Sudan’s access to independence by supporting the 2005 comprehensive peace agreement. It was either that or war. We were well aware of that. At the time, problems had not yet been solved. Not a single problem had been solved: neither citizenship, nor currency, nor the question of debt, nor, above all, the question of the distribution of oil between the two countries, Sudan and South Sudan. Now it is exploding in our face! However, what has been exploding in our face and worrying me far more for a year is China because, at international level, it controls the entire oil industry, from extraction to refinery operations, and it is buying the oil. One would say that, all of a sudden, the European Union, which has done so much, has, somehow, disappeared from the scene. It is somewhat embarrassing.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome UN Security Council Resolution 2046, which is a huge step forward and which we are going to be able to follow. However, I have three wishes. The first is that the European Parliament, finally, will 1) follow up election observation missions in a country such as this which, it was clear, was going to be fragile, 2) send missions, 3) provide follow up and 4) receive the South Sudanese here. My second wish is that the European Union, which is doing so much, which has done so much, and which is continuing to do a great deal thanks, in particular, to our special representative, will enjoy excellent visibility in everyone’s eyes. Then, I would like the position of the European Union, which is a balanced position between the North and the South, to remain in place, in spite of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir. Finally, I would like priority to be given to the humanitarian emergency, especially in relation to the Blue Nile State and Southern Kordofan. What is happening there is unimaginable, and we have not succeeded, so far, in gaining access to these regions, which are suffering tragedies on a daily basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The problems we are experiencing today were well known long before South Sudan gained independence and even when the agreement was signed five years ago. It is also recognised that there is no military solution to this conflict. What has changed is the scale of the conflict. Since South Sudan gained independence, this is no longer an intra-state dispute between two parties within a single state, but an international conflict. It is therefore international law which must provide the solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to pay tribute to the European External Action Service, which did all it could do. That is to say, it focused its efforts on settling this matter in a way that would respect international law, while devoting all the instruments contained in its multiple tool box to the search for a solution to this conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the various mediation attempts by the African Union, following the communiqués of the African Union Peace and Security Council, and following UN Security Council Resolution 2046, the markers along the way to a political settlement are now known. Consequently, the efforts of the African institutions are beginning to demonstrate their usefulness. The European Union has supported the capacity of Africa to take ownership of its own security interests since the early 2010s. Today, the European Union also remains an indispensable partner of the two countries resulting from the separation of Sudan.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, the principal humanitarian actor, the principal actor in development, the principal actor in the political dialogue with the Sudanese and the South Sudanese, holds one of the keys to the solution to the current conflict. One of the keys but not the only one. The EU is thus addressing one of the underlying causes of this desperate situation – poverty, extreme poverty – which undermines the foundations of any sustainable stability. The South Sudanese, as well as their partners in the North, are, however, jointly responsible for finding a solution to the conflict. They must rise to the occasion. It is not sufficient simply to have a state; it is also necessary to be able to manage it. The presence of the EU is much greater than its visibility. There is no solution, then, no alternative; the only possibility is a return to the conflict during which two million people were left to ‘snuff it’ – pardon the expression – against a background of general indifference, over a period of ten years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have a feeling that they are preaching to the converted. I have not yet heard anyone with whom I disagree, either from the Council or among my colleagues, and I have to conclude that we are all truly at our wits’ end over the situation in Sudan and South Sudan.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, I welcome the fact that the UN Security Council has unanimously approved the road map for peace between Sudan and South Sudan and the fact that South Sudan has now promised to withdraw its troops from Abyei. But what good will this do us at the moment?</p>
<p class="contents">I fear that we are going to end up in a lengthy process that we could perhaps compare to that existing between Eritrea and Ethiopia: a border conflict that flares up time and time again and in which both countries – allow me to compare Eritrea to South Sudan here and Ethiopia to Sudan, all inadequacies of this comparison aside – are using the border dispute as an excuse to do nothing about health care for their own people, about social services, famine, education or about anything that their people need so desperately.</p>
<p class="contents">The rainy season is coming to South Sudan and, as a result, 60% of the country will become impenetrable. The roads will cease to be passable and, during that period, food stocks for the people will have to be sufficient. We can talk about the road map, we can talk about a lengthy process, but how do we manage to get some food out to these people right away?</p>
<p class="contents">Another sign that makes me think that South Sudan is not ready for the job of providing a decent future for its own people is the fact that it has stopped selling oil. I can well understand the underlying reason, but if you allow your money to dry up and if you are not able to do your own shopping any more, what does that say about you? What becomes more important for you then? Your people that need to be fed or the border dispute with Sudan? It seems to me that our task in this is to ensure that South Sudan starts behaving decently again and that it finds a market for its oil. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following the establishment of an independent South Sudan, this is no longer a civil war, and any action by either side now has the features of an international conflict. If the South Sudanese army were also to gain the support of the Ugandan army, we could be dealing with a regional armed conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">The current actions by the international community in relation to the two Sudanese states are, in many ways, incomprehensible. South Sudan is trying to achieve the objectives of the UN resolution, as evidenced by the decision to withdraw troops from the disputed Heglig territory and its declaration of willingness to engage in talks. Meanwhile, the world is officially condemning the violent actions of the government in Khartoum, while failing to take any decisions, such as what sanctions should be imposed. There is no coherent strategy dealing with the refugee problem, which threatens to become a humanitarian disaster. Neither is there any appropriate response to the flourishing arms trade. The regular rearming of the Sudanese forces by China, Russia and Belorussia, as reported by witnesses, deserves special condemnation.</p>
<p class="contents">More than half a million citizens of South Sudan living in the northern border provinces have no regulated legal status. In view of the ethnic cleansing which is still ongoing, this is a very dangerous situation. To date, no plan for free movement in the border zone has been implemented. This fact alone highlights the need for a new border demarcation in some sections.</p>
<p class="contents">The accusation and indictment of President Bashir for genocide by the International Criminal Court is reason enough for the West, including European countries, to toughen up its policies in relation to Khartoum. The oil business cannot be a shield against, or obstacle to, the proper functioning of international cooperation and the prevention of ethnic discrimination. I would call on both parties to cease offensive actions and start constructive talks, and I would also appeal to international institutions and to Baroness Ashton to participate actively in working on a solution to this border dispute. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The area has virtually been cut off from the outside world for months now, held in a stranglehold of the Sudanese armed forces. Enduring great hardship, the civilian population is trying to survive in mountain caves. Meanwhile, there are also large numbers of Nuba refugees at the Juba reception centre in South Sudan. The image of this fledgling state is just as bleak; just read the internal report by the World Bank. Certainly, it talks very frankly about an extraordinary situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Why, too, has the independent South Sudan been such a huge disappointment to its international friends and financial supporters in this respect? The answer is as simple as it is disconcerting: the irresponsible behaviour of the totally incompetent state leadership under President Salva Kiir. The complete shutdown of oil production since January 2012 (which had accounted for 98% of government revenue), in conjunction with nepotism and widespread corruption, backs up this heart-breaking conclusion. Already, approximately half of the South Sudanese live below the poverty line and the forecast for 2013 is for an increase to as much as 83%.</p>
<p class="contents">The question I would like to put to the European Union, and thus also to my own Dutch Government, who will soon visit the region, is this: are his European supporters finally going to send a clear warning to President Salva Kiir? Because, we need to ask what has happened to all of that money? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Once again, the civilian population of both countries are enduring indescribable suffering. All violent attacks and assaults are naturally to be condemned, and naturally we must call for a peaceful solution to the conflict. However, that does not absolve us from talking about the causes, or from looking back critically at whether the EU’s clear commitment to the splitting off of South Sudan was responsible given the current circumstances. There will be no quick solution; that much is certain. It is also certain, however, that the problems cannot be resolved by means of armed conflict. Right now, it is essential that we maintain the arms embargo that in fact exists, in order to prevent further escalations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you that in 2004, the EU’s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) imposed an embargo on arms supplies to Sudan and, in 2011, also to South Sudan, but this was unilaterally relaxed in November 2011 to support security sector reform in South Sudan. However difficult it may be, we need to push for diplomatic negotiations. If the international community wants to help end the conflict, it must do so in the role of a neutral mediator, not led by its own interests. The role that the EU has played has not been neutral.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very concerned as to whether there will be more such scenarios in future, whether we will see more natural resource-rich regions of Africa splitting off and a spiralling of state disintegration. The foreign policy instrument of state building must not be allowed to be an instrument of such a development. Using access to reserves of natural resources to guide us in our foreign policy activities will bring not peace, but rather death and misery. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As well as the major disputes of north versus south, there are continual armed inter-ethnic and internecine disputes. Smaller conflicts over water or land rights, cattle theft, rape and kidnap escalate all too easily in Sudan. Peace talks will certainly not be easy in this country, where entire generations have grown up without basic services, with violence the only way they know to resolve conflicts; where a word given today is generally already broken the next day. Even if the African Union special envoy succeeds in getting peace talks resumed, the military status in the border area will undoubtedly remain a stumbling block. Even should a peaceful solution succeed, there will remain enormous potential for conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is all the more important to restore basic services as a measure to accompany peace. In the long term, the country’s oil wealth needs to be utilised to achieve a fair distribution of power and resources and to drive forward the process of democratisation. However, I believe that the EU aid granted for this should also serve European interests. Following the Chinese model, development aid could be linked to supplies of natural resources. The huge reserves of crude oil in Southern Sudan could play an important role in Europe’s oil supply in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards EU aid to South Sudan, the problem of illegal migration into the Union must not be disregarded either. That is why I feel that appropriate readmission agreements should be negotiated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are all concerned about the worsening of the security and humanitarian situation in the region. A road map has, admittedly, been approved, which is a welcome step forward. However, I cannot help thinking that the measures taken to date are far too timid. It has to be recognised that the Sudanese army is still dropping bombs and taking other military action. The security and humanitarian situation of the civilian population is getting worse and causing massive population displacement. The humanitarian assistance of the UN agencies has been blocked. I could go on …</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the scale of the emergency calls for the implementation of specific negotiation initiatives as well as a clear timeframe which would guide the progress of the process. It is important that the first meeting of the Joint Political and Security Mechanism is held as soon as possible so that priorities to foster peace and security can be identified and an action and work plan established.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this same emergency must inspire the work of international partners, which must undertake to support the efforts made by both sides. I believe that activating the Joint Border Verification and Monitoring Mechanism and sending international observers are vital aspects of international action which must guarantee that the decisions taken are actually implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, the United Nations and the African Union must work closely in this direction and give substance to their commitment by fulfilling their role as partner in a practical way and therefore having the courage to address the issue of sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the European Union needs to be more proactive in seeking a peaceful resolution of tensions. The EU should carry out regular monitoring – otherwise why send election observation missions? – and not just act on an <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> basis when a major crisis requires it.</p>
<p class="contents">We must demonstrate courage so that the texts and the declarations can be transformed into action.</p>

Accusations, attacks and retaliation are impeding the resolution of outstanding issues, particularly the sharing of oil resources, the constitutional status of Abyei and the demilitarisation of the border areas. The European Union, which invested so much in peacefully resolving the conflict by separating the two states, now has an obligation to engage immediately in implementing the road map for the cessation of hostilities adopted by the African Union, with the support of the United Nations Security Council. Following up on the electoral missions in the north and south must not cease to be one of the European Union’s objectives, nor must the surrender of President Omar al-Bashir to the International Criminal Court. Democratic change in the north of Sudan depends on that.</p>
<p class="contents">The excellent work of the High Representative must be duly consolidated by a Herculean effort to build the capacities of South Sudan’s government. Without this, no peace efforts will really make a difference to the peoples of the region. The EU must also properly support the work of humanitarian organisations in the region, which have encountered many difficulties in providing support for thousands of displaced people and victims of the conflict. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The peoples of South Sudan and of Sudan are enjoying neither peace, stability nor, least of all, development.</p>
<p class="contents">‘Walk on your own two legs, walk for a long time, find water and share it’, goes an old saying from the region, but this certainly does not reflect reality. Today, at the most, people walk for a long time but, if they have not stepped on a mine first, water is not easy to find until the rainy season. In fact, it is not easy to help Juba, just as it is not easy to put pressure on Khartoum.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I believe that action by the Commission, the European External Action Service and the European Union ought to be based on certain fundamental principles. Above all, we must keep attention focused on this crisis, so that it does not risk becoming a forgotten crisis, one of those points on the agenda that is shelved and deprived of the attention of the media and the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must insist on full application of Security Council Resolution 2046, which is a key element. Thirdly, we must not be unprepared for what may happen in Khartoum, keeping in mind the fact that Sadiq al-Mahdi, former Sudanese prime minister, evoked the prospect of an Arab Spring in Sudan, in view of the failures both of the administration and of President al-Bashir himself. Let us therefore remain vigilant, to avoid a recurrence of what happened in North Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, as we are the main donor to South Sudan, we should have more say in the application of laws in Juba. Currently, uniformed soldiers in South Sudan are appropriating land in an arbitrary fashion. The Sudanese People’s Liberation Movement must re-establish its credibility as far as citizens are concerned, which will be quite difficult without a minimum legal system that is effective and independent. This ought to be the European Union’s first priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Without delay, I will finish with a final point, to which we have already drawn attention: the creation for South Sudan of a transparent fund to collect the proceeds of oil resources, as happened in Timor. Objections may be made that Timor was good news: well, we would like South Sudan to be good news too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is the same old story – the West and oil. What about poverty? How important was poverty to the West?

A new era began for this country. Prospects seemed good. Major oil reserves guaranteed a decent national income. South Sudan also benefits from foreign aid – in 2011, the total foreign aid declared was USD 700 million.</p>
<p class="contents">However, less than a year later, the prospects for South Sudan no longer look so promising. Why? I think we need a good understanding of the background to events. There is practically no tax system in South Sudan. Taxes are collected in theory, but in practice, the system does not work, which is why income from sales of crude oil represents 97% of the state budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is that South Sudanese oil must be transported via the only pipeline, which leads through Sudanese territory to the city of Port Sudan. Recent enemies can hardly be expected to cooperate easily. Accusations and complaints have been made by both parties. What is more, South Sudan has long preferred another solution for transporting oil – through Kenya to Mombasa. In December 2011, a preliminary agreement was signed for the construction of a new pipeline. The problem is that President Kiir shut down the northern pipeline one month later, which did not impress the Sudanese. It seems to me that this region will not be stabilised until the issues of oil and oil transport have been resolved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

More than 150 000 people have been displaced. The fighting and shelling are incessant along the border, and these two countries, which have everything they need to prosper, are squandering their resources in a hopeless conflict, which simply adds tension in a region of Africa where there is already no shortage.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time that Khartoum and Juba complied with the resolutions of the African Union and the United Nations, put an end to hostilities and resumed negotiations without conditions. The two new countries undertook before their international mentors to resolve outstanding issues: the demarcation of the 20% of the border remaining to be drawn, the status of the South Sudanese residing in the North and of the Sudanese residing in the South and, above all, the sharing of oil reserves. It is in the interests of both the North, thanks to transit, and the South, which has 70% of reserves, to conclude an agreement that would benefit them both.</p>
<p class="contents">However, neither should count on the silence of the international community in the face of the humanitarian drama which is being played out. If dialogue between Khartoum and Juba is not resumed quickly, the United Nations will have to exert pressure and impose sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">I note that, in this matter, China decided to assume its responsibilities. So much the better! However, it is necessary – it is essential – that the European Union continues to assert its position and its political presence. Our balanced position is the right one. Let us assert it with greater force and clarity and, above all – and I address these words to the European External Action Service (EEAS), but it has heard them already – let us not forget the conflict and drama of Darfur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The two countries depend on each other economically and thus need to find ways to cooperate. The two States therefore need to stop stirring up and supporting the other side’s enemies, as this is hampering the peace process.

Particular attention must be paid to that issue.</p>

My immediate thought was that the information which arrived Monday would not be confirmed, but I have seen that the information has been confirmed and, in this case, I believe that we can describe it as a new act of provocation from Sudan. In my view, it is an appalling act which actually comes just a few days after Thabo Mbeki had announced that the leaders of both states had expressed their desire to return to the negotiating table.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the recent attacks confirm that Sudan is using stalling tactics. I also believe that President al-Bashir is probably reluctant at the moment to negotiate the road map for ending the conflict. This is why I am encouraging the African Union’s negotiator and the team he is leading to speed up the negotiations with Sudan and work towards preventing the escalation of a new war in the Sudanese region.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by commending the temporary UN force in Abyei for their peacekeeping efforts in the area. I hope that this force’s mandate, which expired yesterday, will be extended in view of the deteriorating situation in the region.

The current conflict was easy to predict, so why could it not be avoided? Why do the same patterns have to be repeated in different parts of the world?

The African Union has taken a significant first step in the form of a road map, which the United Nations Security Council adopted unanimously in its resolution. As for the EU, the Foreign Affairs Council, the President of the European Council and Baroness Ashton have all urged the relevant parties to commit to this road map towards peace.</p>
<p class="contents">The UN resolution is basically a means for persuading the parties to set up a 10 kilometre-long demilitarised border zone, to establish a Joint Border Verification and Monitoring Mechanism there, and to initiate unconditional peace talks. Sudan’s leaders, however, seem to be dallying, and are always imposing new conditions for the commencement of peace negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">This is obviously only a first step. In the longer term, we have to determine where the border lies, decide on the distribution of income from oil, and resolve ethnic disputes. However, the most urgent course of action is to help ordinary people. More than half of the population of South Sudan, some 4.7 million, are suffering from a food shortage. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs fears that South Sudan could drift into even greater poverty. Another problem is the poor infrastructure, which makes it difficult to get humanitarian aid into the country. The continuous arrival of refugees from north to south is placing a further burden on this new, fragile country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What the EU should do is address much more actively Chinese activity in the region, because it is not a great stabilising influence. It is good news that the Security Council has recently extended its mission in the region by six months.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need today is for the Joint Border Verification and Monitoring Mechanism – which should deploy international observers to monitor developments on the ground – to be up and running. We also need to address the humanitarian situation: almost 400 000 South Sudanese have managed to return to Sudan after independence, thanks to the help of the many frontline partners.

A man such as Omar al-Bashir, who has exercised his rule for many years in all parts of his country in the way with which we are familiar, is continuing as before in the part of the country remaining to him as regards human rights, and I doubt that he has a genuine interest in the stabilisation of Sudan.</p>
<p class="contents">We, as the EU, undoubtedly can and must help with the clearly still existing gross shortcomings in Sudan’s governance. I hope that by doing so, we can prevent Sudan turning into a new Eritrea, as one of the previous speakers feared.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community must now act together. The World Security Council resolution provides the legal and political framework. The permanent members of the Security Council have a particular responsibility for its implementation since they have special interests and influence in Khartoum; I am talking, for example, about China and Russia. All those responsible in the north and the south must guarantee access to humanitarian aid.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must work closely with the African Union to bring about the resumption of peace talks. My basic stance is that, wherever possible, we must promote African solutions for African conflicts.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of oil, however, it is clear that the north and south are mutually dependent. One cannot do without the other. The buyers of the oil should realise that they will only gain access to the oil if they make proposals to Khartoum and Juba that reflect the interests of both. To this extent, it would be desirable for the EU to coordinate its actions with, for example, China. I feel sure that the EU would not prevent this from happening. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Issues relating to oil transit fees, border demarcation and the legal status of people living in the border areas have still not been resolved.</p>

<p class="contents">The international community, which monitored the referendum process and the creation of a new state, should strive ceaselessly for a peaceful end to the present dispute, in accordance with the road map which was adopted, and should look for solutions that will convince the governments of both countries to begin peace negotiation.

Border demarcation disputes also affect the oil area around Heglig, and the Secretary-General of the UN, Ban Ki-moon, has described as illegal the attempt made by South Sudanese troops to take control of the disputed areas and called for the forces to withdraw from the region. Although the South Sudanese Government withdrew its troops from the area, the President of Sudan, Omar al-Bashir, threatened to close the transit pipeline through which South Sudanese oil flows to Port Sudan on the Red Sea coast. The South Sudanese Government does not have any other routes for transporting oil, and it is therefore completely dependent on the generosity of its northern partner and neighbour. In this situation, it is incomprehensible that the leaders of the two countries cannot find a common peaceful settlement of the dispute, and that they are exacerbating the misery and suffering of the citizens of their countries through military conflicts that resolve nothing. Therefore, we must help them and insist more strongly that the regimes in Khartoum and Juba resolve their disputes at the negotiating table and in accordance with international law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Before we in Europe feel too superior, we, too, have seen failed states that have overlooked deep vertical divisions. I hope that wiser counsels will prevail and that the people of the two states will eventually become better neighbours than they were fellow-citizens. We must learn from the mistakes of others; the creation of states with vertical divisions is always ill-advised. Is freedom of movements of peoples within Europe, and especially from the Third World into Europe, really such a good idea? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The human suffering is appalling and the lack of sufficient political will on both sides to resolve the outstanding issues must be addressed. The EU has invested heavily in stabilising the situation, and I fully agree with all the speakers who have urged the Council to keep the situation in Sudan and South Sudan high on the EU agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU supported the Sudanese peace process throughout the period of the comprehensive peace agreement of 2005 and sent two election observation missions to Sudan and South Sudan to observe the elections in 2010 and the referendum on South Sudan’s independence in 2011. Both were led by Véronique De Keyser MEP, and I will use this opportunity personally to thank her for her commitment. Ms De Keyser, I have, of course, listened particularly closely to your most important comments, based on your experience.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU will continue to support the work of the African Union panel under the chairmanship of former South African President, Thabo Mbeki. The EU, together with the rest of the international community, calls on the parties to implement the road map set out in UN Security Council Resolution 2046 and to resolve all outstanding issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Mbeki has announced that he is hoping to convene a meeting of the parties in Addis Ababa next week. We sincerely hope that this will lead to substantial progress as soon as possible, and I can inform this House that the EU will remain committed to fostering peace and security in Sudan and South Sudan so that all Sudanese people will finally be able to benefit from the dividends they bring. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In recent days, however, the parties in the conflict have taken steps in the right direction. It is important that talks get back on the right track. The parties must take definite steps to put Mbeki’s Implementation Panel road map into effect. I also support the possible sanctions mentioned in the resolution adopted on 2 May 2012 by the Security Council, if the parties concerned do not comply with the road map. Both sides must end the armed activity in the Abyei region, the oil crisis needs to be resolved, and consensus must be reached on issues of citizenship. It is excellent that the parties concerned have succeeded in working together to establish an airlift between Sudan and South Sudan, allowing many people to return to their home districts before the rainy season begins. There has also been progress in matters of citizenship. I hope that we will soon see the same sort of progress made in the oil crisis and with regard to Abyei. It is also absolutely crucial that humanitarian workers can access the Abyei region via Sudan, because at the moment, this is only possible from South Sudan, nor should we forget that there are still hundreds of thousands of refugees in the area. Regardless of which Sudan Abyei decides it will join in the forthcoming referendum, the humanitarian needs of civilians must be guaranteed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
