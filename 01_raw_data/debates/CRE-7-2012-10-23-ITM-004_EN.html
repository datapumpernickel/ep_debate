<p class="contents">There we have it, Mr President: that is what budget experts are like, they look at every tiny detail. May I say that I greatly welcome the intensive work that you have done, in your capacity as President of this House, to increase democratic accountability in European budgetary policy, notwithstanding possible differences of opinion about the interview you gave on Saturday evening. That is for another time and place, however.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Kalfin and I are today presenting an interim report which is ultimately intended to speed up and facilitate the multiannual financial framework approval procedure. We do so on the basis of the work done in the past by the Special Committee on policy challenges – the SURE Committee – chaired by Ms Jutta Haug, with Mr Salvador Garriga as rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, I would like to express my particular thanks to the present and previous Presidencies, for what we have here is a pilot project: before and after the meetings of the General Affairs Council (GAC), a briefing and debriefing are held on the negotiating boxes discussed there, and the European Parliament’s negotiating team was also invited to attend the informal GAC meetings. Hopefully, this will result in greater mutual understanding and a way forward which is based on actual content, not prejudgements. It goes without saying, however, that this pilot project – this working method – does not, in itself, guarantee any outcomes.</p>
<p class="contents">Our analysis is not just about a magic number, incidentally. We worked very hard on content and on the challenges facing the European Union in the globalisation process. We looked at the existing multiannual programme and compared the Commission’s proposals to it, and considered how we should proceed. For us, of course, it is about numbers, and about the right numbers. It is about content, and it is about comprehensive flexibility for the annual budget procedures. It is about safeguarding own resources which are worthy of the name. At this particular time, it is also about the unity of the European budget: the Treaty is quite clear on that point. </p>
<p class="contents">Let us face facts: some Member States have been talking about a magic number and yet they want to see the cohesion and agricultural policies remaining as they are; they are not interested in anything else. That does not contribute to growth and employment at a difficult time of budget consolidation. If Member States are not willing to provide enough money for the European budget, then they really need to tell us which of the political priorities that they themselves have set will be off the table in future. </p>
<p class="contents">We cannot have successes like Erasmus, which benefits 2.5 million students, and then possibly make cuts there because we want to keep other things in cohesion or agricultural policy! We cannot say that 3 % is reserved for research and development and then cut the Commission’s proposals for Horizon 2020! We cannot claim that Europe must prepare for a new role in foreign and development policy and at the same time fail to achieve our own 0.7 % GNI spending target for official development aid. That is not how it works. This cannot enhance our credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to focus on better spending, of course taking due account of the budget consolidation processes under way in the Member States. To that end, we have made many detailed proposals on how we can work together, on the basis of comprehensive analyses of administrative aspects and the management of the programmes, and how we can achieve better implementation. At the same time, however, we point out that programmes such as <span class="italic">Connecting Europe</span> and lifelong learning should not become casualties as we move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">There are other issues which must also be addressed as part of this process: the debate about synergies between national and European administrations, the question of what should be regulated on the basis of subsidiarity, and where there is excessive bureaucracy which we must dismantle. For example, the Member States have 3 164 embassies and consulates around the world, with an annual budget of EUR 7.5 billion and around 95 000 employees. That is 15 times greater than the 2012 budget of the European External Action Service. So again, let us face facts: these figures should also be mentioned in the interests of truth and honesty, ladies and gentlemen. </p>
<p class="contents">When we say that based on our analysis and the new challenges created by the Treaty of Lisbon, we are in favour, in principle, of contributions being set at a higher level than envisaged in the Commission’s proposals, this also has a firm basis in our analysis. That is something which the Council must understand. However, if no agreement is reached, we will not fade out of sight. What we will be left with, in that case, are the ceilings for 2013 – the ceilings, not the budget – which will remain in place until a solution is found. </p>
<p class="contents">However, our offer, which maintains an appropriate balance between figures – and the more difficult the figures, the more comprehensive flexibility is required – means that we must send out the same clear message that Jean-Luc Dehaene and Anne Jensen have incorporated into our report. We need own resources that are worthy of the name. During the final phase, the Commission made an interesting proposal which also involves the use of the Financial Transaction Tax and, accordingly, a reduction in the national contributions of those Member States introducing this tax. In this context, it is important, in any discussion of a euro capacity or euro facility, to understand that the euro is the rule, not the exception. We cannot outsource the rule. We have to focus on the unity of the European budget so that we have a strong European Union in future too.</p>
<p class="contents">If we take the view that the Financial Transaction Tax is an interesting option for the euro facility, for example, but we would prefer not to introduce it in the context of the European budget, I fail to understand the logic. We are maintaining these core elements of our offer and are in a position to negotiate swiftly and achieve a result as soon as possible – but not at any price! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ivailo Kalfin, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span><span class="bold">− </span>Mr President, I would like to tell you that Parliament’s report on the multiannual financial framework (MFF) does not have a small script. We have said very clearly here everything we wanted to say to the Council at this stage. The role of this report is also very clear: to inform the Council, because the Heads of State or Government will be gathering at the end of November – and before Mr Van Rompuy begins consultations with the Member States – and to explain Parliament’s position on the next financial framework, because the Treaty says that the European Council can only adopt a decision with the agreement of the European Parliament. So we have prepared this report to facilitate the debates in the Council and to provide advance information on Parliament’s position, and we hope this is going to be voted for by a vast majority today.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is very clear and consistent and generates very significant support, as have all Parliament’s positions on the next MFF for nearly two years now. We have been working in the Committee on Policy Challenges (SURE), as Mr Böge mentioned, and have adopted different resolutions in Parliament. We have demonstrated great cross-party unity on the major principles of the next budget. The major principle is that this is an instrument. This is not an accounting exercise but an instrument to achieve political goals, to apply the provisions of the Treaty and to make the European Union viable.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to thank the Commission, especially Vice-President Šefčovič, Commissioner Lewandowski and the Presidency. The Cyprus Presidency, like the presidencies before, has done an excellent job of including Parliament in the decision-making of the Council this time – or at least we had the opportunity to express our opinion very clearly. My thanks also go to you, the President of this Parliament, and to all my colleagues who have been working on this issue, because it is an issue which really unites this House and makes our voice stronger.</p>
<p class="contents">I want very briefly to touch on four points relating to the budget. The first is the size of the budget. I must begin by saying that the Commission’s proposal is not sufficient to finance all the political ambitions that the European Union has set. This is very clear. We have to be aware that the procedure for the next multiannual financial framework is taking place in a very difficult context. We have two challenges – confidence in the European Union and the ability of the European Union to solve these problems, and the need to make fiscal cuts and achieve fiscal consolidation at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">But let us see what the rationale for the European budget is. Firstly, it is not generating a deficit. This means that all the rationale for consolidating national budgets due to overspending in previous years does not hold true at European level. Furthermore, the European budget does what national budgets cannot do in these difficult times. This is an investment budget. It does everything that the national budgets are not able to do because of constraints.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, regarding confidence in the European Union, this budget has a meaning because of leverage, the additional funds that it attracts into investment in the Member States. Ninety-four per cent of the budget goes back to the Member States, and it attracts several times more investment. So a cut of one euro by the European budget would mean a cut of several euros for national, regional, agricultural and competition policies.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to be clear when we speak about the size of the budget. We hear very often from representatives of governments that citizens will not accept a higher European budget. We have to point out to them that we have the same voters. Citizens expect European institutions and national institutions to work together and to put forward a mechanism that will propose an exit from the economic crisis and the creation of growth and jobs, using all the instruments both at national and European level. So I would not set national institutions in opposition to European ones in this case. We have a common interest – we are working for the citizens of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">If some governments need to go back to basic questions such as whether we need more Europe, whether we can do something better at European level than at national level, and whether we are able to set common goals and to fulfil them, then we are ready to re-enter this debate if it is not clear for some governments.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course – and Mr Böge mentioned the flexibility of the budget – in a constrained budget, flexibility is not a technical term. It refers to the possibility of really deploying resources in the most efficient way in order to achieve the goals that we have set.</p>
<p class="contents">I will say a few words about the priorities and content of the budget. We have the traditional policies here, but we have to make sure that for the next seven years the European budget stimulates growth, the creation of growth and the creation of jobs across Europe. This is the function of the European budget. We are ready to take on board all ideas relating to better spending – to a more efficient spending of the European budget – but we need this budget in order to create jobs and growth, especially for young people. We have on many occasions heard the President of the Commission speaking in this House about youth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, just one sentence about the procedure. I want to say here in the plenary something that we have said many times to the presidencies. The MFF considers two procedures: the consent procedure for MFF-related issues and the codecision procedure for nearly 70 legal-basis documents. We do not want to see the Council taking the decision on the codecision procedure, which is the right of Parliament. We will insist on the right of this House to negotiate properly with the Member States and with the Council on all the documents related to codecision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Alain Lamassoure, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Chair of the Committee on Budgets (substitute rapporteur, Jean-Luc Dehaene). </span><span class="bold">− </span><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, thank you for your kind words about our delegation.</p>
<p class="contents">President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, in addition to what our rapporteurs have said, I would like to highlight two crucial points for Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, as far as Parliament is concerned, there can be no agreement on the multiannual financial framework without a political agreement on resources reform: an agreement on the principle of this reform, on the adjustments to the correction mechanisms, on the new own resources and on the calendar for implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone agrees. No democrat can continue to defend the European budget’s current financing system. The rebates that certain countries receive are not just. They simply reflect old balances of power. The annual decision-making procedure is devoid of any political debate and any parliamentary control. None of us here today, irrespective of the institution to which we belong, can explain to the voters how their national contribution is calculated.</p>
<p class="contents">Eighteen months ago, the mere mention of this topic was seen as utopian. Today, the burden of proof lies with those who defend the <span class="italic">status quo</span>. We must thank the Commission and the Cypriot Presidency for that. Unfortunately, the real negotiations on the substance of the reform have not really begun. There is still a huge amount of work to be done to reach a global agreement on the multiannual framework in a month. That is a key point for Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The second key point that I will mention is the preservation of budgetary unity. Last week’s European Council gave President Van Rompuy a mandate to develop the idea of – and I quote – ‘a fiscal capacity’ for the euro area at the December European Council. It stated that it would not be tied in any way to the negotiations on the EU budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say this: for us, this issue completely overlaps today’s negotiations as we are talking about exactly the same thing. We are talking about the same thing when it comes to spending. According to those who promote this idea, we would give additional assistance to the Member States that are applying tough fiscal consolidation measures. Excellent. We can reinvent the Cohesion Fund or the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about the same thing when it comes to revenue. If the revenue from this new fund comes from national contributions, then the countries that finance the fund would clearly use it as a pretext to freeze or even reduce their current contribution to the EU budget. If we think about the own resources that would be directly involved, again they will come from our EU budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are talking about the same thing when it comes to the calendar. We are told: ‘it is an idea for the future, do not worry’. Of course, it will not apply on 1 January 2013, but I imagine that in the midst of the debt crisis, the European Council is not dropping everything to meet in order to take decisions that would apply after 2020, in other words, that would be applied by our successors’ successors. We are thus talking about the same calendar.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, and I must be clear on this, the European Parliament will not give its agreement on the multiannual framework if it does not have a guarantee that all funds that may be created to strengthen European solidarity are integrated in the EU budgetary procedure. That is the basic principle of budgetary unity.</p>
<p class="contents">There may be annexed budgets, annexed tables. There may be special funding for certain policies. What we cannot accept, however, is for the European budget to be frozen in time, like some sort of historical monument, at the symbolic figure of 1 %, and for all of the funds that are needed for new requirements to come from intergovernmental sources, avoiding any form of appropriate parliamentary control. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all know how critical it is that we get the future multiannual financial framework right.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council attaches the highest importance to the timely conclusion of this agreement. It will give the Union the means to act and the capacity to implement its policies. The timing of the agreement is crucial, but so is the quality. We also welcome the very close cooperation on this issue with this Parliament. I am particularly grateful to Mr Lamassoure and the two co-rapporteurs for this file, Reimer Böge and Ivailo Kalfin, for their commitment to this dossier and for their determination to ensure that we reach an outcome which is acceptable to both institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Cyprus Presidency has attached particular importance to continuing the practice of meeting regularly with you, and we will continue to do so until we have an agreement. I would also like to thank Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene and Ms Anna Jensen for their work on the revenue side. The Cyprus Presidency is also working very closely with the President of the European Council as the dossier moves up to the level of the Heads of State and Government.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last few years, the European Union and its Member States have taken important steps in response to the challenges raised by the economic and financial crisis. Looking to the future, the next MFF must ensure that the European Union’s budget is geared to lifting Europe out of the crisis in a sustainable way. We all agree that the budget must act as a catalyst for growth and jobs across Europe, in particular by leveraging productive and human capital investments. Within the future multiannual financial framework, spending needs to be mobilised in order to support growth, employment, competitiveness and convergence, in line with the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time we are all aware of the constraints under which we are working. At a time of exceptional fiscal discipline it is essential that the future MFF reflects the consolidation efforts being made by Member States to bring their deficits and debt onto a more sustainable path. We must ensure that every euro spent brings European added value and that particular attention is given under the future MFF to the quality of spending.</p>
<p class="contents">The work is advancing well. You have seen the revised version of the negotiating box which we produced for the General Affairs Council in September. We also had an informal discussion in the margins of the General Affairs Council last week in Luxembourg. Your contribution through your representatives on that occasion was highly appreciated.</p>
<p class="contents">Later this week we will issue a revised version of the negotiating box. This will put forward an overall approach which will provide a range of figures for various qualitative elements in order to make proposals for the qualitative issues which are linked to the various spending areas. Concerning own resources, the Presidency yesterday released a non-paper to stimulate the discussion, particularly on the very sensitive issue of corrections. Discussions are of course continuing within the Council, and I am therefore not able, at this stage, to give you a clearer position on how the debate on the MFF or own resources is likely to evolve, but the Cyprus Presidency remains confident that, together with Parliament, we will soon be able to outline the parameters of agreement with greater certainty.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the President of the European Council has convened a Special European Council on 22/23 November and has announced that he is ready to prolong the meeting, should it prove necessary. The Cyprus Presidency very much shares this objective, and it is with this in mind that we are continuing to work intensively with all the Member States and yourselves in the run-up to the November meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, honourable Members, we have been following closely your discussions on the interim report drawn up by Reimer Böge and Ivailo Kalfin on which you will be voting later. I wish to thank both of them for their work on this report. It contains a number of important points, which we will bring to the attention of Member States. The same applies to the revenue side and own resources, Mr Dehaene’s report and the work of Ms Anne Jensen. I want to thank them, too, for their excellent work and cooperation. We have had throughout – and we hope that this will continue – an outstanding level of cooperation with committee chairman Mr Lamassoure and the whole negotiating team of the European Parliament. I would like to take this opportunity to thank you personally, Mr President, for your personal involvement and assistance and, most of all, your strong commitment to providing the European Union with the most important instrument in our hands for living up to our ambitions for growth and jobs for the young generation, in order for all of us to honour the contract between generations. Achieving the best possible result on the MFF for the common good of Europe is not just a priority of the Cyprus Presidency, it is a joint endeavour involving this Parliament as well as the Commission and the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the award of the Nobel Prize to the European Union, we must more than ever show European citizens that we are able to unite around a fundamental part of the European project by doing everything to make the European Union more relevant, to prove that the European Union is part of the solution and to offer to each EU citizen a better future. I look forward to hearing your views on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We all agree that this proposal is probably the most important item on the agenda of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission. Through the decision on the MFF we are clearly sending a message to the outside world on whether we are able to deliver on Europe 2020, have enough resources to fund our common policies and can play our important role on the international stage.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also all aware that, for the first time, the multiannual financial framework is being negotiated under the new treaties. Both Janusz Lewandowski and myself have been strong supporters of the clear will of Parliament to exercise its right fully. I would like to thank the Cyprus and Danish Presidencies for having established a very good framework and excellent cooperation with Parliament’s negotiating team and with the Commission. I would say, in particular, that the informal exchange of views before the last General Affairs Council was very important in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the General Affairs Council is the place where the discussions on the MFF are taking place. It is where Janusz and I have been defending the Commission’s proposals and where there is also active involvement of the European Parliament in the whole process.</p>
<p class="contents">We have studied your interim report in great detail and we very much support your starting point that this is an investment budget. We have to repeat this message again and again, because this is the message we have sometimes lost in the negotiations and in the Europe-wide discussions. We have a very strong argument on our side, because even the European Council recognised the catalysing role of the EU budget when it adopted the Compact for growth and jobs in June.</p>
<p class="contents">If you allow me, I shall make a couple of comments on the more horizontal issues before I hand over to my colleague Janusz Lewandowski, who handles all budget questions for the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">First, on the question of the volume of the budget, we are convinced that our proposal of 1.08 % of GNI represents a credible budget and is a balanced figure which would enable us to stabilise the financing of the CAP and the cohesion policy and allow for a noticeable increase in the EU 2020 strategy priorities. We very much appreciate the focus Parliament has put on the improved quality of the spending of the EU budget, because we would like to achieve a qualitative leap in terms of EU funding and European added value. We would like to increase the efficiency, effectiveness and simplification of their delivery.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of the application of macro-economic conditionality, I take note of the report’s opposition to the Commission’s proposal, and I would just like to underline that the Commission’s proposal has been conceived not as coercive measures but rather to incentivise structural reforms and thus optimise effectiveness and absorption capacity. They are not meant to penalise the Member States or regions that need financial support most urgently, but rather to ensure that precious capital will actually help address the very deficiencies identified in country-specific recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">On specific points raised in the report on administrative expenditure, I can confirm that the 5 % staff reduction over a period of five years is a major effort in the face of the crisis. It is an effort to which all institutions and agencies should contribute.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the issue of timing. I know that most of us in this Chamber are convinced that we need a decision before the end of the year so that we can continue with efficient spending after 1 January 2014. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Janusz Lewandowski, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold">− </span>Mr President, let me start with the own resources issue. I would like to thank the European Parliament right away for giving real impetus to the reforms and discussions. After the unhappy and rapid end of previous attempts, it was the European Parliament, through its resolution, and Alain Lamassoure personally, who again initiated the attempt to reform the revenue side. Alain was the person most insistent at the time that we should go ahead with a reform of the revenue side.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s interim report contains a very forceful message – namely the unity of the budget. Unity can be understood in different dimensions, but it is essential to understand the unity of the European budget as the complementary nature of expenditure and revenue. Expenditure and revenue should reinforce each other and not stand in each other’s way. So we are agreed as to the deficiencies of the present system and the remedies. It is important to know that the Commission today decided to authorise enhanced cooperation on a Financial Transaction Tax. So the ball is now in play, as it is also with the VAT system which will replace the current – very complex – statistical VAT system.</p>
<p class="contents">To complete the revenue side of the story: if one wants – and as London, for example, has said we need – a more transparent, simple and fair system of revenue, then we have the system of annual corrections, which is very transparent, simple and fair for everybody.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now make a few points on horizontal issues, starting with flexibility. If there are more constraints, we need more flexibility. That is clear. What is less easy to foresee are unforeseen events, so therefore the emphasis on flexibility in our package has been increased. There is also a very clear signal in this respect in your interim report, and I would like to underscore the use of the so-called contingency margin. This has been useful on several occasions under the current financial framework – for example, the economic recovery plan was made possible through contingency margin decisions – but we are basing this on the acquis accumulated in this financial period and the experience of this financial period. So we are leaving things open on how to shape flexibility properly in the 2014-2020 budget.</p>
<p class="contents">On the so-called ‘large-scale projects’, our decision to place Galileo in and GMS ITER outside was based on the different nature of those large-scale projects. But what is essential is to ensure their proper financing, perhaps by ring-fencing, so again here we are in agreement. We are also in agreement, I am happy to inform you, as to the infamous ‘<span class="italic">reste-à-liquider</span>’ (RAL). RALs are generated through annual budgeting, and the only real solution to the issue of these outstanding RAL commitments is through proper annual budgets and not through artificial devices that kill the predictability of commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">A final point concerns simplification, which is a universal request that has come from every corner of the European Union and on which we have to deliver. We have to deliver, and we have a new Financial Regulation. Inga Gräßle was a very tough partner in this negotiation, but it was very much conducive to the final goal of simplification. Now, the second stage is to ensure against the propensity to make it more complex at the level of 57 spending programmes. So we need a scan of what is sectoral, in order not to allow a watering-down of the simplification proposal under the Financial Regulation. With such important and experienced players as today’s speakers, I am sure that we can offer the European Union a decent 2014-2020 budget that provides predictability of investment for that seven-year period. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the information coming to us about the negotiations with the Council is not at all encouraging. It appears that the Council is asking for significant reductions which are out of step with the actual state of the Union and the economic crisis, because the multiannual financial framework can help indirectly.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the ‘Global Europe’ arm of the External Action Service, the European Commission has rightly proposed higher funding, and this funding is needed because the Union has to play its international role and respond to unforeseen political or other situations which arise every day. In other words, there has to be the scope and potential for the Union to use all of the available instruments to fund various interventions in relation to the countries concerned, particularly those where democracy is being restored, and to fund the External Action Service itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Parliament ought to give full support to an increase in the multiannual financial framework, exactly as proposed by this House, and ought to insist on it, because if we retain the framework as the Council wants it, this will give an unacceptable message to the citizens of Europe as to how the Council of the European Union would address the substantial problems facing the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Governments across the EU are having to tighten their belts and reduce their debt and reduce their deficit, but the solution here seems to be to increase the debt and spend even more taxpayers’ money to increase that debt; to continue with wasteful subsidies rather than focusing on the better use of existing resources.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Committee on International Trade we asked for a better use of existing resources to help SMEs in the EU to access markets overseas, in order to facilitate trade.

<p class="contents">Overall, I think we should remember that spending is only one very small part of the picture. How do we return to growth? Let us ask the question: how many large EU companies which compete at the top level globally have been established in the last 20 years? Where are the Googles and the Facebooks of Europe?

We request that we go beyond the European Commission’s proposal with regard to the preservation of nature and conservation of biodiversity in the LIFE programme. We also request financing for civil protection. We are making these requests because the multiannual financial framework is the test that will determine whether or not the European institutions have learnt from the crisis.

Cohesion policy benefits both: the beneficiaries of cohesion money and the recipients of this money, so I think both sides are beneficiaries. Member States who need these solidarity instruments also benefit, but the countries which contribute more to the European budget also benefit from this money. So we need to present this in the right way to European citizens, the taxpayers: there are no losers or winners from cohesion policy, but the whole Union – all 500 million people in our continent –benefit from cohesion policy.

This financial perspective will not result in economic and social cohesion, but in greater divergence. The intolerable cuts that some in the Council wish to impose mean that the Commission’s proposal is not sufficient or even acceptable. With regard to fisheries and maritime affairs, the proposal makes provision for an overall allocation of EUR 6.685 billion for the main financing instrument in the sector, namely the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund. This represents an annual average of EUR 955 million for the duration of the financial framework, which is even below the amount set aside for 2013, the final year of the current financial framework. The sums set aside for each of the years covered by the future financial framework all fall below the amount set aside for 2013. In other words, even though the current multiannual financial framework is highly insufficient, the proposal for the next one is even worse. The proposal also suggests that the already limited amounts for cohesion should be diverted to other purposes. This suggestion is reiterated by this report, which is sufficient reason for its rejection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the spokesperson for the Committee on Culture, I have had the difficult task, at a time when we are trying to save, of calling for more funding in the areas represented by the committee, namely young people, education and culture, as well as the cultural sector. Fortunately, we have been able in our statement to lean on the Commission and the Commissioner in the area where a very ambitious plan has been proposed – an ambitious proposal – and naturally we are pleased about it, on behalf of the committee. This concerns the programmes for education, training, young people and sport, as well as the creative and cultural sector; if all goes well, they both have a chance of receiving a boost in a time of savings, and naturally this is also necessary so that we can have the necessary growth and contribute to the 2020 strategy. Today I must appeal to the Member States that have also made their feelings clear on the Commissioner’s motion and on our support, but now we must see what the finance ministers will say about it, and in any case I must urge the Council to support it too, when we come to the difficult negotiations concerning the budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Monitor lizards have forked tongues. Perhaps that is too complex a metaphor for the Member States, so let me simply say that they have a split personality. They want to impose more and more new tasks on the European Union – and to some extent we support that with our priorities – but they are not willing to equip the EU with the capacities it needs, in terms of adequate personnel, to perform these tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">I have heard our fellow Members talking about the different policy areas, such as agriculture, as Mr De Castro has mentioned, but also cultural policy, research, environmental policy, social policy and regional development. These are tremendously important areas for all of the Member States and for the regions which we represent. What strikes me, however, is what the Member States are not doing. They are not considering who is meant to do the work on all of these policies. Who is supposed to process the applications? Who will ensure that the projects are implemented properly and funding is channelled to where it is needed? For that to happen, we need enough staff, and these staff must be properly qualified, highly skilled employees. We need the very best people we can find! We need a multicultural workforce from many different European Union countries, with more geographical balance and outstanding language skills. What does the Council want? What do the Member States want? They want to make cuts here!</p>
<p class="contents">Unless we have an appropriate financial framework for administrative expenditure, we will not be in a position to work on any policy areas at all. With that in mind, I urge you, President-in-Office, to ensure that the Commission’s proposal on the staff regulations is accepted so that we have an appropriate framework that enables us to carry out this work! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Rather than reducing financing for those specific vertical policies aimed at women’s rights, at this crucial moment we need greater intervention in these areas, by maintaining specific programmes such as the Daphne programme, by keeping gender equality as a specific objective in the Rights and Citizenship programme, by continuing to earmark funding for the European Institute for Gender Equality, and by financing small-scale women’s organisations which are carrying out crucial work in this area. In this area of women’s rights, as in other areas, what fundamentally stands out is the Commission’s desire to reduce the financing in this framework, by allocating only 0.37 % of the EU’s gross national income to the objectives of economic, social and territorial cohesion.

We are faced with a crucial choice between a budget for mere survival or subsistence – with a little less for everyone – or a courageous budget with selective decisions, with investment in job creation, innovation, youth, in other words in the future of the European Union and its development role. It must be emphasised that, as has been stated very clearly by Mr Kalfin among others, today Europe can do what the individual Member States cannot do for the economy, for regional development and for the regions – where social cohesion will either be strengthened or die – in other words, for the lives of the very citizens we mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">The great European choices are today in danger of being suffocated by accounting-based disputes – within the Council and elsewhere – between net beneficiary countries and net contributors. It should be underlined that this as a false problem, because it is easy, taking account of what happened in the past, to demonstrate with figures and numbers, rather than with words, that the contributor countries actually gained, often more than the others, from the convergence of economies and growth.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is currently working to add figures to the various headings. The war of positions has started: statements, stances taken by certain countries that view the budget as a mere expense item to be cut mercilessly, and even used to appease anti-European sentiment, easy to fuel at a time of crisis. This is a mistaken position that does not help the integration that we are struggling to achieve in other areas.</p>
<p class="contents">As many of us have pointed out, our Europe is still incomplete and imperfect. We adopted a stability plan that was supposed to include development, but we have stabilised so much that we are in recession. Let us at least take the opportunity offered by this budget and this multiannual financial framework to make choices that go in the right direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Flexibility has been an important subject for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, but so has new own resources. We can see from the paper that came from the presidency yesterday, which serves as an illustration, that there are great problems with own resources. It is not a transparent system, and it is not a fair system. It should be changed, and it has also not been planned very well. However, I fear that the Cypriot Presidency is placing a great deal of emphasis on net contributions. This is the way of thinking that we must move away from. The expenditure that we put into the EU budget must reflect genuine needs and sensible policies that we implement at European level, not what the Member States should get back. To a certain extent, this is what will decide it, and so we will readily save on common expenditure on research so that we do not ultimately have to touch expenditure on agriculture and that lovely money that easily comes back to the national coffers of the finance ministries. It must not be like this. The report by Mr Böge and Mr Kalfin contains six points concerning new own resources. What we propose is a procedure so that we can achieve a better system, and I would like to propose that the Council read these six points and take note of them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I simply do not get the impression that your heart is in it and that your proposals for the next multiannual financial framework reflect any genuine determination to work for the future of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all in the same situation in Europe. On the one hand, we understand that the Member States must consolidate their budgets. At the same time, we all know that we need to stimulate sustainable growth and that this is in our shared interests. We need to combat climate change, we have to move our economy towards a low-carbon pathway, and we have to offer our young people new prospects and, with that, new hope, which means building confidence in the European project as well. However, we cannot do so if we allow the budget to contract to the level now being proposed by the net contributors on the Council. That sends out the wrong political signal and does not reflect the spirit of Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">Why is it so important to have our own resources and above all to introduce proper regulation of the financial markets and expect them to contribute to overcoming the crisis? Because this is just. The banks must shoulder their share of the responsibility. It should not simply be the taxpayers and ordinary people who have to cover the costs of the crisis. The banks must make their contribution as well, since they speculate on the financial markets. That is why the Financial Transaction Tax is the right way forward politically and economically. It is a contribution to a social Europe and it is needed to fund the European budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lewandowski has now cleverly proposed a system of incentives. The Member States would pay a lower percentage of their GDP if they participated in a Financial Transaction Tax. One-third would go to the Member States themselves and two-thirds would accrue to the EU budget. This would be a win-win situation for the Member States and would be in Europe’s interests as a whole. Hopefully, the Council will show some movement on this issue. </p>
<p class="contents">Let me make one final comment, if I may: a eurozone budget has also been proposed in the political discussions. I think there are indeed good reasons for additional incentives, also in relation to the European budget, but this is about the indivisibility of the EU budget. We will not relinquish any rights of democratic control over the budget. This issue has arisen before, and regardless of whatever bright ideas some heads of state and government may have, you can be sure that we will defend our parliamentary rights with self-confidence here, and that we will continue to campaign for a genuinely and truly democratic Europe, and that applies to the budget as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, there are three points which I want to make: firstly on the question of the size of the budget. It is important that we reflect the difficult times being experienced by the Member State governments, and for that reason we are calling for a freeze at 1 % GNI.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on the issue of own resources: we remain open to suggestions, but we are not persuaded by the case either for a financial transaction tax or for value added tax. Thirdly, on the question of the rebate, can I remind this House that this is simply a matter of mathematics and not one of sentiment, emotion or politics.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I recognise the efforts which are being made towards resolving the crisis in the European economy. However, with resources strictly limited, is it not time that we revaluated our spending priorities for the European Union budget? It is clear that we are going to have to take tough choices in the future, and I want to stress to this House that those choices must be based on the target of achieving true, European added value. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that overall, the report establishes a good position for this House in this heated debate between Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">From my Group’s perspective, I would point out, first and foremost, that austerity policies in recent years have obviously failed and that countries which have run such policies and are under pressure to make savings have seen a loss of growth and tax revenue but also an increase in poverty and unemployment. Cuts in the MFF would mean the continuation and entrenchment of these policies for the next seven years, as a substantial proportion of the EU budget goes back to the Member States where it is used to support economic development, research and education. For that reason, we cannot and will not vote for such cuts in the MFF.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me take an example from history. My country, the Federal Republic of Germany, faced a similar deep-seated crisis after the Second World War. Then in 1953, the London debt agreement was adopted, which not only cancelled Germany’s debts; it also, and above all, aimed to provide clear and tangible impetus for economic growth through programmes initiated under the Marshall Plan. This helped to bring Germany out of its post-war indebtedness and paved the way for its economy to develop in the way that it has.</p>
<p class="contents">So our view is that we cannot make cuts: we must expand the budget and develop it further, and thus ensure that growth can help us overcome this crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully support Helga Trüpel’s detailed comments about own resources and the Financial Transaction Tax. We support this position too and would welcome rather more commitment from Parliament to moving forward on the question of own resources and implementation of the Financial Transaction Tax, as this is an important issue for this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union budget represents an indispensable tool in solving the effects of financial crises. We are discussing here a budget of which 94 % is reinvested in Member States and which needs to be used for creating economic prosperity through investments and creation of new jobs. The austerity measures were necessary, but to be effective they need to be complemented by measures that catalyse the economy. For this reason the budget enlargement is indispensable and freezing ceilings at their 2013 level is not an option. The perception of the Union’s budget and the gridlock created in the new multiannual financial negotiations can only be changed by an in-depth examination of the own resources system. A new system for collecting VAT and the taxes on financial transactions are two innovative directions that must benefit from our unconditional support.</p>
<p class="contents">Referring to our activities in the European Parliament I believe that the strategy authorised by the contact group is leading us, in the case of a proposal under the threshold proposed by Parliament, to a negative vote. In the event that there is no certainty that a sufficient number of members will vote against the Council’s decision, there will be a delay unfavourable to the European Union. The strength of the European Parliament is in its co-decision procedure. Trust must be extended to all members of this Parliament so as to allow the normal negotiations within the European political files, horizontal files. It is possible that such an approach will change the position of many Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we must work on the other side of the coin as well, namely the revenue side. That is nothing new. For almost 20 years, the European Parliament has been calling for a more transparent, fairer and simpler system of own resources. Now, for the first time, we can lend weight to this demand. </p>
<p class="contents">In the SURE report last June, we called for a system of own resources which would abolish all of the rebates and make the revenue side of the EU budget completely independent of the contributions made by Member States. The Commission took account of these demands, at least to some extent, by proposing a reform of own resources from valued added tax and the introduction of a Financial Transaction Tax. We support this proposal by the Commission, even though it only amounts to a 40 % reform. It is at least a step forward, and what is more, it moves in the right direction. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has won the Nobel Peace Prize. This was intended to be an expression of gratitude but also an incentive to go further. A more peaceful approach could also be achieved if the constant bean-counting between the net contributors and the net recipients were consigned to the past following a reform of the revenue system. A genuinely European revenue stream would also highlight the European value added of the EU budget. Then this constant small-minded national bean-counting could finally stop. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We support a move to own resources allowing Europe to raise more of its own funding while reducing Member States’ GNI contributions. We support a more flexible budget allowing Parliament to switch spending in-year and, most importantly, allowing end-year under-spends to be rolled over into the next financial year instead of being handed back to Member States. We also support spending on growth and jobs and the objectives of the 2020 strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">We also want to see a genuine mid-term review of the MFF budget in 2017 so that the ceilings can be looked at again if and when – as we all hope – growth has returned and austerity is on the retreat.</p>
<p class="contents">Where we cannot agree is on the size of the budget. In my own Member State, welfare benefits are being cut, health and education spending is frozen and wages are frozen or declining. It is therefore impossible to justify any significant increase in the EU budget. That is why I want to see a budget that better reflects the tough times that all national governments are facing at this time. However, we can only accept a smaller budget provided we get greater flexibility so that we can deliver on our key priorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Those in favour of a ‘small budget’ stress the need to cut all public spending, while advocates of a ‘large budget’ underline how this expenditure will boost growth for Europe as a whole. What interests me, however, is something entirely different. I would like someone to explain to me how it is that the Christian Democrats and Socialists in this Chamber are talking about a ‘large budget’, while in Austria, Sweden, the Netherlands, Finland, Luxembourg and, finally, France and Germany, these same political parties intend to cut this budget. Is it not the case that it is very easy for Christian Democrats and Socialists to talk about a large budget in this Chamber, when they know very well that their political interests and a reduction in European Union funding are safeguarded in the Council as a result of the pressure exerted by their own parties? If that is true, the European Parliament risks damaging its reputation and attracting ridicule, while the defence of European solidarity staged here is nothing more than play-acting at negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In 2007, EU unemployment was 7.3 %; today it stands at 10.5 %. In Spain, one of the biggest recipients of cohesion funding over recent years, the jobless figure today sits at 25 %. GDP for the European Union has been flat.

Employment comes from new industry and new industry requires capital, flexibility and less red tape – none of which the European Union helps with.

Firstly, the decision on the multiannual financial framework is not taken in November. How can we explain to citizens that they cannot count on the EU budget as a catalyst for jobs and growth? We have to make it very clear to the Member States – who will come to the negotiating table to say no – that the Treaty allows us to have the budget even if they block the decision. The only challenge will be to identify the legal basis for launching new investment programmes, and we will find it.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, corrections. I agree that they are crucial for the process. So far the debate has focused on expenditure. The corrections should be transparent, temporary and few in number. The debate begins only now, and I believe that it would be irresponsible to move to a growing number of national corrections. This will make the decision in November impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the risk of the traditional VAT system – which deserves retirement – not being replaced by a new, feasible system is rather high, so we might end up with an increased role for GNI and a vague commitment to own-resources reform in the future. It would be a shame if we could not afford it any more.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, on behalf of my committee, let me say regarding cohesion policy that we should not depart from the major mission of the policy, which is investing in growth – but with a view to reducing the structural disparities, which means that the national and regional allocation criteria should respect the Berlin methodology. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The difference between the two ideas is very clear and very significant.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament, through a number of resolutions, has pronounced in favour of equal treatment of Member States in terms of agricultural payments.

I have my doubts, however, when I see the way the future of the Cohesion Fund and Structural Funds is shaping up, and especially their internal organisation. I have to say that this is one of the biggest challenges for the new Member States, given that a great deal of the development and investment that has taken place has come from the Cohesion Fund and Structural Funds.</p>

Firstly, an appeal to get the MFF sorted by the end of the year and, secondly, a challenge. Mr Böge, the rapporteur, put this well when he said that, if they want reductions, they had better justify them and tell us where they want them. Is it CAP? Is it cohesion funding? Is it Horizon 2020? And on what basis? Our funding here in Europe is always justified on the basis of adding value. If they can show that it does not add value, then we have no argument, but I think they will find that very difficult to do.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I want to make is that the second part of our discussion this morning is on own resources. I would like to compliment the countries who have introduced the FTT on their enhanced cooperation. Hopefully it will prove successful, so that all countries will join in eventually.

Only the Member States, their governments and their national parliaments are entitled to say how much of their taxpayers’ financial resources are to be handed over for the joint activities of the European Union. At a time when all of the countries of the Union and their citizens are having to make substantial savings, the Commission, too, must make a contribution to the consolidation of Union savings and be flexible in reassessing the priorities in line with the current economic situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally support solidarity within the European Union and I am convinced that there is a need to look for model solutions not only to bring about a fair redistribution of financial resources, but also to prevent such financial resources being squandered on projects that, in a spirit of solidarity, do not bring the developing parts of Europe bonuses that might help them to achieve economic growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is too modest and cannot be explained by the crisis and the need to make savings. The budget for the common agricultural policy is 12 % lower in real terms, while the proposed CAP reform reduces its competitiveness and imposes additional objectives for which there is no funding. The report misguidedly proposes dealing with Pillars I and II jointly when assessing the CAP. The Pillar I budget is based on old, historical calculations – on criteria that have long since lost all relevance. The budget for Pillar II is based on objective, coherent criteria. The second pillar is mainly used for rural development and environmental programmes rather than to benefit farmers. Combining these two pillars will lead to erroneous conclusions and I am surprised that it has been suggested. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why this interim report – and I commend my colleagues Böge and Kalfin – actually reflects a hugely European dimension to the budget. For too long we have had debates about those who pay and those who benefit. This is not the way we should talk in terms of a European Union budget. Yes, we have to acknowledge difficulties in Member States, but we must insist that the budget of the European Union is for European citizens, for growth and for jobs. The chairman of the Agriculture Committee has reflected very well the view of that committee, but can I also stress to colleagues that we are asking for this money to facilitate more farmers in the European Union. We have heard the arguments of colleagues from the new Member States, who rightly and justifiably feel that they are badly treated because of the differences in payments, so we must acknowledge that this report is a European report.

Just the opposite, the budget for the cohesion policy should be further increased, since the disbursements represent strategic investments in the added value field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Janusz Lewandowski, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span><span class="bold">. − </span>Madam President, colleagues, thank you for your comments. There is no multiannual financial perspective without the consent of European Parliament – that is clear. Therefore your voice and your vote are important and should be helpful in the very exceptional circumstances in which Europe finds itself today. It is also a sign of good institutional cooperation, with each institution having an important role to play – including the national parliaments – with regard to the issue of own resources and taxation: no taxation without representation. That is my answer to Mr Hartong, who usually makes critical comments and leaves the room instead of listening to the answer.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a part of this rational construction I admired for so many years from behind the Iron Curtain. It is absolutely right to place the multiannual framework in the context of the realistic growth, jobs and competitiveness agenda for Europe. It makes a difference whether this is just a political announcement or an agenda equipped with money. The European budget is about the multiannual predictability of investment in Europe with a shortage of investment money in the national budgets. The European Parliament has a clear role to play when it comes to the proper level of budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">Our technical update for cohesion was not very fortunate, given the recent figures, but we cannot make the other basis for the ‘Berlin methodology’ in relation to cohesion. The recent figures, as updated, which are not fortunate for cohesion, are the only ones on which we can base our calculations with safeguards for countries like Hungary, which have experienced some problems in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding own resources, your important message is on the unity of the budget. We can understand unity as also not being a fan of the second budget for the European Union, but this is a unity of a complementary nature of revenues and expenditure. The proposal on the table, supported by the European Parliament, is really a fair, transparent and simple response to everybody who wants a simple, transparent and a fair system of own resources. If we manage to achieve real reform where revenue is concerned, we deserve another Nobel Prize. The same goes for simplification, which has been requested in the soon-to-be 28 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the European Parliament has an important role to play at the level of expenditure. This is a modest proposal: comparisons with national budgets are not fair. No single Member State has in the past had to accommodate such a major enlargement in terms of geography. We are to be 28, not 27, in the next financial perspective, and we are to have many more powers and areas of responsibility at European level. Therefore I cannot resist several comparisons. Yes, our annual budgets are less than the annual budgetary deficits of some Member States. I cannot resist pointing out that the UK’s contribution to the European budget is on a par with that country’s contribution to its fire service, and less than it contributes to its prison service. It is 14 times less than the servicing of the UK debt. That is not the problem of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I fully understand that some of you – and of course this is just a euphemism – do not support an approach which would reduce the overall size of the MFF. I very much appreciate, however, your frankness on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">You are well aware that there is also a divide between Member States on this issue. I hope you appreciate that there are valid and strong arguments on both sides and different approaches regarding the best way to achieve our targets. I would like to reassure you that we are working hard on the revenue side and will soon come forward with more details regarding our approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Some very important institutional issues with regard to the EU budget in the aftermath of last week’s European Council were raised by the rapporteur, Mr Lamassoure, and other distinguished speakers. I will refrain, if you will allow, from commenting on them, especially since later this morning we will have the opportunity to discuss them directly with the President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I will comment briefly on what Ms Jensen had to say. With all due respect, I do not think that in our paper we either expressed support for the ‘juste retour’ or referred to direct payments as a holy cow. We just raised issues and questions for consideration. But maybe I did not fully grasp the gist of your point.</p>
<p class="contents">On FTT, we all know that it has proved impossible to fly at the level of 27. Now we are advancing with enhanced cooperation, and the Presidency is fully committed to moving this forward. But we need to be aware that this enhanced cooperation is not about an own resource but rather a national resource. It is not FTT as an own resource. What we are trying to do in the current exercise on the MFF is to find a way to establish a link between the revenue accrued in Member States participating in enhanced cooperation with own resources with a corresponding reduction to their GNI contribution. But we need to be fully aware that there are both legal and political obstacles in some Member States which otherwise would like to participate in the FTT-enhanced cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to emphasise – and reassure those Members who spoke on this issue – that a focus on less-developed regions is one of the few non-controversial issues in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">When we say that the level of the MFF will unavoidably have to be revised downwards and that all headings and sub-headings will have to be affected, we are not expressing a wish. We are trying, as honest brokers, to provide radiography – an accurate presentation of the current situation. The same applies to questions regarding staff, raised in particular by Ms Roth-Behrendt. There again we need to get the right balance.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me once again insist on the fact that the Council has not yet come to a decision on the MFF and that discussions are continuing in a pragmatic way and with the full commitment of all – I stress of all – Member States towards reaching a timely compromise. Of course we all work on the basis that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. We will study very carefully and give full consideration to your interim reports, both on MFF and on own resources based on value added tax.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also listened very carefully to the views expressed here this morning and I can assure you that I will bring them to the attention of colleagues within the Council. Osmosis between the work of institutions is a key word for the Cyprus Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would ask you to continue to support our report in today’s vote. I would also like to reiterate my thanks to everyone who worked on this text. May I say on a personal note that the cooperation with Ivailo Kalfin, the members of the negotiating team and the contact group has been one of my most positive experiences as a rapporteur in this House, and I hope that we can sustain this to the end so that we have the chance to achieve a positive outcome together. </p>
<p class="contents">If the Cypriot Presidency, the Presidency of the European Council, now unveils a new negotiating box – a range of figures, as Andreas Mavroyiannis has said – this will take us into a new phase in the negotiating process. So let me be quite clear: after the vote on this interim report, we are willing to negotiate from now until 22 November on all of the issues relating to the multiannual financial framework and on all of the details of the interinstitutional agreement, wherever this is necessary to work together to identify solutions which result in an acceptable compromise. It is up to the Presidency to make use of this offer so that it can be integrated into the Conclusions and the debate at the European Council meeting on 22-23 November. Ultimately, and this needs to be reiterated, the outcomes or agreements reached by the European Council are a political agreement, and nothing other than a negotiating mandate for the Council so that it can finally achieve a positive outcome with Parliament in the weeks thereafter. First of all, Parliament must give its approval, by a majority of its Members, so that the Council can then make a unanimous decision. That is something that this institution should never forget in this procedure! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With this debate, and hopefully with the vote a little later, Parliament will give a very clear signal to the Council. I am sure that the Presidency will take that message to the Council itself.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three important issues that we have to take from the debate. First, the budget needs to be sufficient. Therefore, any decrease in the budget will be accepted with difficulty. We have mentioned several times that we will not accept a haircut approach to the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the budget has to be highly targeted. We are ready to discuss any ideas on better spending of the monies under the European budget, and we want to see these being used exactly for the purposes for which the EU budget is needed and expected.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, this budget has to help the Member States do something that they cannot do on the basis of their national budgets, which is to help them with additional instruments to create growth and jobs in the Member States, because all taxpayers have an interest in this happening. These messages have to reach the Council and be understood before the Council takes a decision.</p>
<p class="contents">We will also insist on the possibility of negotiating all the instruments contained in the legal basis. Again, whatever the Council decides will be taken into consideration, but we will not give up our right to negotiate on the legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a word on own resources. I am very happy to hear from Commissioner Lewandowski that the Commission is going to start the procedures for enhanced cooperation for the FTT, but the FTT has to be an own resource and has to make it easier for the Member States to reduce their GNI-based contributions. We do not want a bigger European budget; we want a more stable European budget, and we will fight for it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today, in fact, the Cypriot Presidency is publishing a document on the ‘resources’ part of the budget. Its reference is the Fontainebleau agreement, approved by the European Council in 1984. That was 28 years ago. The European Union did not exist then. Cyprus and Poland, for example, were not Member States. The economic community was limited to 10 Western states. The Iron Curtain had torn the continent apart. China was struggling to combat widespread famine. The idea of a single European currency was raised only at academic conferences. </p>
<p class="contents">We are in a new century, we are in a new world, we are in a new Europe. Four successive Treaties have resulted in a significant increase in the competences of the Union, which now has three times as many members. Everything is new, expect the budgetary framework. We have a historic responsibility. Our generation of heads of government, ministers, Commissioners and Members of the European Parliament would be disgraced if Europe found itself in 2020 with a budget whose amount, financing and distribution had been designed to cope with the needs we had 30 years ago. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the present economic context we have to concentrate on measures that can improve the economy and overcome the economic and financial crisis facing us.

No less important is the consumer protection policy, with its ultimate objective of empowering consumers.

I would like to stress that not only must the overall budget remain intact, but within it, so must the budget for regional policy for the period 2014–2020. Cohesion policy plays a vital role in achieving the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy, as well as being essential if we are to overcome the economic crisis. It is a key pillar of the ‘intelligent growth’ which the EU considers so important, a strategic tool for investment and competitiveness, and one of the main embodiments of European solidarity. For these reasons, funding for cohesion policy needs to remain at least at the level of the 2007–2013 period. In view of this I think it is unacceptable that the Commission’s proposal would mean that Hungary is the only EU Member State where per capita GDP in the period 2014–2020 will consistently be less than 75 % of the EU average, while its cohesion support could fall by nearly 30 % relative to the current budgetary period. I consider the low growth ceilings set and the growth projections used to determine support levels unfair and counter to the spirit of the EU Treaties because they hit countries with the lowest growth levels hardest and hence keep them trailing behind in the long term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The budget must be geared towards growth and employment, enhanced competitiveness, and cohesion for less developed regions. Reducing the European budget would inevitably impede growth and competitiveness, goals reinforced by common agreement and which we need to achieve if we are to overcome the crisis. In many Member States today, EU support represents the only basis for economic growth. Expenditure cuts would increase the gulf between the developed and less developed regions, between affluent segments of the population and those living in poverty, undermining one of the EU’s most important fundamental principles, solidarity. For this reason it is vital to make our position clear: the European Parliament opposes freezing the budget at its current level or reducing it. Of particular relevance here is the demand put before Parliament by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament that in the next EU budget commencing in 2014 a quarter of the Cohesion Fund resources should be spent on projects aimed at promoting employment, social inclusion and poverty reduction. Equally vital in my view is providing more generous support in the 2014-2020 budget for programmes aimed at promoting human rights and enforcing the rights inherent in European citizenship. We must resolutely reject any attempts to produce a future budget for the eurozone that is detrimental or counter to the interests of the EU27. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A reduced budget in the European Union would have a negative impact on economic growth and competitiveness throughout the EU, and would weaken its cohesiveness, solidarity and ability to overcome the crisis. Any reduction would restrict opportunities to ensure a fairer distribution of direct payments and proper financing of the cohesion policy. I can only support the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, who recently, in Bratislava, stated at a meeting of the Friends of Cohesion group that Europe needs political unity – the wealthier countries must agree to a wide-ranging policy, which provides for support for the less wealthy regions of Europe, since this is an investment in the growth of the European Union as a whole. I understand the political difficulties in many Member States when the EU budget is discussed. However, together with the rapporteur I would like to remind you that the EU budget represents only some 2 % of total government expenditure in the Union, and is hence more than 45 times smaller than the sum of government expenditure in the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We also have the objectives set by the Europe 2020 strategy. For these reasons, it is appropriate to put forward the MFF 2014–2020 as an essential condition for strengthening European economic governance and for supporting the objectives set in the above mentioned strategy for smart and sustainable growth in support of social inclusion. The MFF and the EU budget together are one of the instruments that should both help in allocating investment into activities increasing growth and employment and help Member States in their structural reforms. The correct identification of investment priorities (human capital and education, development of the knowledge-based society, infrastructure, research and innovation, small and medium enterprises, green and new technologies) and coordination of them in the Member States should kick-start economic growth in the EU. Among other things, the report stresses the importance of supporting research and innovation, the policies of cohesion and general competitiveness in the EU, including financing of large infrastructure projects (ITER, GMES, Galileo) and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. It can generally be stated that the report submitted by Mr Böge and Mr Kalfin provides a clear analysis of the MFF and reflects the comments of the EP, and I therefore recommend that it be approved as it stands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, it is worth actually thinking of cohesion policy as an EU investment policy that helps to achieve a systematic rise in the population’s standard of living. That is why it is also better to avoid earmarking as much as 25 % of regional funds for the European Social Fund, as, however important its role in promoting employment and tackling social exclusion, it is cohesion policy that serves more effectively to achieve the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy. At the same time, special EU support programmes benefiting the poorest should be maintained. The multiannual financial framework 2014-2020 should also bring us closer to achieving full convergence of direct payments across the EU under the common agricultural policy. However, even rural development measures financed by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) differ in nature depending on the size and state of development of rural areas in the individual Member States. For that reason, country-specific allocations of EAFRD monies should be retained. Parliament must also firmly oppose all attempts to reduce rural development funding as contrary to the objective of social and economic cohesion within the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Cohesion policy is the main part of the response to the crisis, because it contributes decisively to growth and job creation, and it deserves and is entitled to adequate funding. For this reason, the European Parliament maintains that the financing of cohesion policy must be maintained at least at the 2007-2013 level. By maintaining the current budget level and with an up-to-date, targeted, results-oriented cohesion policy, I am confident that we will achieve much more. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To achieve this goal, we should take political and financial responsibility and be prepared to offer Eastern Partners further support and clear prospects for an enhanced relation with the EU. The Commission has committed to grant additional support to those neighbouring countries undertaking significant political, economic and social reforms. In the time-frame of the MFF several Eastern Partnership countries could have in force an Association Agreement, including a DCFTA. Association Agreements would contain strong commitments by the Eastern Partners to legal approximation and structural reforms in many areas, like trade, for which the EU has promised to provide financial and technical assistance. Political association and economic integration of the Eastern Partners will be successful only if the necessary financial support is provided. In this context, and in the light of the latest ‘MFF negotiating box’ presented by the Council Presidency, I demand again that the level of financial resources envisaged in the proposal of the European Commission for the 2014-2020 multiannual financial framework is at least maintained to enable the EU to play its key role for the development of these countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
