Ladies and gentlemen, our sitting today is innovative, because the Prime Minister of Belgium is here, who has been invited to speak to plenary in order to contribute to the political reflection in which the European Union is currently immersed.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, normally Heads of State only speak to plenary at formal sittings which are not followed by a debate, or when they are Heads of Government of the country holding the Presidency of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we have decided to invite those Heads of Government who wish to take part in the debate on the future of Europe and to listen to their views on it. Today we have the honour of receiving Mr Verhofstad, the author of a short but striking book – 'The United States of Europe' – which makes a significant contribution to the current debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that Belgium has just completed a parliamentary marathon to ratify the Constitutional Treaty, since that country has had to obtain the assent of seven parliamentary assemblies. There is no doubt that at the next European Council important decisions will have to be taken with regard to the issue that has brought us together today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should first of all like to thank you for organising this initiative, and I have already noticed from the introduction that your House is still as lively as I remember it being back in 2001 when I as President-in-Office of the European Council came to defend the decisions of our presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I am very flattered, Mr President, by this invitation, this initiative is also evidence of the efforts made by your House and of the perseverance it has shown. Allow me to remind you first of all that your Parliament has played an important, if not decisive, role in the Convention. I am delighted that, with this initiative, the European Parliament is once again assuming its responsibilities in shaping the future of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I would not wish to start my address on the future of the European Union without first mentioning a date from the recent past: 1 May 2004, which is just over two years ago. A milestone in the history of Europe; a key date for the European Union: sixty years after the Yalta Conference, 48 years after the Hungarian Uprising, 43 years after the construction of the shameful Berlin Wall, and 35 years after the Prague Spring, this day was, as Bronislaw Geremek put it, ‘the real end of the Second World War, and the real beginning of a unified European Union’.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason why I briefly mention that day is that many people today seem to have what I would call a particularly short memory when they talk about the enlargement of Europe and of the European Union. The Union is said to have been too hasty in welcoming the former Soviet satellite states into its fold. The Union is said to be expanding too fast. The Union is said to have reached its natural borders, and to have exceeded the limits of its so-called absorption capacity. What, though, does ‘too fast’ mean to people who were oppressed for nearly half a century? What is ‘too hasty’ for people who we scarcely bothered about before they freed themselves from the Communist yoke? Come to think of it, what are ‘natural borders’? Where do such borders lie, when we see that European cities such as Belgrade and Dubrovnik are still outside the European Union? And what ‘absorption capacity’ are we talking about? The one in our head or the one in our wallet?</p>
<p class="contents">What I wish to make clear at the outset of my speech is that the future of the Union must not be thought of in terms of ‘either …or’: either ‘enlargement’ or ‘deepening’; either Turkey or the Constitution. History and the direction of history are unequivocal. The Union must continue to grow. This is the only guarantee for lasting peace and stability in Europe. The only guarantee that Bosnia or Kosovo, or the entire Balkans for that matter, will not go up in flames again tomorrow. The only hope, too, that countries such as Ukraine will become stable democracies in future.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the Union must be deepened further, and European integration must continue unabated. In any event – and that is something that lies at the very heart of this debate – it is time we put an end to the period of stagnation in Europe. After all, lack of progress in European integration did not start with the referendums in France and the Netherlands, as many people would have you believe. The citizens have been experiencing a crisis in Europe for longer than that: division over Iraq, non-compliance with the stability pact, and the debate on financial perspectives which we resolved in the end. I would also dare to add the Lisbon Strategy to this list. Let me make it perfectly clear that there is nothing wrong with the goals of the Lisbon Strategy, but the so-called ‘open method of coordination’ used to implement it has been far too weak to give European unification and integration a fresh, decisive impetus after the successful introduction of the euro.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">No choice should be made between deepening or enlarging first, as some people lead us to believe. Both are necessary. Nor should a choice have to be made between Europe as a free trade area or Europe as a political entity. Here once again, the direction of history is unequivocal. We are in fact evolving very rapidly, from a uni-polar world dominated by the United States of America, to a multi-polar world in which countries like China and India are rightly demanding an emphatic role. If Europe wants to continue to play a leading economic, political or military role in this new world order, then political union is the only alternative. No single Member State, not even the large ones, can harbour any illusions about going it alone on the world stage. As my illustrious predecessor, Paul Henri Spaak, rather cynically put it so many decades ago: </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">FR) </span>‘Europe still consists solely of small countries. The only relevant distinction that remains is that some countries understand this, while others still refuse to acknowledge it’.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It was Paul-Henri Spaak who said that, not me. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL) </span>In short, the question is not whether the Union will evolve into a more federal, political entity, but rather when this will eventually happen, or better yet, whether this will happen in time. That is the fundamental question. I, for one, have some doubts as to whether we will make the leap in time and evolve into a fully-fledged political union, and I am happy to share those doubts with the European Parliament. It is true that on 29 May and on 1 June 2005, the referendums in France and the Netherlands dealt a blow to the emergence of a European political union. The rejection of a constitution, which – although far from ideal – could have ushered in much more democracy, more transparency and more efficient decision-making, was a sledgehammer blow for those working on Europe’s political union. We cannot deny that the blow that both referendums caused was so great, that it is unclear even now whether the Constitution can still survive. The ratification process continues, and 15 countries have so far approved it, but let us be honest with ourselves. Some Member States may have been relieved when France and the Netherlands voted ‘no’. At any rate, they have postponed their own referendums indefinitely. In any case, the outcome of these two referendums has left Europe in confusion. And today, exactly one year on, there is no end in sight to that confusion. For we must face the facts. The subsequent 'reflection period' has yielded little or nothing at all. Over the last twelve months, there has been no noisy brainstorming session about the future of Europe, but rather a deafening silence.</p>
<p class="contents">A few new ideas have surfaced in the past few weeks, it is true, but I would join you in doubting whether they will amount to much. One such example is, at the risk of sounding condescending, the ‘Europe of projects’, but what we really need is ‘a project for Europe’. Or the idea of having everyone renew their vows to Europe. Or the intention perhaps to save part of the constitutional treaty by 2009, without any certainty that it will not be voted down again.</p>
<p class="contents">Be that as it may, it is to be expected that we in the European Council are going to extend the reflection period in just a few weeks. Elections will be held in France and the Netherlands, and an important presidency, the German Presidency, is coming up. There is a right time for everything, conventional wisdom has it. However, deciding when to act based on an election in another Member State or on who presides over the Council of Ministers is not the best approach, in my view. There will always be an upcoming national election somewhere, and waiting for the right presidency means running the risk that no one will grasp the urgency of the matter. Habits set in. Wear and tear take their toll. Why should we make a fuss about the future of Europe? It is doing just fine, without a project, without a constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet I firmly believe that we must act as a matter of urgency. And I would like to reiterate the reasons for this: Europe's economic growth is lagging behind, our political influence in the world is waning and our military strength is below par.</p>
<p class="contents">To find out what we need to do, we must first take a close look in the mirror, and together answer questions such as: Why did so many citizens turn away from Europe in those referendums? What went wrong in France and the Netherlands? What is the real reason why they did so in two states that were founding Members of the European Union?</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, two main answers or explanations can be given. The first, which is also a form of self-criticism, is that many national political leaders have long painted a negative picture of Europe in their own countries. When things go well, the feathers are immediately donned in the national cap, but when something goes wrong, the accusing finger is always pointed at Europe. And it must be said: Europe is a willing victim. No reaction or reply is hardly ever forthcoming when you abuse or lay into it. The most grotesque distortions gain currency: Brussels is supposedly home to an immense, Kafkaesque bureaucracy. The truth is, that some 24 000 civil servants work in the European institutions. This figure is smaller than the civil service of nearly every large European city. Europe is also said to be an enormous money-squandering machine. While I cannot deny that funds are sometimes misspent, and that is also the <span class="italic">raison d’être</span> for the Court of Auditors’, the truth is that the budget of the European Union is 20 times smaller than that of the United States, and 40 times smaller than that of all other (national, regional and local) governments combined. Each European citizen pays less than five euros a week for Europe – a fraction of what he or she has to pay for his or her national, regional and local governments. In return for these five euros, the citizen has enjoyed peace and prosperity for years, some of them, including us Belgians, for more than half a century. As we know in life, though, and certainly in politics, gossip is more stubborn than the truth, especially when that gossip is bandied about constantly, whether or not it is relevant.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, a second, and in my view, more decisive reason why citizens are put off and voted ‘no’ in both referendums. In their judgment, Europe no longer provides a sufficient answer – if any – to their many questions and concerns. I think that in this age of unbridled globalisation, they see the European engine sputtering and the European economy gasping for breath. Unemployment remains high. Companies are often relocating to the (Far) East, taking jobs with them. A powerful European response is not forthcoming. Although cross-border crime is on the rise, let us be honest, we had to wait – I remember it very well – until the Twin Towers were levelled before an agreement could be reached on the European arrest warrant. And the same thing is happening now with the European patent. Everyone knows that this tool is absolutely necessary if we are to make up for our lag in research and development, but in spite of all the Council’s declarations of intent, this could drag on for years.</p>
<p class="contents">This being so, it should come as no surprise that European citizens are opting out of referendums – and let us be honest about the fact that it is not one. We are all too aware that the European Union, as it functions today, lacks the necessary power to provide clear and decisive answers to the concerns of the people, and we are only too aware of why this is so.</p>
<p class="contents">Until such time as Europe embarks on the road towards a real federation where the unanimity rule is scrapped, or at least limited to the strict minimum, it will continue to be powerless to react rapidly and decisively to new challenges. To put it in a different way: a confederation, based on the intergovernmental method and the principle of unanimity, has no choice but to paralyse our Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that 50 years after the launch of the Union, it is high time to make a choice once and for all: confederation or federation; unanimity or qualified majority; intergovernmental or community approach. A 'board' led by a number of Member States, or a strengthened European democracy based on an active European Commission and a fully-fledged European Parliament, which make up the essence of European democracy. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Allow me to illustrate the crucial importance of this crossroads by returning to the major challenge facing us, and I believe that the major challenge facing us now is the modernisation of the European economy. If one looks at the figures, what are they now and what do they tell us? Average GDP growth in Europe over the last ten years has been 2.3%, compared with 3.3% in the United States. In Europe, the total employment rate increased by 9% during that same period. In the United States, it increased by 14%. Far more striking is the fact – which we must indeed acknowledge – that, while, in the 1980s, per capita income was still at the same level in Europe and the United States, European per capita income is now 30% below that of its US counterpart. I have not even touched on China, India or Japan, about which a great deal is said. Last year, China's economy grew by almost 10%. The European Union’s trade deficit – we always talk in terms of surpluses, but let us also look at the deficits – with Asia rose to EUR 100 billion, and is expected to rise even further over the next few years.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union's response to this problem is called the ‘Lisbon Strategy’. As I have already said, there are no question marks concerning the objectives of this strategy. Europe must become ‘the world’s most competitive knowledge-based economy’. However, the method used to that end, which enables the Member States to decide for themselves how they intend to go about meeting that objective, is not effective. The facts show that we are falling further and further behind in a large number of areas. There is a simple reason for that. The Lisbon Strategy makes use of the aforementioned open method of coordination, a form of intergovernmental approach that is mainly based on best practices, benchmarking and peer review. Aside from defining a number of general objectives, the role of the European institutions is limited to drawing up rankings and tables for the purposes of drafting reports. That is precisely what others do too in their reports: I am thinking of the World Competitiveness Centre (IMD) and the World Economic Forum (WEF).</p>
<p class="contents">The only difference between the reports drafted under the Lisbon Strategy and the ones by these economic institutes is that the latter show that nearly all of the countries in Europe are declining. Some will hasten to say that this is naturally due to the strength of the euro. Yet, it is primarily due to the lack of common reforms in the European Union. In short, although we are striving to make our knowledge-based economy the most competitive one in the world, it must be pointed out that we are in danger of becoming less competitive by the day.</p>
<p class="contents">A conclusion is required, which I have tried to defend not only within the Council, but also, prior to that, at the European Parliament, for example when I was invited by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. That conclusion is as clear as day: the intergovernmental method, without commitments, that underpins the Lisbon Strategy does not work properly.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">What we really need is a much more binding, Community-based approach. Social and economic governance in the true sense of the word. A joint European socio-economic policy, in which the Union provides a broad outline of the necessary reforms. These reforms are absolutely imperative if we want both to face up to rising competition from new growth areas and to protect the social model of which we, in Europe, are so rightly proud. These reforms require action not only with regard to industry, innovation, research and taxation, but also with regard to the labour market, pensions, social security and health care, without mentioning other areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The method to be used here – and I do not want any ambiguity on this matter – cannot simply consist of indiscriminate harmonisation; I am opposed to indiscriminate harmonisation or, in other words, to a form of standardisation that takes no account of the differences among the Member States. Plainly ignoring the differences in customs is not an option. No, what I am advocating is a policy of convergence, a similar approach to the one that was successfully applied to the Stability and Growth Pact and that led to the introduction of the euro, because that is indeed what was at the heart of the Pact: a policy of convergence. Unlike harmonisation, which is based on absolute values and which denies the differences in Europe, convergence is about setting minimum and maximum levels, a range of values; it is about creating a framework in which the various Member States of the Union must operate and modernise their economies. The maximum levels are needed in order to inspire the Member States to implement reforms. The minimum levels are needed in order to prevent social dumping.</p>
<p class="contents">Convergence also enables the various Member States gradually to develop in line with each other and the Union to become competitive again faced with other growth regions in the world, the main difference being that cut-throat internal competition is prevented and that the Union is not forced to give up its social approach. I also believe that Europeans will thus be able to regard the Union once again as a solid partner, a federation of peoples and nations, which this time round is able to provide an answer to the challenges of globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, by radically changing the course of the Lisbon Strategy and enhancing this strategy by employing a more compelling and precise Community method, the Union will once again be able to capitalise on past successes. It must be acknowledged that neither the internal market nor the euro would have come about without a powerful Community driving them forward. It must be said today that, for the internal market, this driving force took the form of the principle of mutual recognition and of qualified-majority voting, as developed by Mr Delors. As for the euro, it would never have come about without the Maastricht criteria and the standards set out in the Stability and Growth Pact, which is also a driving force of the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, while a new Community economic strategy of this kind is highly desirable for the Union, it is certainly crucial for the eurozone. A single currency and a monetary Union are destined to fail in the long run if they are not supported by a common approach to social and economic challenges. The absence of reforms in one country will inevitably have a negative bearing on the health of other countries, in other words, of the entire zone. If anyone had doubts about the need for, at the very least, a form of economic governance in a monetary union, they need only imagine the United States with one currency, the dollar, and one central bank, the Federal Reserve, but with a different socio-economic policy for each of its 50 states. We would regard that situation as ‘unmanageable’. The fact is, we are faced with that unmanageable situation now, within the European Union, or at least within the eurozone. Then we wonder why we do not have the same economic growth as other regions in the world!</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, for some time now, I have advocated taking an initiative to strengthen the Eurogroup. Not with the aim of excluding anyone, because – I repeat – if the 25 Member States were able to apply themselves to developing a new Community strategy together, then I would undoubtedly prioritise that joint approach. Yet, if that proved impossible - which I increasingly fear to be the case - then there is no question of not taking action at all. Moreover, when I talk about the Eurogroup, I am referring not only to the current members of the eurozone, but also to all the countries that, under a contractual clause, are destined to join the eurozone. In other words, no one is being excluded from joining the EU and from being part of the eurozone.</p>
<p class="contents">What might strengthening the eurozone entail in terms of creating the social and economic governance that is so lacking in the Union? I am thinking about 'strengthening' here with regard both to the institutional aspects and to the content. In particular, I am thinking about jointly preparing the EU spring summit, about frequently drafting reports and recommendations for the eurozone within the European institutions, about defining common macroeconomic starting points when drafting national budgets, about drawing up convergence criteria on social, fiscal and economic matters – a very important task – and about holding meetings that bring together within the enlarged Eurogroup not only finance ministers, but also employment ministers, social affairs ministers and ministers for science policy - my finance minister agrees. Finally, I am also thinking about ensuring autonomous representation within the international finance institutions, which is an obvious step to take when one has a monetary union and a single currency.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, so far, I have focused almost exclusively on the economic challenges facing the Union. I would be trivialising matters if I were to overlook the other areas in which we need more, not less, Europe. One such area is justice and security, in which we should be more effective in the fight against illegal immigration, organised crime and terrorism. As regards research and development – please forgive me for repeating myself – we urgently need the European patent. The same goes for a common foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to this last point, we must acknowledge the fact that only a European defence can move us closer to a common foreign policy of that kind. My personal experience in 2003, shortly before the start of the war in Iraq, was painful but instructive. At that time, in 2003, it seemed totally impossible to debate the Iraq crisis within the European Council. Divided as we were, we preferred to keep our cards close to our chest. In short, only when we develop common instruments, such as a European army and European diplomacy, will we be forced to lay our cards on the table - and in due time - in the event of an international crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that the idea of developing a European army or European defence is likely to be perceived by some Atlanticists as a sacrilege or as a denial of our transatlantic obligations. Well, that is not the case. In the 21st century, NATO is going to change; it is likely to evolve from a regional defence alliance into an international security network, consisting of allies and partners. At the same time, there is every reason to believe that we will make ever more explicit efforts to tackle international security issues within this kind of renewed international cooperation association, rather than continue to call on the so-called coalitions of the willing. The disadvantage of these coalitions is that they disintegrate easily following each change of government.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this new ‘transatlantic security network' – the foundations of which will be laid in Riga – Europe’s defence must be developed and integrated as an autonomous European pillar. It goes without saying that a great deal of resistance will have to be overcome in order to succeed in this. Resistance on the part of some Americans, for example, who can only see NATO as an alliance of countries, and resistance on the part of some Europeans, too, who continue to regard European defence as an alternative, or even a rival, to NATO. Yet, I believe that, by finding a middle ground between these two arguments, it will be possible in the long run to overcome this resistance. The European operations conducted in Bosnia, Macedonia and Congo have shown this.</p>
<p class="contents">Be that as it may, the development of Europe's defence, which is intended to operate both as an autonomous entity and as a pillar of NATO, is urgent and essential. We cannot play the part of the world’s moral conscience without having the military might to back it up. Nor can we constantly call on the United States to come to our rescue when we are faced with a civil war on our own continent, as was the case in Bosnia and Kosovo. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL)</span> The question remains: what does all this have to do with the Constitution and the draft Constitution?</p>
<p class="contents">Theoretically, of course, there are various possibilities. We can opt for the <span class="italic">status quo</span>, regard the constitution as a lost cause and continue to work on the basis of the treaties signed in Nice and elsewhere. That is not, in my opinion, the right way forward, for then, we would retain the unanimity rule, which, in turn, means vetoes and, perhaps, paralysis.</p>
<p class="contents">We can also take an approach that could well catch on, namely a ‘pick and choose’ approach, if I can put it that way, trying to save the most attractive parts of the constitution, but my question is, then, which parts? I can imagine that every member of the Council will have a different priority. For one member it will be the subsidiarity test, while for the other, it may well be larger powers for the European Parliament, for example. I will let you guess. Ultimately, the odds are that at the end of the ride, we will end up with more or less the same Constitution. It is highly doubtful that ratification in two or three years’ time will have a greater chance of success than today.</p>
<p class="contents">We could also take a ‘roll-back’ approach, where we interpret the outcome of the referendums as a sign that the citizenry actually want less Europe, meaning that we should reduce Europe back to nothing more than a free-trade zone. However, dropping our European ambitions and going against the course of history would be like abdicating, a form of betrayal, for the success, to date, of European unification cannot be denied. It has proven to be the best remedy for poverty, dictatorship and war. Europe has brought long-lasting peace, social protection and unprecedented prosperity. So we must stop being cynical and painting a picture of the Union as some kind of inconvenience.</p>
<p class="contents">Practically and politically, there is just one option that remains, and that is to press on with the ratification of the Constitution. Each country and each citizen of the Union has the right to express an opinion on this Constitution, but remember, there may have been two 'no' votes – in the Netherlands and France – but there were 15 'yes' votes in the 15 other EU Member States. I do not think that Europe would be a democracy if it did not take that simple statistical fact into account. Moreover, in my view those who in recent months have put ratification on the back burner are duty-bound to start or resume the ratification procedure – and I will tell you why. We agreed this when we approved the draft Constitution in the European Council. That is why we added a special declaration to the constitution, declaration 30, which states: ‘If four-fifths of the Member States have ratified it two years after signing it, and one or more Member States have encountered difficulties in proceeding with ratification, the matter will be referred to the European Council’. Well then, if not all of the countries start a ratification procedure, then the content of this declaration will obviously be pointless, which means that any breakthroughs in the European Council will be blocked.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyway, I personally think that four-fifths of the Member States is feasible within the European Union – if, that is, everyone assumes their share of responsibility. If we manage to reach that quorum, then a totally new situation would arise, a situation which certainly opens up new prospects vis-à-vis the current barriers. After all, if that happens, if we reach this four-fifths quorum and when we meet, I cannot imagine the Council simply running through the agenda as usual and not discussing anything, in the knowledge that the necessary ratifications were missing in the Union. This declaration to the Constitution would be rendered meaningless.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, however – and that is also the message I would like to press home today – whether or not we reach the four-fifths quorum, nothing is standing in the way of the further integration that I have just described – quite the opposite. It would be good if a second track were opened alongside the ratification track. This second track would not require any changes to the treaties. It would be a project involving all countries that wanted to take part, as I described in detail a moment ago.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, I am suggesting that we quickly develop a new strategy along two lines. The first involves moving forward with ratification and fully fleshing out and applying declaration 30 to the Constitution; the second involves making a new and significant leap forward in European unification, without requiring any amendments to the treaties, on the basis of a number of points I set out a moment ago. This two-track strategy is, in my view, the only way to get through the current period of uncertainty, which could drag on for years, in a meaningful way, and, above all, the only way not to waste time. After all, time is the last thing we can afford to waste.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to add that, 52 years ago, the European Defence Community collapsed after a 'no' vote in the French Parliament. There was great dismay at the time, but the European leaders of the day did not let that setback throw them off balance. In fact, they knew perfectly well what they had to do. They did not need time to reflect. They did not need to make enquiries or organise opinion polls. They spent two years negotiating in one place, Val Duchesse, just a couple of kilometres from here. They then took the results to Rome, where they signed a treaty that led to the creation of the European Economic Community. That was when they put Europe on the right track for good. That was 52 years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">It is exactly the same thing that we need today. After all, the situation today is not all that different from the situation 52 years ago. Today, the majority of the French and Dutch citizens voted against the constitution, and today we must not let ourselves be thrown off balance. Today, the time is ripe for a major leap forward. And today we need bold policy to put Europe back on track.</p>
<p class="contents">Why, so far, have we not done the same thing they did 52 years ago? What is the big difference? What is needed? The answer is simple: courage, political courage. The same courage that Jean Monnet, Alcide de Gasperi, Konrad Adenauer, Max Kohnstamm, Paul-Henri Spaak and Robert Schuman demonstrated back then; the courage to pick ourselves up after a major setback, square our shoulders and keep on going. That, more than anything, is what we need now.</p>

Soon there will be almost 500 million people in 25, then 27 and later perhaps even more countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that, whenever I leave Europe and then return, I always have a profound feeling of gratitude to be back in Europe, because there is no other continent with as much diversity – including cultural diversity – as the continent of Europe and the European Union. However, this continent is also a difficult one – just think how many parties are represented here in the European Parliament and how we continually need to work to reach joint results.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that, in our opinion, the Treaty of Nice cannot form the basis for leading 500 million people into a brighter future. We must go further, and we therefore welcome today's debate. A debate should result in people listening to each other, understanding each other and, hopefully, reaching joint results. I am therefore pleased that Prime Minister Verhofstadt is here today, and it was always the three Benelux countries that gave the greatest impetus to Europe. I hope and expect that, at the end of this process of strengthening the substance and the principles of the European Union, the three Benelux countries – not just Belgium or Luxembourg, but the Netherlands too – will be at the forefront of European development.</p>
<p class="contents">Immediately following Nice, the European People's Party said that Nice was not enough, and we had some very frank discussions with President Chirac in Strasbourg in December 2000. At our congress in January 2001, we in the European People's Party drafted a resolution saying that we want to go further, we want a new conference, and we want, if possible, a constitution, a constitutional treaty. Perhaps the name 'constitution' was too ambitious for many people. That may well be the case, and we must look into it carefully. I would remind you of what Mr Juncker said last Thursday when he deservedly received the Charlemagne Prize of Aachen: it is not acceptable for the Heads of State or Government of the countries of the EU to spend Monday to Saturday talking down the European Union and Brussels, and then to expect there to be a good result in referendums and plebiscites on Sunday.</p>
<p class="contents">This is unacceptable, and that is why we call on all governments in the European Union to depict Europe as it really is – with both its positive and negative developments.</p>
<p class="contents">We in Europe have got used to always just talking in negative terms: for many people, the glass is always half empty instead of half full.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Verhofstadt, you referred to 1 May 2004, when eight formerly Communist East European countries – Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were occupied by the Soviet Union – acceded to the European Union, including Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Slovenia. It is not the European Union that has expanded, but its force of attraction. Its strength in peace, freedom, democracy and the rule of law was the force that attracted these countries, so that they ultimately became Member States. We should publicise this as a really great success for European development.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take the Euro: we are quite justifiably discussing the stability of the Euro. Much of this discussion has been presented very negatively, including in connection with the reform, and it certainly is a considerable challenge. However, just imagine we did not have a common European currency. Where would we now stand in the globalisation process if the countries of the European Union were still devaluing their currencies to give themselves an export advantage in the European Union? Europeans would be set against each other, and it would take away from us any chance of being competitive on a global scale. So let us be positive about Europe!</p>
<p class="contents">I have just been talking to the Dutch Minister for European Affairs. I found it very enlightening to hear him say that, in an Internet survey in the Netherlands, many of the participants said that we needed more Europe, for example with regard to internal security, agreements on immigration and the major issues of asylum. It is therefore our common task to find a way, through discussions and then decisions, of turning the substance and principles of the Constitution into political and, in the first place, also into legal reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Verhofstadt, I welcome your statement that the ratification process should continue. We should also particularly like to thank Estonia for having ratified the constitution a few days ago. We would encourage Finland to continue with the ratification process – the leaders of the groups will be going to Helsinki tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also say to our Polish friends and partners that you have a good point on the issue of energy. You are quite right to expect solidarity when it comes to energy supplies. Solidarity applies to all the countries in the European Union, but Poland, too, must exhibit solidarity when it is a matter of our future, on the basis of a treaty, a constitution, that gives us a prospect for the future. Solidarity is not a one-way street, but a two-way process, and it applies to all Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by saying this: our group is deeply committed to subsidiarity, and subsidiarity includes local, regional, national and European levels. The local level and the lower levels in the sense of 'close to the people' need to act when they are the best ones to do so, but the European Union needs to act when the nation states can no longer act, when they are too small to solve the problem. It is therefore our duty to make the path, the principles and the foundations of the Constitutional Treaty a reality. We must find common solutions, in all 25 countries and here in the European Parliament too.</p>

You said that we need courage, and I thought that your speech was very courageous. I have seldom heard a member of the European Council be as critical of the institution as you have just been.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the crisis in Europe is also, in part, a crisis of the European Heads of State and Government. I promise you – and this is something I say frequently – that in future I will say: it is, in part, a crisis of the European Heads of State or Government minus Mr Juncker and Mr Verhofstadt. It is quite clear that both you and Mr Juncker, in what you have said here and in what he said last week, are demonstrating a clear commitment. It is a commitment not just to strengthening integration or to expansion; you have made a commitment to a fact that should really go without saying for a Head of State or Government, namely that you stand by what you say and do. In Rome, all of the Heads of State or Government who sit on the Council and take part in the summit ceremoniously – there could hardly have been more ceremony – signed this treaty, but some of them then went home and acted as if they had no idea where they had been. That is one aspect of the crisis surrounding this constitution. It is very much to your credit that you have stood up for it so clearly. I can tell you that I should have liked to have heard a speech like the one you gave today from certain leaders of other institutions in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I should like to discuss two elements to which you referred directly, Mr Verhofstadt. The question of whether we will get 20 'yes' votes, and how we should deal with the two 'no' votes, is an important one. We now have 15 states. We very much welcome the fact that the Finnish Presidency of the Council has stood up and said: no, for us the constitution is not dead. Mr Vanhanen is doing what you are doing. My government says that he has signed the constitutional treaty; we want our Parliament to decide. That is the logical and normal way to go.</p>
<p class="contents">The Estonians ratified the constitution a few weeks ago. I do not see why we could not achieve the figure of 20 so that the agreement between the Heads of State or Government to which you referred – not the agreement by the European Parliament, but the agreement by the Heads of State or Government – can enter into force. Therefore, we cannot give up on the Constitutional Treaty, and it is reckless for senior representatives of the European Union to say 'let us think of something else' rather than first of all following the ratification process through to the end. That was an important statement that you made to Parliament today.</p>
<p class="contents">You also referred to another particularly important point. The issue of how we in the European Union even assess what has happened differs from one political camp to another and from one country's political class to another.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one thing I am sure of, though. This morning, Mr Poettering, I also spoke to the Dutch Minister for Foreign Affairs, Atzo Nicolaï. Surveys in the Netherlands show that the vast majority of Dutch people are in favour of the European Union. The same people who said 'no' in the referendum, when they are specifically asked whether they want more Europe, say 'yes'. They want more social protection, more environmental protection and more stability. Why, then, did they not vote for this Constitution, which provides more social protection, more environmental protection and more stability? They must have their reasons. Of course, it is partly due to problems in the EU, but it is also due to domestic politics in these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pretty sure that, if Mr Chirac had said to the French people that he would resign if they accepted the Constitution, there would have been an overwhelming majority in favour of the Constitution in France. I am quite convinced of that.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps that is how to get the Constitution accepted in France. However, it is quite clear that there is a connection between the depression in certain Member States and the fact that their populations rejected the constitution. We cannot deny that, but, given that it is the case, it also sharpens our eye for those people who said yes. It also makes us more acutely aware that courage is worthwhile, because one head of government in Europe did put his political fate on the line for the constitution – Mr Juncker said to the people of Luxembourg, 'I believe that, in the long term, more Europe is the only way that we can keep our small country as socially, economically and ecologically strong as it is today. I am absolutely convinced of that. If you have a different opinion, if you think that Europe needs to be administered differently, then you need to find a different Prime Minister'. So, he linked his fate with that of the constitution, and thus won his people over to the constitution in a referendum just a few weeks after the 'no' votes in France and the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="contents">I think you are right, Mr Verhofstadt. Europe is lacking in courage. Nobody has the courage to say 'I have a conviction, and I am prepared to put my political fate on the line for this conviction'. Members of the European Council have taken the decision to stand before their parliaments and say 'even though the overwhelming majority of the population is against it, we must send soldiers to such-and-such a place, because there is no other way'. They could do that, they managed to push through their conviction there; I will make no comment on that here. I should have liked them to apply the same energy to the European Constitution and to say, with the same energy, 'I will fight for my conviction, just like we fought for other projects'. If they had done so, Europe would have got much further. I am grateful to you, and I am firmly convinced that, if there were more Verhofstadts in Europe, we would make much more progress.</p>

My group welcomes the presence here of Mr Verhofstadt, both as a prime minister and as one of the major architects of European reform.</p>
<p class="contents">As you recognised, Prime Minister, in the Laeken Declaration in 2001, the European Union has been talking more to itself than to its citizens. Yet five years after your Presidency, the task of reconnecting Europe with its citizens still shows too little evidence of progress. Indeed, just yesterday a survey showed that 82% – more than four in five – of our fellow citizens feel that government at European level fails to communicate with them.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the year-long period of reflection – and eight months into the Commission’s much vaunted plans – little has been broadcast beyond the bastions of the Berlaymont.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the same survey might hold the seeds of hope, for though Europe may not be brilliant at communicating what it does, that survey shows that our citizens still trust the European institutions to do it. In fact, more of them trust the European institutions than their own national governments.</p>
<p class="contents">So here is Europe’s mandate from the people: a mandate to deliver the reforms needed to meet challenges like energy security, migration, climate change and organised crime, which individual Member States struggle to deal with under the current set-up. Greater coordination of economic policies, as you recommended, Mr Verhofstadt, would certainly help, as would greater defence coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso has pointed to the need for practical achievements to reinforce our links with citizens and rally them to our cause.</p>
<p class="contents">But this ‘Europe of Projects’ can never get off the ground until Member State governments explain to their people what they are doing together in Brussels and why, and until we give the Union the money and the legal powers to push through initiatives like the common energy policy, which faces an uphill struggle against blocking forces in the Council, as too do many other initiatives in the field of justice and home affairs, for example, where the absence of qualified majority voting so often results in stalemate.</p>
<p class="contents">Quibbling over the <span class="italic">passerelle</span> clause in the Treaty will resolve little, and change rests, in any case, on the same unanimity which has led to inaction up to now.</p>
<p class="contents">As you said, Prime Minister, it is the Constitution – as practical as it is ideological – that can best put the institutional building blocks in place to move Europe forward. It is all very well for Mr Schulz to rail against it, but it was his Socialists in France who helped to kill the Constitution in that referendum.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Mixed reactions)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We need to make our period of reflection a period of analysis, producing proposals on how to proceed. This month’s Interparliamentary Conference on the Future of Europe kick-started the process. Today’s sitting is the logical extension, and let us hear more debates with national leaders.</p>
<p class="contents">On Europe Day, Estonia became the fifteenth state to ratify the Constitution and Finland will soon follow. To me, that Treaty looks far from dead, and with the political courage of leaders like Guy Verhofstadt, Angela Merkel and Romano Prodi – leaders committed to Europe – then Europe’s future is surely brighter.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Prime Minister told us, we have a lot of work to do. However, we have the people of Europe behind us in our task, because they recognise, however much some of our national leaders like to deny it, that the big problems we face, the major challenges of globalisation – population growth and migration, climate change, internationally organised crime – cannot be dealt with by nation states built on the 18th-century concept of military industrial power; they require us to overcome our tribal and our religious hatreds and to work together for the future of all our citizens on a planet which we share with <span class="italic">many</span> others.</p>

We also hope that your generous efforts will help us, together with the other European Union Member States and our institutions, to bring a glimmer of enlightenment to this constant crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">We substantially agree with your vision for the institutions and we endorse what you have said about Lisbon. We can even agree on the fact that ratifications should continue, but we also think that it will be impossible to make France and the Netherlands accept the existing text and, moreover, your two-pronged strategy falls down, in our view, on the weakness of the political solutions. We are trapped in a perfectly obvious contradiction. If the European Union is to be loved by its citizens, it has to show them that it works, but in the last few years no great initiative has been taken on the environment issue, the jobs issue, peace, development, human rights or the integration of new citizens. Thus there is only one thing to say: institutions and policies are indissolubly linked, and that is where we no longer agree with you.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority of our citizens cannot be won over by the idea of a federal, democratic and peaceful union, based on thoroughly disquieting examples like the United States, China or India. Furthermore, neither the Socialists nor the Greens who did not vote for the Constitution will be won over by the idea that we must keep up with the growth seen in the United States, China or India, because such growth results in poverty and the consumption and wastage of resources.</p>
<p class="contents">I could not help noticing, Mr Verhofstadt, that in your speech you did not once mention the considerable environmental and ecological challenges that we are facing. That, unfortunately, may be a sign that the departure of the Greens from your government has perhaps led to a slight reversal in your thinking about the sustainability question.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, we also think that to talk about a European army in a situation in which we Europeans shilly-shally in most crises and are forced to follow the United States – and in which our credibility on all human rights issues and on the peace and disarmament question is rapidly losing momentum – clearly, to talk about an army is perhaps too great a leap forwards, and one that we do not endorse.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Verhofstadt, we are of the opinion that a European Constitution is in fact necessary and that we have to find a way to win the citizens’ support for one, but we shall certainly not be able to do so with more market, more liberalisation and more firepower. We shall only succeed by genuinely changing Europe’s policies with a view to greater sustainability.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Francis Wurtz,</span></span>  <span class="italic"> on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, I should like, if I may, to make a preliminary remark, since we are inaugurating a series of new-style debates today. I believe that it is impossible to respond seriously, in three or four minutes, to an <span class="italic">ex cathedra </span>speech that lasts three quarters of an hour and that is also in-depth. In my opinion, the procedure needs to be revised.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a great deal to say about some of the ideas put forward by Mr Verhofstadt. For example, about the idea of putting the Union’s crisis down mainly to a question of method, which is not federal enough in his opinion, by choosing to overlook the content of the economic and social decisions taken. That is an analysis that I regard as inadequate and that my group does not support. Or, indeed, about the idea of introducing, in the name of a form of social and economic governance, maximum social levels alongside the minimum levels that already exist. I do not really understand his reasoning, which seems to me, in any case, to be heading in the wrong direction. I have a great deal to say, too, about Mr Verhofstadt’s appeal for a military Europe and for that military Europe to be thoroughly integrated into NATO, an appeal with which we do not associate ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not be able to expand on these various points now, because I would like to address another point that I feel Mr Verhofstadt glossed over. It concerns what is, in my opinion, our main problem today: I am referring to the reasons for the widening gap between Europeans and the Union. The results of the Commission’s consultation do reveal to us, however, some precious information about the cause of this disaffection, and I should like to mention three examples.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, 47% of the people polled as part of this consultation see globalisation as a threat to jobs. In October 2003, 56% regarded globalisation as a good opportunity; 20% fewer of them think the same today. Yet, in October 2003, Europe was no more federal than it is today. Here is another result: what do the people polled think about the role played by the European Union in fifteen or so areas ranging from environmental protection to the fight against terrorism, via social policy, with the protection of social rights only appearing at the end of the list? They gave these areas a satisfaction rating of 4.7 out of 10. That has nothing to do with the Union’s being more or less federal.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Europe's ability to combat unemployment, which was consigned to the bottom of the list, the satisfaction rating is 3.8 out of 10. This figure, I would point out, is the average across the 25 Member States. How would you rate the educational performance of a pupil scoring 3.8 out of 10 in a core subject? That is how people perceive Europe's current ability to deal with the problems linked to globalisation. I believe that that is the main problem. We cannot cleverly sidestep it.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, what, in the eyes of most of the Europeans polled, is – and I quote – ‘the key element for the future of Europe’? The most popular answer: to achieve comparable living standards throughout the Union. That is the opinion of 51% of those polled in the 25 countries and of as many as 74% in the new Member States. Our new fellow citizens obviously have no desire for their countries to form a kind of low-cost or cut-price Europe, which business communities long for.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, globalisation is perceived as a threat to the social model, and the single market is not seen as an answer to this fundamental problem. These concerns will not be alleviated by the project of a barrier-free transatlantic market, which is on the agenda of the next European Union-United States summit. Sidelining this section of the debate once again will not help us, in my opinion, to break the deadlock. It is only by accepting real changes, not only institutional ones, but also ones related to economic, social and political lines of action, that we will have the opportunity to breathe life back into the European dream.</p>

What we have here is rather the self-serving political elite talking amongst themselves. They could not be epitomised better than by a person like Mr Verhofstadt.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say I find it a bit rich for the Prime Minister of Belgium to come along here and tell 24 other nation states what they should do. I say that because perhaps he ought to look a bit more in his own back yard. The most recent opinion poll in Belgium – or should I say in Flanders – shows that 51% of people there favour independence from the Belgian state. The Vlaams Belang is now the biggest political party in Flanders. Is it, Mr Verhofstadt, because you are so embarrassed and ashamed that your own country is falling to pieces, that you come along here to encourage the rest of us to self-destruct as well? I am not sure.</p>
<p class="contents">I suppose there was at least a certain honesty about your speech, because you are an unashamed Euro-nationalist. You could not give a damn what ordinary people think. You could not give a damn about the referendum results in France and in the Netherlands last year. You said yourself today – in that most incredibly arrogant speech – that the whole process of political integration will continue regardless of what the people say. What you are doing is threatening the very basis of national self-determination and democracy. In the last century, this principle was thought to be so important that if you look in your own back yard, you will see the graves of many British soldiers who went to defend that very principle, on which you now seem to have turned your back.</p>
<p class="contents">It was clear last year! What is it about you, Mr Verhofstadt? What part of the word ‘no’ do you not understand?</p>

<p class="contents">The essence of the best idea and the best debate is when you have divergent opinions, coming together to try and garner the best from the situation. A number of key elements that were mentioned by the Prime Minister in his speech are deserving of more in-depth analysis and comment. However, if I may be so bold, I would like to touch on two or three elements.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the situation of whether or not the people want <span class="italic">more</span> Europe or <span class="italic">less</span> Europe, I would never dare to speak on behalf of all the people of Europe. However, I can speak on behalf of the people in my constituency in the south-west of Ireland, whom I met last weekend. Out of the 4500 people I met last week in Ireland, 3000 of them brought up issues of European concern that they wanted to see solved. Amazingly enough, for all the issues that they brought up, they saw that the best way of getting a solution was at a European level – not at a national level – because they saw there was a bigger picture involved. These issues involved the environment, fisheries, free trade and so on. They saw their best hope of advancement on all of these issues coming from a European level.</p>
<p class="contents">People <span class="italic">do</span> want more Europe in certain areas, but if you tell people in the world, or people in Europe, or people in my country, that they will be part of a European army; that their taxes will be determined by Brussels; that they will have no say with regard to what kind of a police force they will have, they will reject it out of hand. This is not because they dispute the argument or the veracity or the genuineness of the argument put forward, but because they see those as red-line issues. They see those as issues that are best dealt with by the people in their own country.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most important issues we have to discover is not to go down the simple road of saying ‘you are either for a federal Europe or against it’. Personally, I am against a federal Europe. The kind of model that has been successful for Europe has been one that we have created ourselves. It is not something that has been copied from some other model. It has been a creation out of necessity – the necessity that we now face before us. You touched on it yourself, Prime Minister, during your own questions concerning economics and other areas. The discussion is now taking place. Decisions will have to be taken at some stage in the short term, not in the long term, and such decisions will subsequently need to be properly implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">The Foreign Ministers in Vienna last week were correct when they said it was wrong to call this document a Constitution, because it is not a true Constitution in its right form. Call it a <span class="italic">Treaty</span> for a new Europe, but not a <span class="italic">Constitution</span> for a new Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In fact, we had another glowing example of this only a few minutes ago. Mr Verhofstadt is now urging his European colleagues to ignore the devastating results of the referendums in France and the Netherlands and continue to act as if nothing is wrong. Although Mr Verhofstadt is keen to get noticed as the champion of public involvement via referendums, he has not dared organise the promised referendum in his own country. Indeed, Mr Verhofstadt’s public involvement cannot be organised until he is certain of being right and not at any risk of losing.</p>
<p class="contents">This European democratic deficit is at its most obvious in the case of Turkey, which threatens to paralyse the entire European system. Europe has not run aground as a result of the outspoken, proper and well-founded distrust of the voting public in the Netherlands and in France, but rather because of the reasons that underpin it. Europe is stuck because eminent European statesmen refuse to define the territory of the European Union, refuse to restrict the potential accession of new candidate countries to countries that belong to Europe culturally, geographically and historically, which obviously does not include Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, Prime Minister Verhofstadt himself is one of the outspoken champions of this Turkish accession and refuses any referendum or democratic input on that subject.</p>
<p class="contents">A month ago, that other ivory-tower sage, Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, said that he could see no reason why a debate about the European boundaries should be held, on the grounds that such a debate could not lead anywhere. As it happens, the opposite is true. Only when the European citizens are reassured that Europe has boundaries, only when they know that their Europe is restricted to countries that have a common basis, something that is essential to them, only when the European citizens discover that their statesmen are once again prepared to listen to their voices and prepared to respect the outcome of democratic referendums, only then, and not before, can European recovery set in.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to repeat that in that sense, it was good and symbolic that it was none other than Mr Verhofstadt, the man who, in his own country, represents only 15% of the voters, that it was he who should come here to represent the eminent, pedantic eurocrats who are never prepared to listen, that is the role that was made for him. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I notice that there is, in actual fact, little difference between what he says here and what he says in Belgium. To him, Europe is just the church tower and nothing else. That is why he does not tolerate any further consideration being given to Europe, for he is interested only in what happens in a 5-mile radius around him. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR) </span>I, for my part, have a different opinion of Europe. I believe that Europe has a destiny and that it must follow that destiny. Above all, I believe that the history of Europe moves in a certain direction, and that is something that we must never forget. It is in fact history that teaches us what we should do, even if our points of view are sometimes very different. There are those who believe that things are moving too quickly or too slowly, or that other concepts should be developed. Yet, one thing remains clear, and that is history. History teaches us that, when we were divided and inward-looking, Europe was in crisis, a war was being fought, civil wars were constantly being fought.</p>
<p class="contents">I will therefore ask those who now claim that they do not want to enlarge Europe, to include the Balkans, for example: why should these countries be denied stability? If, in fact, they do not join the European Union, we know full well that, in the next two or three years, this part of the world will once again be in the grip of violence and war.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, the countries concerned must meet all of the conditions. However, those who claim today, <span class="italic">a priori</span>, that these countries and these populations cannot join, that there are borders, are actually telling them that they do not want them to enjoy what we have been enjoying for 50 years now in the European Union: peace, stability and well-being. That is something that we cannot accept. That is the selfishness that was being expressed a short while ago, and we must not give into it now. That is the current challenge, not the issue of Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span> </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL)</span> Is it not the case that the only reason why Turkey is being used here is as a pretext for displaying selfishness? Turkey is of no consequence to them. Whether Turkey joins or not, all that matters is that they can demonstrate that it would be best if we were all to end up self-sufficient. That is what the last speeches we heard, including the speech by Mr Farage, who said all kinds of things a moment ago, came down to in practice. I can tell you, Mr Farage</p>
<p class="contents">I can tell you that I am saying <span class="italic">exactly the same</span> thing in the Council as here in Parliament. That is absolutely necessary, because you cannot say one thing in the European Council and then the opposite in London or another city in Europe. I try to give exactly the same message to both the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span> </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Indeed, the most important thing, Mr President, is that, during the Council on 15 and 16 June, which will be a very important Council, we must try to decide together how to continue the process. Once again, I have nothing against extending the period of reflection. Nonetheless, I am going to ask that consideration also be given to Declaration 30 annexed to the Constitution, which was adopted by the Convention, by the European Council and by the countries of the European Union who ratified the Treaty. That does not in any way mean that we carry on regardless whatever the majority of French people or the majority of Dutch people think. That is the reason why I am suggesting to you a second strategy, alongside the continuation of the ratification process.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true, indeed, that we have to respond to the expectations of citizens and to their fears. We cannot do that by saying to them, ‘There you are, we have a Constitution’. Simply waking up one morning to hear that they have a Constitution is not going to reassure them. That is not how things work. We are the ones, above all, who need the Constitution to make progress on a certain number of things. We also need tangible policies and something which, in my opinion, is lacking most of all in the European Union, socio-economic governance. Why do you not understand that a monetary Union without a common socio-economic policy and strategy is utterly preposterous!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">That might already be, as I hope, the conclusion of the Council on 15 and 16 June. We would have made a step forward and not only for ourselves or for the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps I should plead guilty, Mr Poettering. At the beginning, with the Laeken declaration, we perhaps used the word 'constitution' a bit hastily for the time. The fact remains that now we must recognise that we need a twofold strategy. There is the Constitution, which we shall perhaps have to renegotiate to achieve unanimity. There is also a credible socio-economic policy that you, the Council and Parliament, have to put in place without delay, because that is what people want. Therein lies the response to globalisation. Europe is not the source of globalisation; no, it is the right answer to globalisation and that is the message that we have not yet adequately developed and put across to the nations of Europe.</p>

It is true: we are often Europeans without realising it, and we do not realise what great progress the Union has made; we do not give Europe the credit for it and instead we blame the Union for our little frustrations.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now in this period of reflection, trying to demonstrate that Europe works. As you have said, offering an example, I often wonder whether we are doing the right thing. For example, we say that Europe must gain legitimacy by creating work; but does Europe – the European Union – have the instruments for creating employment, or are they national instruments? If we set objectives that do not depend on the Union, but on the Member States, and we do not achieve them, then the Union will pay the price.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore going to propose to you, Mr Verhofstadt – and you can do this, because you are the Prime Minister of your country – that one day you carry out the following test, in order to demonstrate what life would be like for the citizens if Europe did not exist; you could, for example, on 29 May or 1 June, install border posts between your country and France and between your country and the Netherlands, and at those posts you could put customs officers who could ask the French or Dutch citizens for their passports and tell them that their French car insurance was not valid in Belgium and that they have to take out a green card.</p>
<p class="contents">And on one day – just one day – you could re-establish the Belgian Franc, and the euro would not be legal tender in Belgium and would have to be exchanged; and, when French and Dutch citizens returned to their beautiful countries, Mr President, those customs offices could make them fill out a form indicating the goods that they have bought in your country.</p>
<p class="contents">That would show them what the European Union is, Mr President.</p>

If even political leaders are not committed to Europe, people become disorientated and distrustful. Therefore, Mr Verhofstadt, I should like to welcome you, and to thank you for the vision you presented both in your book and here in Parliament. You have repeatedly emphasised that the heart of the European idea is political union, not just a huge market.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Economic Community was just a detour that we had to take because the Defence Community did not become a reality. That bears repeating, and the Treaties of Rome were preceded by the Messina Declaration. I very much welcome the possibility that we might be able to adopt a kind of 'Second Messina Declaration' next spring. It will not be called that, but the core could be the same: a renewed commitment to the objectives and grand projects of the EU in the coming years and decades.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need projects that are attractive to the people. Once again, we are discussing energy policy. We know that, in 20 years' time, 70% of our energy will come from imports from unsafe regions. Why do we not have the courage, as Jeremy Rifkin proposed, to launch a third industrial revolution in Europe with a solar hydrogen economy? We need it all: coal, oil, gas, that is business as usual, but this new basis for an energy revolution would be something that many people could approve of, and I would advise you to adopt something like this at the summit in June. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These days that deserves acknowledgement.</p>
<p class="contents">Prime Minister, we agree with your observations. Europe is experiencing a crisis of vocation, a crisis of inspiration, and, faced with this situation, the European Council cannot simply extend for a year the period of reflection. It is not a wild rush forward that people need. What the nations of Europe expect from their politicians is that they put forward a vision and outline perspectives. Here I should like to say a word about those perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we have, as you keep on repeating, an urgent need for economic governance for Europe. We have the euro, that is fine, but it is not enough. If we want to create growth and employment, we all know that we have to go further and coordinate our economic, budgetary and fiscal policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have an urgent need for new common policies: I am thinking of research and development, I am thinking of defence, I am thinking of the question of energy and its supply and production, and I am thinking also of the question of migration and codevelopment. On each of these questions, it would be completely unrealistic, and even misleading, to think or to give the impression that appropriate answers could be found at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we also urgently need a strengthened European presence in the world in order to create at last a new balance. In order to achieve all that, we shall obviously need to draw up a new Constitution that is shorter, simpler, clearer and refocused on the great principles on which our Union is founded. This text will have to state who we are and what values and what political project we are defending.</p>
<p class="contents">Prime Minister, you have understood what we are expecting from the next Council. It is that, for once, Heads of State or Government should put aside their political scheming and ulterior motives in order to place themselves, quite simply, at the service of the general European interest as a matter of urgency.</p>

Who would have thought it? By a Head of Government, in the middle of a pause for reflection; and on the subject of Europe, too. I would thank you for your intervention and for the clear and courageous language with which you have broken through the governments’ deafening silence – or, as some people would say, cacophony – and, in this House and in the middle of the crisis, risen above all the internal political considerations and mutterings about renationalisation in order to speak on behalf of Europe. To do so is not pleasant, but it is important and significant. You have resisted the temptation to manipulate the European debate and the motives of those who voted ‘no’.</p>
<p class="contents">That is currently the big problem, as I see it. Almost all the governments now try to attribute to people motives that they did not have, as if those who said ‘no’ had done so not in order to vote in favour of a more democratic and more social Europe that is capable of taking action and in order to direct their protest against Europe as it is at present but, instead, in order to demand less Europe. You have, in actual fact, listened to the people and not only to the other governments, as the British and Austrian Presidencies of the Council did.</p>
<p class="contents">You withstood the hubris that persuades us that we were much too quick off the mark with the Constitution, had aimed too high, had asked too much of people and had set our sights too high. No, you have been one of the very few people to have understood that the opposite is the case. We were too slow and did not aim high enough. Our goals were not magnanimous enough and our visions were unconvincing and our compromises too lazy. That is why you call for the crisis to be solved not by slackening our pace nor by being weary, resigned and demagogic, but by taking a clear step forwards.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to add just one proposal. If we could agree to incorporate this step that you propose into a rider to the Constitution, covering many fields including democracy, social powers and individual responsibility for security, then we need not destroy the constitutional process. Instead, we can show people a clear way forward and a means of progressing further towards a higher goal. Moreover, we need not allow the ‘no’ votes to cause Europe to fail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I personally share your vision of a federal United States of Europe. As a member of the Convention to draft the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and also of the Constitutional Convention, the extent to which this idea is really so much pie in the sky became clear to me, however, in the corresponding debates. Ideas about how far European integration should now be taken are extremely different, not only between the Member States but also between political forces, indeed even within the political groups, including my own.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of all this, I had never expected, when the Constitutional Convention began, what great strides it would be possible to make in deepening integration and how much more it would be possible to achieve in terms of democracy, citizens’ rights and the strengthening of a polity based on social welfare. The Constitution constitutes huge progress for Europe and, at the same time, reflects the political consensus that has been achieved. A member of my own party very recently spoke of it contemptuously as old, unpalatable rubbish, but it really is nothing of the kind. Neither the progress made nor the consensus achieved should be put at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">That, Mr Verhofstadt, is precisely why I do not share your concept of the eurozone states, nor Mr Sarkozy’s alternative concept of what he calls the pioneer group. In my view, both models are already unrealistic because, in the course of last year, two founder states quite obviously lost the title, ‘pioneer of Europe’. The fact that Commission President Barroso has still not understood the signs of the times is shown by his agenda, which is purportedly citizen-friendly but which, in my opinion, amounts to nothing other than a return to Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that it is only as a social Europe that our continent will be equipped to face the future, and on this matter I share Mr Juncker’s opinion. In receiving the International Charlemagne Prize of the city of Aachen, an award on which I should like to congratulate him, Dr Juncker rightly pointed out that Europe would founder if, in the next few years, it did not succeed in becoming a social Europe, for example through having a basic minimum of employees’ rights, valid throughout Europe. It is a pity that you have said so little about this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He does not hide his goal. He does not deny the facts. He has even written a courageous, self-critical Laeken Declaration containing a critique of the EU as it currently exists, and one with which most critics of the EU would concur. Unfortunately, it was overlooked in the constitutional Convention, and that courage failed him when Belgium was to ratify the Constitution. That was the end of his desire to get closer to the people through openness and democracy. The views of the Belgians were not to be heard through a referendum. The people of Belgium were not to be given the opportunity to vote ‘no’ to the Constitution, like the linguistic cousins of the Flemings in the Netherlands or those of the Walloons in France. The United States of Europe – yes – but not by asking the people. Take heart, Mr Verhofstadt. Take your colleagues with you in burying this rejected Constitution. Organise direct elections to a new convention. Get proposals drawn up that can then be put to referendums in every country at the same time. Until then, open up all meetings where laws are adopted. Put every document on the Internet. Allow the national parliaments to vote on the annual legislation programme. Allow the Commissioners to appear in the European Committees of their national parliaments and thus to be in touch with their national democracies.

In my opinion the rejected draft Constitutional Treaty offers this very prospect.</p>
<p class="contents">Our limitations have recently made themselves painfully clear when dealing with conflicts of interest between Member States in the context of the northern gas pipeline project. The European Union was powerless not for lack of a constitution, but for lack of political will. There is, however, an alternative: let us concentrate on the specific matters that are already on the table, such as improving the operation of the common market and the euro zone and improving cooperation between countries on security and on internal affairs, and ultimately on cohesion policy. The shorter the list, the easier the public will find it to understand our aims.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Poettering, please refrain from blackmailing us with the choice between an energy policy with the Constitutional Treaty or none at all. Let us start discussions on what really does bind us, let us write these aims down and then implement them. This would provide a good basis for an amended treaty. Yet let us not do it by hastily and arrogantly incorporating each policy into procedures and institution. Let us do it without including tasks that are impossible to implement at Community level. Let us first find the basis and substance for a common policy, or in other words what actually binds us, because no procedures on earth are capable of creating a common position where no such substance exists. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If I were a judge in a figure-skating competition, I would give very good marks for artistic performance, but less on the technical aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">You wondered and even asked a question as to why the citizens of Europe do not trust the European Union. I can give you the example of Slovakia and the new Member States: we had to meet very strict criteria for full membership. We have been full members for two years now, and you can see whether the ideals of the European Union have been fulfilled. Restrictions on free movement, transitional periods limit employment opportunities; the Services Directive has not been adopted, inadequate and incomplete access to health services, etcetera. Is it possible for one of the founding Member States, France, not to support the Constitutional Treaty, with Strasbourg being the seat of the European Parliament and the former French president, Valéry Giscard d´Estaing, chairing the Convention to draw up the constitutional treaty? All of these are questions in which our citizens see a disparity between words and deeds. Have you thought about the real situation as regards meeting the targets of the Lisbon Strategy?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr. Prime Minister, I ask you, wake up! We are already half-way through the period, and we should have had results by now. It is too late in the day to speak about what should have been done. At least say in your closing speech what needs to be done now, what needs to be done tomorrow, and what needs to be done in a month’s time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I rejoice at Mr Verhofstadt’s coming here to set the ball rolling, for he is indeed one of the people who made an active contribution during the period of reflection. I broadly support his twin-track approach, which amounts to continuing the ratification process while at the same time taking initiatives rather than resting on our laurels. I do not see eye to eye with him, though, when he claims that we can meanwhile indulge in unbridled enlargement. While I am not opposed to enlargement, I do fear that further enlargement without deepening the European Union will lead to something we do not want, namely a free-trade zone.</p>
<p class="contents">What I do think is that we should try even harder to explain to our citizens that the right response to what scares them at present, namely the changes and globalisation, is not to withdraw into some sort of economic patriotism or nationalism, but that only a European response is a real response to globalisation; and that this also means that Europe must adjust to the new concept of globalisation and the information society, and we will only succeed if we join forces within Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, only as one Europe can we be a real global actor that defends our interests and values in this global world of tomorrow. Our citizens are, at present not yet aware of this; they still believe that they will manage by closing themselves off from the outside world. We must tell them that globalisation is irreversible, that it will happen without Europe if we do not take a tough line. We can play a very strong role in globalisation, provided Europe is strong. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first aspect is the time factor. Mr Verhofstadt emphasised the problem of the Lisbon process. We have no time to lose. Five years for the Community patent is stupid. Furthermore, I should like to say that the Heads of State or Government have a very great responsibility regarding the financial perspective with, for example, the research programme which has less money, in real terms, in 2007, 2008 and 2009 than in 2006. There is surely a basic contradiction there between talk and reality. I think that the method too – open coordination – has been shown to be inadequate. The instruments of Community policy, therefore, are not supported in the budget. Consequently, it is not possible to make a policy that is grounded in real circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect on which I should like to elaborate, very briefly, of course, is the social aspect. We have spoken of the rejection of the Constitution. It is true, and you quite rightly made reference to it, that the social aspect was there 50 years ago: there was hope of social improvement after the war. Nowadays, people do not have that feeling. Therefore, one priority would be, in the same way that the Europe of monetary unity was created from the European currency snake, to create a European social snake that would make it possible to realise tangible achievements in this field too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I just have time to comment on one point only: your two-track strategy. First of all, and I think Mrs Frassoni has already said this: ‘yes’ to the continuation of the ratification process.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, the two tracks should intersect and intertwine. I mean that the provisions governing the institutions must be consistent with your political priorities. Thus, you will not get very far with the Eurogroup process if the decisions are not taken by a qualified majority in fiscal matters, at least on certain issues. You will not get very far either in matters of foreign policy and defence unless you have a budget that has been granted independent financing. In this respect, I shall make it clear that I have no problem with the European Army if its purpose is the prevention of conflicts.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr Verhofstadt, we must prepare ourselves to renegotiate the Constitutional Treaty on two or three specific points. I would draw your attention to the fact that the current provisions in the Treaty, concerning the flexibility clause and enhanced cooperation, are inadequate and that, consequently, from this point of view, especially if we wish to continue with enlargement, countries that wish to forge ahead should be allowed to do so. You say it in your book; you have not said it enough, in my opinion, in your speech but I am sure that you think it and, therefore, I support you in this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Democracy as a political system requires a demos, a people whose citizens recognise a strong sense of community with each other and who are therefore prepared to take an extensive degree of responsibility for one another. A demos has common cultural traditions and a common history. A demos has a common political arena in which debate can take place and where conflicts can be analysed and resolved by democratic means. A demos has a national identity which shapes the very soil from which democracy can grow and in which it can stand tall and survive trials and tribulations.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Verhofstadt is a typical representative of the euro-elite who believe that it is possible to replace national identities with a rapidly assembled European identity in which a flag, national anthem and national day can be quickly launched, pretty much like the new currency. By attempting to push through a political union that lacks legitimacy in the eyes of Europeans, the EU establishment risks creating grass-roots opposition to the whole integration project. Mr Verhofstadt scornfully calls the freedom for us Europeans to trade with one another, settle where we want, study where we want and invest where we want ‘just a free trade zone’. Freedom, however, is not ‘just’ anything. Rather, ‘Freedom is the best thing that can be sought the whole world over’, to quote an old Swedish folk song from the Middle Ages.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you that if, with the aid of a constitution, we attempt to force on the Member States a policy that will always lack the support of the people, we will be heading for the collapse of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must be mindful of the fact that this is a momentous occasion, particularly in geopolitical and cultural terms. Both the candidate countries are on the Balkan Peninsula, which has historically been known as Europe’s soft underbelly. The accession of Bulgaria will also mean the EU entering the field of eastern culture.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community’s expansion in that direction should therefore be prudent and responsible. That is why I would like to warn against the recently-expressed reservations about the reforms in Romania and Bulgaria, which in my view are over the top. This is the only way in which ill-considered accusations against these countries regarding widespread corruption can be interpreted. Those who express such accusations should bear in mind that in Bulgaria and Romania, more than in any other European countries, corruption is a legacy of the Communist past. The post-Soviet structures, which remained untouched for many years, became a source of bribery and other criminal activity.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also bear in mind that Europe itself is partly responsible for this state of affairs, by not giving sufficient support to de-Communisation and vetting movements. The European Union has come into being thanks to the integration of nations. However, this is only possible through a mutual understanding of their legacies and problems, because that is the only way in which a partnership can be built. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The speech demonstrated that the political elites’ claim to be listening to the people of Europe is as phoney as the latest suggestion of a cosmetic stunt of dropping the title ‘Constitution’.</p>

Europe needs a debate and European leaders need to hear and understand what people are saying to them, especially following the meeting of Foreign Ministers at the weekend. Apparently no one at that meeting pronounced the Constitution dead. However, the Dutch Foreign Minister has said on a number of occasions that following the ‘no’ vote in his country’s referendum last year, that is in fact the position. Who is right? We need to know.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ministers agreed to let the discussion run for at least another year. I think that is a mistake. No one seriously believes that the Constitution can credibly be presented again to the peoples of France and the Netherlands, who have already spoken. That would only serve to fuel the sense among our peoples that the EU remains oblivious to their concerns and priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole point of the Laeken declaration in 2001 was that the EU needed to find ways of getting closer to its citizens and making the institutions more transparent and accountable. The Constitution sadly failed those basic tests. However, I am glad that the Foreign Ministers agreed that there would be no Constitutional cherry-picking while the debate goes on.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course the future of the EU is a very important subject: the kind of Europe we want to live in is important for our countries and peoples. I have a very positive vision of a Europe of nation states working ever more closely together. I want to see the EU move on to a new agenda: a reforming agenda that tackles effectively the sense of alienation between the institutions of Brussels; a reforming agenda that works for fundamental economic reform through liberalisation and more open markets, and puts growth at the forefront of its priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to see greater and more effective intergovernmental cooperation in tackling environmental challenges and fighting the scourge of terrorism.</p>

Some of us are acquainted with his very pro-active approach, but at times like these – amidst growing euro-scepticism and pessimism – a positive take such as his is more than welcome. I am indebted to him for this.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also grateful that this debate has happened at all, because it looks to me that both the Prime Minister’s speech and the speeches of a number of our fellow Members, including group chairmen, managed to lay bare the main areas of concern that we face. I would first of all like to mention the schizophrenia among Heads of Government, Heads of State and ministers who meet to take joint decisions on average once a month, in the case of ministers, and four times a year in the case of Heads of State or Government, without whose permission nothing can be done in Europe. After their meetings, they go home and act as if they have nothing to do with this whole European business, as a result of which, of course, there is, inevitably, huge distrust on the part of the public. As you said yourself, Prime Minister, if something has gone right, then they, and they alone, take the credit; if something went wrong, then Brussels is obviously to blame. This is what I would call schizophrenia.</p>
<p class="contents">Many Members also mentioned masochism. So many Heads of Government, Heads of State or Members of this House are enormously eloquent in underlining the EU’s shortcomings, but never mention what it does right. In the final analysis, Mr Verhofstadt, I think you have shown the way forward in saying that we should look for ‘and/and’, rather than ‘either/or’ solutions. I think that that is the way we can leave the crisis behind. Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I welcome the idea of using specific projects as means of continuing to put Europe on the map. In fact, this Parliament has taken the lead in that respect by making Europe more social, rejecting the Port Directive and amending the Bolkestein Directive.</p>

Europe is our culture, our values and our Western civilisation, which believes in freedom, tolerance, the importance of the individual, and peace, and which therefore cannot relinquish its Christian roots. That is why we must not think of the Union merely as a bureaucracy divorced from the people and an institution concerned only with laying down rules about countless petty issues. In order to involve people’s minds – that is the problem – we need a Europe that offers solutions to people’s most important demands, as provided for in the text of the Constitutional Treaty signed in Rome.</p>
<p class="contents">To overcome the current crisis, the Union needs a treaty that brings Europe closer to its people. We therefore place great trust in the German Presidency to achieve a goal towards which we are all striving. Europe needs to become stronger within a context of vital transatlantic relations. It needs political unity in order to address a number of major challenges: first, the fight against terrorism, in order to build peace in the Middle East and the Balkans; second, growth and development by means of the Lisbon process, but without breaking certain rules to which science, too, must be subject, and the liberalisation of the services market as quickly as possible; third, the economic and commercial confrontation with China and India, two major emerging countries that are, however, preparing to form an alliance with each other; the fourth challenge is the energy question, not forgetting the nuclear option; the fifth is immigration and the African emergency; and the sixth is expansion of our borders, starting with the accession of Romania and Bulgaria and then that of Croatia, without closing the door on other candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall only overcome these challenges if we succeed in transforming today’s Europe, which is too tied up in bureaucracy, into a Europe of the people, of policies and of values. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I suggest that you apply this formula to the Constitution. I am French and I start from a premise that is probably obvious: The French will not vote again on the same text.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us start from there. Let us go even to the end of the ratifications. Personally, I want that, it is a right for nations and it is a duty for leaders. It will probably result in a few more rejections but we shall take it to the end. That means that, whatever happens, some new thing will be needed – I say ‘thing’ to avoid words that cause annoyance. We go, therefore, to the end with as many ratification procedures as there are countries, that is to say not 25 but 27 with the Romanians and the Bulgarians, whom we are always forgetting because their accession is as good as ratified, as it is included in the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">We go round all the countries, therefore, but that could begin all over again endlessly. Here, then, I agree with your idea: we have to scrap unanimity. We have to break down the barriers and to do that we have to rewrite Declaration 30 differently. In this way, if, when the time comes, for example, 22 out of 27 countries say ‘yes’ and 5 say ‘no’, the 5 who say ‘no’ either accept the majority rule or they stand down. Otherwise, we shall go round and round in circles, and from postponement to postponement and from reflection to reflection.</p>

You touched on a number of points, and, though it would be useful, it would be impossible to discuss all of them. I shall speak about one, the Lisbon Strategy, which is the issue that over the past five years has left us most open to ridicule. The Lisbon Strategy is a delightful set of intentions, yet commits the cardinal sin of not being a Community strategy, as you correctly pointed out. That is a cardinal sin, but we have then gone on to commit the truly deadly sin of not rectifying it; in other words, we have failed to give the Commission the responsibility and the resources to make proposals on areas such as the internal market and the single currency.</p>
<p class="contents">We still confuse intentions with workable, measurable objectives, and objectives with the activities needed to achieve those objectives. I know that you understand this kind of language, Prime Minister.

I should like to continue with this theme and say that I should like, in particular, to see a Commission President with so much commitment to standing up for Europe’s future.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall continue from where the previous speaker left off. In criticising the defective economic and social policy, he highlighted, among other things, the Lisbon Process and this open method of coordination. I believe that this method is a particularly good example of the principle of subsidiarity being misunderstood, as the Member States formally insist on their powers in these areas but are, in fact, unaware, or only partially aware, of what these specifically amount to. The consequence of all this is that the damage is taken to have been caused by the European Union, and the Member States are not seen as being responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that our shortcomings in terms of economic and social policy are not, unfortunately, all going to be solved by means of this Constitutional Treaty. These shortcomings were also the basis of our failure in the Convention, as we achieved almost nothing, or not very much, in this area. My question is now as follows: what solutions, other than the opportunities in the eurozone that have been pointed out, do you envisage whereby, in spite of holding on to this Constitutional Treaty, we can secure what is contained in the Treaty with a view nonetheless to making further progress in this area? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also get the impression that Parliament has become entrenched in its previous positions, with supporters remaining supporters, and opponents remaining opponents. We have not sought any real ways out of the constitutional crisis facing Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, expert bodies have put forward at least a dozen different solutions to the constitutional crisis. I would like to mention one of them in detail, because I would like all Members present to take note of it. It is the variant of the ‘small constitution’, or in other words the implementation of those provisions of the present document that are most constitutional in character, by which I mean the provisions of Sections One and Two, in a constitution. Those provisions that are more executive in nature would then be implemented by way of reforms of primary legislation and through the use of secondary legislative instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the fiasco of the referenda in France and the Netherlands, it appears that we should do all we can to defend the Constitutional Treaty. This is justified by the answers to the following three questions. Firstly, do we really want a more far-reaching European Union, or in other words do we want more Europe? The answer to this question, at least in my political circles, is yes, we do want more Europe, because only deeper integration makes a stronger, more effective and more democratic EU possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question is whether we want a constitution. Yes, we do want a constitution, because the constitution provides us with the chance of a stronger, more effective and more democratic EU. Finally, the third question is whether we want this particular Constitutional Treaty. Yes we do, but not at all costs. We have to accept political reality and be as flexible as possible and only put in place solutions that are attainable in the given situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We were supposed to come up with the answers during the period of reflection, but this period has not been a success. There have been no national debates and no support from the European institutions, in particular the Council, which after the ‘no’ votes in France and the Netherlands adopted a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has fallen into lethargy, and for that reason I would like to ask you, Mr Verhofstadt, at the June session of the Council, to ask the leaders of those countries which have postponed the ratification process what they intend to do now and what their plans are. Please do not accept the answer that it is an internal affair, because it is not. Ratification of an international treaty is an obligation for the countries that have signed it. It is also a test of their credibility and of their capacity to cooperate in international relations.</p>

On the one hand, there is the pessimism of the most enthusiastic Europeans, who sometimes speak as if the European Union were in terminal crisis; as if very little has been achieved over the last 50 years; as if it is just a free-trade area and that we still need to build a political Europe, as if what we have is somehow not political.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, there are the fears and the pessimisms of the anti-Europeans, who seem to think that we have already built not just a federal system, but a centralised superstate with everything being decided not just in this Parliament, but by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither fear is an accurate representation of reality. The reality is that the Union has a solid set of achievements to its credit, but with shortcomings. The Constitution was intended to address these shortcomings with sets of reforms that, although not very radical, would be useful. Surely it is right that we take the time to complete the period of reflection and try first to save the Constitution – or most of it – before calling for a two-speed Europe and going down that road. Tempting as it is to build Europe without France, it would surely be better to try to bring France on board first. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My first point is that the Prime Minister is one of the best defenders of Europe. I was in Nice as a civil servant when he defended a stronger Europe, easier decision-making and qualified majority voting. He was able to hold the meeting hostage to the last minute and he is one of the few who actually defends a truly federal Europe today. There are not too many ‘federalists’ out there: there are many closet federalists, but not many real federalists any more. I really commend him and congratulate him on that. I am glad that some prime ministers are still European.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the controversy about the name of the Constitution. I heard the debate with the Foreign Ministers and I disagree with those who wish to change the name. The name of a ‘Constitutional Treaty’ describes what it is perfectly: it has constitutional elements and it is an international treaty. That treaty’s name was conceived in Joschka Fischer’s speech in May 2000 – six years ago. What responsible parent, six years after christening a child, would go ahead and change its name? It would lose its identity. So let us not try to hide things. Problems do not go away with the change of a name.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Prime Minister suggested that there should be a core group around the euro countries. Could he be more specific? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must admit that, compared with when I was a member of the European Convention, I am much more convinced of closer cooperation between members of the European Union. It is very clear that a Europe of 500 million cannot rely on and cannot work on the basis of the Nice Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I am absolutely in favour of Prime Minister Verhofstadt’s idea that we need courageous leadership, because without determination and clear convictions we cannot convince our voters to support this project. Therefore we need to stop speaking half-truths; we need to stop saying one thing in the European Council and then another thing at home; we need to stop thinking in practical terms about forthcoming elections. Our voters know when we are speaking half-truths and if we are not showing clear conviction.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must not isolate ourselves. We need transatlantic cooperation – the next item on the agenda this afternoon – to strengthen the project, and I will fully support that idea. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I shall begin with the question of Declaration 30 because this Declaration has quite a strange history. The principle of four fifths of Member States was already present in the original proposals that were presented by the Prodi Commission. It appeared there, however, in order to state that if four fifths of the Member States ratified the treaty, then we would go ahead, which was naturally unacceptable to certain members of the European Council. Subsequently, we, the Convention and then the Intergovernmental Conference, wanted to retain this concept of four fifths.</p>
<p class="contents">How was the matter to be presented? We could not say that if four fifths of the Member States ratified the Treaty, we would go ahead with it, because that would amount after all to abolishing the unanimity rule, which indeed will need to happen one day. The Americans did it in 1787 on the occasion of the Philadelphia Convention. It was a seizure of power by 9 out of the 13 States that existed at the time.</p>
<p class="contents">What had to be done, therefore, in order to retain the four-fifths concept? In the end the following wording was decided on: ‘the matter will be referred to the European Council’. This is what is stated in the Declaration annexed to the Treaty, while in reality the concept of four fifths has a very different origin since, in the beginning, there was no question of organising a debate within the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The motive behind this concept, a motive which stems from the Convention and the proposals of the Prodi Commission, and ultimately was not taken up in the final text, neither by the Convention nor by the Intergovernmental Conference, was to find a solution to a particular situation. Who did they have in mind, then, in relation to this concept? Certainly not the French, but rather that part of the Union that is on the side of Mr Kirkhope and others, a part anyway that is on the other side of the Channel. That is what they had in mind. They said: if everyone says ‘yes’ and the British say ‘no’, we shall still see each other within the European Council so that we can carry on. That was the motive behind the four fifths. Lo and behold, it is the wretched French who vote ‘no’, and present us with the problem of the application of the four fifths. In substance, I am in agreement: the ideal would be to have a system where unanimity disappeared and was replaced by something else, a European referendum or a four-fifths majority, for example. To achieve that, however, we should have to have referendums, popular consultations, and in the countries who voted ‘no’ as well.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the reason why I am talking about a second track. You can do anything: continue with ratification, fine, I am asking for that; make use of the four fifths principle, fine; extend the period of reflection, fine; organise an Intergovernmental Conference as Mr Duff is asking, fine, but all that still means years and years of work. This work, between you and me, is going to be very interesting but it would really be a serious error not to do something else straightaway. We are going, therefore, to consider the four fifths, Declaration 30 and an Intergovernmental Conference; and we shall perhaps make this or that change to the draft Constitution, otherwise it will never be acceptable in the two countries that said ‘no’. All these things are obvious and constitute, indeed, the first track to be followed.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be a gross error, however, not to open up straight away a second track that does not require amending the Treaty. Now, all the things I spoke about in my introduction, all the proposals that I made require no amendment to the Treaty. Another big advantage is that France and the Netherlands are already part of the Euro zone. There is no need for us to initiate a great debate to find out whether or not they wish to participate.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect that I wish to emphasise regarding cooperation within the Euro zone is that it is an open cooperation, it is not a closed club, it is a reality that exists and which will grow with the entry of Slovenia by 1 January 2007 at the latest. I do not know whether the Ecofin Council has completed its scrutiny of the other countries, on the basis of the opinion of the Commission and the European Central Bank, but these countries will join nonetheless, maybe not in 2007, but then it will be 1 January 2008. It is therefore certain that this group will continue to grow.</p>
<p class="contents">Why not move forward with it in real terms? Because if the citizens said ‘no’ at the time of the referendum in France, it is because there is no socio-economic convergence and because there is no way to respond to their expectations at the social level. Consequently, we have to follow the two tracks and, if it is true that it would be a mistake to abandon ratification of the Constitution, it would be another grave mistake to straight away take the other track, that of the socio-economic governance that everyone wants. That is perhaps the most important conclusion that one can draw from the referendum in France and indeed also in the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="contents">As someone, I think it was my predecessor, Jean-Luc Dehaene, said: I am not advocating enlargement now and not doing all the rest, I am advocating doing both at the same time. For it to be possible to do both at the same time, however, one must have the courage, again this year, or, at the latest, next year, to initiate socio-economic governance in the European Union. Otherwise, once again, for year after year, we shall be fighting, talking away endlessly about the Constitution, and consequently losing even more the support of the citizens of the European Union.</p>

<p class="contents">The resolution that they have put forward for the vote at the next plenary session of Parliament is indicative of their true objectives. In a display of contempt for the will expressed by the French and Dutch people, as well as other people who have not been allowed to express the same opinion, the dominant forces in Parliament have imposed a constitutional agreement and their own support for the European Constitution, by rejecting amendments and pressing ahead with ratifications in the countries that rejected the Treaty – with the use of Community funding – by the time of the next elections to Parliament in June 2009.</p>

This is expected to be achieved on 1 January 2007. It has now become imperative that we find answers to the questions regarding a unified Europe, the existing unified will for development, and the Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Where to now, Europe? Are we going to achieve the vision of a federal European State, as advocated by Jacques Delors, or that of a looser alliance of states? The questions and their answers, yet to be found, cannot prevent the will of the deciding majority to be taken into account in the decision-making process of the European Union. We cannot allow progress to be hindered by any one state! However, this can only be achieved by the renewal of the institutional and decision-making system of the European Union, because the Union cannot be enlarged any further if it does not change the way it functions.</p>
<p class="contents">Without high-standard legislation, a more efficient decision-making mechanism and a stronger role of Parliament, the European Union may not only lose its efficiency, but its ability to function, as well. The fact that the European Union has become stuck within its current legal framework reinforces the very reason why the citizens of two countries voted against the Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is not just an economic project, but also a supranational institutional system that also serves solidarity and the protection of social values. There are many who miss the fact that this is not emphasised to a greater extent. We must make it clear to them that the implementation of this partly depends on the fate of the Constitution and on the efficiency of the European Union. Therefore, European Union legislation must be brought closer to people.</p>
