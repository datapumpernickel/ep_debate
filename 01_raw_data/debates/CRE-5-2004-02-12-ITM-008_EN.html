Representatives of the two largest groups and of one of the other groups in this House recently paid separate visits to Iran. I can see that the groups are largely in agreement in their assessments of the current situation and in the political conclusions they have drawn. Sadly, we are compelled to note that the process of democratisation has received a severe setback, in that this forthcoming election will be less democratic than the previous one. The President and the majority of members of the Parliament in Tehran agree that this cannot be regarded as a free and fair election. We share their view.</p>
<p class="contents">The electorate, whose frustration is so deep that they are not even supporting the reformers, are likely to vote with their feet and stay at home on election day. This really benefits no one, not even the usual suspects in Iran, although they are delighted and are already canvassing European governments to do business with them and forget the reformers.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to ask the Commission whether, in view of this setback, it simply plans to turn its attention to other matters. On behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, let me say that we must now intensify our political contacts with the Iranian institutions but also with all the political forces and civil society in Iran. We must not only talk to those in the reformist camp; it is also particularly important that we seek dialogue – and it will be a difficult dialogue – with those who exercise power in the judiciary and in the Council of Guardians and make it clear to them that, if they continue to pursue their present policies, they will make poor use of their country’s potential, obstruct progress towards a Trade and Cooperation Agreement with the EU and, above all, thwart the hopes and expectations of the Iranian people. Also, any sustained attempt to govern against the people is doomed to failure, as events of recent decades in this world have shown. That is why I make this appeal to those who hold power in Iran: change; turn about, before it is too late. Perhaps you can indeed put the domestic dialogue back on track, so as to foster the growth of democracy in Iran. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Their exclusive power to interpret the Koran is constantly being abused for political ends. They block everything that does not appeal to them or that could impinge on their own position of power. They have now vetoed more than a third of the laws adopted by the parliament. More than 2 500 reform-minded candidates have now been excluded from the elections, including around 80 sitting MPs. Whilst large sectors of society, young people in particular, want modernisation and freedom, the hard core in power is clinging to medieval ideas and repressive practices. The younger generation constitutes the vast majority of the population in Iran. In addition, even many former revolutionaries have become disillusioned by the clergy’s abuse of power. President Khatami himself calls the exclusion of candidates a threat to the nation and the system. The conflict between reformers and conservative clergymen is increasingly coming to a head. If nothing is done about it, it seems that it is only a matter of time before the situation boils over, with everything that entails. The human rights and democratic situation in Iran is still extremely worrying. Unless substantial improvements are made, the European Union will not be able to form a partnership. It is highly debatable whether it is actually still advisable to continue to negotiate. What is Commissioner Patten’s opinion on this? Does he still see prospects for partnership with Iran now that the situation is deteriorating so dramatically? Nor is the human rights dialogue with Iran of any great account, as I know from personal experience. It will not make things any better if the parliamentary elections turn out to be a farce. The European Union must not lend itself to a dialogue that is used as a pretext for not actually carrying out any reforms. Iran is a potentially rich country with an ancient civilisation, and has the potential to play an extremely important, constructive role in the region. It will not become a new civilisation, however, whilst the ayatollahs continue to abuse their unrestricted power, but will instead be doomed to remain an international pariah. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

More than ever, therefore, and certainly more than in the past, our Community institutions must make their presence and influence felt among the conflicting forces in the Iranian Parliament, in President Khatami’s Participation Front and in Ayatollah Khamenei’s Guardian Council, in order to defend the universality of the values of the rule of law, democracy and human rights. These fundamentals should serve as a basis for negotiations and exchanges between the two factions, without which there is a risk of ending up with a State in which there is no rule of law, and to push that State or to push the cohesion of Iranian society and the geopolitics of this tormented region towards even worse scenarios.</p>
<p class="contents">The time has come to defuse the Council of Guardian’s attempts to disqualify reformist parliamentary candidates in the forthcoming general elections. In effect, the acknowledged absence of democratic rules and procedural transparency will end up discrediting the political rulers and encouraging their rejection. Those rulers have already succumbed to the suppression of freedoms, including freedom of expression, and they are the cause of the failure of economic and social development. To suppress all the democratic aspirations of the people of Iran, who are already worn down by years of war and revolution, would be to snuff out their last hopes and ideals, leaving the way open to despairing ideologies and extremisms.</p>
<p class="contents">The mobilisation of the European Union must be a matter of priority and it must be committed and pro-active, and must engage decision makers and all social categories or categories of activity. Any withdrawal, any ostracism on the part of foreign diplomats, would strengthen the retrograde and destabilising forces in a region of the Middle East which is as far from us in geographical terms as it is geo-politically sensitive in our view.</p>
<p class="contents">Any argument in favour of severing cultural links between Europe and the Middle East should also be rejected. The creation of a special parliamentary delegation to Iran proves this, the signing of the additional protocol on safety controls for nuclear materials confirms it, and the preliminary discussions between the European Union and Iran on human rights should convince us of it. These first signs must support and encourage the European Union’s approach to the Iranian authorities with a view to sending, right now, a party of observers to examine the electoral process and cooperating, right now, in judicial reforms and in the control of drug trafficking. At the present time, history is being made in Iran, and Brussels has learned enough from Munich in the past to be aware that it cannot refuse to make its voice heard now in Tehran. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That influence often produces results quite different from those that had been expected. Muslim fundamentalists in Afghanistan and Saddam Hussein’s regime in Iraq owed their survival not so long ago to support from the West against others. In Iran, too, attempts were made for a long time to keep allies in power when their position was contested. Fifty years ago, the Mossadeq government was ousted as it was considered that it was too left-wing and that it could conceivably have entered into cooperation with Iran’s neighbours to the north, which were still part of the Soviet Union. An authoritarian ruler, the Shah, returned to power, but he proceeded to make ever more enemies in his own country on account of his lust for power and his neglect of his people. Whilst left-wing nationalism and socialism had no opportunity to constitute an alternative, a medieval variant of Islam was given renewed opportunities to organise popular resistance. Twenty-five years ago, a popular uprising put an end to a regime that had always sought military and economic cooperation with the West.</p>
<p class="contents">The outside world has never trusted the new authorities. Following a few years of great enthusiasm, social policy and democratic experiments, this regime, too, incurred hatred within the country. The sizeable younger generation wants an end to the exclusion of politicians whose views differ from those of the conservative clergy, to restrictive rules for women, to the expulsion of students, and to the frequent hanging, stoning or amputation of body parts of those who do not fit into the world view of the authorities. Many people have fled the tyranny, often to Europe. Nevertheless, in recent years, Europe, motivated by economic interests, has been making overtures to this regime. The United States was hesitant, but seemed to be doing the same after Iran suffered the earthquake in Bam and showed readiness to have its nuclear projects inspected. In 2002, a part of the opposition standing up for the rights and freedoms that we take for granted in Europe was placed on a list of terrorist organisations. That increased the confidence of the real authorities in stopping earlier initiatives for democratisation and normalisation. Excluding the most critical candidates reversed the political composition of the parliament from the outset, turning the large majority into a small minority. My group hopes that Europe will learn from this and take the side of the Iranian people and their resistance organisations from now on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In a speech on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of Iran’s Islamic revolution, the Head of State levelled particularly sharp criticism at the exclusion of a whole host of reform-minded candidates from the parliamentary elections on 20 February. President Khatami said – and my colleague Mr van den Bos has also said this – that elections are a symbol of democracy. The President then warned that ‘if this [right] is restricted, it’s a threat to the nation and the system’. His message to the conservative forces in the Islamic republic is unmistakable. Their repressive actions are destabilising both State and society. Public bitterness is already great and will only increase. What is the lesson that the European Parliament should draw from these unfair elections for the Iranian parliament, the Majlis? If it turns out that the vast majority of the new Majlis consists of arch-conservative, even radical Islamists, we should not set any store by close relations. ‘A sheer waste of taxes,’ a German Iran specialist, who is also a voter, commented to me an hour ago. I think that this is spot on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yes, the majority of university and college students are women. It is probably this very situation that prompted the Council of Guardians to curb and nullify the potential effects of what we, from our perspective, see as an encouraging development.</p>
<p class="contents">If we talk today about the elections in Iran, it would be quite legitimate for anyone to say that Iran should take its own decision and to ask why we are interfering. I would say yes, Iran – that is to say the population of Iran – should decide for itself. That, however, is precisely what the Council of Guardians wants to prevent. It is not a matter of reformers or non-reformers. If the non-reformers are elected, we shall have to live with that. The point is that the Council of Guardians operates a selection process from the outset to determine who is allowed to stand for election, and it is this very selection process that prevents the Iranian people from deciding freely. Such elections cannot produce a truly legitimate freely elected Parliament because of the way in which candidates are preselected.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European Union have no option but to press for the most important changes that are needed in Iran, whatever happens at the polls. I am thinking here of the death penalty. The present moratorium on stoning, a particularly barbaric form of execution, must be scrupulously observed and even enshrined in a legal instrument. I am thinking of the ratification of the Additional Protocol to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which will probably be a matter for the new Parliament. Whoever is elected, we must press a clear case for ratification. I am also thinking of the situation in the Middle East, where we need Iranian support. Let there be no shortage of criticism – unsparing criticism – of these conditions in Iran. At the same time, the Commission will no doubt also have to work to ensure that all the main aspects of Iranian conduct in the Middle East are conducive to peace in the region. Be that as it may, the fact remains that we cannot but roundly condemn the approach adopted by the Council of Guardians. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am thankful that Iran is seeking dialogue and cooperation. It has made us Europeans an offer, which came from the Supreme National Security Council, for the creation of a joint commission to engage in a bilateral Euro-Iranian dialogue centred on the fight against drugs. At the present time, Iran has about two million drug addicts, along with some eight million occasional drug users. These are very high numbers in a country with a population of 60 million. The bulk of drugs leaving the region currently goes to America, but we can expect Europe to be targeted soon for a massive wave of drug smuggling. This is why I am particularly grateful that the head of the Supreme National Security Council has made an offer to the European Union to work with him and his organisation to stop this flow of drugs from the war lords in Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">The second offer, for another bilateral commission which would engage in a joint effort to combat terrorism, is one which, in my view, we should not refuse, likewise the offer made by the judiciary to cooperate with the Court of Human Rights here in Strasbourg in order to accelerate the training of Iranian judges in this field as well as simply to show them the advantages and disadvantages of the various systems. This should be put at the heart of our bilateral relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, the promotion of cooperation between small and medium-sized enterprises in Iran and those in the European Union, is a means of strengthening democracy. I believe that the business contacts in this domain could point the way to more fruitful cooperation in the domain of dialogue and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point of particular importance to Europe, of course, is partnership in the domain of energy. Security of energy supplies is the issue of the future.</p>

The extent of the exclusions also includes numerous important women who played a leading part in the legislative reforms and, as a result, the position of women is further deteriorating in Iran. These are women with whom we have cooperated constructively within the framework of the European Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Elections are a symbol of democracy only when they are conducted properly, to quote President Khatami. Nonetheless, it would appear that above President Khatami and the democratically elected representatives of the people stands the all powerful Revolutionary Council, which is endeavouring to deprive the parliament which will come out of the elections on 20 February of any democratic voice or powers of reform. It is known that of all the bills voted for by parliament in 2000, over one-third were not ratified by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a fact that Iran, a country with a long history and an important geopolitical position, can play a strategic role in the stability of the area, especially in relation to Iraq and Afghanistan. However, I fear that efforts by the hard core to bend the will of the Iranian people may result not only in a parliament which has no democratic legitimacy, but also in the weakening of Iran's international position. Without doubt, Iran's basic problem is its power structure. No reform efforts and no progress with respect for human rights can be made while the Islamic Revolutionary Guards show disdain for the decisions taken under democratic procedures. The recent moratorium on stoning must be converted to legislation which will put an end to this horrific punishment.</p>
<p class="contents">And I should like to take this opportunity to add something else. I hope that Iran will include women in the teams which it sends to Athens to represent it at the 2004 Olympic Games. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It should be crystal clear that President Khatami’s decision to call a general election in February has crushed any hope of his intending to implement reforms in Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">In Iran, the critical dialogue has clearly been interpreted in such a way as to convey the impression that we in the EU are now better placed to understand and accept their oppressive regime. When will the EU realise that this dialogue is a farce? Is there nothing being done by the hierocracy in Iran that can make us take seriously our own much trumpeted values of democracy and human rights and, let it be said, act in accordance with them? What, moreover, do we do on the day that Iran’s mullahs export their regime to Iraq?</p>
<p class="contents">The EU should now support those forces that really want to see a pluralist and democratic Iran. At the moment, it is the resistance movements, for example the Mujahedin, that, in order to please the Iranian Government, the United States and the EU have added to their list of terrorists, even though they have never attacked civilians. As a first step, the EU should ensure that members of the Mujahedin are not handed over to Iran and certain death, and it should, as quickly as possible, see to it that they are removed from the EU’s list of terrorists and support their demand for a referendum in Iran. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is the risk that the banning of reform-minded MPs from fighting the elections will result in a huge abstention rate, particularly among young people. This is the only way for them to express their disillusionment. They fear more than ever that they will become victims of the backward-oriented forces. The constant flagrant undermining of the reform-minded forces constitutes a threat to a new revolutionary movement. Furthermore, Iran is running the risk of further isolating itself at international level. This is particularly worrying with regard to the conflicts in the Middle East region. Given its location, Iran is making the Middle East more vulnerable than ever. In the short term, the European Union should bring all diplomatic channels to bear in an attempt to induce the regime in Iran to reconsider the exclusion of reform-minded MPs from the elections. This should be made a condition for giving the existing cooperation between the European Union and Iran new impetus in areas of mutual interest. Apart from that, the European Union should lose no time in developing new initiatives aimed at cutting off the drug route between Iran and Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also a potentially rich country, which has oil, and it has shown its willingness to return to the international fold by abandoning its military nuclear programme and adopting a moratorium on the death penalty. Iran is strategically important because it has a border with Afghanistan and another with Iraq.

Why?</p>
<p class="contents">First, as Mr Tannock said, Iran is a great pre-Islamic civilisation; one in which we in the West have occasionally meddled in ways that were not always – to put it mildly – very well judged. Second, Iran is an enormously important regional player. One only has to look at its neighbourhood to see how important it is and to recognise that we cannot have a credible policy for the wider Middle East that does not embrace and include Iran. Thirdly – and I feel this very strongly – we see in Iran, in my judgment, the first stirrings of genuine Islamic democracy. Indeed, for the hard-line conservatives, that is the problem. I happen to think that demography is strongly on the side of democracy in Iran. However, the theologians, who are seeking to block progress, are not the first theologians we have seen – even in our own European experience – who have not been wholly in favour of democracy and the advancement of civil liberties. I will come back to that later.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of the significance of Iran, I have favoured – as the European Union has favoured – a constructive, tough-minded engagement with that country. That has taken a number of forms. We have tried to develop a political dialogue, which most recently has focused on our understandable concerns about whether Iran's nuclear ambitions for energy have turned into nuclear ambitions for military purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">We were concerned by the IAEA reports last summer and autumn. We are pleased at the progress that has been made following the visit of the three European Union foreign ministers to Tehran, but we will now be watching for Dr El Baradei's next report, for discussions in Vienna and for a clear commitment by Iran to meet the undertakings that it gave in Tehran when European foreign ministers visited. We also hope that we can develop a dialogue about terrorism, as well as weapons of mass destruction, and about the peace process in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">We have established a dialogue on human rights, which is an extremely important aspect of our relationship with Iran. It is fair to say that we have seen progress in some areas, allowing thematic rapporteurs into Iran. Some of the – frankly barbaric – punishments that have been carried out appear to have been stopped for the time being. Someone said during the debate that we should talk to the judges and others: I have. I felt that, in talking to some, I had been transported back several centuries, in order to take part in the discussions. However, it is important that we have these discussions and have them on a frank basis. We say to those that we talk to in Iran that a human rights dialogue is not simply an alternative to doing something about human rights. So we want to see our dialogue leading to progress in that area.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also talked to the Iranian Government about trade and investment and economic issues. We have had a number of rounds of negotiations towards a trade and cooperation agreement – a fairly basic most-favoured nation agreement. We had not had any discussions for a while. That sort of agreement is important to Iran, not least because of the number of young people coming on to the job market every year and the requirement on the part of the Iranians to attract more foreign investment in order to create the jobs and the economic development which is needed to deal with that demographic pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">The Iranians know perfectly well that all those issues – political, nuclear, trade and human rights – are umbilically linked. We cannot simply ignore problems in one area and think that we can move forward rapidly in all the others.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat that I am in favour of engagement, but engagement should not be regarded as a sort of cop-out for acting responsibly in these areas which matter so much to Parliament and to the Union and beyond.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in that context that I just want to say this about democracy: we have obviously been pleased that the democrats and the moderates have done so well in recent years. We are a little disappointed that, despite that, they have been unable to make more progress in government, partly because so much of what they wanted to do has been blocked by the conservative clerics, by the Guardian Council. That has led to some disillusionment on the part of the public, which led in turn to a low turnout in the elections and a less satisfactory result for the democrats than they might otherwise have achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in no doubt that what we are seeing at the moment is an attempt by the conservative clerics to distort the electoral process. Why are they trying to do that? They are not trying to distort the electoral process because they think they are going to do well, but because they think that, unless they do so, the moderates, the reformers and the genuine democrats will do well. It is an attempt to thwart that democratic impulse in Iran that we are seeing at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say – and I hope this does not sound too much like the leader of a Boy Scout troop – that you cannot halt the democratic process in Iran indefinitely. It is like trying to stop the tide coming in. So I hope the conservatives will realise that and that Iran is best served by allowing people greater participation in the government of their own country. If we see genuine democracy rather than the Potemkin variety of democracy, that will be one of the best ways of underpinning a relationship between Europe and Iran, which all of us should wish to see.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat that if we are serious about a creative and constructive policy for the wider Middle East, it has to involve Iran. It is no good condemning Iran out of hand and regarding it as being led by Manichean forces of wickedness and darkness. We have to be constructive and encourage the genuine democrats, who many of us have met and we have been impressed by their bravery. I hope that in the course of the next months and years we will see Iran making the difficult transition to an Islamic democracy which can play a constructive leadership role in the affairs of its region.</p>
