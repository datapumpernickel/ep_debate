He was in Strasbourg yesterday, and he is still in Strasbourg at the moment, but he will not be able to take part in these debates. I must therefore ask you to forgive the Commission’s absence. I believe that we cannot paralyse debates, but that we should go ahead. The Commission will be represented here by the top officials responsible but not by the Commissioner, who will not be able to participate. On the other hand, the Council, which is not present either, has not apologised for its absence. I believe that we must move ahead with our agenda.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Miguélez Ramos (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what we are going to vote on today is clearly not the Miguélez report. For obvious reasons: the Committee on Fisheries, by accepting the majority of the amendments to my report, and myself, by reaching a compromise on certain points with some of the Members presenting amendments, have made significant modifications to the initial text.</p>
<p class="contents">This text is, therefore, a synthesis of the various positions held in this Parliament in relation to the reform of the CFP, and when it comes to evaluating it there will be certain people who consider that the glass is half full and others that the glass is half empty. In any event, I believe that the report contains a sufficient number of positive elements in comparison with the current CFP for me, as rapporteur, to request that this House vote in favour of it.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that in the Committee on Fisheries there has been more agreement on the shortcomings of the current CFP than on identifying concrete proposals for its reform. Nevertheless, I believe that it contains sufficient positive elements to lay the foundations for a future CFP.</p>
<p class="contents">The greatest difficulty has been in reconciling the various interests: those of the companies, in order to allow them to be economically viable, those of the preservation of resources and social and economic measures which are able to defend an activity largely based in the least developed regions, outermost regions and Objective 1 regions. The European Commission should be able to show sufficient political intelligence to reconcile these three aspects, above all because the failure of any one of them would lead to the failure of the other two.</p>
<p class="contents">We are concerned about the existing contradiction between the highly critical analysis carried out by the Commission of the current CFP, which is shared by the European Parliament, and the subsequent proposals for reform, presented in the Green Paper, which are hardly innovative. The Green Paper opts for little change, or ‘more of the same’, which pleases nobody.</p>
<p class="contents">The report I am presenting is clear when it comes to defining the fundamental objective of the common fisheries policy: balancing the viability of a strategic European Union economic sector – which contributes to our food supply and is vital for employment and the economic and social cohesion of the outermost regions of the Union – with the maintenance of sustainable marine eco-systems.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the conservation and management of resources, the Committee on Fisheries asks for TACs to be set by means of rational and transparent measures, incorporating scientific opinions and data from the sector’s professionals, especially since they will be set on a multiannual and multi-species basis. It asks for an end to the incoherences between the current CFP and the single market, demanding that areas of restricted fishing, either closed seasons, boxes or restricted access, be based on scientific criteria for the protection of resources. In fact, as the report indicates, the current CFP entails a derogation from the principle of equal access and, in the absence of a Council decision, this derogation will end on 31 December 2002. The CFP is obliged to respect the fundamental principles contained in the Treaty, including, ladies and gentlemen, the principle of equal treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">Relative stability requires a new analysis, as the report states, of the communities which are highly dependent on fishing, which considers the evolution in the Community over the last 25 years. This analysis is essential to the review of the CFP.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Fisheries has also rejected the extension of the exclusive access zone beyond the current range of 6-12 miles.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the fleet, the report makes its point clearly by pointing out that the Multiannual Guidance Programmes (MAGPs) have not produced the desired results, largely as a result of the lack of will of certain Member States to implement them correctly. The reduction of the fleet is a socio-economic sacrifice which, in order to be understood and accepted by the fisheries sector, must be carried out in a balanced fashion in all Member States and also receive sufficient Community financial support. The Community must continue to contribute to the modernisation of the fleet, by means of structural measures, strengthening the aspects relating to safety and living conditions on board, without this involving any increase in fishing effort. It is therefore necessary to continue with the structural aid.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to inspection and control, we recognise that the operation of monitoring and control mechanisms is unsatisfactory. We believe that all the efforts aimed at conserving resources are destined for failure if we do not have a harmonised European system with a high degree of conformity within the sector. It is necessary to extend the competences of the Community inspectors and establish a single penalty system.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to international relations, the Community must deal with them decisively, relating them to the European Union’s foreign policy. From the point of view of fisheries, the Union’s international relations must be seen from a primarily commercial point of view, with a view to achieving fishing opportunities for our fleet. The fisheries agreements constitute and will continue to constitute an essential element of the new CFP. To this end, it is necessary to create a uniform strategy in the reaching of international agreements, in such a way that the professionals are subject to the same conditions in terms of fishing opportunities, the payment of charges, licences and the using of surplus quotas.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s commercial relations and policy on markets must combine the respect for the principle of Community preference with a reduction in tariffs together with the establishment of a list of sensitive products, giving the processing industry access to the supply of raw materials.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the social aspects, they were completely absent from the Green Paper. We ask the Commission to fully incorporate these economic and social measures, which are necessary in order to ensure the economic and social cohesion of the regions dependent on fishing. The fisheries sector is characterised by tough working conditions and a lack of collective agreements, which makes it necessary to increase social dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">To end, within the time allotted to me by my group, I would like to express my regret at the elements that have been lost during these long months of parliamentary negotiation, in particular two points: a Community fleet which can operate under a single flag and a single body of Community inspectors. I regret that the European Parliament, on this occasion, is not the innovative and pioneering institution which all we Members wish it to be. In terms of fisheries we are decades behind in relation to the European project, but just as we now have euros in our pockets and our skies are watched over by Eurocontrol, sooner or later the European flag will fly on our fishing vessels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today, I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation. The Committee on Development has made a number of fundamental comments on the fisheries policy in relation to the development policy.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the Committee notes that the European Union is one of the world’s most important fishing entities and we must be aware of this. Furthermore, the EU’s market is so vast that over half the fish consumed is either caught by the EU’s fleet outside Community waters or else imported, much of it from developing countries. One can therefore understand that the common fisheries policy can have quite a considerable impact on developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Development believes that the European Union must ensure its common fisheries policy is consistent with its policy on development and cooperation. This is obviously essential because it cannot simply shift the problems of the European fisheries sector to other areas. And, as we know, these problems are numerous; for example, we have excess fleet capacity, overexploited resources, declining employment and a largely degraded marine environment. Therefore, to shift these problems to other areas of the world is not acceptable and is not an intelligent, long-term policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe that the fisheries agreements, which are one of the crucial elements of the common fisheries policy, must not only be based on this first principle, but also upon reliable scientific assessments of the status of fish stocks and on the impact of fishing on target species, in particular. As the main rapporteur said, scientific assessments are clearly necessary. If we do not have them, which is, unfortunately, often the case in developing countries, we should adopt the precautionary principle so as to avoid the over-exploitation of resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point that I would like to make is that we must ensure adequate protection for coastal fishing communities in third countries and thus guarantee their food safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the rapporteur said, we must overcome the failure of the current CFP. All of us who live in coastal regions know that biological rest periods, prohibited areas, dimensions of nets, TACs, etc. do not improve the situation and that the proposal made in the Green Paper does not go any way towards improving it.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Committee on the Environment believe that we must take action on sources of pollution, of which there are many – industrial pollution, huge pressure from tourism, which we in our country understand very well – action on special ecosystems such as those which we have in our country, like the estuaries, action on oil refineries and other plants which act in opposition to what we want to see.</p>
<p class="contents">We need social, environmental and economic indicators that guarantee that actions are effective, as well as accompanying social measures and incentives aimed at sustainable fishing practices, such as the small-scale fishing which takes place on our nearest coasts. We must respect the cautionary principle, which is well defined in the code of conduct of the FAO and in the United Nations agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">We must increase consumer confidence by acting not only on traditional fishing, but also on aquaculture. There must also be information and increased awareness, as well as the participation of the citizens and the sectors involved so that the measures to be adopted in those sectors may be successful, as well as the participation of local and regional authorities. And control and monitoring – as the rapporteur said – of the measures adopted, because otherwise there will be inequality between the various countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in our view, we must not forget that greater fleet capacity does not guarantee employment. Employment has fallen by 19% in the productive sector and by 10% over recent years in the processing sector. We must therefore act to eliminate this contradiction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The subject is simply too important. Getting this report, with its 400 amendments, through the committee was a really tough business. The large number of amendments was certainly not attributable to the involvement of Mrs Miguélez Ramos, whom I respect as a colleague and who has done exemplary work in producing a balanced report, and I would like to thank her once again for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Some will mock and ask themselves what all this expense is for, but I cannot emphasise enough what significance this report has for the future of fisheries in Europe. A common fisheries policy has been in place for just about twenty years, with all their highs and lows. Fisheries swam through many a trough. Brussels cannot be made to bear all the responsibility for that, however. On the contrary, not every Member State and not everyone in the fishing industry is pulling their weight, and it is for that reason that the CFP has not fully met the high demands made of it. This year, we are at a crossroads in the truest sense of the word. In which direction do we want Europe's common fisheries policy to go in future? I can assure you that Parliament's recommendations will fall on good soil at the Commission, as this cooperation between the institutions in the interests of Europe's fisheries, and for their benefit, must be carried on, and it will be. Now that the Commission knows what this report recommends, it can submit its reform proposals, which we await with eager anticipation, and so I hope there will be a large majority.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing, though, must be clear. This will be a voyage over a rough sea for, as I have said, there are massive challenges ahead. Let me briefly highlight a few things that I see as vital to Europe's future fisheries policy. Firstly, without fish, there will be no more fishing industry. This equation may be simple, but it is true. We must give even more attention to the maintenance of healthy stocks than we did previously, because only healthy marine eco-systems guarantee sustainable management with a future ahead of it. After all, we all – here in Parliament and out there on the coastline – want a viable fisheries sector, and one that is viable not only for today and possibly tomorrow, but for the decades yet to come.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we know too little about how the marine eco-system is interlinked, and so there must be more intensive research. Thirdly, it is a fact that there are insufficient fish in European waters, and so we must also fish outside them, and to this end we need agreements with third states. These are expensive and are costing more and more; they will probably be too expensive as soon as tomorrow. We have to strike out on new pathways here, even if this will require greater involvement of those who directly profit. We owe this to our taxpayers. Time is passing too fast, not only the time I have to speak, but the time left to reform the CFP. Let us, by the end of this year, find a common and sustainable solution in the interests of our European fisheries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stihler (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, the review of the common fisheries policy gives us a chance to guide the future of fisheries in the European Union over the next ten years and we have to get this right. The CFP has not yet achieved what it set out to achieve, and that is a sustainable fisheries sector. Instead we have a situation where our fish stocks have been depleted and our seas polluted, while our technological capacity to fish has increased beyond recognition.</p>
<p class="contents">The cornerstone of the new CFP has to be environmental and economic sustainability. One way of achieving this is to recognise the CFP's regional dimension. We should increase industry involvement in fisheries management and conservation, allowing for an improvement of dialogue between fishermen and scientists. Sustainability means that we have to take the environmental dimension of fisheries management seriously. However, this has to be coupled with clearer procedures for responding quickly to conservation emergencies. We should retain the principle of relative stability, but also ensure greater effectiveness and consistency in the control and enforcement of EU requirements, while attempting to simplify the burden of control on fishermen.</p>
<p class="contents">As we know there are still weaknesses in inspection and control, and the inspection structure and coordinated approach must be welcomed. However, the use of uniform penalty procedures will require careful examination.</p>
<p class="contents">The area of fisheries agreements which Mr Lannoye talked about also needs to be reviewed. Development considerations, poverty reduction and environmental impact are key considerations. There have been many examples where local fishermen in some of the world's poorest areas can no longer fish. When they cannot fish, they do not eat. Reform is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">A lot has to be done in a very short time, but there is too much at stake for it to fail. I hope that this time next year, when we return for the first part-session in 2003, we will see a newly reformed CFP fit for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Attwooll (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, when it is normal practice to congratulate rapporteurs on their work, it is difficult to find appropriate words to use when something exceptional has been achieved. So I shall say simply that it is a tribute to the work of Mrs Miguélez Ramos that a report that attracted over 400 amendments at the committee stage has come to plenary with only 25 to be considered.</p>
<p class="contents">Before dealing with the nature of the substantive motion for a resolution, I want to touch briefly on the amendments by my own group. Amendments Nos 3, 4 and 5 look to the international level. Amendment No 3 seeks common definitions and methodology in respect of fisheries subsidies and fishing capacity and effort and the interrelationship between them. Amendments Nos 4 and 5 are designed to improve the monitoring both of the cost-effectiveness of fisheries agreements with third countries and of fishing activities conducted in the context thereof.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 6 seeks only to soften the wording of recital H because of doubts that the CFP can actually guarantee those working in the sector living conditions comparable to those in other production sectors, although it should certainly assist in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Amendment No 7 wishes merely to add recreational sea angling to the areas to which, along with deep-sea and coastal fishing and aquaculture, separate attention needs to be given. We hope that these amendments will meet with the approval of the House.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally, we believe that the motion for a resolution has achieved a commendable balance between the demands of fishing as an economic activity and the need for conservation. In sustaining the principle of relative stability, and the six- to twelve-mile limit, it recognises the fragility of fisheries-dependent communities. In endorsing a move to multiannual and multi-species quotas, it promotes an approach to fisheries management that is better for the industry and the environment alike. It also addresses other issues of environmental concern, such as shark finning and the bycatch of citations. Further, it takes serious note of our responsibilities towards the developing world.</p>
<p class="contents">Another of the aspects dear to my own heart is the move towards establishing a far greater input into the decision-making process by fishermen, scientists and conservationists. I add, with a touch of pride, that this is an approach pioneered in my own constituency, with the involvement of organisations such as the Scottish Fisherman's Federation, The Shetland Oceans Alliance and the World Wildlife Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">The number of amendments at committee showed how many different and often conflicting views there can be where fisheries issues are concerned. The final report demonstrates just how well we in this House can manage to reconcile our differences. I hope that, as voted later today, it will remain something of which Parliament as a whole, the Committee on Fisheries in particular, and Mrs Miguélez Ramos, despite her modesty and her own personal reservations, can be justifiably proud. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Without fish there can be no fishing industry.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the biggest problems with the common fisheries policy over the past 20 years has been that several objectives have not been prioritised. This has created conflicts. The only way to ensure that the fishing industry has any kind of future is to put conservation at the top of the agenda. This is a prerequisite for the industry, not an obstacle that has to be overcome. Unless conservation is the number one priority, compromises with other objectives of the common fisheries policy, such as economic ones, will always lead to further erosion of stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">We have tabled an amendment which would set as a prime objective the need to ensure that fish stocks and other marine species remain abundant. Both the fishing industry and the Committee on Fisheries claim that they agree with the need to conserve stocks and protect the marine environment. The recent cuts in quotas for several stocks in the EU last month provide ample illustration of the need to make conservation of stocks the main priority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are other very legitimate opinions in the Group of the United European Left. But I warn you that it has been difficult to reach a position.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, I would firstly like to thank Mrs Miguélez for her work. Initially, she presented a draft report which seemed to me to be perfectly balanced and which I believe should have served as a basis, with the contribution of all the members of the Committee on Fisheries and with the spirit of Mrs Miguélez, for supplementing what she presented to us. But 400 amendments were presented, the majority of which I believe were motivated by exclusively national positions, which do not contribute to the consolidation of a common policy, one of the few common policies, but quite the opposite.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Miguélez, after these 400 amendments, made a superhuman effort to present some new compromises. I withdrew. In this respect, I believe that she did good and even admirable work, but I believe that the final result, the 400 amendments, on which I do not believe we were very generous with her compromises in many respects, is not very coherent. There are strong contrasts, in some respects we go into many details and in others we hardly deal with the general issues. But, in any event, it is very important to me that I say this, and I will do so very frankly: there are amendments which, in my view, represent fundamental modifications to the Treaty, at a time when the implementation of the euro is strengthening the free movement of people. It also expresses the will to make progress with the common fisheries policy and strengthen it. Furthermore, one has the sensation that sometimes we are asking for nationalisation of controls of Community waters, while at the same time asking for Community controls in third country waters. And sometimes one has the feeling – excuse my frankness – that regionalisation is being used to talk about other things.</p>
<p class="contents">I am going to advise my group not to vote against the final result. I do not believe that Mrs Miguélez would deserve that and, in any event, I would repeat once again my spirit of cooperation and I thank you once again for your admirable efforts to achieve a balanced result which, in my view, has not been achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Miguélez Ramos, for her work in producing this most important report after very extensive consultation. The whole purpose of the Green Paper on the common fisheries policy published in March of last year was to stimulate debate on the future of the common fisheries policy. It did indeed stimulate debate, particularly in my own country. The Commission called for thorough and urgent reform of the common fisheries policy. As a Member of Parliament representing a constituency in which many depend on the fishing industry, I share this view.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate and discussions generated by the Green Paper will be incorporated into the Commission's White Paper for consideration by the Council this year. I welcome the consultation process and can assure colleagues that in my Member State the authorities took care to carry out a broad and meaningful consultation. The marine minister set up a special review group in order to present a coherent response to all concerned. This is as it should be. Under the common fisheries policy, and indeed under other EU policies, there has been a tendency to make policy decisions without full consideration of the valuable views of those working and living in the sector concerned. Proposals and recommendations in response to the Green Paper on fisheries policy were produced by the Irish national strategy review group on the common fisheries policy, which was set up by the marine minister and included stakeholders. It is vitally important that they should be included at all times. No common fisheries policy or other policy can be successful unless the stakeholders play an important role in it.</p>
<p class="contents">No doubt the discussions this year in Council will be difficult. Important decisions have to be made in key areas, particularly the social and economic dimension of the common fisheries policy. It is my view, and one that I know is shared by many Members representing coastal regions, that the Green Paper does not address these aspects adequately. It takes little account of the importance of the fisheries sector in coastal regions where there is no alternative source of employment, be they in Ireland or elsewhere in the Community. There must be integration; with my country in mind, consideration must be given to fisheries policy, regional development policy, rural development policy and Objective 1 areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the frankness with which the Commission has spelled out the current state of European fisheries and many proposed changes, if implemented, would help to solve some of the current difficulties. A number of additional critical changes must be made to further strengthen the common fisheries policy. Greater involvement of fishermen and stakeholders in the management process is long overdue. Involving fishermen will do a great deal to improve the credibility of any future policy. Genuine regionalisation of management and control will greatly benefit the sector. I would urge the Commission to underpin the decentralisation process by creating a Europe-wide network of regional advisory committees.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless practical and feasible changes are made to the control system, fisheries policy will not have the confidence of fishermen and will certainly fail. My country has benefited greatly from membership of the European Union over the years. However, the fishing industry has paid too high a price in having to share its abundant fishing grounds off the west coast of Ireland with greedy neighbours. If there is a depletion of stocks it is not Irish fishermen but some greedy neighbours in other Member States who are responsible for it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a result, over the last two years, previously secret papers on the negotiations leading up to Britain's entry to the then Common Market have been released and we have been able to see documents relating to the establishment of the common fisheries policy. It transpires from these documents that, at its inception, there was no legal basis for the CFP. Furthermore, ministers knew this; they were prepared to, and did, lie to the British public about this, despite the certain knowledge that the policy would be a disaster for the fishing industry, but fishermen were regarded as being politically expendable. They were sacrificed to ensure that the timetable for British entry was kept on track. Since then, the expected disaster has materialised in the form of tens of thousands of fishing and fishing-related jobs lost, financial losses approaching £1 bn for every year of the CFP and a fleet in terminal decline.</p>
<p class="contents">The CFP is also a disaster on a technical level. In a 1997 report the Parliamentary Research Service noted that the only examples of successful management systems were to be found in the Falkland Islands, Iceland, Namibia and New Zealand, where fisheries fall within a single jurisdiction. There is <span class="italic">no</span> example of a common fisheries policy ever working effectively, so the CFP is fatally flawed by virtue of the fact that it is a common policy.</p>
<p class="contents">To this Green Paper and the report by Mrs Miguélez Ramos, therefore, I and my party can respond that the CFP was built on lies and that technically it is a shambles. It represents all that is wrong with the European Union and we believe that it, like the EU, should be abolished with immediate effect – reform is not an option. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Souchet (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I naturally wish Mr Fischler a speedy recovery and I would ask the officials present to give him a detailed account of our concerns. The new common fisheries policy is currently being prepared, and I would therefore like to draw the Commissioner’s attention to three crucial points.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, it is imperative that the new common fisheries policy retain the system of TACs and quotas as its basis, as this is the best way of bringing catches into line with the status of fish stocks. These quotas must indeed become multiannual, particularly so that, as the <span class="italic">Association du Grand Littoral Atlantique</span> (AGLIA) has requested the Commission, we can avoid erratic fluctuations from one year to the next and enable fishermen to have a minimum of foresight, without which no human or economic activity is possible. Furthermore, these quotas must in no way become individual or transferable. Should this happen, we would witness an irreversible concentration and the extinction of sea life in most of our coastal regions. We continue to stand by our current system of the collective management of quotas by Member States and the professional fisheries organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the new common fisheries policy must stop using the brutal, unfair, costly and inefficient system of compulsory reductions in fleet capacity. The Commission is proposing to strengthen the existing mechanisms for fleet replacement. We are totally opposed to this. The fact that the Commission yesterday approved an excessive construction of trawler factories in Europe does not mean that it must, practically by making the same mistake again, make it impossible to undertake the essential modernisation of our non-industrial fleet, the need for which is, sadly, all too evident, particularly given the numerous tragic accidents that are caused due to the fact that the fleet working along the Atlantic coast is becoming out-dated.</p>
<p class="contents">The fleet must be managed with flexible and reversible instruments. In this connection, aid for modernisation, and most importantly, setting up aid for young people must certainly be maintained in the meantime.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the new common fisheries policy must establish a sustainable management system, integrating the skills, knowledge and expertise of professionals into the decision-making process. A number of recent examples, involving anchovies or hake, for instance, show that it is extremely dangerous to rely exclusively on estimates and on models drawn up by biologists to justify decisions that have particularly serious socio-economic consequences. In an area where resource assessment is an extremely complex matter, we must have every available source of information at our disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that these three concerns, which were greatly emphasised during the consultation process, will inspire the draft regulations that the Commissioner is due to present to us shortly. In comparison to the Green Paper, we still have a fair way to go and a great deal of effort must be made. We call upon the Commissioner to propose to us a new common fisheries policy, which is essentially forward-looking and no longer a pitiful stopgap measure, because we believe that fishing activities in all our maritime States lies at the heart of the development of coastal regions. We believe in the future of the fishing industry. We would like to have a common fisheries policy that also believes in the future of the fishing industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, I regret the final result, because I believe it is not as satisfactory as we should have hoped. I therefore voted against the report in committee, which delivered a result – as you will remember – of 12 votes in favour, 6 against and 3 abstentions, amongst them the rapporteur herself.</p>
<p class="contents">Why do I consider the report to be unsatisfactory? Because I believe that, after more than 20 years of the so-called common fisheries policy – which is common only in name – and after 17 years of the transitional period of two Member States, Spain and Portugal, we should have made rather more progress in the communitisation of this policy and gone beyond what is proposed in the Miguélez Ramos report, which opts for the maintenance of the status quo. I shall refer to two key issues.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, these two issues are: firstly, the distribution of fishing opportunities in Community waters between the Member States, maintaining relative stability, which is not a principle but a discriminatory mechanism by any reckoning; secondly, the complete refusal to test, even experimentally, new management systems which are producing wonderful results in the world and in the great fishing powers – such as Norway and Iceland – by means of transferable fishing rights, which we are flatly refusing to even to test.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely believe that with our internal market and our single currency it is unacceptable to exempt a whole economic sector, fisheries, from the advantages of the European Union, which are laid down in the Treaties, since it is an economic sector like any other and it is expected to play a strategic role in the future and many regions depend on it, many of them Objective 1 regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we can and must reach a greater consensus without harming other fishing communities – which must all be understood and defended – in order to update the issue, or, at least, to open up new possibilities, however slowly and gradually. I believe that we will have to carry on talking a lot over the coming months in our committee in order to find genuinely European compromise formulae. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was no easy task and I think that Mrs Miguélez has done a brilliant job. And if the outcome is not to everyone's liking, then it is we who are to blame, not the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">The House has examined the problems of the common fisheries policy on numerous occasions in the past. This Commission communication is the first stage in the Commission's overall strategy to improve the CFP in the run up to reform. So at this stage we need to lay down a few basic principles and priorities for the future CFP.</p>
<p class="contents">First, we must ensure that the basic aim of the CFP is to develop the fisheries sector and guide fishing activities towards viable levels from both the economic and environmental point of view. Any other policy would be absurd. Secondly, we must ensure we have a more integrated policy at European level, a more harmonised CFP. The Commission should submit imaginative proposals which help advance European integration. We shall only be able to implement the single market in the fisheries sector if we have uniform joint management of resources for the benefit of a Community fleet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The review is an opportunity not only rectify shortcomings but also to preserve crucial provisions which are worthwhile and necessary for the survival of Europe's fragile fisheries-dependent communities. We must preserve the six- and twelve- mile zones at least. We must continue with special conservation areas like the Shetland Box and support historic fishing rights through the fundamental principle of relative stability.</p>
<p class="contents">The common goal of conserving stocks for future generations remains the most important objective of the CFP. It is imperative that the promotion of sustainable fisheries and the needs of fisheries-dependent communities are kept to the fore.</p>

Of the preparatory work, I would also highlight the welcome given to some of the proposals that I tabled on this sector, which is crucial to food supply and essential for employment and for the economic and social cohesion of the Union’s outermost and coastal regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would highlight, in particular, the position of rejecting any proposal to introduce a system of individual quotas or individual transferable quotas at EU level, which would amount to the privatisation of fishery resources and to the concentration/verticalisation of catches, which would have negative consequences at the socio-economic and environmental level, and I hope that Parliament will not change this decision.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also highlight the rejection of the Commission’s intention substantially to reduce structural aid in the fishing industry, bearing in mind the socio-economic difficulties facing the industry, and the idea that, in the light of past results, structural aid should be redistributed on a more equitable basis. I also wish to refer to the approval of the proposal to set up a specific Community programme to support small-scale coastal fishing and artisanal fishing, and to the need to ensure that the principle of Community preference is respected. I must also highlight the need to improve working conditions and the participation of fishermen in management and the need to maintain the existing system of exclusive access to the 6-12 mile coastal zone, which, nevertheless, I would like to see extended to 24 miles and, in the case of the outermost regions, to at least 50 miles. These are proposals which, regrettably, have not been adopted, which was also the fate of compensation for the canning industry and of flexibility with regard to annual revision of the multiannual TACs.</p>

The report contains a series of sound declarations of intent but, because in reality they have never been put into effect, the current fisheries agreements are neither an effective contribution to stepping up the fight against poverty nor of economic benefit to the developing countries. One of the world’s poorest countries, Mauritania, has just entered into a fisheries agreement with the EU. Experts have found that, if the resources are administered sensibly, fishing for cuttlefish alone can give Mauritania an income of USD 100 million per year. However, Mauritania cannot afford to develop its own fisheries and will therefore receive much less compensation from the EU which, with its overfishing, is in the process of eliminating the cuttlefish stock. Last year alone, moreover, 300 Mauritanian fishermen lost their lives because fishing conditions had become more dangerous. The EU takes from the poor and gives to the rich. Those are the deplorable facts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That said, many speakers have reiterated that we are satisfied with the finished product. We cannot be entirely satisfied, but then that may have been inevitable. There are various issues which are as yet unresolved; these are the issues on which we and the Commission will have to work in the coming years, particularly over the next six months. We all know which issues remain unresolved. For my part, I would like to identify what might be called three criteria which, if applied, could enable us to find viable solutions to the individual issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we must not take the line of imposing penalties. This approach too was the result of an excessive desire to educate, to make fishermen understand that if there are no fish they will not be able to continue to make a living. But that is in the natural order of things; it is common sense. The operators know that conserving fish stocks is the best way to preserve their jobs and they are therefore on our side.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need more imaginative solutions. For example, we have been pursuing the exclusive line of trying to reduce the fishing effort for years now and we know that that line does not yield results, so let us now try to find a different solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we need to be aware that we cannot have a common policy which all support if we do not involve the institutions, the operators and the territories. That is why we need regionalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">If we apply these three criteria, I believe it will be possible to find a viable solution to all the issues raised on which we are focusing, and that we will be able to produce a balanced proposal which combines a common policy with respect for the diversities and individual characteristics of each of our countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These two objectives are shared by all. We had to make a choice, as the rapporteur has, to either change the entire system, at the risk of destabilising everything or to adapt what we could. We chose the second proposal of the two, which was also my preferred option. Two principles should then be respected: firstly, that of access to waters – to the 6-12 mile coastal band, I believe – this is already provided, and secondly, the principle of relative stability, which was also taken into consideration. These two choices are fundamental and I hope that Parliament will ratify these.</p>
<p class="contents">I will mention three of the changes that we must make. I am convinced that it is better to place TACs and quotas at the heart of the common fisheries policy, as they offer the greatest guarantees, particularly if they are multiannual. The second change is if multiannual guidance programmes (MAGPs) are retained – and they should be – we must assess the consequences they have for the safety of fishermen. Last year, in Brittany alone, which is where I live in France, we lost 25 men at sea. I imagine that you have a similar situation where you live. This is a considerable number, and it is obviously unacceptable. I think that we must step up safety at sea and enable our fishermen to continue to build new boats. We must not allow fishing fleets to become out-dated because this increases risks at sea. My last point concerns penalties. A good regulation is one that is applied to all equally. Fishermen feel that, even when two identical mistakes are made, the penalties imposed are different. I think that the Commission must pay particular care and attention to these three changes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Meanwhile, even those with an economic interest recognise the danger of the oceans being emptied of their fish stocks, not overnight, but gradually, because the young fish are increasingly given less of a chance of reaching adulthood and of procreating.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur shares with many politicians the hope that it will be possible to combine sustained catch levels with a better protection of the natural balance. She is right to call for more consistent compliance with agreements, but that is only a short-term solution. Despite the fact that demand for fish continues to rise, a reduction in catch levels at sea will become inevitable. This is why replacement employment in coastal areas must be sought, as well as the protection of the Third World. This is in preference to highlighting the differences between countries with small, traditional ships that sail out all year round and countries with large, state-of-the-art ships which need to remain docked for part of the time. The fact that these two groups continue to blame each other for the depletion of stocks will – more than anything – serve as a good excuse for our not taking adequate action, and we shall not therefore solve the problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should therefore like to highlight six issues that I consider to be priorities. The first is that we safeguard the continuity of fishing for future generations, which will only be achieved by strengthening the policy of protecting resources and we must therefore take serious account of scientists’ recommendations, the mesh-size of nets, the protection of juvenile fish and the reduction of discards. The second issue is to ensure that there is a balanced and flexible management of the quotas and of the TACs, thereby enabling quotas to be transferred from Member States that do not use them to those that need them. The sound implementation of the multiannual guidance plans, or of the instruments that come to replace them, seems crucial if we are to achieve this objective, and serious penalties must be imposed on those countries that do not comply. The third issue concerns the need to strengthen the international fisheries agreements component, and the European Union must negotiate new opportunities for its ship-owners. The fourth issue concerns the need to approach the fisheries sector with an awareness of its specific characteristics and this is why the principle of relative stability must be upheld. My fifth point is that we must strengthen the social dimension of the CFP, so as to provide fishermen with essential support for their survival. Lastly, we must pursue the structural policy of support for the sector with the aim of keeping the Community fleet permanently up-to-date and adapted to new circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank Mrs Miguélez Ramos for all the commitment she has shown in her work. The end result is not ideal, but I hope that it will provide the basis for what is needed. I should like to end by conveying my best wishes to the Commissioner, Franz Fischler, and to take the opportunity to share a saying with him: “a good plate of cod in the Portuguese style and a good glass of red wine will cure the worst bout of flu”! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We must introduce an integrated policy through genuine cooperation at international level, whilst striving hard not to give in to a lax attitude, which would have a detrimental effect on our work. This can be achieved by revising existing legislation, namely Regulation (EC) No 1626/94, and by adapting the regulation on minimum landing sizes, technical measures and fishing gear to each region.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also carry out in-depth research to enable us to develop an accurate idea as to the potential of anchovy, mackerel, blue-finned tunny and other fish; in other words, how much fishing effort can be supported by the various species. We can do this by paying greater attention to the members of the Mediterranean-specific industrial tribunals and by stepping up the activities of the Regional Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean, which must be given effective jurisdiction and resources so that it can take action, both in terms of deep sea and inshore fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank our excellent rapporteur, Mrs Miguélez Ramos, as well as my colleagues, Mrs Langenhagen and Mrs McKenna, for visiting the Mediterranean coast, particularly Sète, Mèze and Port-la-Nouvelle, for supporting these proposals and for coming to find out what the situation is on the ground. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think we all recognise the tremendous difficulty involved in coming forward with this report. There are probably things in it that not everyone likes. However, in the circumstances it is probably the best that could be achieved as we try to reform the CFP.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to ask ourselves what the European Union wants to achieve in reforming of the common fisheries policy. The one thing we can say for certain is that the present common fisheries policy is not one of the best-loved policies of the Union, and there is certainly no guarantee that future changes will endear any future policy to the industry, especially given the pressure on fish stocks and the differing views of scientists and fishermen.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the opportunity is there to be seized and we have to ask whether we can get things right this time. Can we achieve a proper balance? Are we in a position to respond to the needs of the industry and respond in time? The problems of the industry have built up a great degree of resentment. We have heard here today that there are those who would love to scrap the common fisheries policy and hand it back to national and regional governments. That will not put any more fish in the sea or solve any more problems. Fish are migratory: they do not stay in one place all the time, year after year.</p>
<p class="contents">So while such a move sounds easy – and to some it sounds very good – we have to ask a number of questions. Would renationalisation mean any more fish? I do not think so. Would it mean more financial support? I would suggest that it might result in even less financial support to the industry, and markets would not improve. So we have to find an acceptable position.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say bluntly to the Commission that if it cannot get the policy right in the next four to five years, then it will be forced to hand it back to national governments. We have an opportunity to get it right. The Commission has to involve local fishermen, local areas and local people if it really wants to get it right. I would certainly support that – but there has to be meaningful consultation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is characterised by the confusion between the general interests of a common policy, which is dedicated to managing a declining resource, whilst rationalising a traditional economic activity, and the objectives for developing extremely remote regions, for which fishing is one of the few sectors of activity that provides medium- and long-term employment. The Commission Green Paper on the Common Fisheries Policy paints a very gloomy picture and I regret that it contains no reference whatsoever to fishing in the territorial waters of extremely remote regions of the European Union. The ideas that are proposed, and above all, the solutions advocated, are obviously designed to meet the challenge posed by continental fishing and are poorly adapted to extremely remote regions. These regions have fought for respect for their differences, as laid down in Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam, and so that their specific characteristics can, at last, be taken into account in each of the European Union’s policies and, more importantly, in the common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The dimension of this sector in extremely remote regions, its characteristics and, above all, its impact on all fishing activities in Europe should, however, make it much easier than anticipated to justify the practical and specific measures for extremely remote regions, particularly in terms of resource and fleet quotas, of support for coastal fishing and aquaculture, as well as public limits on investment, upon which the growth of this activity in these regions depends. An adequate level of investment would enable them to develop and to modernise their fleets, to ensure greater coherence in the measures proposed by the European Commission by reconciling, on the one hand, the objectives for providing financial support to the businesses involved in processing and selling fish products and, on the other, the need to ensure that these businesses receive a regular supply of high quality raw materials.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to add that we should be careful when concluding international fishing agreements and ensure that they take into account, where applicable, the proximity with extremely remote regions. Fishing licences issued by third countries to Community fishing vessels should be given, first and foremost, to fishing vessels from the extremely remote regions that are nearest and should not be seen as a means of dislodging the European fleet.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot conclude without congratulating Mrs Miguélez Ramos on the remarkable and difficult work that she has done to enable us to reach a consensual and satisfactory document. It is a task that seemed almost insurmountable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
