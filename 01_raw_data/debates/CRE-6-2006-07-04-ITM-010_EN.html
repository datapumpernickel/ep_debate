Many people in the EU nowadays ask themselves the same vexed question every day: when will it hit me? When will my job be on the line? When will it be my turn?</p>
<p class="contents">In the transformation process in Central and Eastern Europe alone, entire economies have collapsed, and millions of jobs have gone. People have understood this, however, because it was the result of Communist mismanagement. Yet many are unable to understand what is happening in many industries in the older EU Member States: textiles, shoes, furniture, household appliances, pharmaceuticals and cars – manufacturing industries that have always been considered secure – are hitting the skids.</p>
<p class="contents">Very few people have been prepared for this structural change we are witnessing. It is therefore high time to help the many people who have lost their bearings to reorientate themselves. The significance of today's discussion extends far beyond the possible closure of a car-manufacturing plant in Portugal. It is a discussion about the future of employment in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The time has also come to spell out a few home truths.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we have entered a new phase of competition, and the pace of structural change is set to quicken still further. We must not close our eyes to that. Competition is a fact of life, whether we like it or not. Nor is it a question of whether we can survive competition intact. The great social question of our time is how many people's prospects will be ruined by this competition; to put it another way, the great social issue of our time is the future of our jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time we faced up to that question. Whoever still believes that other issues take precedence is out of touch with the world of today and its challenges. We need more sustainable, environmentally safe growth, and we need more and better jobs, otherwise the social face of Europe will turn cold and cynical, which would be an affront to our European principles of shared responsibility between the individual and society, of solidarity, social justice and social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">The key word for a European society of the 21st century that seeks to offer its people new prospects is ‘competitiveness’. We are all well aware that Fortress Portugal, Fortress Germany, Fortress Poland or Fortress Europe is not an option in the open world of the 21st century. We must embrace open competition; we must capture the high ground and draw competition upwards in search of the best solutions, the best technology and the highest standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have launched a common European policy for growth and employment. This policy must now be vigorously pursued in Europe, nationally and regionally, otherwise we shall be gazing time and again in dismay at one breach after the other in our social model in the form of closed factories and research laboratories that have relocated overseas – which has already been happening. I would warn anyone against the notion that we can easily put up with production facilities moving away because we still have research and development. Once production has gone, research and development will follow.</p>
<p class="contents">A policy for growth and employment must be a policy that creates a favourable business climate for all companies. It is in business, in companies, that jobs are created, and it is companies that axe jobs too. No edict from the government of a Member State or from the EU as a whole can change that in the slightest. We can however pursue a policy that creates external conditions which make it possible and attractive for companies to do their work, to expand, to invest and to create jobs in Europe. That is the meaning of the term ‘business-friendly policy’.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, an active industrial policy that keeps industry in Europe is more essential than ever before. The illusion that industry can now be consigned to museums is just as false as the notion that industry is first and foremost the world’s chief polluter. I advise anyone who still thinks in these terms to think again. Those who would drive industry out of Europe are playing with the futures of the people who work in industry, the futures of the people who work in industry-related services – sectors that employ not only millions of people but many tens of millions – and the futures of the small and medium-sized enterprises all the way up the supply chain; in short, they are playing with the future of Europe itself.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to maintain a strong industrial sector in Europe with companies that perform in the global marketplace. We are not simply looking for European champions; we need leaders in the world market, for our firms are effectively competing in a global arena. No government can make them successful; that is down to the companies’ own efforts. We can, however, back them to the hilt.</p>
<p class="contents">This was the task of the High-Level Group CARS 21. Twelve million jobs in the European Union are linked directly or indirectly with vehicle manufacturing. We have spoken to all the stakeholders about what can and must be done to maintain a strong automotive industry in Europe. I hope Parliament will understand why, on the issue of future exhaust-emission standards, I argue against a policy of ‘head down and charge’ and in favour of formulating proposals that we can put on the table when the time comes, secure in the knowledge that our high standards are technologically feasible and that they will also be affordable for most people.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we are already able to build a car with zero emissions today, but there is nobody I know personally who could afford such a car, and I imagine no one in this Parliament could afford one either. We must do our bit to ensure that it remains possible to manufacture and sell European cars – not for the sake of the cars, not even for the sake of those who buy and drive them but for the sake of the people who need those jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Another thing is that an active industrial policy does not stop at the borders of the old European Union but encompasses the new Member States too. Enlargement is not the curse of the European labour force, nor is it the cause of structural change. The truth is that, in 17 out of 20 industries, the old EU has a huge advantage; only in three industries do the new Member States now have a competitive edge. One of these, indeed, is the car industry. That, however, will only help us when China and other newly developed countries become more powerful competitors in the automotive market.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the automotive industry itself – which, of course, was the trigger for this debate – I wish to express my firm conviction that we shall keep our car industry in Europe in the long term, and it will be strong, but it will look rather different in ten years’ time than it looks today. There will be consolidations. You need only read today’s newspapers to learn of transatlantic talks on that very subject.</p>
<p class="contents">What we can predict with some degree of certainty is a mixed picture – one picture for Western Europe and another for Central and Eastern Europe. We shall no longer see any significant growth in vehicle output in Western Europe. There will only be a slight increase in demand. Productivity is likely to grow faster than demand, and anyone with any knowledge of economics knows what that means: it means that the pressure on car-manufacturing jobs in the older Member States will become even greater.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as we know, the major European manufacturers – and the same applies to General Motors – have no plans to shift any of their production capacity out of Western Europe. They will, however – and this is the salient point – establish new production facilities where demand for their products is greatest. This trend is already clearly observable throughout the entire European car industry.</p>
<p class="contents">On the plus side, however, we see that not only European manufacturers but those from other parts of the world too are starting to concentrate research and development capacities in Europe once more, especially in the old locations. In this respect too, the European operations of General Motors are no exception.</p>
<p class="contents">Enterprises, ladies and gentlemen, bear a great social responsibility for Europe, and that must become apparent across the board. I am not one to criticise every corporate relocation decision out of hand, nor am I entitled to do so. Besides, it would be foolish to do so, for the globalisation of production and research is unavoidable if a company is to succeed in the long term in a competitive industry. I do, however, criticise those who put short-term profit before sustainable solutions. I criticise those who, when they come under pressure, choose to cut and run as the cheapest option, with no regard for the people they put out on the street. I criticise those who pay themselves huge salaries but are not worth a penny as responsible managers, because they have driven their company to the wall and squandered the jobs it once provided.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to see companies in Europe that are constantly striving upwards, that take innovation to new levels, that can alter their profile, that train their staff to cope with new tasks too. We, of course, have a duty to help them in all of this. Yet we must also point out the limits of political action. Corporate decisions to close or relocate plants are decisions taken by companies, and no government and no European Union can overrule them, whether in the case of Azambuja or in any other case.</p>
<p class="contents">We do, however, have some very clear rules, and we must insist vigorously on their observance. These include the key issue of dialogue between management and labour, for example. When a plant is to be closed or relocated, this dialogue must include the following question: what has the company done to give its redundant employees a new future, for example in terms of training, further education and industrial retraining? From this follows another question: what have we done to help it?</p>
<p class="contents">We also have the instrument of aid for companies in difficulty, which was also used in the Azambuja case. Aid awards were authorised in 2002. The plant’s difficulties, in other words, are not entirely new. Let me make it very clear, however, that the payments of state aid which were authorised in that case and which took the form of investment support from the Portuguese budget were granted under European rules, which stipulate that the beneficiary company must remain at its location for at least five years after making the investment for which it has received support.</p>
<p class="contents">At the request of the Commission, the Portuguese Government is currently investigating whether the plant also received money from European funds. If it did, this would be another point on which we should have to insist on strict fulfilment of our conditions, and I can promise you that the Commission will do that. European tax revenue is meant to be used to stabilise plants in European locations, not to axe jobs.</p>

The first remark one is led to make is that this new era has helped to reduce poverty around the world.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worthwhile continuing to promote the free movement of goods, commodities and persons, if only in terms of economic growth, which many countries around the world are enjoying in a sustainable way. Let us not, however, make the market a sacred cow; although the values that guide our political action acknowledge many of the virtues of the laws of the market, we also understand that the political authorities have a vital role in the regulation and functioning of that market.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a role that the EU and Parliament must not neglect. In the draft report on the European social model to be debated here in September, we will urge the EU to adopt an attitude towards third countries with high economic growth that promotes democracy, freedom, respect for human rights, environmental protection, social justice and regulation of the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">It will be Europe's responsibility, in our view, to play a key role in striking a balance between economic growth and the search for decent social and environmental standards in the emerging world powers. If such guidelines are to prevail externally, the biggest concern internally will have to be the focus on increased competitiveness. In this regard, I wish to welcome the Commissioner's remarks here today.</p>
<p class="contents">The next steps are contained in the Lisbon Strategy. As regards the manner in which to proceed, I should like to reiterate that I still believe that it would be a very good idea to strengthen the Commission's role in implementing this strategy. Although globalisation can be seen as an opportunity for European business, the same process, as the Commission has said in this Chamber, also entails risks within the European area. One of these risks is the possible disappearance from the industrial map of regions and sectors whose economic base is manufacturing.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that there needs to be intervention at European level in the definition and execution of public policies that promote regional and social cohesion, with a view to preventing the phenomenon of exclusion. This is an extremely important point, because if we want to win over the citizens as regards the European project we cannot allow feelings of loss of hope and confidence to take root in certain regions outside the main population centres. I therefore warmly welcome the Commission’s initiative on setting up the Globalisation Adjustment Fund. Businesses, just like people, are born, they grow and they die. The important thing as far as employment growth is concerned is that the birth rate of business should always be higher than the death rate.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the role of the EU and its institutions, I feel that they should not support political initiatives aimed at keeping alive industries or factories that are untenable in the medium term. That would not be the right path to follow; rather it would be something of a false dawn that would feed meaningless illusions. The right way forward, on the other hand, should be based on the competitiveness of the European economy, which depends on balanced public accounts, effective education and training systems, justice that works promptly, competitive tax systems, greater flexibility in the labour market and major incentives for research.</p>
<p class="contents">Without competitive economies there is no investment. Without investment there is no employment or social justice. Parliament should be channelling its efforts into discussing and defining policy instruments that could help increase competitiveness and regional and social cohesion in the EU. We naturally support all initiatives aimed at monitoring the use of public funds by private companies and we feel that this kind of support should be associated with medium-term objectives on employment and regional development. I believe that it is not Parliament’s job to make judgments on individual cases, which seems to have been at the root of this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I should like to conclude by encouraging dialogue between the parties involved, with a view to achieving the best possible solution that, according to the latest information I have, could satisfy everyone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They went straight to the heart of the debate that we must conduct on the future of European industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Azambuja is an individual case, but it represents many others. It is symptomatic of a wrong choice of course in European industrial policy. There is no disputing that we must remain competitive and that rationalisations are part of this effort, that productivity growth is necessary and that, if higher productivity leads to job losses in one company, these must be counteracted by the creation of new jobs elsewhere or in the same region through innovative investments. That goes without saying, and we must make targeted investments to ensure that it happens. What our policies must not and cannot condone, however, and what we Socialists in Europe will fight, is the brutality with which multinational giants deal with the lives of human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">In the course of my political career, as the mayor of a German town, I experienced the cold, calculating way in which companies played off national, regional and municipal administrations against each other when it came to investing in locations. The imagination of company boards is boundless when it comes to obtaining public investment support as a location incentive. This is matched only by their complete lack of imagination when it comes to shouldering their social responsibility in times of crisis. This is precisely what we are now observing on the part of General Motors.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to you for what you have told us. You will check whether European funds went to that factory; if they did, the company must stay at its Portuguese location. That is good news. But what happens then in Portugal? It will be the same scenario we witnessed only a few months ago when the Swedish workforce was played off against the German workforce of the same combine. Whoever lowers welfare standards furthest, whoever allows the lowest wages, wins the day. Fewer social rights and less pay is the basic criterion for location decisions. This is a form of capitalism that the people of Europe do not want, and we must fight it.</p>
<p class="contents">If, as in my country, a company – not a car manufacturer in this case but Allianz financial services – makes a profit of EUR 4.4 billion, then decides to sack 8 000 highly qualified staff to maximise its shareholders’ returns, that is not only immoral – I cannot expect morality of a capitalist, nor do I – but also socially irresponsible. We must consider how we can use national and European legislation to curb that kind of corporate policy. In the case of large groups of companies with global operations, these are, of course, corporate decisions taken by the group, and we have no influence over them. But the impact of these corporate decisions affects the whole of society. For this reason, we believe that the application of democratic principles to such decisions is part and parcel of economic democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Hedge funds buy up companies as assets nowadays. We live in an economic world in which major funds buy large companies, de-list them as quickly as possible in order to reorganise them as quickly as possible and sell them on at a profit as quickly as possible. The company, its location and the entire region are thus reduced to commercial goods. That cannot be the economic future of Europe! Accordingly, the way in which the European economy is restructured will determine the future social cohesion of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In the second half of the 20th century, the idea behind the European Union, the idea behind the single market in which we live today, was that economic and technological progress should go hand in hand with social progress. We have reached a stage today in which maximisation of profits goes hand in hand with diminishing social security. If we do not halt this trend and return to what we did successfully in the second half of the 20th century, namely combining economic growth with social security, we shall forfeit the social stability of our European societies – and social instability is always at the root of political instability, which leads in turn to a loss of security. For this reason, the restructuring of companies in Europe is a challenge to which we must respond on the social level.</p>

It does not take much imagination to understand the hopelessness, the fear of the future and the financial worries they go through, day after day. In that, Parliament stands united: across the political parties, across the European countries there is support for the European social model and the support of the workers and the unemployed.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to what concretely should be done, our opinions differ greatly. I firmly believe it is a serious mistake to try to protect jobs by preventing modernisation, restructuring and globalisation. It may be good for today, but it is disastrous for tomorrow. Our answer to globalisation must not be evasion and conservatism but to embrace it and prepare our citizens for it. It must not stop restructuring from happening but make the transition for those affected easier.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the starting point for the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats in Parliament when addressing the challenges presented to us by industrial restructuring and globalisation. We believe that the European Union can and should play a role, but one of facilitating transition rather than one of obstruction. We are not against change. We are for change. Otherwise, in ten years we will have all our jobs in China or other nice regions outside Europe. We are for cooperation, education and economic growth, but they should be brought about with social and environmental responsibility. That is our task in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of issues where we need European politics, not only to keep but to create new jobs all over the Union. At the very heart of that we find the Lisbon Agenda. First and foremost it is about strengthening the individual. Europe can help by encouraging and funding programmes for lifelong learning, language skills and cultural exchange, to mention a few examples. They help prepare for a labour market in transition where few jobs can be guaranteed for life. There are no jobs for life anymore but there could well be work for life.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is about strengthening European industry to be competitive in the 21st century. By giving access to an even greater internal market supporting European research and innovation, we open new opportunities that will eventually create new jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, to accomplish that, we need strengthened social dialogue addressing issues of change such as the need for companies to facilitate transition for those losing their jobs, and environmental rules for sustainable economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">It has a lot to do with European leadership, about explaining the challenges we are facing and about doing what we can to facilitate the journey into the future by preparing individuals and businesses; but not about making false promises, protecting jobs and hoping for short-term political gains.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the Liberal answer to the challenges of globalisation and industrial reform. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have also read in the press agencies that the Commission declared that the restructuring and relocation process carried out by Opel was considered to be above-board and was in keeping with the rules of the various European funds.</p>
<p class="contents">I actually believe, and your intention was clear, that there is not really much point in Parliament and some of our fellow Members repeatedly criticising, month after month, global capitalism or total capitalism: we live in a world in which competition is becoming tougher and tougher and in which the future of the car industry is undoubtedly determined more by Renault-Nissan-GM alliances such as those announced, than by processes about which we are speaking today.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, if we do want to have a role, I, for my part, should like it if you were able to respond, as Commissioner and as the person responsible for these issues at the Commission, to four precise questions:</p>
<p class="contents">Question one: we have always championed the idea of the European Works Council and industrial relations observatories when it comes to anticipating this kind of change. We, in this House, wanted arrangements of the European Works Council kind to be strengthened. Do you not believe, from this perspective, that initiatives are steps for the Commission to take with a view to strengthening this legislation?</p>
<p class="contents">Question two: the Barroso Commission has proposed an adjustment fund for cases of globalisation-related restructuring – I am not sure whether the Opel case is included in this – but what exactly is this fund about? Can you assure us that, during a transition period, this fund will really help workers that are penalised by this type of process to rebuild their careers thanks to training schemes?</p>
<p class="contents">Question three: you rightly referred to the CARS 21 programme and to the Commission’s focus on research and development programmes and on the cars of the future. Supposing that people believe - which I do not – that private cars are a means of sustainable development for the 21st century, particularly for our European cities, it is all the same astounding to note, when we know that environmentally-friendly cars will have to have a hybrid engine, like the Toyota Prius model, for the next 25 years, that European manufacturers are still lagging behind in this area. What is your assessment of the research and development programmes in this area and of the marketing of this type of product?</p>
<p class="contents">My fourth and final point: it is quite clear – and the Opel example is obviously shocking from this point of view – that we are witnessing competition between neighbouring territories: Portugal and Spain. Do you not believe that, while respecting the competition rules, it is the duty of the Commission and of the European Union to impose common minimum rules on businesses operating on EU soil, and, while I am not saying that it would be a perfect solution, I am specifically thinking of company tax harmonisation?</p>
<p class="contents">There you have four forms of action that the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties and promoter of the European general interest, ought to encourage. In that regard, I regret to tell you, Commissioner, that we still do not find your Commission either proactive enough or ambitious enough on the various points that I have just mentioned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At this time, workers from Opel Portugal, part of the General Motors group – and we salute those workers via their delegation here in this Chamber – are going through terrible anguish, as they follow this debate with great interest and hope that they receive from Parliament and the Commission the kind of solidarity that they have had from General Motors workers from EU countries such as Sweden, Germany and Spain, whose futures are also under threat.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst news appears in the media about talks between businesses in the car industry involving General Motors and others, the Opel Portugal workers, their families and the people and local and regional authorities of the Azambuja region and surrounding areas are living under the threat of unemployment and hindered development that may lead to closure. This situation is all the more dramatic given that we are talking about a country in which unemployment and poverty are on the rise. Mr Silva Peneda’s remarks are therefore all the more appallingly insensitive.</p>
<p class="contents">Much more attention needs to be paid to industrial mergers and restructuring. Community aid must be contingent on long-term agreements on employment and local development. Priority must be attached to protecting the workers whenever manufacturing companies are restructured, including complete guarantees that the workers will be fully informed, will be fully involved and will have a decisive influence throughout the process.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that there are alternatives to closing down Opel Portugal. We know that with the political will, the company can continue to function as normal. It is a company that has the conditions in place for productivity and in which undertakings have been made that the workers have observed. General Motors must keep its side of the bargain and the Commission must take the measures needed to ensure that Opel Portugal functions as normal and that employment with rights is guaranteed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This process has serious social and economic consequences. Production becomes concentrated in economically and technologically stronger regions, at the cost of less developed regions. This is particularly visible in the new Member States where whole sectors of industry have disappeared. In Poland, for example, light industry and, to a significant extent, the car manufacturing, electronics and mining sectors have disappeared, and with them jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The progressive globalisation of production and the liberalisation of markets have resulted in a further deepening of economic and social divides. Regions which have high levels of agricultural production and a developed network of agricultural and food industries such as sugar, fruit and vegetables and refrigeration in particular, lose out the most. Poland is again one of the countries that have suffered most and is located in one of the worst affected regions. So who benefits? The ‘old’ Member States and economically powerful industrial regions benefit and will continue to benefit, especially as the European Union is directing most of its efforts towards achieving profits from trade with third countries in manufactured articles, which make up 85% of turnover in goods. Agricultural products only make up 15% of turnover. This begs the fundamental question: what relation does the policy of the EU authorities in the field of enterprise bear to the basic principles of the European Union, such as European solidarity, equal opportunities, sustainable development or human rights? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should just like to highlight two of the important points that he made. One was about structural change. I totally agree that structural change is here to stay and indeed it will accelerate. So the issue is not how we stop it, but how we harness and manage it.</p>
<p class="contents">The second important point to highlight is that the answer is not protectionism, either by countries trying to put up barriers or within companies trying to protect old jobs when the market has moved on.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mrs Ek that nowadays people might not have a job for life any more, but I think people still have a right to expect that they can have a life with a job. The question, therefore, is what can be done to help and what should not be done.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, as MEPs, we should not have this kind of debate every time a major company closes or downsizes, so that we politicians can show that we care – even though of course we do – and can be ‘seen to be doing something’ in each individual case, highlighting named individual companies. I do not think regular debates on this basis are helpful. It should not be about us trying to grab headlines back home.</p>
<p class="contents">What I think we can do, and should do more, is to make sure that we help set a regulatory climate in which entrepreneurship can flourish, so that more new jobs can be created and genuinely; as one door has to close, other doors can be encouraged to open.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that the greatest form of job security any individual can have is in the skill set they can develop, and that is where our priorities should lie. We have to make sure that, when people talk about investment, companies recognise that their investment in people is the most important investment they can make. Investment in people by countries is also the most important investment that countries can make. If we get that right, we will go a long way towards managing the challenge of change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would like to say that I support the Portuguese workers in their efforts to retain and develop their employment. I also know from past experience that, as Mr Schulz has mentioned, GM has not always been good at conducting social dialogue, an example being its relations with its factories in Germany and Sweden, when it played the workers in the different countries off against each other. That is not a way of behaving that I am fond of.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the view that restructuring is not new. Rather, it is something we have always lived with. In my home town there was once a rubber factory, but it is no longer there. In its day, nearly everyone in the town worked there. There will continue to be restructuring in the future as well. In some cases, restructuring is badly handled. This leads to job losses, and the region in question is hit hard. There are, however, also successful examples of restructuring where new jobs have been created and regions have been able to survive and even progress, with longer-term employment. So, what is the secret? Well, there are a few key factors. They are social responsibility, participation and a long-term approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, then, the long-term approach. I do not have a high regard for companies that do not themselves have some form of long-term plan of how they are to tackle global competition successfully and that only take subsidies in the short term before then leaving the region in question. In addition, participation is needed, by which I mean participation by the most important asset that companies have, namely their staff. Employees are companies’ most important resource and should not merely be given information and consulted when changes are being made. Employees should be a part of the restructuring process. They should be able to be involved with it and influence it. That way, there is no need to go out on the streets and demonstrate. That way, new jobs can be created. There is also a need to demonstrate social responsibility from very early on and to train staff so as to be able to meet the long-term challenges of the future and for the regions, as it is often companies that play a large role in regions where there is a need to demonstrate social responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the automotive industry is concerned, it is an industry that has become increasingly globalised and that consists of an ever decreasing number of companies. Restructuring will be needed. There are a number of things that we can do at the European level. We can, as Mr Jonckheer said, strengthen works councils and the directives concerning these. We can work on information and consultation. I believe that we need framework agreements between industries and trade unions at the European level in order to be able to manage the changes that will come in the future. This will be increasingly important. Restructuring is something that we have to live with, but it can be made a success if employees are allowed to participate actively and if the companies involved demonstrate social responsibility.</p>

<p class="contents">A year ago, I took the floor in Parliament to talk about the iron and steel industry and about Terni, an Italian city that was witnessing its own livelihood being threatened by the operations of a multinational. The opinions expressed by this Parliament were very useful. Today, I must come back to this subject by talking about another factory, the Eaton factory, in Piedmont: here, too, the workers are at risk because of the behaviour of a multinational; I should also like to mention Getronix, and others, as we have heard, have talked about Opel.</p>
<p class="contents">In all of these cases, as in the case of Terni, we can and must help. We must also intervene so as to prevent all of this from happening again, that is to say, to prevent multinationals – which, I might add, garner profits and even enjoy public funds, including European ones – from using Europe by directly pitting one country against another country, workers against other workers.</p>
<p class="contents">We must decide that dumping and relocations need to be combated with specific rules, because they have nothing to do with competition and the market, but actually undermine social cohesion and burden us all with unbearable costs.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to combat them, practical responses are required: one of which is to genuinely strengthen European works councils. Granting more powers to workers and trade unions will also help us to build up an idea of what kind of development Europe must have.</p>
<p class="contents">Some people regard this speculative market as reliable, believing that there might eventually be a positive net outcome in terms of employment, which in fact there is not; I believe that politics must deal with what needs to be produced in this Europe and that we must therefore take action in this field too.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that those who want to integrate Europe must recognise that the unity, rather than the division, of European workers is a vital asset when it comes to building this united Europe and that it is therefore not dumping, but the upwards harmonisation of rules and rights, that represents a firm commitment for this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We come from the West Midlands region of the United Kingdom, a region that has historically been very dependent on the car industry, which has been through many cycles of plant closures and change.</p>
<p class="contents">The other day I went to speak at a school in Coventry and I said to the children: ‘You know where that Blockbuster video store and that supermarket are? In the 1980s I worked in a car factory there that employed 20 000 people’.</p>
<p class="contents">There is nothing new about this. We are treating it as if it were new. Investment will create jobs and deliver the solution to the problems that many colleagues on this side have talked about: investment in new cars, investment in new factories, investment in robots that will cut the cost of production, and investment in quality. I ask Mr Schulz where that investment is going to come from. It is going to come from profits. What the car industry is short of is not bleeding hearts; it needs more profits to invest in those new products. That is going on in the successful companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Another factory I worked in during my 30 years in the industry – the Oxford plant of what was the British Motor Corporation – is now one of the most successful car plants in England, which produces the Mini. You see them all over the place, you see them in America. BMW – the owners of that plant, a German company – is investing GBP 250 million to make a new car there and we thank BMW for that. It is going to create another thousand jobs. An engine that was made in Brazil is now going to be made in Birmingham, in my constituency.</p>
<p class="contents">I say to my friends in Portugal – and many of them will be speaking shortly about these issues: come and talk to those of us who have lived through that problem before. One of the saddest days of my life was when I went to the Longbridge car plant to meet the receiver of that plant, which had gone bankrupt. I started work there in 1967 when it employed 25 000 people, and now I walked into an empty factory.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the reality of industrial life. It has been there for a long time. The issue is how we deal with it. We need better employment, we need full employment, we need retraining, and we need to help people who are made redundant to get new employment. If something cannot be saved, we have the responses to it. We have been involved at Longbridge, where 5000 people were made redundant. We are working at Peugeot at the moment and in other areas. Come and talk to us about the practical things that we are doing and stop complaining in this Chamber about the problems. We have all been through them every day. Let us not have another debate like this. Let us think about a positive way forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While he has experienced redundancies and restructuring, I myself have been made redundant three times due to economic developments and restructuring in the Nord Pas-de-Calais, in France. The Socialist Group in the European Parliament is in favour of a policy enabling businesses to create jobs, to modernise and to promote economic development. Yet, when it talks about economic development, the PSE Group is also talking about social support, with a view to creating wealth, but to redistributing it too. Europe must demonstrate its European social model.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the reason why we have worked collectively and why more than 80% of us voted in favour of a report on restructuring and employment, in which we state that we certainly need to provide for a form of support, but that we also need to enlighten Europe about what we are and about what we do. We voted in favour, by a very large majority, in an effort to say that, if Europe provides economic aid and public money and if it becomes clear at any given time that a form of ‘subsidised tourism' exists, then that money must be reimbursed. General Motors, where last year more than 500 000 employees were affected by restructuring, is one such example that is of concern to us today. We are not complaining, but we do believe that everyone must be respected, and employees in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Restructuring is necessary in order to keep our businesses economically competitive. It still has many consequences for all that. In the case of General Motors today, as in many cases of restructuring, Europeans are awaiting a strong response from the Union. Mr Barroso gave us this response by calling on the new Finnish Presidency to embody the Europe of results. Well, the Europe of results starts here, in this Chamber, with a strong signal sent out to the employees who are currently in difficulties. Support measures must of course be taken, concerning training and aid, but we must ask ourselves as from today how the public money that has been distributed will be paid back.</p>

In 2005, more than half a million jobs were lost in the European Union through restructuring measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Quoted companies, in whatever country they are based, are registering all-time record profits. Sales are going through the roof, and workforces are being drastically pruned. Over the last three years, the productivity of companies featuring in the German share index DAX has risen by an average of 6.5%. Surely that means they are competitive! When we discuss what to do, we must ask whether the basis on which we grant aid is the right one.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall make you a few proposals, most of which have not yet been given any consideration. Is it not safe to assume that aid is primarily awarded for innovative products and processes, for new research and development rather than for plant and equipment? I believe this categorisation can be used to restrict aid awards.</p>
<p class="contents">My second question is this: is it wise to limit the recovery to five years? The amortisation period for equipment is usually 10 to 15 years. Logically, companies should repay the money for as long as it takes to write off the capital expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, when it comes to assessing whether or not support should be granted, should we not insist and verify that companies operating globally comply with the guidelines of the World Health Organization, the International Labour Organization and the applicable emission standards in all their locations? Any company that does not would simply be ineligible for aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, is it wise to support companies which are not bound by a collective agreement and which trade unions are unable to influence? In such cases, European taxpayers are paying double. We fund the companies’ research and development and their expenditure on equipment, and afterwards they make employees redundant, and European taxpayers are supposed to foot the bill for unemployment benefit too. That is surely bad economics!</p>
<p class="contents">One final point: if we intend to pursue a genuine structural and regional policy, a far closer link must be forged between the company’s need for support and the beneficial regional impact of such support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Last year 9 000 jobs were lost in Germany. This year 900 job losses have been announced in the United Kingdom, and more recently the closure of the Azambuja factory in Portugal, which has been in operation for decades and where 1 200 people work, was announced.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take this opportunity to greet the representatives from the Azambuja factory who are in the Chamber today and to express our solidarity. When we speak about thousands of redundancies, these are not just big numbers, not just statistics, not just percentages, they are human, family tragedies, and I am appalled that some Members of this House have shown a lack of awareness of this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The closure of the Azambuja factory affects us all as it could be another stepping stone towards the dismantling of other General Motors factories in the EU and the subsequent relocation of those factories to the east – to Russia and to Asia. This is why this debate is worthwhile. It is a good thing that Mr Schulz took the initiative of scheduling the debate, to give us a chance to obtain some answers.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, what can be done to prevent the closure of the Azambuja factory? This debate should also help multinationals to realise that they cannot simply use and discard; they cannot receive incentives such as Community funding or tax breaks in one Member State and then head off to another in an attempt to obtain further support and more benefits. Closing down factories cannot be normal. It must be something avoidable and we, and the Commission, must of course do everything possible to ensure that this does not happen again and that the globalisation adjustment fund be implemented when things take a turn for the worse. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Faced with the changes that have taken place, and that are still taking place, within national and European industry, Europe has the problem of managing industrial restructuring processes, which have an extremely serious effect on workers and on the various regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Harbour was wondering just now what the topic of the future might be. This is my answer: ‘The topic of the future is how to manage these processes’. There are many cases nowadays in relation to which problems are arising, problems that go by the name of relocation, non-compliance with trade union agreements, and job losses.</p>
<p class="contents">They range from the case of General Motors to that of so many small and medium-sized enterprises right up to what is taking place, for example, in the Eaton factory, in Piedmont, a business in which the restructuring process and the failure to comply with trade union agreements are seriously threatening jobs. In order to deal with this, we need to adopt a firm, Europe-wide stance, involving the effective management of these processes, and this will also increase the consistency of the Lisbon objectives themselves and the social dialogue itself, which is regarded as one of the pillars of this strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call for a common position to be adopted in order to give strength and substance to the very action of the European institutions, beginning with Parliament, in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to highlight one final aspect: it now seems entirely clear that the issue of restructuring requires a review of the Community instruments available. Here is just one example – and I should like to hear the Commissioner’s opinion on the matter – if we really want to manage these processes, then we cannot avoid the need to strengthen and reform European works councils. We need to update the directive if we want to meet the new requirements in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that Parliament as a whole and the Commission can adopt a common position on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thousands of workers, some of whom are here in the Chamber today, are under threat of redundancy. This applies to thousands of support businesses and workers’ families in Azambuja and neighbouring areas, as well as to the General Motors workers themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">I recently met with the Portuguese Workers' Commission, the Mayor and with my fellow MEP Mrs Madeira, but I should like to say at this point that the issue has a broader, European-level scope. We know that General Motors has had strategic difficulties and that it has called for Renault Nissan to step in and help with the management. This does not, however, exempt the company from their responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution that we have tabled confronts General Motors with its European responsibilities, and states very clearly what is happening in Azambuja. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, strategic changes and business restructuring must take into account the fact that workers are human beings and not just factors of production. The EU needs to have a clear strategy, a more appropriate means of dealing with such problems if it wants to have a European social model that functions properly.

It is also, unfortunately a familiar story in recent times in the EU, as has been mentioned in this Chamber before.</p>
<p class="contents">Businesses receive Community and State aid and incentives to set up in a given region and country, and then relocate, flying in the face of the rules of conduct in place, without any compunction or respect for the hundreds or thousands of workers, and often whole families, who are laid off at the drop of a hat. The easy quest for maximum profits and the phenomenon of globalisation cannot justify the economic and social tragedy of the weakest links in the business chain.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, adopted at the December European Council, has neither the remit nor the capacity to prevent all of the situations that have arisen in Europe. This is an international fund geared towards a small number of redundancies and countries on account of the changes happening in world trade. More needs to be done. For this to happen, the EU must define clearly the plan of action that should be pursued by manufacturing companies in Europe and those businesses seeking to reach this market of 455 million consumers with their products. In order for us to be in a position to set an example to the world, we have to begin to demand compliance with the European social model and respect for human rights, and to do this differently. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With regard to the individual case that has featured so prominently in the contributions to this debate, namely Azambuja, the allegation that the company is making enormous profits on the backs of its workforce and the European taxpayer would be rather hard to substantiate, for the days when General Motors recorded profits are long past, both in Europe and in other parts of the world. If I remember rightly, the last annual loss amounted to ten billion dollars, which is not by any means chicken feed. This case therefore needs to be assessed rather differently from those that Mr Schulz, for example, had in mind when he referred to certain forms of modern capitalism which do indeed have socially damaging effects, as no reasonable person can deny.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is clearly agreement in this Parliament that structural change is inevitable, and there is also agreement here that it must not be meekly accepted like sunshine or rain but that something can be done when structural change occurs – and indeed something must be done, because people’s well-being is at stake. The vital thing that a modern economic policy can do now is to shape structural change in such a way that people are not left by the wayside as its victims. That is precisely the aim of our policy.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of very interesting proposals have been made here. I should like to focus on at least one of them and strongly emphasise that I, too, am firmly convinced that the reinforcement of employees’ rights in Europe would make it possible to shape structural change in a more beneficial manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
