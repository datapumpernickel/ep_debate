<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gutiérrez-Cortines (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Madam President, I would like to thank the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport for having accepted this proposal to carry out a study on universities and higher education in the European area of knowledge. I must say that many ideas from my fellow Members of Parliament are taken up here, and I have listened extensively to the views of the European Students’ Association and the European Universities’ Association, as well as many other sectors and that, furthermore, a hearing has taken place.</p>
<p class="contents">However, before discussing the main issue, I would like to say that there are no amendments and that simply, in order to aid the reading of the text, I would ask the secretary for the plenary session to introduce two subtitles: 'European Area of Higher Education ', before item 1 and 'Bologna Process ', before item 5.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is it necessary to produce this report? There is a certain contradiction in Europe. For more than 1 500 years the universities have been an axis upon which European culture has been built. Furthermore, they have been the places where dialogue has been created, where scientific thought has been developed and where young people have been educated. But, nevertheless, curiously, we are seeing a process of distancing – which many call ‘endogamy’ – of universities from the system and the European Union, and the Commission itself and European policies are not taking sufficient account of the role the universities could play as consultants, institutions and conveyors in relation to the Community <span class="italic">acquis</span>. As well as being highly professional and independent, these institutions are established throughout the Union’s territory and should be key references for civil society, as places for dialogue and debate and as support for the MEDA programmes and the programmes of the candidate countries, as well as centres for training in many respects, even more than they are at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not therefore just addressing the Committee on Culture, which we know has created specific programmes on the universities, but the whole of the European Commission. We are therefore discussing the first European document on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">By this I mean that, on the one hand, we invite the universities to come closer to Europe, to observe Europe and take an interest in European issues and, on the other, we invite the Commission to extend its relationship with them in all respects.</p>
<p class="contents">What are we asking for in the report? It is necessary to reinforce the creation of a European area of education and, to this end, the universities must be protagonists. Furthermore, we need them to take on the scientific and conceptual challenge facing Europe and its regions and nations. The universities must also be guardians and must be committed to quality and be the main protagonists and conveyors of the culture of hard work and open and transparent evaluation. Evaluation, transparency and quality should be the responsible reaction of these bodies which are generally funded with public money and in which society trusts to educate our future generations.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the Bologna process, starting with the universities themselves and with the Council, with all that it implies: mobility, recognition of qualifications, the creation of networks, etc.; but it is understood that, in order to achieve this convergence, both the recognition of qualifications and the increase in mobility amongst teachers, students and researchers, it is necessary to make admissions procedures more flexible and make the Bologna process itself more open, as well as the architecture of qualifications. In that way people will feel more comfortable and more at ease and it will be easier to take account of the diversity of problems posed by the different types of qualifications and research, as well as the varying characteristics of practical training.</p>
<p class="contents">The production of a Green Paper is also requested, because it is surprising how little we know about the situation of the universities. The indicators – the few available – in many cases show very negative figures; the universities are going through a great crisis: they have made a great effort to bring education closer to everybody, and they have often lost out in terms of competitiveness. They must be helped. We must recognise the research profession, promote research and create incentives so that students, when young, are initiated into these aspects; it is necessary to reward merit, mobility and results, and it is essential that the universities increase their role as centres for life-long learning. They must be centres for the spreading of technology and innovations, as well for the updating of knowledge.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also suggested that the presence of universities in the media be increased as well as the promotion of distance-learning universities – they have asked us for this – and at the same time that a 'centre for universities' be created, as a centre for the universities to meet so that their relations are not maintained via the Internet and at a cool distance, but that there may be a place in Europe for debate on universities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that if we want to create this Europe of knowledge that we have been anxiously hoping for since Lisbon, we must integrate universities in a very real way.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the reason why my colleague responsible for research, Mr Busquin, and I are preparing a communication on the role of the universities in the Europe of knowledge, a role which cuts across research, education and innovation. With this communication, the Commission will take account of the ideas expressed in the present report, such as, for example, those concerning, doctoral studies. These studies must, in fact, be consolidated and 'europeanised'. I share the rapporteur’s point of view on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall discuss the Bologna process, next year in September, at the major conference in Berlin. Until then, we shall have practical work to do. In fact, on 17 July, the Commission adopted the Erasmus World project, which will authorise the creation of links between our universities, at masters’ degree level. We will thereby create cross-border university families, which will offer Europeans masters degrees and will be open to students and lecturers from other continents. This proposal has been submitted to Parliament and to the Council, under the codecision procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">We are thereby affirming our will to innovate and to strengthen our universities so that they once again become the centres of excellence that they have the potential to be and so that they contribute to making a reality the Europe of knowledge, which still exists in theory only.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget that universities are themselves a collection of actors and institutions - schools, professional training, businesses, citizens - for whom the Commission’s policy is intended.</p>
<p class="contents">We are relying on Parliament’s support to achieve a Europe of knowledge which comprises all the various forces in intellectual society. Adopting the resolution, taking account of this global perspective, will mark a step in this direction. I thank you for the support that you have given to the action that we are in the process of undertaking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to focus on sport. In Europe it is very difficult to combine studies with sport and this means that our young people eventually have to choose between the two. We parents naturally try to have an influence on this choice and we encourage them to chose studies instead of sport, since they seem to us to offer more security.</p>
<p class="contents">In other countries, such as the United States, sport and university studies are entirely compatible. And not only are they compatible, but a North American student actually has access to many more universities and opportunities thanks to sport than they would without it.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must promote sport in universities, both inside and outside the university itself. We must promote the participation of university teams in competitions between universities (regional, national, international, etc.) and perhaps – and why not? – we could apply part of the Erasmus programme, which is having great success, to providing mobility for university sports teams, as enjoyed by other students.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget that young people who divide their time between studies and sport are not left with much energy and time to indulge in other activities which we would all consider less advisable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There has been talk, particularly in recent years, following Lisbon, of the need to develop a knowledge-based Europe, but this has in many respects thus far remained just a good intention.</p>
<p class="contents">Those like myself who have experienced the effects of the Erasmus and Socrates programmes in universities know, despite the frequently limited scale of the programmes caused by lack of funding, how much impact they have had both in terms of widening the horizons of students and lecturers and in terms of creating extensive European awareness among the citizens, starting with the families of those who have benefited from the programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Our task is now to extend the Union’s attention and action to a large number of other aspects of higher education, most importantly encouraging the dissemination of the good practices of some countries in all the other countries of the Union, promoting the right of all the citizens to study irrespective of their financial situation, and this can be achieved by expanding public higher education, which is the only form of education which attracts investments that are not subject to the mindset of quick profits and which is therefore able to guarantee all the citizens access to higher education, which is necessary for the renewal of the ruling classes.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not disregard the fact that the supremacy of public universities in some countries of the Union is currently under threat from alarming privatisation trends, which are in danger of irreparably reducing the freedom of study and diminishing the quality of research and teaching, placing greater emphasis on income than on merit and ability.</p>
<p class="contents">The Gutiérrez-Cortines report takes this situation into account and contains a number of important proposals. I would like, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, to point out that it calls upon the Commission to set up a ‘European University House’ providing the academic world – including students, lecturers and the various agencies operating in the sector – with an autonomous way of asserting their needs and making proposals. This would be an interesting example of the application of the principle of subsidiarity to a sector of European culture which is crucial to all our work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I could not agree more that knowledge is the key to competitiveness and economic and social development in Europe, but I certainly do not see eye to eye on all her conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">Universities play a vital role when it comes to turning Europe into the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy. It is therefore very important for them to maintain mutual contact and exchange information and experiences. The pre-condition is, however, that they should offer high-quality education in an attempt to create centres of excellence within the academic world. I completely share Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines' view that the mobility of students, lecturers and researchers could be much improved. Administratively, many stumbling blocks could be removed. However, I cannot see the good in the Commission and Member States having to promote the establishment of a European University Seat. Accordingly, it is not clear to me what role a representation of the Member States and of Parliament would be playing in this.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point, the validity of which passes me by, is the setting up of a separate European cultural university. Language and literature, philosophy and communication are already being taught at existing universities, while special academies cater for the arts. The report points at the need for an intercultural dialogue with the world's other regions. This is all well and good, but it does suggest that the existing universities are completely introspective and maintain no contact with the rest of the world, and this is simply no longer the case. I therefore fear, Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines, that my group, despite the fact that we agree on certain aspects of the report, will be abstaining from the vote, since it cannot reconcile itself with the two above-mentioned points. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a result, the standard of education provided is falling across the board.</p>

The Communist Party of Greece is radically opposed to the Bologna process, to private universities, to interventions via the Green Paper, to the so-called European area of higher education and, of course, to the creation of a seat of European universities, all of which eradicate independence and the free circulation of ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">We are fighting for state universities and state universities alone, subject to academic, not business control, which will meet grass-roots and social needs. We support cooperation between universities with due respect for the academic order.</p>

It will also increase European competitiveness, because universities play an important role now in the business sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Many higher education establishments are already suffering a funding crisis and European Union higher education legislation will not be brought closer without proper financial commitment.

<p class="contents">However, I would have liked to see more emphasis on the teaching of modern foreign languages, since linguistic barriers are one of the main impediments to mobility.

<p class="contents">I fully agree with Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines that the time has come for Europe not just to fund but to manage and promote a model of education without frontiers at European level, restoring research to its institutional home, the university. I therefore feel I must stress the importance of consolidating the European higher education area, an assuredly important goal which, although involving the individual universities of the Member States, would affect neither their autonomy nor their cultural history while providing for what will, I am sure, be high-quality teaching.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the movement of students, researchers and lecturers is an excellent way of bringing about exchanges of skills and of developing critical faculties, and has great social value, with a view to ensuring successful cultural integration in the future. I deeply believe that the establishment of a network of higher education and the results of research will not only bring reciprocal evaluation of performance but will make any monitoring process more cost-effective too.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore becoming increasingly important for the European Union to implement a support policy through the programming of funds for university research, bearing in mind that the task of a university as an institution is not just to teach but, above all, to carry out research and experiments, thus enhancing the role of researchers who would otherwise seek more professionally rewarding activities elsewhere, specifically in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking back at the funding hitherto appropriated for research by the European Union, I note that a huge amount has been dedicated to small and medium-sized enterprises, which are certainly important in the overall economies of our countries, while the sector of university research has been neglected.</p>
<p class="contents">I am afraid I must point out, on the basis of this analysis, that much of the research funded was then subcontracted precisely to university researchers for its implementation. I realise that many resources have certainly been made available to the European Union’s universities thus far – the Fifth Framework Programme, the Sixth Framework Programme, Erasmus etc. – but we have a further task: to further convince those working on this document that it is time to restore to the institution of the universities their supreme role in research, acknowledging that they have performed this role for over 600 years and achieved excellent results, offering them for the benefit of the whole world without claiming property rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Farage (EDD).</span></span>   – Madam President, there is no doubt about the importance of universities and education. In fact, education itself is so important that Prime Minister Blair has said in the past that he only has three policies: education, education and education. But the high profile of education in the political arena makes universities and other institutions especially vulnerable to external pressure. Not for nothing do universities become one of the first targets of demagogues and dictators. The free thinkers and the independent spirits are soon removed.</p>
<p class="contents">Democracies also have a problem here because our educational establishments rely predominantly on the state for their funding and he who pays the piper seeks to call the tune. As a result we have seen increasing interference in our educational establishments.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also the case with the European Union. As more and more money destined for academia comes through the European institutions, the European piper is indeed now calling the European tune.</p>
<p class="contents">As I travel around British universities speaking to students, I see a rash of ring of stars flags and EU literature. But more worryingly, under the Jean Monnet programme I see the orthodoxies of the European Union now being taught in political science and in European history courses. Such is the grip of EU money that dissent from the perceived wisdom is treated almost as heresy. Unless the correct version of political history is submitted in their course work and in their examinations students now find themselves penalised in their exam marking.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus I view this report with some degree of dismay and trepidation. The European Union has its own key policies and they are integration, integration and yet more integration. That of course is why the European Union is so interested in universities and further education.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no doubt that this particular report is well meant but the creation of a European learning area and the prospect of yet more taxpayers' money being filtered through the EU into universities is a recipe for even more political interference. The independence of our universities is far too important for them to be sacrificed on the altar of political integration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must ensure, however, that we do not fall into the trap of the dogmatic principle that is so dear to pro-European supporters: wherever there is a European area, everything must, without fail, be merged and blended together.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as universities are concerned, a great deal has already been done, particularly under the Socrates and Erasmus programmes, to encourage the mobility of students and teachers, the creation of joint courses, the scheduling of intensive courses as well as helping to set up thematic networks. Must we, however, go further down a centralising and bureaucratic route, which would introduce unique and rigid criteria in an area where the diversity of cultures, methods and concepts is the guarantee of a culture of quality, which is not tied to an ideology?</p>
<p class="contents">Up to now, Europe has done what it has had to do in this area by providing everyone with effective tools under the programmes I mentioned earlier. We must now develop original forms of cooperation, whilst respecting the freedoms and desires of each EU nation. Business and engineering schools provide an example of the success of schools which, independently of any European legal framework, have successfully managed to integrate themselves into this new area by freely organising joint reorientation classes, exchanges, subjects and degrees.</p>
<p class="contents">Is it up to Europe to decide what belongs to the private domain? Is it up to Europe to concern itself with sporting activities in universities? Is it up to Europe to define what must constitute teaching of artistic studies? I do not think it is. I recognise, however, that there are two positive points in this report. Firstly, the drafting of a Green Paper, as long as it does not become an instrument for standardizing our universities, and secondly, granting post-graduate study grants on the basis of merit rather than household income. These two points are not enough, however, to convince us to vote in favour of this report.</p>

I wish, in particular, to put forward once again the proposal, which I feel has a place in a debate such as this, that the legal validity of qualifications should be abolished. In my opinion, this is a measure which could serve to ensure that the confusion in the debate between public and private sectors – the guarantee of high quality education – is avoided.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, as Professor Vattimo rightly said, there is a great deal of emphasis on providing a genuine guarantee of the educational experience. Well then, until evidence is provided to the contrary, the legal status of the administrator cannot be the guarantee of that experience. In the eighteenth century, the whole of Europe flocked to Prussia, not because Prussia had an efficient state capable of running universities but, above all, because there was a great teacher named Immanuel Kant. In fact, the validity of the learning adventure is guaranteed by the broad-mindedness of the teachers, and that is precisely the point I am trying to make.</p>
<p class="contents">In all probability, abolishing the legal validity of educational qualifications is still one of the best ways of guaranteeing the full legitimacy of those establishments which know how to teach properly. This is so true that, although Professor Vattimo the MEP may not be able to acknowledge it for ideological reasons, Professor Vattimo the university lecturer is quite aware that studying for a degree under ‘the Prof’ is different from doing so under any other tutor, to the extent that the guarantee of the educational experience that he provides is not the fact that it is the state which runs the University of Turin but his love of the truth and his love of the adventure of learning. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She deserves the congratulations she has received and of course I would like to add my own.</p>
<p class="contents">It is timely because its description of the university situation and its interesting proposals put an end to what has been several years of slow progress in terms of European construction in the education field, during which we have seen little more than passivity and rhetoric. On issues such as the unification of quality standards, the mutual and automatic recognition of qualifications, the convergence of degrees and programmes and the employment of graduates, the achievement of a European dimension, and the objectives set for 2010 in general, are almost as far away as they were on the day following the end of the Bologna process, more than three years ago now.</p>
<p class="contents">The most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world is still waiting for us to be able to create a European area of higher education. Meanwhile, the universities’ response to European employment demands is inadequate and furthermore, in a context of globalisation, the European universities are still losing the battle against the American universities, both in terms of their leadership of the knowledge-based society and in terms of their external attractiveness to third-country teachers, researchers and students.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the European university sector, with its fifteen million students and 600 000 teachers, is the most dynamic sector in our society, and the fact that we are adopting reports such as these, are hopeful signs which lead us to believe that, despite nationalist resistance in the Council, the autocratic attitude of some of our universities and the apathy of the Commission and Parliament in this sector, we will finally achieve the stated objective of a European area of higher education which is worthy of the name.</p>

<p class="contents">To list some of the positive elements, efforts are being made to reduce administrative or other obstacles hampering exchange programmes for students and teachers, efforts are being made to encourage learning foreign languages, and not only English; efforts are also being made to create joint networks and services for circulating information, and, lastly, efforts are being made to encourage placements and even sporting competitions. These are all excellent initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">I must, however, express some reservations about the self-confessed goal of this report through the creation of a European area of higher education. The Commission’s assessment of all university systems, both public-sector and privately-run, could create a new bureaucratic, supranational European layer, disregarding the subsidiarity principle which is included – almost for the sake of appearances – in the first paragraph of the report. The stated desire to introduce uniform criteria in the structure of qualifications, or even to harmonise all university curricula for students, will undoubtedly reduce the diversity of distinctive academic or scientific models, which can be regarded as a competitive factor and a mark of progress. European civilisation has created diversity in all areas. By first of all fully mastering a specific area of knowledge, a science, a technique, a particular experience and a national culture, we shall stay as faithful as possible to true European traditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Universities have always been incubators of European culture and have played an important role in developing our societies. We must therefore realise that if the European Union is to achieve the new strategic development objectives set in Lisbon today, it needs more active and competitive universities to generate knowledge and innovation not as isolated institutions but as active partners in the social and economic fabric at national level, at regional level and at a cross-border level that mirrors the new configuration of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Another dimension we need to be aware of is the role of universities in promoting European unification, by cultivating a European conscience and promoting a European nationality. Our universities can become the laboratories of unified Europe with their educational and teaching programmes and the cooperation and mobility of students and teachers which they can promote.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the direction you are working in, Commissioner, but the Member States also need to come on board. There is a great deal of work to do here because we all know about the obstacles to the mutual recognition of diplomas, low mobility and the differences in academic approach to university courses in the various countries of Europe. What we all have to understand is that convergence and promoting educational cohesion can be achieved with all due respect for diversity and, at the same time, by introducing systems which recognise and promote the added value of the special attributes of our universities. This sort of policy will also bring about better conditions for the professional mobility which the European Union is striving to promote. So I think drafting a Green Paper would be a good initiative and I for one shall be behind you in this endeavour, Commissioner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
