<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Corbey (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the waste mounting is still growing. Packaging only plays a minor, albeit visible, role in the environmental problem and is a source of irritation to many people. Packaging could be used as an example of a fresh approach to environmental problems. We must make sustainable development viable. We can adopt all the sound ideas from the sixth environmental action programme and apply these to the packaging policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, we are not starting from scratch. We have had a packaging directive since 1994, which we can use as a basis to work from. The packaging directive has a dual purpose: to reduce the harmful environmental impact of packaging to a minimum and to guarantee the functioning of the internal market. It is important for Parliament to consider how the directive operates in practice, for we must learn from experience. Compliance with legislation is important, but the effectiveness of the legislation is at least as important.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of compliance, there is good news and bad news. The good news is that nearly all Member States have implemented the directive well. Most objectives have been fulfilled, and Greece recently became the last Member State to inform the Commission of its measures and the results it had achieved. The Member States all did it their own way: Germany by means of the green dot system, the Netherlands by means of the voluntary agreements, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is also bad news, and I should like to mention four points. Firstly, the volume of packaging waste is still on the increase. Prevention of excessive packaging was an express objective, although it is not further specified in the directive. Only in four countries has the volume of packaging materials diminished. We clearly need to be more ambitious in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the proportion of plastic in waste is growing. The directive prescribes a very modest target for plastic: at least 15% must be recycled. But even this minimum target has only been achieved by four countries, namely Germany, Austria, Belgium and Sweden. More than 50% of all products are wrapped in plastic. As it is difficult to recycle plastic, something must be done about this.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, reliable and comparable data is lacking. The Member States all have their own way of collating data and it is unclear, for example, whether plastic waste that is exported is also included in the figures. Political decisions must be based on sound data, and the directive must be adapted accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">To finish off, I should like to mention one major point: it is, in fact, unclear what the environmental effect is of all the collection, sorting, recycling and re-use. We think it is positive, and that is probably the case, but a sound assessment of environmental effects is required in order to continue to motivate consumers to separate their waste. Furthermore, the effect on the internal market, this directive’s second pillar, is equally vague.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, it is clearly time for a change. We need better reporting, better definitions and in addition to this, I would suggest a threefold approach.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we must devote more attention to recycling. The targets must be raised considerably and we must encourage the use of recycled materials. Special attention must be given to plastic. To date, plastic has had no positive residual value. In order to make the collecting and sorting of plastic profitable nevertheless, a levy is required, and I would ask the Commission once again to quickly present the revised proposal now.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would ask the Commission to promote re-use. For that purpose, situations must be identified where re-use is useful from an environmental point of view. That is connected with transport distances and the materials.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must accord prevention a far more prominent role. For that purpose, I suggest making the manufacturers responsible. On the basis of a lifecycle analysis, manufacturers must demonstrate that they have chosen the best possible packaging for their product from an environmental point of view. The question is, of course, how this can be measured. The emission of CO2, the use of natural ancillary resources, harmful substances and residual waste must definitely form part of the equation. By adopting this approach, environmental costs can be charged on as part of the product, and that is the direction in which we need to be heading.</p>
<p class="contents">We must define clearer environmental parameters within which the market can go about its business and manufacturers can make choices. Manufacturer responsibility must be further detailed and the Commission must now take the stakeholders dialogue seriously. The interested parties from each sector, not only from industry but also consumers and representatives of environmental organisations, must be invited. This can lead to a refreshing approach which can be incorporated in clear guiding principles.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the three above-mentioned points, fellow MEPs have added a number of useful suggestions: clear responsibility not only for products but also for retailers; paying attention to the role of local councils and of consumers; and paying attention to planning and transport packaging. I welcome these suggestions with open arms.</p>
<p class="contents">The long-overdue revision of the packaging directive is an opportunity to demonstrate that the internal market can be reconciled with the environment, and we must not let this opportunity slip. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is clear that in this particular case we are dealing with a directive whose implementation has been very complicated in the majority of Member States, given that the fine-tuning of the mechanisms needed to meet the objectives of the directive is in itself a very complicated issue. It is one thing to issue a piece of legislation, because everything holds up on paper, and a completely different thing to put it into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank the rapporteur for the commitments we have been able to make and I regret that we could not agree on certain points, which are by no means trivial ones.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly I would like to make it patently clear that this should have been a report on the implementation of the directive on packaging, but it has turned into a report that is trying to tell the Commission the direction it should be taking with regard to the revision of the directive in question. It is a clear example of the temptation that we frequently give into in this Parliament, which is to forget that it is the Commission that holds the legislative initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats propose the following: Firstly, that the objectives for the prevention and reduction of packaging waste should not be binding, nor should they be classified by material, in order that competitiveness is maintained between them. For we should not forget that the legal basis of this directive is the environment and also the internal market. We think, however, that these objectives should be linked to the quantity of the product that is packaged and put on the market.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: the responsibility for the prevention and removal of packaging and packaging waste must be shared between producers, packaging companies, retailers and consumers, and not only the producer, as the draft report proposes.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly: Life Cycle Analysis is a very useful method from an environmental point of view, that should be taken into account, but it cannot be proposed as the standard norm to ensure that the requirements of Annex II are being met. These standard norms should be issued by the European Committee for Standardisation and this body, in turn, should continue working in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we are against introducing any other new standard apart from the so-called ‘green dot’, already in use in most countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we propose that the recitals alluding to the situation in specific Member States in 1998 with regard to compliance with the objectives of the directive be removed, for at this time the directive was in the process of being transposed, and the data, and I quote directly from recital B, “are not meaningful for the purpose of assessing the real degree to which the directive's objectives have been met”. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We really need to discuss packaging.</p>
<p class="contents">I nonetheless think – and I say this following 30 years’ experience of environmental issues and environmental debate – that, as usual, we have an incredible talent for running after problems and battening upon them. To discuss packaging solely from the perspective of waste, as we are doing now and have <span class="italic">always</span> done, is completely wrong. I address the Commissioner with responsibility for environmental issues directly and appeal to her to allow us to discuss the whole chain. We have to discuss logistics, transport and the packaging that eventually becomes waste. Above all, the amount of consumer packaging must and can be reduced. You and I come from the same country, and we <span class="italic">know</span> that experiments led to a 30 per cent reduction in the quantity of material in consumer packaging over approximately three years. It <span class="italic">is</span> possible. I might perhaps be allowed to appeal for the forthcoming White Paper on Integrated Product Policy to address the whole of the logistical chain, something which did not feature in the Green Paper. That would be a merciful answer to our prayers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There should be nothing to prevent Member States from making progress.</p>

I would very much like to know if there is a strategy for this, whether you need more time for a new debate on strategy and whether you are in the process of moving over from a product policy to a materials policy. As I now observe, that is a vain labour of love, as you are now applying yourself to other things.</p>
<p class="contents">You are right, Mrs Corbey, to say that packaging waste is increasing, and so it is entirely right and proper for us to concern ourselves with these Packaging Regulations and with those to be enacted in the future. I simply think that we must first discuss what has actually been done by the Member States. Were the old Packaging Regulations from the Nineties right, or did we make mistakes? Did we rightly see how things would turn out today? Is there not a multitude of loopholes? As you mentioned, databases are largely lacking. Has transposition into national law really taken place punctually and in the way we intend, and is the hierarchy envisaged by the Packaging Regulations actually as flexible as we need it to be in the future?</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe so. Yet we must, now that the Commission has imposed on us this report on implementation, concentrate on these important matters.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unfortunately not our present task to consider what quotas have to be set for landfill dumping, recycling, and so on. Let me make clear that I regret that.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a lot of other points I would like to make. Having lost the first minutes, though, I shall admit defeat and carry on debating in the next round. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jackson (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, these oversight reports by Parliament are very important because we need not only to examine new legislation but to look back to see what has happened to the legislation we have adopted. Mrs Corbey is quite right to name names. The Member States were supposed to bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the packaging directive before 30 June 1996. That did not happen.</p>
<p class="contents">Two things should flow from the findings Mrs Corbey has put before us. Firstly, we must ask whether the original directive, as Mr Florenz has said, was defective or whether ministers were not honest with themselves about what they could achieve when they adopted it. The answer is probably a combination of the two. Secondly, we should ask why the Commission did not act more quickly than it has to investigate why the directive was struggling to gain universal compliance. I regret that Mrs Corbey did not focus on these questions.</p>
<p class="contents">Individual countries have had very different experiences as each has put a recovery system in place. My own evidence from the United Kingdom is that our system has been too bureaucratic. One businessman in Cornwall complained to me that he had to employ a graduate specifically to keep a track of his firm's obligations under the directive. What lessons are there from our experience which could underpin the revision of the directive, or at least a revision of the way that Member States are applying it?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is wrong if it proposes higher targets for recycling. This is the easy way out, but the wrong way. Such targets cannot take account of the considerable variations and circumstances between Member States, so we will end up with an even bigger range of results than we have now, creating trade barriers and distorting competition. If we are to get EU environmental law that really makes a difference, we must, within much broader targets, allow Member States to adopt solutions best suited to their respective local environments and economies.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would thank her for her work on this own-initiative report including a resolution on implementation of Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste. The report addresses relevant issues and will be of great importance when the Commission goes on to prepare the revision of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also noted that the European Parliament would like to carry out a more extensive review of the issues affecting packaging waste. I think this is necessary, but things must be done in the right order. We have now <span class="italic">committed</span> ourselves to tabling before long a proposal for revision of the existing proposal and for new targets. This, moreover, is something we are going to do. I anticipate the Commission’s being able, before the end of the year, to take a decision on the promised revision of the Directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste. After that, we must look to the longer term considerations addressed by Mrs Paulsen and Mrs Jackson. We must therefore adopt several different approaches to this work.</p>
<p class="contents">The first revolves around an Integrated Product Policy. I want to state in no uncertain terms that we have specifically emphasised life cycle analysis and this way of looking at the issues. Certainly, further efforts are required and further proposals and ideas about how to proceed, but the life cycle analysis contains the whole mode of thinking and way of approaching this issue. It is important that we continue to work with an Integrated Product Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The second revolves around the thematic strategies we have promised under the Sixth Environmental Action Programme. In the course of next year, there will be two such strategies which will be of great importance to our attitude towards these issues: recycling and use of resources. In connection with these strategies, there will be the opportunity to review the whole of our policy in terms of looking at each individual waste stream. Are we to continue to do this, and how are we to look at this issue in broad outline? It is important for us to take this major initiative, but we must do it in the right way and at the right time. In my judgment, we must handle the problems via Integrated Product Policy and via the thematic strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">Before the end of the year, the promised revision of the specific targets for packaging and packaging waste will take place. It is perfectly correct to point out that we need to review the whole of this issue in order to obtain a policy which will last for many years into the future and which will mean that we do not need to go chasing frantically after problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
