Nevertheless, as a funereal action and as a warning to the world, our resolution holds considerable resonance. Certainly the suppression of women's rights in Afghanistan continues apace. I come from a different cultural and religious tradition to those who created the Bamiyan Buddha statues in the 2nd century, but I feel that all of us share a common ownership of our heritage and the right to free movement, education and employment regardless of gender.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming particularly to the statues, this destruction was much more than just a mindless act of violence by a regime that apparently intends to catapult us back into the Middle Ages. All of us, whatever our creed, nationality, or political viewpoint, lost an irreplaceable piece of the common heritage that binds us together on this earth.</p>
<p class="contents">A founding principle of the European Union is that religious and cultural tolerance is integral to a democratic and civilised society. This debate therefore not only registers our disgust with the Taliban, it is also a reminder that there are forces we need to guard against. The Taliban may see the destruction of the Buddhas simply as the shattering of stones. But we in Europe know better. We know that the burning of books meant much more than the burning of books. It signified something else entirely. In commending my resolution to the House, I hope therefore that we in the Union will continue to work with all the governments and other agencies which sought to prevent this action and that together we can prevent any further catastrophes of this kind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you know, the whole population is being held to ransom by fanatical clerics and the episode with the statues is just the umpteenth example of the fanatical nature of this regime, a regime which lives and thrives within these <span class="italic">madrasas</span>, these so-called schools which, at the end of the day, only teach one thing: intolerance.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing which I think is important is that we have to dispel the widespread view that nothing much can be done about Afghanistan. I think the contrary is true. I think there are some very specific things which can be done. I can name three.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is probably the most important: Commissioner, the European Union, i.e. the Commission, should take an extremely firm stance vis-à-vis Pakistan because, without Pakistan, there would be no Taliban. That is an absolute basic. The Union must therefore make clear that, if Pakistan persists, as it is doing, in helping and supporting the Taliban, there will be no prospect of developing relations between the European Union and Pakistan.</p>
<p class="contents">A second possible line of action, for which we can, I think, thank a forerunner in our Parliament, General Morillon, consists of giving firm support to General Massoud over and above any hypocrisy. We cannot keep hiding behind alibis. It is, I think, the only organised resistance against the regime in place and we need to give it teeth.</p>
<p class="contents">The third line of action, which will perhaps seem a little more indirect, but which is just as basic, concerns aid given by the United Nations - fairly indirectly but not as indirectly as all that ­ via the UNDCP, the United Nations Drug Control Programme headed by Mr Arlacchi. The UN has given the Taliban substantial aid through programmes which profess to eradicate crops but which, in fact, do no more than shift them a few hundred metres or a few kilometres, to the point that the Taliban have had access both to UN subsidies and to the profit generated by cultivating banned substances. So we need to get the UNDCP with its back against the wall. I think that we also need to campaign to prevent Pino Arlacchi from being re-elected in June. This man needs to go home and study sociology and relieve us of his presence in an organisation of such importance.</p>
<p class="contents">The UN and the European Union, which is funding this programme, and the Member States, which fund the UNDCP, should therefore insist that all aid programmes to Afghanistan to eradicate drug crops be abolished. We should also persuade the Russians who have infiltrated Mr Arlacchi’s entourage and who have a certain number of dubious connections to say the least - and I shall not say more - to go home and let us clean up the management of this specialised United Nations programme and, in doing so, stop helping the regime in place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Women who almost float along, who are kept apart by curtains on public transport, who are obliged to give up their jobs … time and time again they are kept apart, and time and time again they are humiliated, abused and sold short. This is why people are actually forced to move home, to emigrate in the face of the inhuman conditions prevailing in Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">What must be done to get the Taliban to reconsider? In practical terms it is too late for many statues. That is a very tragic fact and in my view it is to be greatly welcomed that the international community protested against this iconoclastic fury of 2001. This protest came not only from the West or from the Dalai Lama, but also from their own fellow-Muslims, who realised that this was a matter of cultural heritage and not purely religious symbols. The protest was vociferous. It is to be welcomed that at the same time the discriminatory and inhuman treatment of women in Afghanistan is receiving the attention it has long deserved: there should be worldwide protest against this too.</p>
<p class="contents">This regime discriminates not only against its own women: the local correspondent of the BBC, herself a woman, has just been deported. Her criticism of the iconoclasm was too stinging and so the press bureau, which had existed since 1950, had to close. I am not very optimistic, not to say pessimistic about the Taliban heeding these resolutions. Hopefully no one will take it into his head to support them financially or by supplying weapons. It just shows you what can happen when dogma becomes law. It is to be welcomed that we, as the European Parliament, are responding. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance fully supports this resolution.</p>

I would like to highlight these two points in our joint resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">‘Heritage’ is not the right word to use because of its significance. I would prefer to take up the distinction made two days ago in a daily newspaper by a French philosopher, Jean Luc Nancy, between the symbol and the idol. The symbol represents the human being, whose capacity for truth will never be extinguished. The nature of the symbol in this case are statues which also serve as idols. The idol is the total yet limited presence of the symbol itself. It is perhaps the inverse representation of the symbol. But, in both cases, the symbol and the idol merge into the image and the ability of the human being to transcend itself. In terms of both nature and symbol, women in Afghanistan are totally deprived.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me explain what I mean by deprivation. Rather than describe it, I will talk about it in the appropriate terms. The word ‘discrimination’ in our joint resolution, as in the Council joint declaration of January and the texts of the UN and of the international institutions, disturbs me because discrimination operates in a space where a common minimum is allowed for there to be discrimination. Discrimination is a natural corollary of exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Here we have women who are denied access to employment and education and who are excluded from public life. This is called rejection. These are the words we must use.</p>
<p class="contents">I find it hard to believe that hanging and public beatings are the result of discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out that I believe we have become mired in a form of language, which I do not find very suitable and, as Members of the European Parliament, we must be very careful about this. This is because behind all this, all these words, behind this international language, which uses the same words to describe democracy in the West and for our Western democracies as it does to describe what is happening in Afghanistan, lies our capacity for doing anything at all. Who is protecting the Taliban? Who is supporting them? Pakistan. Who is protecting them? Do I have to answer? Can you answer with me? Why did we go to fight against Saddam Hussein? Why have we imposed sanctions against Iraq? Why do we not take sanctions against Afghanistan? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the orders of Taliban chief Mohammad Omar, the two world-famous Bamiyan Buddha statues have been completely destroyed regardless of all international protests. These millennia-old treasures that are part of our common cultural heritage are irreplaceable. Not even the promise of further aid for this totally impoverished country could deter the self-styled warriors of God from their scandalous acts. They control Afghanistan, drive out dissenters, exploit the country, human rights are trampled under foot, women are denied the opportunity to go to school, as my fellow Members have pointed out, and they are not allowed to appear in public. It is like living in the Middle Ages. The Koran says that freedom of religion and conscience together with justice are central elements of Islamic social order. These commandments have been misinterpreted by the mullahs, an abuse that is unpardonable. The Taliban’s closest ally, Pakistan, intervened without success. Commissioner, the European Union must act here. We in the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats want the international community to outlaw such fanaticism and vandalism! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, it is unacceptable for us to support what I would call a lawless area, where there is no recognition of the basic aspects of human welfare. I do not think that Europe will ever be able to allow this situation and I believe that each and every one of us, whatever their attachment, can sympathise with it, given the two examples that Mrs Fraisse already mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is clear that the abolition of many symbols, representing what men and women might believe in, is crucially significant, but what is even more serious is the fact that denying any dignity for women’s rights must stir us into action. This is obviously a serious point and it certainly needs to be made.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point relates to Islam. I believe we must have the courage to say that some people, who have a good understanding of Islam, have denounced the current situation in Afghanistan. By invoking Western values we must not deny this truth, which is that a certain number of men and women who are devoted to Islam oppose the events which are unfolding today in Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the message that ideas and convictions can peacefully coexist, which must be adopted by Europe, must be disseminated far and wide. So, there must be no demonisation, simply the desire to take action.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly and finally, point 12 of our resolution calls on the United Nations to rapidly establish an independent committee of inquiry. We must arrange a meeting. If the United Nations does not have either the determination or the courage to establish this committee of inquiry, it may fall to the European Parliament to take the initiative on behalf of our shared values and set up such a committee. That is what is expected of Europe: it has its values; it is tolerant; it must demonstrate its determination, perhaps such a meeting has already been arranged. If the United Nations does not act, it is up to us to do so. However, we are sending a very clear message to the Taliban and I hope I have succeeded in obtaining your support.</p>

<p class="contents">The observers concerned were quick to point out that this indignation was rather late in coming and that it could have been voiced when the Taliban took power because of the archaic and barbaric regime which they established in defiance of the most basic rights of the Afghan people.</p>
<p class="contents">This criticism cannot be levelled at the European Parliament which has taken action several times over, the last occasion being on 30 November 2000, when it condemned the regime as forcefully as it could and set alarm bells ringing regarding the tragic humanitarian situation experienced by the entire population.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President-in-Office of the Council, our Parliament welcomes the common positions adopted on 22 January, and particularly those adopted on 21 February this year, but we think the time has now come to openly give all the necessary political aid to the very forces on the ground that continue to fight under Commander Massoud. I would very much welcome a clear response on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, as you know, we are also concerned about the tragic situation which, according to the Under-Secretary General responsible for humanitarian affairs at the UN, is threatening one million people in Afghanistan with famine. I also asked you about this during the previous debate in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">May I ask you what the current situation is with regard to the aid that the European Union can give to all the populations under threat, including those of the North and the more isolated populations? Do you not think that parachuting food into these areas could and should be considered?</p>

It now appears from the press reports, that in defiance of appeals from world leaders, the UN General Assembly and international organisations including the EU, the statues have indeed been destroyed.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community despite its unanimity on this issue has been helpless to intervene, other than through direct appeals to Mullah Omar to reconsider. He has been unwilling even to meet the representative of UNESCO, who travelled to Kandahar to see him. The EU Troika has also sought a meeting from Islamabad without success. The Taliban faction is isolated by UN sanctions and has been consistently informed by the international community that military victory will not bring diplomatic recognition for the Taliban organisation in Afghanistan. Only a peace settlement involving all the parties to the current conflict can be the basis for lasting solutions to the tragedy of Afghanistan and its people.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly acts of cultural vandalism of the kind that appeared to have been carried out in Bamiyan this week are no encouragement to the international community to engage in dialogue with this group. Meanwhile human tragedy in Afghanistan continues, thanks to the effects of the worst drought in the country in 30 years and of course the ongoing conflict which has continued throughout the winter. It is now estimated that there are at least half a million displaced persons inside Afghanistan. In recent months, 170 000 have left Afghanistan for refugee camps in Pakistan and there are estimates that 1 000 people a day are crossing the borders from Afghanistan to Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">On the ground, the Commission, through ECHO and through its budget to aid for uprooted people, continues to provide humanitarian assistance via UN agencies and NGOs both inside Afghanistan and in Iran and Pakistan, including for demining. This totalled more than EUR 400 million over the past ten years. ECHO has already committed EUR 2.5 million for assistance to IDPs in Afghanistan and refugees in Pakistan this year. Further support for drought and conflict affected areas is planned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
