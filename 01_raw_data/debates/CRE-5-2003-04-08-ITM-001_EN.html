<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sørensen (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, although the Court of Auditors’ criticism of the Commission’s internal control and monitoring systems is fierce and direct, it is my opinion that we must recommend to Parliament that the Commission be granted discharge in respect of the implementation of the sixth, seventh and eighth Development Funds for 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">In my report, I have focused on certain key basic concepts in current development policy and attempted to investigate whether these basic concepts place special requirements on, or raise particular issues in connection with, checks on the use of the funds. In this connection, I would like to emphasise various points:</p>
<p class="contents">Ownership: ownership is of great importance if we are to manage development aid effectively. The point is that legitimate requirements of donors, a policy of relief of poverty, environmental aspects, etc. may conflict with national and local priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Budgetary support: budgetary support is another concept that caught my attention during my work on the report. As far as I can see, in principle there is no reason – certainly not from a control point of view – to avoid budgetary support. However, the Commission must carefully ensure that in future there is clarity concerning when and under what conditions budgetary support is an effective form of aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Decentralisation: the much discussed decentralisation that the Commission has implemented is based on more decisions being made on the spot rather than here and in Brussels. I support this principle, but the Commission must ensure that the current problems with the audit arrangements at headquarters are not simply exported to the delegations.</p>
<p class="contents">Underutilisation: the implementation of payments from the funds quite simply takes place too slowly. Can it be right that, for 2001, there was a total amount of approximately EUR 8 500 million outstanding for obligations and projects that had yet to be implemented? Moreover, I find it alarming that the three funds effective for the 2001 financial year have been in the process of implementation for 16, 11 and 4 years respectively. I also find it incomprehensible and bureaucratic that, in administrative terms, implementation must take place via three funds at the same time. I expect the Commission to present a realistic plan soon for increasing the speed of implementation and for simplifying administration of the funds.</p>
<p class="contents">The declaration by the director-generals: in order for any significance to be attached to this document, I expect next year’s declaration to state clearly what ‘a reasonable assurance’ means. A limit must be placed on the number of reservations that can be made and on when these reservations have consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community’s external links are currently divided between no less than six different services. This fact was supposed to have been evaluated in 2002, but we have not yet seen any results of these evaluations. We are still waiting.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of its financial audit, the Court of Auditors’ sharply criticises the Commission’s internal control structure and monitoring mechanisms. This is regrettable, even a matter for criticism, since it means we cannot assess whether we are getting value for money.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to the budget: it is now up to the Commission to establish specific action plans and time scales for at long last bringing the development funds into the general budget. It is entirely unacceptable that tax-payers’ money is not being used as effectively as it could be, and this is due not to the Commission – which is so often blamed – but to the governments in certain Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">My report on the development funds is only part of the overall discharge procedure. The discharge procedure is an opportunity for Parliament to test the Commission’s ability to administer the EU’s tax money. In this connection, I am surprised that the rate of reform in the Commission seems to be declining in certain areas. In view of many of the figures that we are discussing, it is essential that we have a reliable accounting system. That is not the case at present. The current Commission replaced the Santer Commission, which had got bogged down. We may ask whether the same thing is in the process of happening to this Commission. In the areas that I have been working on, it had the opportunity and time, as well as the ability, to reform the administration of the EU. A lot remains to be desired, and I must say that Mr Prodi’s wish for five more years as President of the Commission represents excessive optimism. If the goods had been delivered, if the reforms had been implemented, and if the will and ability to get rid of old, poor administrative practices had been demonstrated, there would be reason to wish him every success, but that does not appear to be the case at present.</p>

<p class="contents">We have before us a combination of problems and recommendations that constitute a genuine work programme, which, although not perfect, will enable both the Commission and us to make significant progress towards improving budgetary implementation. I therefore wish to focus more on the work that awaits us than on repeating what has happened in the past. Our first priority is the modernisation and upgrade of the Community accounting system; this modernisation must apply to the medium and long-term objectives and in relation to the crucial and immediate correction of its worst anachronisms. Following the measures that have already been adopted on the security and inviolability of data, we must put an end to the various and contradictory accounting practices which, as the director-general for the budget acknowledged in his last annual report, call into question the synchronisation and coherence of accounting data, replacing them with a single system that is comprehensible, reliable and transparent and which can be consulted, accessed, understood and used by all actors involved in the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">What is particularly important is to bring a rapid end to the mechanisms that allow 20% of appropriations recovered from irregularities in the EAGGF-Guarantee to disappear, leaving no trace or record in the Community’s books, in sums and for purposes of which the Commission is unaware and much less controls. Then we have the problem which runs deeper and is more difficult to correct; that of systematic budgetary under-implementation, which in 2001 stood at more than EUR 15 billion, a colossal sum, which on its own exceeds the entire budget of several of the current Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to reaffirm that the logic of irresponsibility that in this field frequently haunts the Community institutions and which always finds someone else to blame, must end. It is up to the Commission to propose the regulatory framework in which to develop programmes for budgetary implementation; it is up to the Commission to make budgetary proposals both on an annual basis and in accordance with the financial perspective; it is therefore up to the Commission to ensure that budgetary programmes are feasible and realistic. If the legislative and budgetary authority wishes to submit to the Commission proposals that it considers unfeasible, the Commission simply has to enforce its right of initiative and refuse to enshrine the proposal in law. For most Community appropriations there are powers of codecision with structures of a national, regional or other nature. If, however, there are problems of implementation on the part of the management partners, the Commission must make these known in a transparent way and in good time, enabling the due corrective measures to be taken. What is unacceptable is that, given deeply mediocre budgetary implementations that involve almost all non-Community partners in programme management, the Commission continues to claim that this is not its responsibility and that there is nothing more it should be doing.</p>
<p class="contents">We have paid particular attention in this field to the programme of structural aid for agriculture in the countries applying for EU membership (the Sapard Programme). We are very pleased and note with optimism the guarantees given by Commissioner Fischler to the effect that he will attach the greatest priority to this programme’s implementation. We shall examine the results closely. We also feel that we must make the greatest efforts to raise the awareness of our colleagues in the inter-parliamentary delegations of the need to speed up this programme’s implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I wish to draw attention to the need for crucial measures to be adopted on the way in which the Commission deals with companies with which it has contractual relations. It is deeply regrettable that the Commission is not even able to detail the number of contracts with third parties through which it implements an extremely substantial part of its own budget and is therefore even less in a position to establish an appropriate ex-post mechanism to monitor not only the legality and regularity, but also the transparency and efficiency of these contracts. It is symptomatic that in relation to Eurostat, a body on which this Parliament focused its attentions in the recent report by Mr Bösch, it has already been concluded that an audit of such contracts signed in recent years cannot be completed within the deadline that has been set, because there are more than 2000 of these contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">What is known as ‘externalisation’, in other words, the management of Community services by bodies outside the Commission, is doubtless a policy that must not only be maintained but must in many cases also be developed. This externalisation, however, needs to be supervised more actively, more coherently and not in a way that merely goes through the motions. Approving this report will consequently be less a point of arrival and more a point of departure. I hope to be able, in this work, to continue to count on the cooperation that I have enjoyed to date from the Commission services, in particular from the directorates-general for the budget and for agriculture, which I wish publicly to thank. I also count on the cooperation of Cocobu as a whole.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Avilés Perea (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, I will refer to the report on the institutions, namely the Council, the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions and the European Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Council, for the first time this Parliament is granting discharge. Until now, it had not been denied, but there was a gentleman's agreement that Parliament would not give its opinion in relation to discharge. Now, it has been proposed that soon, when the Convention completes its work, the foreign and defence policy, which currently falls to the Council, should be included within the Commission; from now on, this issue will be subject to discharge, in the same way as for other institutions which depend exclusively on the Commission. Therefore, the Committee on Budgetary Control has considered it appropriate that this year the discharge of the Council be included, with the clarifications which I will summarise next.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee is pleased to note that cooperation in terms of responses and improvement during the next financial year are one of the Council's objectives, as well as overcoming the discrepancies between the physical inventory and the accounting inventory.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the same internal reform criteria should be applied in the Council as in the Commission in relation to staff policy, that is to say that the qualifications of personnel and their remaining in high-level, and therefore high-responsibility, positions within the Council, should obey the same criteria as the Commission, in terms of not remaining for long periods and professional classifications.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not currently have much knowledge with regard to foreign and defence policy. As I said before, until now the Council has been treated differently, and we believe it should be managed more effectively and more transparently.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Court of Justice, discharge is granted, also with some observations which I will point out in a moment.</p>
<p class="contents">We note that there have been considerable improvements in accounting management of real estate and in the presentation of the inventory as had been requested. We also note that all the real estate problems relating to the <span class="italic">Palais</span> and all the buildings in which the Court of Justice is based have been resolved. There were many gaps in relation to information on these processes, but they have now been resolved and we are very pleased about this.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also glad to see that cases dealt with have increased, but the Court still operates slowly, which leads us to believe that perhaps it lacks sufficient resources. We would like to know the exact situation and the requests of this institution, so that we can contribute to resolving the difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">Discharge is also granted to the Court of Auditors and we must express our pleasure at the public presentation of the report of that Court, which was presented in a timely manner, in November, to the European Parliament and to the press, which is a transparent and clear way to behave. We urge the Court of Auditors to maintain this policy. Although sometimes, as a result of translation difficulties, the moment can be delayed, the sooner this presentation is made the better. We are also pleased with the efforts it has made to make the declaration of reliability an instrument which provides information on improvements in management and control. We believe this effort should be maintained, because it is one of the best ways of gathering information on the situation the institutions are in. We also know that the Court of Auditors has staffing problems; its staff, which must be highly qualified, do not stay in their posts very long – perhaps for reasons of personal promotion or professional career – and we should consider how we can resolve these problems, so that this staff is more stable and in order to facilitate the work of the Court. We should also consider whether in certain cases it is appropriate to turn to temporary contracts or some type of externalisation. We also welcome the improvements relating to information on the work carried out by the Court of Auditors.</p>
<p class="contents">I will refer very briefly to the Economic and Social Committee, to which we are also granting discharge. All the past problems have been resolved, which we are very pleased about. This committee has presented its accounts and all its management in a clear manner, and, in contrast with the past, we have no difficulty in granting it discharge this year.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret to say that this has not been the case in relation to the Committee of the Regions, and that we cannot grant it discharge during this plenary session. We therefore request that it be delayed. With the time limit for reports to be carried out expired, after a series of items of information had been requested by means of a questionnaire – as for the other institutions – we have received an audit report relating to 2001 in which there are many serious deficiencies in all aspects relating to the payment and presentation of receipts, travelling, daily allowances and other types of emoluments. Therefore, despite the fact that the Committee of the Regions has delivered its modified Regulation with a later date, we believe it is more appropriate to postpone discharge until October and, meanwhile, to produce a report which gives us better and clearer knowledge of the accounts of the Committee of the Regions.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the European Ombudsman, I would like to say that he has cooperated magnificently with this Parliament's Committee on Petitions and has done good work, despite the scant resources at his disposal. Naturally, he will also receive our discharge.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Staes (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to express my sincere thanks for the excellent cooperation I have received, not only from my fellow Members, but especially from the Secretary-General and his services. I can inform you that we received a reply to our questionnaire even before Christmas, and that the replies to those questions have helped to make it possible for us to fully incorporate it into the resolution. I believe that it is one of the first times that this has been possible at such an early stage, and I express my sincere thanks for that.</p>
<p class="contents">I have regarded my report as a kind of annual report on the functioning of the European Parliament in 2001. It starts with the most important news. It recommends to you all that the Secretary-General be given discharge for the work he did in 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">My report has 120 sections. It is quite impossible, therefore, to explain everything, and so I should like to clarify just a few aspects, starting with staff policy. I should like to go into more detail on equal opportunities policy: on women's access to senior posts in this Parliament. Parliament has declared itself in favour of this many times, but it remains a difficult area. As I say in my report, together with the Committee on Budgetary Control, this objective has not in fact been achieved. Only 22% of the officials in the top category are women. Three of the Directors-General recently recruited are men, and, in 2001, only 14.3% of women were promoted in category A as compared with 30.8% of men. I believe, therefore, that we have to support positive-discrimination measures. Where there is equal merit, systematic preference must be given to women when filling management posts until a balance is achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Another difficult area is the appointment of senior officials. I recommend abandoning the accepted traditional practice of assembling geographically and politically balanced packages. I do not think that this is a good thing. We must go over to a policy of appointments based on the criteria of qualifications, merit and ability.</p>
<p class="contents">A second important chapter of my report concerns buildings policy. First of all, there is the fact that we have three places of work. In the previous discharge report, the Bureau and the Secretary-General were asked to publish a study on this. That study is now available, and it reveals that having three places of work costs EUR 169 million per year: EUR 120 million for the infrastructure, EUR 40 million for extra staff and missions and EUR 9 million for miscellaneous costs. The need for staff to travel to Strasbourg means that 25 855 days are lost. That costs the taxpayer almost EUR 4 million. Needless to say, this produces a particular image problem. Every time we receive groups of visitors, we have to explain it all over again. Not only does this give rise to an image problem, but also wastes time and money. This is beyond our control. Hence the recommendation to those MEPs who are active in the Convention to raise this there and ensure that the possibility of amending Article 289 of the EC Treaty is considered during the preparation of the draft Constitution. I know that this is still a significant problem, as a proposal of this kind still has to go to the Intergovernmental Conference, and indeed a number of Member States still have a veto. All the same, we owe it to ourselves to try.</p>
<p class="contents">Another aspect of buildings policy concerns the paved area that has been laid on top of Brussels-Luxembourg station. The Belgian Government has a number of obligations in this regard and should in fact bear the costs. The Belgian First Minister has been sent two letters, but has not replied. I therefore urge the Belgian Government to comply with its obligation forthwith and pay us that EUR 4.74 million.</p>
<p class="contents">I also devoted a few sections to the D4-D5 building. Mr President, you are the Vice-President responsible for buildings policy, and I say here in all frankness that I believe that you and the Administration have steered an excellent course. I think that you have done everything possible to execute this building project in accordance with the proper rules. I think, however and I say this in my report that a number of things have gone wrong, not on Parliament's side, but on the Belgian side. We were presented with a fait accompli against our will. The fact that the Belgian Government at one stage agreed that the land was free of charge, but that this nevertheless ended up in the hands of a private developer, has added to the difficulty of our task, and that is something I regret.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I wish to say a few more words about environmental policy. This is an important element. I describe the many good measures you have taken with regard to the D4-D5 building. Significant efforts have been made to see to it that renewable energy will soon be utilised, that provision is made for solar panels and suchlike. I think that we should work towards a genuine climate policy plan for our institution, so that we, the European Parliament, can also make a contribution to meeting the Kyoto standards.</p>
<p class="contents">As recently as Friday of last week, the Commission presented a study stating that, if all the government buildings in the European Union used renewable energy, this would already mean 18% compliance with the Kyoto standard that Europe has to achieve. Let us set an example, let our Parliament take this step, too, and ensure a real climate policy plan for the European Parliament.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Blak (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, firstly I would like to say a few words concerning the discharge of the Commission. I would like to recommend that discharge be granted on time this year. We all know that there are problems with the Commission’s accounting and computer systems. We know that from the Court of Auditors’ reports. It is no secret that the Commission should have done something about the problem long ago. I believe that the Commission has now grasped the seriousness of the situation and that a very extensive reform has been started. Postponing discharge until October would not change anything. It would be much more efficient to appoint external experts to assess the proposed reform and for Parliament to keep holding the Commission to its timetable.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should also be granted discharge on time due to its admissions in the Eurostat case. Eurostat is a scandal and has been so for years. Eurostat has entered into contracts with companies that have pulled the wool over its eyes and defrauded it. This has now become clear to the Commission and, following pressure from Parliament, it has now terminated all contracts with the firms. I think we should reward it for that. It is very rare for an institution such as the Commission to admit to a mistake, but it has done so in this case. It will now at last send a signal to other companies that they cannot get away with defrauding the EU in contracts with its institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Eurostat case would never have seen the light of day had it not been for a Eurostat employee. I would like to highlight the role of Dorte Schmidt-Brown and her incredible professional and personal integrity. I hope that the Commission will find a solution that will grant her compensation. It would send a signal to other employees of the Commission that the Commission is serious when it says that swindling and fraud will not be tolerated.</p>
<p class="contents">I have recommended that discharge be granted to three agencies: the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, the European Agency for Reconstruction and Cedefop. The remaining agencies must wait. It was only recently that a final decision was made to grant discharge to a further five agencies. We need time to look at them properly before granting discharge. Consequently, what I am recommending is a proposal for postponement on technical grounds.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some problems that are general to all the agencies. Basically, I believe that the Commission should apply the brakes and carry out a cost/benefit analysis of all types of agencies and the interaction between them. An agency may perhaps have been established that later proves to have completed its role. Perhaps there is need to merge some of the agencies. We must constantly evaluate whether an agency provides any added value. We must not have agencies just so that all the Member States can have their ‘baby’. Many of the agencies have very large administrations. That is not necessarily their own fault. Administrative burdens are often imposed on the agencies that are better suited to a big administration such as the Commission. Various solutions may therefore be considered. More tasks could be transferred to the agencies. We could consider transferring some tasks that are currently carried out by the Commission, e.g. within education and health. We must avoid overlaps between the work of the Commission and the work of the agencies. We should carefully consider whether there is a need to establish any more implementing agencies. Could the tasks not equally well be given to the agencies that we already have?</p>
<p class="contents">The agencies must now also implement the new Financial Regulation, and that has already happened at the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia in Vienna. Among other things, this means that the agencies are now to be responsible for their own financial control. There will no longer be an independent <span class="italic">ex ante</span> control of the agencies. We accepted this as part of the new Financial Regulation. I am concerned, however, that there is a risk of a gap in control arising. The Internal Audit Service of the Commission simply does not have the resources to look at the individual transactions. The Court of Auditors carries out very few control checks. We are therefore very dependent on the internal control system in the agency functioning properly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Agency for Reconstruction has generally acquitted itself well, but unfortunately there has been a very serious case of fraud within the energy sector. No employee of the agency was involved in the fraud. Ultimately, however, the agency is responsible for control of the EU funds spent. I have called upon the Commission to propose phasing out future EU funding of the energy sector in Kosovo if the present situation continues. It is extremely regrettable that the agency has entered into a number of private employment agreements outside the rules on inviting tenders. It is, however, the Commission which forced the agencies to sign the contracts. It is not unlawful to conclude direct contracts, but it must be restricted to special cases and must take place entirely openly. There are two examples that I could give but which I will not mention here to avoid embarrassing people. These rules were not observed in several of the contracts signed in 2001, and I would say to the Commissioner that this must not happen again or there will be problems. We must ensure that the agencies observe the rules on tendering. I am well aware that the rules can be highly bureaucratic and difficult. That is something that we must look at, but, whilst we have the rules, they must be observed.</p>

In the Committee on Budgetary Control it is our task to examine and evaluate the Commission’s accounts every year, and in this, the European Court of Auditors’ annual report gives us valuable guidance. We have also found points of criticism regarding the 2001 discharge and have formulated them in clear terms. I will leave the details, though, to those of my colleagues who have dealt with the institutions concerned in their reports.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to talk about something about which, for the most part, we can be pleased. As rapporteur for the budget of the European Coal and Steel Community I have few reservations about recommending discharge. We have here – and I almost regret that, in accordance with the Treaty, the ECSC expired last July after 50 years – an example of how it is perfectly possible to present a balanced and correct budget. When, only five years after the end of the war, France’s then Foreign Minister Robert Schuman suggested combining the coal and steel industries of France, Germany, Italy and the Benelux countries, he was both showing vision and taking a risk. With the major objective of a peaceful Europe in view, the ECSC was the first step towards a community of the states of Europe. Fifty years on, we can say it was a successful experiment, and, today in particular, I would like to draw attention to that peace-preserving plan, to understanding between nations.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from the industrial policy aspect, the ECSC also had from the outset a strong social side that should not be underestimated. Hundreds of thousands of coal and steel workers benefited from adjustment aids to cope with structural change. I would also like to mention the significant research aspect, for example to encourage innovative production techniques or develop environmentally friendly solutions. The gains have been estimated to be worth ten times the money invested, and that is good to hear.</p>
<p class="contents">Following my in-depth research, let me put it like this: without the ECSC success story, we can be sure that some things in Europe would have gone differently and far less well. In my report I have reviewed the measures required to accompany the expiry of the ECSC’s activities. I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the exemplary cooperation given by both the Court of Auditors and the Commission and their active willingness to provide the information requested.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention a few points which in my view nevertheless need to be addressed. Firstly, there should be a publication, a real publication worthy of the name, describing the work undertaken by the ECSC and its success story. Why should we not recognise successes when they occur and record them in writing for future generations? Secondly, the Commission must keep us informed about the redeployment of personnel – these people possess invaluable expertise, and we should not give it away or hide it. We also need detailed information, of course, about outstanding commitments, even after the ECSC Treaty has expired – some of which extend to the year 2027, with contributions for loans to officials, and, up to the year 2017, a commitment for Eurotunnel – and we need information about the cancellation of all amounts from the reserve, which clearly will no longer be needed in future. These are what is known as ‘dormant resources’.</p>
<p class="contents">The ECSC – I am repeating myself – was a model for peace and progress in Europe. Even after it has expired, its spirit must live on. I am glad that, even after the ECSC has been wound up, there will be a research fund making an important contribution in the coal and steel sector, in which the candidate countries will also take part, and willingly so. I promise you, however, that we on the Committee on Budgetary Control will still be keeping our eyes open in this area in the future.</p>

Parliament exercises control over this on behalf of the citizens of the Union. In the year 2001, EUR 79 400 million were spent from that budget. In addition, there was expenditure from the European Development Fund and the Coal and Steel Community.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like at this point to thank the general rapporteur, Mr Casaca, for his very thorough and intensive work. On behalf of the Commission I would also like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Staes, Mrs Avilés Perea, Mr Blak, Mr Sørensen and Mrs Langenhagen, for their thorough and conscientious work and I would also like to say how much I respect the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mrs Theato, for the way in which she directed this difficult process, and to thank all the members of the Committee on Budgets for their intensive work.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the several hundred pages of financial statements, the rapporteurs and the committee also had to work through the annual report of the Court of Auditors and hundreds of pages of replies to the 267 questions that were put to the Commission, and the committee held hearings with eight members of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The European budget covers a broad spectrum of expenditure programmes, from the marketing subsidy for dairy products to slaughtering premiums for cattle, bee-keeping subsidies, restructuring measures in the fisheries sector, youth exchange programmes and support for research in biotechnology, not to mention aid to provide schooling for girls in Afghanistan or food aid in Southern Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">All these programmes have different rules. Different players administer the programmes and handle the money, and the attendant risks of error also differ. The scrutiny performed by the Court of Auditors and Parliament took the whole range of these varied tasks into account. I must concentrate here, however, on a few points that proved the most important in the discharge process, namely the accounting rules and the book-keeping system, the contracts with the Statistical Office and the question of the rate of implementation of the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as the accounts are concerned, the Court of Auditors has found that the 2001 revenue and expenditure account gives a true and fair view of the income and expenditure, and this is confirmed in Mr Casaca’s report. He has again called for reforms to the balance sheet. Mr Casaca’s report goes into the forthcoming reform in detail. In the Committee on Budgetary Control we had an opportunity to discuss the proposed reform and the specific steps involved in great detail. It is a project covering all services and all bodies. In some points our accounting is already exemplary, so far as publication is concerned, namely in that we publish the figures for the cash-based revenue and expenditure account monthly on the Internet. I mention this because the Commission’s proposal to oblige public limited companies to publish quarterly reports provoked lively debate as to whether that was reasonable. The Commission itself publishes its housekeeping figures monthly.</p>
<p class="contents">Compared with the Member States, when we look at some aspects of the balance sheet, too, we have nothing to be ashamed of. But is that enough? No, it is not. It must be clear from the accounting system whether a payment is a final payment or an advance payment that can be called back in if a programme does not go well. The accounting system must have an entry on both the assets and the liabilities sides as soon as a commitment is entered into, for example, and not wait until the payment has actually been made. Our accounting must be on an accrual basis. And the services that administer the resources must have direct access to the account status for their programmes. That is the only way to have very good financial management. It does of course present a challenge to the underlying information and technology system.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will of course gladly comply with the Committee on Budgetary Control’s request for a quarterly progress report on reform. We have also agreed to follow the suggestion of the rapporteur, Mr Casaca, of starting a pilot scheme where recipients of payments are informed in writing as soon as the payment has been requested by the authorising officer; this, too, will make for greater transparency. But it must be borne in mind that only 20% of the Budget is managed by the Commission and that in cash terms most of the Budget remains, in practice, in the Member States’ treasuries.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Court of Auditors examines the Commission’s cash management on an annual basis. We will nevertheless put before the Court of Auditors Parliament’s call for a specific external audit. We will also base the reform on the standards set in 2000 and 2001 by the International Federation of Accountants. But I would at this point also like to make one fundamental observation. In Old Europe – if I may put it that way – it has up until now been the case, for the European Union too, that the principal rules of accountancy were and are laid down by public law and not simply by the standards of an association of that kind. The fundamental question arises as to whether we want to depart from this practice. In my opinion, we should retain the practice that the public legislator has a part in deciding what principles must be applied for the accounts of the public budget.</p>
<p class="contents">We do, of course, also have the great advantage of having an independent public authority, the European Court of Auditors, as our external auditor. At a time when, in the USA for example, the public audit authority is being strengthened as compared to private auditors as a result of scandals such as the one surrounding Enron, it is clearly an advantage to have a public auditor who is obliged to remain independent.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to the questions from your general rapporteur about contracts with Eurogramme, the Commission has agreed to suspend all payments to Eurogramme for the time being and to review all contracts concluded with it. Contracts will be terminated wherever this does not entail additional costs. You are now urging the Commission to review all contracts concluded by the Statistical Office since 1999 by July this year as well. That is 2 660 contracts. It cannot be done by July. But because we want to answer Parliament’s concern, we will have to find a feasible solution here, for example on the basis of a sample. The Commission will present the Committee on Budgetary Control with a list of these contacts at a forthcoming meeting and suggest how we may take scrutiny further.</p>
<p class="contents">The events surrounding Eurogramme or Eurostat have also shown that cooperation with OLAF in information matters needs to be placed on a less ambiguous footing. OLAF is and remains master of the information from its own investigations, and, whilst OLAF’s independence must of course be safeguarded in everything it does, it has become clear that we must at the same time ensure that OLAF’s findings are promptly made available to the authorities that manage resources, so that measures to protect the Budget against fraud can also be taken in good time.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as the implementation of budget resources is concerned, I simply want to say a brief word here about the Sapard programme. Regarding the Sapard programme, the Commission has promised the Committee on Budgetary Control and Parliament that top priority would be given to improving the programme’s execution. My colleague Mr Fischler has already implemented some of the measures promised to the Committee on Budgets. On the very day before this House gives its assent to the enlargement treaties, every effort is required to make pre-accession aid at last effective for agriculture on the spot.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you very much, Mrs Langenhagen, for your very positive report and your very positive remarks about the ECSC. You now have the report you reminded us about concerning lending activity, but it will probably not be possible to produce the publication you suggest about the ECSC’s activities since its formation in 1952 in all official languages by the end of this year because some of the posts have already gone to other services. But I fully agree with you that this experience and information about this important part of the history of the common European path should be available in all countries and people should be able to see how the idea of economic cooperation led to a genuine project for peace. We should indeed not allow this to be forgotten and we will see how we can take up this idea and find a feasible way of doing it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Blak, scrutiny of the agencies now covers a very broad spectrum of different activities, and your work, for which the Commission thanks you, was therefore very wide ranging. The new Financial Regulation stipulates that the creation of a new agency must be preceded by a cost-benefit analysis and I welcome the fact that Parliament wants to see this principle strictly applied, and with regard to existing agencies an audit in the course of evaluation for the cost infidelity analysis continues to be the best form, also of course being designed to avoid duplication. That is of course something of great importance when it comes to the use of scarce budget resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the external policy area of the Agency for Reconstruction, the Commission does not agree that there are sufficient grounds for an administrative investigation. But we will of course examine the things you mention and report back to you. In external policy over all, the Commission has complied with Parliament’s request to stop outsourcing tasks to the Technical Assistance Offices. The number of TAOs has been reduced from 126 in September 2000 to 12 at the end of 2002. This shows that here, we have taken the path that Parliament wanted. This has gone hand in hand with an appreciable change in the administration of ancillary aid programmes, namely deconcentration. This is also true of the European Development Fund, for which Mr Sørensen is rapporteur, and here, too, my esteem for your thorough report.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgetary Control lays particular emphasis on the need for members of delegations to be adequately trained to perform the management tasks they are now required to undertake. The Commission produced a new manual for this in 2002 and the new Common Relex Information System for the financial management of external programmes, with the nice abbreviation CRIS, has now been introduced. Every delegation now has to submit an audit plan, which is intended to ensure adequate supervision of aid programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">In its White Paper on reform produced in the year 2000, the Commission made a list of all the measures necessary for the complete reform of the Commission. Eighty-seven of the 96 measures have already been taken, and the Commission has reported on them in detail. A guiding principle of this reform is the clear allocation of responsibility for the use of Community finance.</p>
<p class="contents">The Directors General now have to give an annual account of how the control standards have been applied. What public administration requires its institutions to publish such reports, in which the weaknesses also have to be described? What administration then checks, in full view of the public, whether the necessary measures have been taken to improve financial management? I believe transparency itself is a key element of the reform. The new Financial Regulation has been in force since 1 January 2003. This far-reaching reform is the fruit of the intensive work undertaken jointly by Commission and Parliament in 2001 and 2002, and I would also like to mention the Council at this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Reform of the accounting system is in full swing and must be completed by the end of 2004. This Commission will leave behind a service that is comprehensively and radically reformed and ready for the new challenges of enlargement. The Committee on Budgetary Control and this House have always supported and encouraged the Commission in this and with this discharge process Parliament has given renewed, and greater, impetus for reform.</p>

I would quite particularly like to thank Mr Casaca for his close cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">You are right, Commissioner, that deconcentration or decentralisation and the strengthening of delegations have set in train a great process of reform in external policy expenditure. This decentralisation has been a complete success, as I have seen for myself in various places. I would, however, like to raise three problems and, in a way as a kind of peaceful preventive strategy, point out that we shall be paying quite particular attention to them.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is Palestine. Criticisms are sometimes voiced here, which up until now have proved unfounded, and it is good that Parliament has set up a working party to look into these things. Because if, as I am, we are absolutely in favour of aid to Palestine, we need to be convinced that everything is being handled correctly. The new Finance Minister and the new Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority are a good sign, but we will be watching things very closely.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is the KEDO programme. It is of course a difficult programme, especially in times like these, but it is a very important one. We have received a reply from the Commission for 2001, which we have noted, but with which we are of course not satisfied, and this means that we will be looking in particular at 2002 and subsequent years more closely to see whether it is ensured that our money really is being used for peaceful purposes. That is quite crucial with regard to developments in Korea and North Korea.</p>
<p class="contents">The third programme is pre-accession aid. Although you mentioned Sapard in particular, I think there are shortcomings with the other programmes too. In view of the fact that Bulgaria and Romania will still remain even after the other countries have acceded, and that there will in all probability also be Turkey and a few Balkan countries, Croatia for example, we cannot be satisfied with amending Sapard alone. We must structure these pre-accession aids and make them more flexible, if we are to make a success of this. Nevertheless, we consent to the discharge for 2001, giving notice, however, that we will be following these three matters in particular very closely in the months ahead.</p>

<p class="contents">2001 was anything but a good year for the Structural Funds. It shows, with no ifs and buts, that the main objectives of the 1999 Structural Funds reform were not achieved. Firstly, as with the previous reform, this time, too, there were quite considerable delays in moving from the old to the new programming period. Secondly, the authorisation and administration procedures have not been simplified as originally planned. Thirdly, the approach of decentralising day-to-day administration of funds while at the same time strengthening controls has failed. The situation is indeed alarming.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States are far from having used all the money available to them. That is true both for the period from 1994 to 1999 and for the new Structural Fund period. In 2001, for example, only half the money originally envisaged by the Member States was called. We all know what that means. That is why the next Structural Fund reform, which will then cover not 15 but 25 states, will have to return to the principles that we actually wanted to implement with the last reform.</p>
<p class="contents">These are first of all concentration on a few clear priorities, secondly simplification of resource administration, and thirdly a more performance-related approach to the distribution of funds, something I have called for repeatedly but in vain. The fourth demand would then have to be to avoid abrupt changeovers between programming periods in future.</p>
<p class="contents">I come now to the European Social Fund itself. Let me please make it absolutely clear that we on the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs are very concerned about the sometimes very serious cases of mismanagement in the use of money from the Social Fund by the Member States and that we fully support the Commission here, Commissioner, in all its investigations and controls. Sometimes we really do get the feeling that some Member States really do not want to make the effort to improve things.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur for the last Social Fund reform, I was really very deeply concerned to read what the Court of Auditors has now written in its special report on the use of ‘social risk capital’, an instrument that this House pushed through especially in order to oblige the Member States to make a suitable amount of funding available as ‘grants’ to non-governmental organisations and local partnerships. The Court of Auditors notes that the Member States have made hardly any use of the instrument. In two cases, Germany and Austria, it was not used at all. I really cannot understand this.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I have to ask the Commission why it did not inform us of this intolerable state of affairs earlier. The fact is that some Member States are clearly in breach of the Social Fund Regulation. I therefore call on the Commission and the Member States to find, without delay, a solution acceptable to all sides.</p>
<p class="contents">This afternoon the Commission will be presenting us its proposal for the employment guidelines. We will then for the first time have employment guidelines for three years. That will at last give us an opportunity to make the European Social Fund – the only labour market policy instrument we have at European level – a genuine part of employment strategy because then we will no longer have different periods of validity. We now have for the first time the opportunity to coherently dovetail employment strategy and Social Fund measures in order to reduce unemployment and …</p>

On the one hand, we are pleased with the efforts made by the Commission during 2001 to integrate the aspect of equal opportunities between men and women into the Union’s policies and particularly into new fields such as international trade, public contracts, asylum policy and the environment. This is a good way of working to achieve the objective of equal opportunities which, as you all know, is included in the Treaty as one of the objectives to be fulfilled in all Community activities.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I must point out, as other Members have done, the problems which have arisen in the management of the Structural Funds. I have been responsible for an initiative report on compliance with the objective of equality in the Structural Funds, since it is a very important programme which is unfortunately not being implemented adequately and which leaves out such important criteria as this equal opportunities criterion. We hope that in the future more initiatives will be adopted and the procedures will be simplified, so that these Funds are used appropriately in order to achieve this objective.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe it unacceptable that, although the European Social Fund has the established objective of 15% of total costs for the promotion of the employment of women, only 6% has been used for this purpose. Therefore, although 15% is not a particularly high percentage, we believe that the fact that not even half has been reached must be corrected in the future, since employment is always one of the most important instruments for the integration of men and women and for equality.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also pleased with the implementation of the Daphne programme, which ended at the end of 2002 and whose new phase is now underway. We have expressed a series of considerations on the extension of the Daphne programme, which will be taken into account in the Commission’s report and in the new phase of this programme, which is so important in the fight against violence against women and which has brought such good results, on which I congratulate the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we would like clear efforts to be made within the financial management of the Commission to channel a proportion of the budget for Community programmes towards equal opportunities between men and women. We hope that this will be taken into account during the next budgetary year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Theato (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you have heard the news. The Committee on Budgetary Control proposes discharge for the 2001 Budget in respect of all institutions except the Committee on the Regions, which still has until the autumn to finish its homework, that is, it must clear up the contradictions in travel and subsistence payments and other points and undergo a comprehensive audit. It is also proposed postponing discharge for five agencies that receive money from the EU Budget until their constituent acts are brought into line with the new Financial Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me begin, however, by thanking all the rapporteurs for their conscientious and responsible work and the members of the committees for their constructive cooperation and in particular the committee secretariat for its excellent support. We have broken new ground with the discharge procedure for 2001 because rules have come into force that are not always clear and may lead to difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">The first question concerns the vote during the April meeting. The Committee on Budgetary Control has two options: first, to propose the discharge be granted or, second, to propose the discharge be postponed. If, in the second case, the plenary were to reject the proposal, discharge would be considered granted. That is an implicit vote of approval, which in my opinion does no justice to the weight of the discharge. What would then remain of an original stringent decision that would have to be watered down by being adjusted to such an indirect discharge decision? Are the accounts in that case still correct, now that, in contrast with the former case, we have to provide accounts for every discharge report, something which seems questionable?</p>
<p class="contents">All the discharges must nevertheless be published in the Official Journal. Yesterday evening the Committee on Budgetary Control had to comply with another new rule. All the amendments tabled for the plenary had to be examined. How that is supposed to be done is nowhere explained. We therefore proceeded pragmatically and noted the Committee’s previous vote in the case of motions that were retabled, taking a vote on new motions, of which there were only a few. One thing is quite clear – the plenary and the groups are the masters of events. Our committee can make proposals but not set parameters. I think this new rule complicates the discharge procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Without the innovations referred to, I might have voted for a postponement in the Casaca report, because the rapporteur has listed the Commission’s failings clearly and in detail and the other rapporteurs have also commented on them. This concerns the book-keeping and accounting system in particular, where staff decisions were dubious and where reforms were tackled too late and half-heartedly despite repeated reminders from the Court of Auditors.</p>
<p class="contents">If I am voting for discharge despite all that, it is because I did not want to risk the scenario I described at the beginning. The Commission must not take this as carte blanche, but it must follow up our demands thoroughly, speedily and above all transparently. There is not much time until the next discharge, which we start on in November. We are looking for positive results by then, or all our complaints will be repeated with stricter conditions attached. The points are mentioned here: proceedings in respect of Eurostat are still not completed, although steps have been initiated, and the committee’s demand is that all the options for presenting the accounts and their reform should be examined by outside experts. They must then be discussed in a hearing. A motion to this effect will be presented again today in extended form. I ask you to vote in favour.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me thank, once again, all who have been involved in this big piece of work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

People in this House clearly have different yardsticks for the discharge procedure and different political uses for it. Our yardstick is that wherever clear commitments have been given to remedy acknowledged shortcomings, and where there has been no serious misconduct, discharge will be given. So far as I am aware, it is also true that in order to get those commitments the rapporteurs have made a great number of offers that could not be refused. I think that is a sensible way of proceeding.</p>
<p class="contents">For us there are therefore always two options when we enter a discharge procedure. In the language of the Rules of Procedure both the option of postponing discharge and the option of granting discharge. But I think we also have to make clear that our experience after four years is that parts of this House – and I mean by that the self-appointed Euro-sceptics – have always tried to reduce the discharge process to one option, namely to collect as many votes as possible to take a shot at the Commission in the hope that perhaps one day it will fall over. I do not think that is what we understand by ‘taking into account’. There are always both options and not just one.</p>
<p class="contents">Take the example of the accounting system. We have always started from the assumption that the Court of Auditors has found there to be deficiencies that have to be made good. We have called for further evidence for claims that go further than that, claims that are spread with particular ‘<span class="italic">verve</span>’ in one country or another in publications which, surprisingly for me, they still call newspapers, but such evidence has never been produced. It is important to note that.</p>
<p class="contents">As general rapporteur, Mr Casaca set clear conditions. These were broadly agreed with the representatives of the various groups and were accepted by the Commission. We were very pleased to hear that again from Mrs Schreyer today and we are therefore in favour of discharge.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen that systematic attempts were made in 2002 to link a staff dispute that arose in the Commission with the smell of a cover-up of possible fraud in the accounting system. On its own, that staff dispute would not have created much of a stir in the press. But I say once again: the attempt to link it failed. No evidence was ever produced for such a link and in the end there was only the staff dispute. But a staff dispute is no reason for refusing discharge in a system where such discharge procedures exist.</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, the more hysterical the attempt to make more of the staff dispute became, the clearer it became even to some journalists that there was nothing more to the story. Members of this House in particular then noticed that when, a week before the vote in committee, a newspaper suddenly describes as brand new a document that was distributed here in the House months before, basically an attempt is being made to orchestrate them. At this point we can in my opinion say that we were right not to do that and we have shown that the self-appointed Euro-sceptics can be reduced to their hard core if they put their real agenda to the vote.</p>

What is remarkable about this debate is that, on the eve of next year's European elections, we once more have a Commission which has not received a positive Statement of Assurance from the European Court of Auditors. Nevertheless, my group will align itself with those who wish to grant discharge.</p>
<p class="contents">What are our reasons for doing this in spite of that negative, or non-existent, Statement of Assurance? First of all, many reports by the Court of Auditors have revealed that there have been improvements in the administration of the Commission. Secondly, a Financial Regulation has been adopted. We believe that that Regulation must be given time and chance to take effect, and we are giving the Commission time to do that. Our third argument for granting discharge is that, if we do not do so at the present juncture, on the eve of enlargement, it will make an extremely bad impression on the new Member States: that is to say, that we are in effect packing the Commission off home. Nor could we do that. Our final argument for giving discharge is that we have found the attitude of the Commission towards this Parliament very positive in recent years. Requests for information have met with a satisfactory and timely response, and even the response to Parliament’s own-initiative reports has been positive. Consequently, we recommend discharge.</p>
<p class="contents">The crucial question for us remains: what does the Commission need to do in order to obtain a positive Statement of Assurance? The Court of Auditors does not say in its reports. Every year another surprise awaits as to what they have to say, and another whole list of things that are going wrong emerges. I think that it is good that the Commission is now entering into discussions with the Court of Auditors, and that it is then going to inform Parliament of the criteria and timetable it intends to keep to in order to obtain a positive Statement of Assurance.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say a little about agriculture. The most striking feature of current agricultural policy is that it is no longer based on price support, but rather on income support – the integrated administration and control system. The irritating thing is that this is applied differently in different European countries. That is unacceptable. In a united Europe, the systems should be the same. I would therefore draw the attention of the Commission once more to an own-initiative report – which it so happens was drawn up by me, but was approved by plenary session – in which we point out that, if the administration of agricultural expenditure in the new and existing Member States concerned is not in order, the Commission must suspend advance payments much more often until the system is in order, instead of carrying out controls after the event and imposing penal charges. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a former member of the Committee on Budgetary Control I myself am also guilty. I did not draw the right conclusions from the reports produced by the Court of Auditors regarding the flaws in the accounting system. I did not believe that the Commission’s accounts could be so very badly organised in a budget of almost EUR 100 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking back, we Members of Parliament received all the relevant information from the Court of Auditors, on the basis of which we should have reacted earlier to the weaknesses in the system. We were not equal to the task. We are responsible for the weakness in the monitoring procedures, the Commission itself for the weaknesses in the system.</p>
<p class="contents">The problems are not individual cases of malpractice, but are themselves inherent in the accounting system. The action taken by the Commission’s former chief accountant, Martha Andreasen, made it possible for the problems to be exposed. Just a while ago Mrs Andreasen told me that the Emperor has no clothes, that the Commission’s accounting system is rotten to the core, and that things must be swiftly put right. It is thanks to her that we can now speak about the real problems we used to turn a blind eye to. For her pains, Mrs Andreasen was dismissed from her job. That was an injustice. The Commission has made a mistake in protecting officials who should have been dismissed on the grounds of total professional incompetence with regard to accountancy skills. Instead, they dismissed Mrs Andreasen.</p>
<p class="contents">We politicians do not see problems if they are too close up or too big. We did not see the flaws in the Commission’s accounting system in time, but, as we can see them now, things have to be put right. We also have to restore Mrs Andreasen’s ruined reputation. We must not just rescue Social Democrat and Green Commissioners with European Parliament Social Democrat and Green votes.</p>
<p class="contents">As Members of the European Parliament we should feel ashamed of the role we have played. The report by the Committee on Budgetary Control lists numerous flaws, which give a gloomy picture of both the Commission’s accounting system and ourselves. If we had to be discharged from liability regarding our own actions I would vote against it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unlike Mr Seppänen, I believe this committee has done its work very thoroughly and that in the past, too, it has tried to uncover every problem in good time.</p>
<p class="contents">Even before Mrs Andreassen made the headlines, we on the committee had a hearing about the book-keeping system and we had discussions about it with the Commission’s Internal Audit Service and with the Court of Auditors.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to particularly stress that the various rapporteurs, especially Mr Casaca, have taken a lot of trouble to check all the details this year and have written a very critical report, one that does not shrink from naming the problems, but which also makes clear that the Commission is making efforts to solve them. For that reason, our group will also be supporting the discharge recommendation. Unlike some of the EU’s opponents, we do not believe that this discharge recommendation is a whitewash; it is based on a thorough examination and a critical assessment of the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also in favour of postponing discharge for the Committee on the Regions because it has still not satisfactorily resolved the repeated problems with expense accounts, to which a solution must at last be found. We are, though, particularly concerned about Sapard, which is a very important programme intended to prepare the candidate countries for future aid in the agricultural sector, and, sadly, only 9% of it was implemented in 2001. The tremendous cash flow difficulties with the Sapard programme are no accident. The programme was supposed to prepare agriculture and rural areas for accession, both through measures to modernise farms and rural industries and by creating the necessary infrastructure and providing adequate information about rural development.</p>
<p class="contents">It was also supposed to bring about the rural population’s active involvement in the design and planning of that development, which we in the Member States are already financing through the ‘second pillar’ and the Leader programme. Unfortunately, it did not work out like that. During accession negotiations, the Commission gave clear priority to implementation of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. It used Sapard as a sort of training programme for the candidate countries’ administrations and as a test balloon for implementation of the <span class="italic">acquis</span>. The administrative cost of the programme became enormous and delayed the accreditation of the agencies for far too long. In the case of Slovenia, for example, building the administration for Sapard has cost more money than is ever made available for the country itself.</p>
<p class="contents">So instead of making people in the rural areas of the candidate countries feel eager to get going and creating partnership between government and NGOs, expectations almost everywhere have been bitterly disappointed, and the negative experiences with Sapard have unfortunately benefited those agitating against EU accession.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has now announced that it will hold a conference about the future of Sapard and Leader in the new Member States this spring and possibly amend the Sapard Regulations. We think that is urgently necessary and we support it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by making one further point. I think the Commission has some courageous officials, by whom I definitely do not mean Mrs Andreassen, but courageous officials who put the question of Eurostat on the agenda and have sought to solve this problem through internal channels. I hope that Parliament and the Commission will in future appreciate, praise and support such courageous work more than the untruthful headlines of Europhobes, the untruthful headlines of Mrs Andreassen, who is allowing herself to be used primarily by opponents of the EU.</p>

These reports focus time and time again on the major problems that exist with the financial management of the considerable funds that tax-payers in the fifteen States pay to the EU. Some of the accounts are reasonably satisfactory, but unfortunately this applies mainly to the smaller or minor units, the Council, the Court of Justice, the Economic and Social Committee, the Ombudsman, Parliament and the Coal and Steel Community.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be said, however, that the situation remains entirely unsatisfactory in the large areas that fall within the Commission’s remit. In Mr Casaca’s outstanding report it is emphasised that, while the accounts as a whole are formally correct as far as the income, liabilities and administrative expenses are concerned, such a declaration still cannot be made in respect of all the other payments. It is also stated that, in the past six years, very little progress has been made towards complying with the Court of Auditors’ comments on the accounting system. It is stressed that, in connection with the closure of the accounts for 2001, the Commission infringed the Financial Regulation, and, on page after page, we read the very weighty observations that ought to make us adopt a very different position which goes much further than we are currently doing.</p>
<p class="contents">Far too much regular fraud and deception is still taking place, and, when it is revealed by an honest public servant – whether it be Dorte Schmidt-Brown or Marta Andreasen – the person in question is dismissed and often has their name dragged through the mud. The person in question is said to be ‘not right in the head’ and those responsible are promoted. Note that Budget Commissioner Mrs Schreyer did not today answer Mr Blak’s request for compensation for Dorte Schmidt-Brown. I would like to support Mr Blak’s remarks. Mrs Schreyer will have the opportunity to speak again and to respond to Mr Blak’s express request.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that there is a lack of will in Parliament to tackle the entirely unacceptable economic management that we are witnessing in respect of large parts of the EU’s funds. The EU was not created yesterday. The EU is not a union of unstable developing countries. The EU Member States overwhelmingly have national administrations that work far more responsibly and precisely than the EU. The reality, however, is that the EU’s administration is such that responsibility is an entirely undefined concept. The Commission clearly has no control over the director-generals and their public servants, and, regardless of the number of times that Parliament complains of faults and shortcomings, these are not corrected effectively. There always seems to be a mentality that this is not our own money and that the people concerned are not held accountable in the same way as national civil servants and politicians are held accountable for the budgets in the national states. The EU advertises itself in terms of greater democracy, greater transparency and an EU for the citizens, but the truth is that the EU is the opposite: the more EU, the less democracy, the less transparency, the less responsibility – but the citizens are too far away to find that out.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament is doing the EU a disservice by, year after year, turning a blind eye to the fact that the reforms requested by the group of wise men in 1999 have still not been implemented. A majority of Parliament would no doubt vote for all the budgets because they do not dare confront their citizens with the fact that the EU’s administration is not functioning well enough. The Commission can therefore take the criticism easily. Nothing happens, even if the reforms are postponed year after year. We are, however, sending the wrong signal by adopting all the accounts. We are ourselves being irresponsible if we tell our electorates that this is good enough – because it is emphatically not. It is on this basis that some of us wish to vote against the reports concerning the Commission, the development funds and the agencies, but we will vote for the reports that recommend postponement of discharge.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for the outstanding work done by themselves and their assistants on these reports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this context the reality is other people's money. It is taken from them on the grounds that Parliament feels it has the right to decide how it is spent.</p>
<p class="contents">People do not volunteer to pay tax and in the final analysis the money demanded is taken under the threat of force. If they do not pay, citizens can lose their possessions, their livelihoods, be made bankrupt and even go to jail. All of this imposes a special responsibility on us, a special trust, and we must ask ourselves whether we could look our constituents in the eye and say yes: all of this money has been spent and properly accounted for. Speaking for myself, I have to ask myself whether I personally could justify putting someone in prison because they have not paid their taxes that this Community has used. I cannot say in all honesty that I could and, frankly, that is the test.</p>
<p class="contents">On this basis I do not see how anyone could consent to the discharge of these accounts. The test has not been passed. We have not discharged our responsibility of trust to the citizens of our Member States in ensuring that the money has been properly spent. We have no right to grant discharge. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a shame that, at the end of this exercise, there are so few of us in the Chamber to discuss it.</p>
<p class="contents">It has caused rivers of ink to flow and, as happens every year – this year, I regret to say, with more marked ill will – it has brought discredit and even disgrace on a directorate-general and one man in particular, Jean-Paul Mingasson, whom everyone here knows and holds in high esteem. I am keen to pay public tribute to him for the injustice he has suffered, since all the accusations made against him and the Budget Directorate-General, with which we have cooperated loyally for years, have proved to be unfounded. Of course, there were a certain number of problems and difficulties, which we addressed in the context of this discharge, as we have done in all the others, but that should not have led to the newspapers printing often groundless accusations made by certain Members who do not appear to be present at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly keen to pay tribute to Paulo Casaca, María Antonia Avilés Perea, Bart Staes and the other rapporteurs for the significant work that they have carried out, which has, today, given us a balanced, comprehensive discharge, where we call, of course, on the Commission to settle a certain number of issues, in particular the delays. These delays are clearly in the nature of things – reform cannot happen overnight – but it was perhaps a little unwise to say, at the start of this term of office, that it would all happen extremely swiftly. It takes time. We can clearly see this with the reform of the Staff Regulations, and the reform of the accounting system, in particular. We saw it with the Financial Regulation, which gave rise to difficult negotiations although, I am glad to say, a successful conclusion was reached. I hope, Commissioner, that this reform will be completed before the current Commission gives way to the next, and I am asking you this in the very interest of the Prodi Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The reform of the accounting system, which has been criticised many times – sometimes rightly so, of course – is significant because this system is, in particular, the source of a very serious problem, that of the RALs, the outstanding commitments, which cause us major difficulties as an institution but also as a Union in relations with the outside world. This is why we called for a timetable or, at the very least, close monitoring which we will, I am sure, be capable of carrying out and the results of which you will be able to present to us regularly. I believe that this reform will enable you to speed things up. We have overcome a difficult hurdle.</p>
<p class="contents">We trust you also with this exercise. Carry it out effectively, since the work you have done over the past five years is at stake, as is the trust which we will place in you later, apart from a few minor negative criticisms, judging by the interventions made so far. In any event, the Italian Radicals will be voting in favour of granting discharge. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And I would therefore also like to congratulate the main rapporteur, Mr Casaca, as well as the other rapporteurs, Mr Blak, Mr Sørensen, Mr Staes and Mrs Langenhagen, who have done excellent work, each within the field corresponding to them.</p>
<p class="contents">I have personally been able to observe how we rapporteurs, who are obliged to carry out the discharge of the various fields, are subject to external pressure, are put under pressure from the political groups to work in a particular direction. We have to see past this pressure in order to do rigorous and objective work, and I believe the various rapporteurs have achieved this this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Very serious problems have arisen, particularly in Mr Casaca’s report with regard to accounting, the Sapard programme and Eurostat. The rapporteur has therefore had to make a special effort to ensure that solutions are found which, while granting discharge to the Commission, lead to effective solutions in the future. I believe this has required important work which Mr Casaca has done excellently and I would therefore insist that we must congratulate him on it.</p>
<p class="contents">The other rapporteurs have also suffered external pressures. During this year we have been subjected to pressure from the press with articles, sometimes true and sometimes manipulated, which have attempted to influence our work. Commissioner, I do not like this work to be influenced, I like to have my own criteria, to make my own studies, to analyse what is happening properly and I must therefore thank the Commission for having cooperated enormously in order to clarify all these issues, so that the opinion issued by Parliament is really its own.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the approach I have taken in my work and my group is therefore going to grant discharge to the Commission this year. In the various reports we have followed the same criterion because this work requires a high degree of responsibility from Parliament and must include a very rigorous analysis. We defend the interests of the European citizens but, above all, we must bear in mind the consequences of what is decided in this Parliament. Responsibility and rigour when it comes to carrying out the work must therefore be imposed. This is how I have worked, and I believe the other rapporteurs have done the same and therefore, although it has been a particularly complicated and difficult year – as all we members of the committee know – we have been lucky enough to have the leadership of our President, who has shown great responsibility at all times, and I believe that the final result will be satisfactory. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That period is of course still under way and we are therefore also justified in again giving the Commission a few laurels in advance.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are transferring thousands of millions of euros back to the Member States because we are not able to implement certain programmes, that does not mean we are being particularly frugal, but quite simply that we are failing to implement policies on which we have agreed. This is not, though, only about the Member States, Commissioner; if environmental protection organisations have their support status removed from one year to the next – more or less wilfully – that also has something to do with under-implementation of the European Budget. If project applicants have to wait years to get the money from the European taxpayer, that, too, has nothing to do with economy or good management.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you raised the issue of Eurostat. That is not about OLAF; OLAF is known to have informed the Commission. If, though, the Secretary-General of the Commission does not know where Mr Solbes Mira’s office is, that is a problem of the Commission’s internal reform. You will have to keep an eye on that in the next few years. OLAF is doing its work very well here. There have already been two cases reported to Luxembourg. We only have to insist that Luxembourg fulfils its obligations, follows up notifications involving the protection of European taxpayers and in the end brings charges.</p>
<p class="contents">There is PerryLux – a most deplorable case, one that is already a few years old, and about which Luxembourg has still not done anything. I would really like to call on Luxembourg from here to take the protection of European taxpayers’ interests more seriously than it has done in the past. We cannot have a situation where they benefit from having thousands of European Union officials based in Luxembourg but evade responsibility when it comes to safeguarding European taxpayers’ interests.</p>
<p class="contents">We have mentioned a point – this is something I want to say to Mr Blak – about the agencies. Do you know what super users are? We are back with the reform here, Commissioner. They are people who enable one and the same person to perform the tasks of resource manager, authorising officer, financial controller and accounting officer. Anyone here who has anything to do with auditing knows that this naturally throws the doors wide open to the abuse of funds. We have such things in our agencies. It must be stopped. Mr Blak was absolutely right to raise it in his reports. I would like to urge everyone here today, if we find that again next year, to take a negative stance to the discharge of such agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">One last point. We have decided to postpone discharge for the Committee on the Regions. The latest news we have received from the Committee on the Regions confirms this course. It is inconceivable that an attempt is now clearly being made to punish the bearer of those ill tidings, the financial controller, for what has happened here. That is not the way. Other speakers will be saying more about it. I can only warn the Committee on the Regions and its Secretary-General not to continue the way they are going, because we will not hesitate to draw the logical conclusions.</p>

Four years after Paul van Buitenen's revelations, which contributed to the resignation of the previous Commission, the use of an unsuitable automated accounting system is still undermining the reliability of the accounts. That system is made up of a variety of non-integrated parts, and is unable to reveal errors or anything illegal. Officials who gain knowledge of these shortcomings and wish to contribute to a quick solution are not rewarded, but instead punished. For years now, solutions have been put off until a later date, and only after 2005 will we know whether anything has really been solved. Member States are not under pressure from the many infringement procedures for non-compliance with rules, because the former have not given rise to many investigations or penalties. A similar state of affairs in a Member State or part of a Member State would probably result in the annual accounts there not being approved. Why should we then approve such a document concerning the Commission before the problems have been solved? In my view, granting the Commission discharge at this stage sends out the wrong signal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When it took office in 1999, this Commission solemnly pledged that there would be a change for the better. Today, however, four years on, a positive Statement of Assurance from the European Court of Auditors is nowhere to be seen. We once again have to make do with an assurance that the Commissioner will really do everything in her power to improve the situation, and with her pledge that a modern accounting system will be in place by 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">We have not heard any specific commitments for 2003 and 2004; we did not hear any even when we asked Mrs Schreyer explicitly to tackle urgent problems in the short term. Postponing the granting of discharge is really the obvious course of action, therefore. The report by Mr Casaca offers ample basis for this. Then we can see whether the Commission really makes any progress in the coming six months.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's poor management tarnishes the reputation of all the European institutions. In spite of this, the majority in this Parliament seems to opt for allowing itself to be kept in suspense. Is that in the interests of the voter, of the taxpayer? We are convinced it is not.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like to raise the issue of the internal accountant, Mrs Andreasen. Both the internal memo from the auditor and the modernisation plans show that her criticism really holds water. It is reasonable, therefore, for the Commission to come out of its trench, admit frankly that it is wrong and put a stop to the disciplinary procedure, instead of shooting the messenger from the Committee of the Regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have been able to observe their efforts closely, as well as their coordination with all the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control. I congratulate them but I would like to focus on the report by Mr Casaca, which I consider to be positive for the reasons I will explain now.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, because of the Commission’s generally positive attitude in cooperating in the drawing up of this report and in responding to the questions addressed to it. But furthermore, because this approval, or this report, was preceded by an analysis, not only of the conclusions of the Court of Auditors, but also of the questions put in the questionnaire, the answers given by the Commission, and the working documents produced by certain members of this committee.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a cautious approval, however, which is accompanied by many recommendations which the Commission should not ignore. I am sure it will not and that it will cooperate in this regard. Of these, I will briefly mention the following: firstly, to try to eliminate the reservations in relation to the reliability of accounts. Probably through the solution offered by Mr Mulder – which he has just referred to – through an open and constructive dialogue with the Court of Auditors. But the Commission must also be aware – as I am sure it is – of the profound concern of the Committee on Budgetary Control and of the whole of this House, I am sure, given the deficiencies of the accounting system and the essential need to choose the right accounting model. That is why we have presented an amendment to this House, so that there may be an audit accompanied by a hearing, so that we protagonists who ultimately have to judge these accounts can express our opinions on them.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I would also like to point out the caution in relation to the creation of executive agencies, the need to impose limits on the under-use of appropriations, particularly in relation to the Structural Funds, and compliance with the objectives of the Sapard Programme, above all in terms of its positive aspect of creating administrative support structures in the countries which are about to join us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also congratulate the Commission and all the Commission staff who have worked so hard to obtain a positive decision from Parliament in very difficult circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been told in recent days by Eurosceptics – many of them on the extreme left and right – that we should not be granting discharge because there are still too many concerns about the accounting system. I share those concerns, but the Commission has made excellent progress in the last few months. The alarmist and often factually incorrect reporting by some newspapers does not do justice to the efforts being undertaken to put things right.</p>
<p class="contents">With respect to the Council, I can only underline the comments made by the rapporteur, Mrs Avilés Perea, that it is high time that the Council – which now has an increasingly operational role – be held to account for the way it spends taxpayers' money. It would be good if the Convention were to make progress on this. However, in the meantime, bringing the Council into the discharge report for the first time in the history of the discharge process, as we are doing today, is a major breakthrough.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Avilés Perea and Mr Bösch have already referred to the Committee of the Regions. The situation there can only be described as alarming. Two weeks ago the internal auditor of the CoR was invited to attend a meeting of our committee to explain the discrepancies between his views and those of the Director of Finance of that institution on the financial management situation. The internal auditor said three things. First, that the picture painted by the Director of Finance and the Secretary-General of the financial situation at the CoR was not complete. Second, that the CoR failed to properly apply the rules on the reimbursement of travel expenses and other financial rules. Third, and most shockingly, he said that his appearance before the committee was 'a cry for help'. The most senior official responsible for financial control at the Committee of the Regions issues a cry for help! In those circumstances, we have no option but to postpone discharge for the CoR while an investigation by the Court of Auditors takes place to determine the exact nature of the problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the meeting of our committee two weeks ago, I have made further enquiries and I have obtained additional information on irregularities that are alleged to have taken place at that institution. In one case a high-ranking member of the CoR is alleged to have organised fake meetings on the eve of official meetings to be able to claim additional daily allowances to the tune of EUR 10 000. Another, now deceased, member of the CoR is alleged to have been engaged in airline ticket fraud amounting to some EUR 11 000. There are more such cases. However, perhaps most worrying – more worrying even than all of this – is the fact that the internal audit service appears to be subject to huge pressure and even intimidation, designed to discourage them from pursuing their activities in a free and impartial manner.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the seriousness of these allegations, which I consider to be reliable, I have decided to refer this case to the Anti-fraud Agency OLAF in the hope and the expectation that OLAF will launch an immediate inquiry to get to the bottom of all this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to express my full support for the report by Mr Staes on the discharge for the European Parliament. I hope the Convention will take good note of it and that the Bureau of this Parliament will now overturn its ludicrous decision to build two new meeting rooms in Strasbourg. We do not need them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now one might think it should be a matter of course here in Europe that each Member State has a fair and impartial administration which looks after the interests of its citizens. In the specific field of budgetary administration, virtues such as thrift, efficiency, probity and reliability are, of course, particularly desirable.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is, however, that, for the eighth time in succession, the European Court of Auditors has refused to issue a statement of assurance to the Commission attesting that the latter has managed European taxpayers’ money prudently and thriftily. The accounting deficiencies that a courageous woman, a senior official in the Commission, brought to light in the spring of 2002 are hair-raising, even to those with little knowledge of accountancy. For ten years the Commission had not conducted a cash audit. At Eurostat, the European Statistical Office, preferential treatment and mismanagement have evidently been the order of the day, with a devastating impact on the Community Budget.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of all this, the Commission sees no need to take decisive remedial action. On the contrary, officials who expose deficiencies rather than being prepared to conceal them are sidelined and hit with disciplinary proceedings. In this way – and I am addressing these words especially to the Commissioner – the Commission is not doing its job. If Parliament, as the supervisory authority, tolerates this, we too are failing in our duty. I am saying this so explicitly because I am a convinced European and because I want this Europe to have a future and to win the trust of the general public out there.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to administering its own budget, I believe that the European Parliament must act in an exemplary manner. It just leaves a bit of a bad taste in the mouth when we in this House always discharge ourselves or our own Secretary-General. I really think it ought to be done by another institution.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn now, however, to the details of the report on Parliament. The highlighted shortcomings have largely been familiar to us for a long time. Staffing decisions must be made more transparent, and the awarding of contracts must be beyond reproach. On behalf of my group I firmly support these demands that are made in the report. And it does seem to me that decisions on the purchase and construction of buildings, particularly in our Brussels base, are not always open to scrutiny.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the discharge of the three agencies, we rightly express concern at the fact that their responsibilities can still overlap and that duplication of effort can still occur. The adaptation of their responsibilities to the requirements of an enlarged EU likewise remains unsatisfactory. The conclusion of consultancy contracts by private treaty by the body known as the Kosovo Agency, involving in one case a monthly fee in excess of EUR 25 000, was evidently the result of pressure from the Commission – a pernicious influence, in my opinion, which casts an alarming light on the Commission’s dealings with agencies in general.</p>
<p class="contents">I wonder whether it is even necessary to have these agencies popping up like mushrooms all over Europe. Is there any reason why every single Member State should host at least one of these bodies? Can we afford these bodies, and do we need them at all? The Commission, I believe, uses them to fob off responsibility, but then interferes arbitrarily in their business in specific cases. This brings the work of the agencies into disrepute, and we in Parliament should therefore resolutely oppose any policy of externalisation, in other words the contracting out to other bodies of tasks incumbent upon the Commission, a policy touted by the Council and the Commission as the way ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Morgan (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, at last the Committee on Budgetary Control has decided to recommend granting discharge to the Commission. Throughout this procedure we have all been aware of the well-documented flaws in the accountancy system, which were first highlighted back in 1994. This has been of major concern to all the members of the committee. We cannot bury our heads in the sand, we have to face the problems head-on and this report does that. Mr Casaca has done a very good job.</p>
<p class="contents">The reform of the accountancy system is essential. We have timetables, we have specifics about where the whole accounts reform process is going, but we must put this into a context. We are asking the Commission to introduce a system that not one country in the European Union has yet managed to accomplish, namely the introduction of a full accrual accounting system. We have to remember that context. We have demanded a lot of the Commission in this report, and European socialists have been leading the way in setting extremely stringent targets for the Commission to meet. As shown by the committee last week, nearly all the MEPs on the Committee on Budgetary Control have been responsive to the clear efforts made by the Commission to deliver our demands.</p>
<p class="contents">The irony is that throughout this discharge procedure we have heard a lot of sound and fury from the right and the right-wing press, and yet all they could muster after all that was three measly votes in committee. Even people who represent parties such as the UK Independence Party, people such as Mr Camre and Mr Titford, who are vociferous in their criticism, could not be bothered to turn up for the vote. That shows that their objections are based on ideology, not on fact. That is something we have to bear in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of most people in the Committee on Budgetary Control is to put proper controls in place. A couple of weeks ago we had to make a political judgement as to whether our support for the Commission would help or hinder future reform. We decided that postponing discharge would actually hold up the system. We are interested in delivery.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the Parliament discharge, we have to be very clear that we in Parliament cannot throw stones at the Commission and demand from them, for example, a certain level of transparency, if we are not willing to demand the same of ourselves. I would like to congratulate the Secretary-General and the President of the European Parliament on the way they have run the administration over the past three years. They pay full respect to financial regulation. It will be interesting to see how the decentralisation system works over the next year.</p>
<p class="contents">But we cannot admonish the Commission for wasting taxpayers' money when we spend willy-nilly on things that are, frankly, a total waste of money. Every month thousands of parliamentary assistants and administrators leave Brussels to travel 400 miles to work here in Strasbourg. We have now established that travelling time alone wastes over 25 000 working days each year – EUR 3.9 million! Note must also be taken of how it discriminates against part-time workers, the majority of whom tend to be women.</p>
<p class="contents">It is wholly unnecessary to use EUR 173 million each year in order to respect historical treaties. In the wider context, I have found that we spend over EUR 1 million on committee meetings held outside the seats of Parliament. We have also seen an increase in the amount of money spent on yellow weeks, that is, EUR 372 000. The right wing must listen. They are voting against all of these points about transparency within Parliament, and frankly they are a bunch of hypocrites! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wonder how the people in the public gallery feel about the 5% – 8% of European taxpayers' money from the GBP 98 billion 2001 budget that the Commission controlled going missing through fraud, mismanagement or waste; about the EUR 15 billion surplus, money that could not be spent because of inefficient programming; about the specific problems that we found when we debated these points – specifically Eurocost comes to mind; about the leaked e-mails and memos within the Commission that show how bad the accounts actually were in 2001. About the promises we received of how things were going to get better for 2005 – but of course some Members forget that we are actually dealing with the accounts for 2001 and exactly how they were reflected. About a 1960s-vintage public-sector accounting system that was in urgent need of reform, and yet the only action the Commission would take was to suspend one of the people who was brought in to carry out that reform.</p>
<p class="contents">The only sensible recourse for us to take is to postpone discharge, and we need to have much deeper inquiries into the accounting systems reforms that have been put forward so far.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Morgan said that she and her group are facing problems head-on. What they are actually doing is lifting up the carpet for the Commission to sweep its problems under. The Socialist Group should be ashamed of the position it has taken over the last few months, because it has known full well that it was going all along to grant discharge no matter how bad the accounts for 2001 proved to be. It will come to pay the price in the 2004 European elections. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, however, we face the discharge for the seventh, eighth and even sixth European Development Funds, and the main thing that emerges is that a large amount of that money has not been spent, and that the Fund is therefore under-implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is one of the chief administrators of development money worldwide. No less than 10% of the total development money worldwide is administered by the Commission. We would urge, therefore, that careful attention be paid to the valuable comments made by both the Committee on Development and Cooperation and the Committee on Budgetary Control. Many mistakes have been made, and there is a lack of measurable indicators. Then there is the lack of coordination with the Member States, which means that the complementarity between the Commission and the Member States is often a dead letter. The Council does not concentrate on strategic issues, but instead is involved with 50 management committees intended to enable the micro-management of individual projects. There is a great deal of criticism of the way in which we carry out self-monitoring. The only control is on legality, while many taxpayers are asking themselves whether we actually have anything to show for our development work. I would therefore add my voice to that of the Committee on Budgetary Control in its wish for the incorporation of the European Development Fund into the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I should, however, just like to return to something that I find very dangerous: here I am talking about the risks of direct budgetary support. There is a growing trend towards this, and I understand, of course, that it seems much simpler at first glance. Direct budgetary support already amounts to EUR 2 604 million, although we know that it involves great risks, which the rapporteur has explained very well. To begin with, there is the risk of substitution. In the context of combating poverty, we want 35% of funds go on health and social infrastructure – education, in particular – but we note that the countries find it that much easier to spend their money on weapons. I should like to point to the examples of Uganda and Rwanda, which are probably down somewhere in the Commission's records as countries who do things by the book. You should take a look at what those countries are doing in East Congo, however, and see how they share the guilt for plundering the land. We are giving budgetary support to countries such as these.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not looking enough at the conditions, because the report – rightly, in my opinion – refers to these as poor and inadequately stipulated. What we are looking at is a lack of control with regard to management and implementation, to say nothing of the possibilities for corruption that are permitted and covered up as a result. There are the enduring problems of monitoring. In short, Commissioner, I should like to urge that the European Development Fund and the money that the Commission administers for development and cooperation be examined not only on the basis of legality, but also of the results achieved in connection with the priority we all set ourselves, namely the eradication of poverty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am unable at this juncture to deal with every contribution, but I can address a few points, beginning perhaps with one of those raised by Mrs Maes in her speech. I hope that the Convention will ensure that the European Development Fund does not have a separate budget with its own rules – many of them complex – since this has contributed to our having had such poor implementation. I hope that the Convention will take the step of deleting this separate fund from the constitutional treaty, so as to make development aid an integral part of the European budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to correct Mr Heaton-Harris: expenditure in the European financial year 2001 was not EUR 98 billion but EUR 79 billion. Indeed, it was strongly emphasised in this debate that the budget was relatively low and was also underspent.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to Mr Casaca’s contribution, let me come back to the point that the resources which the Member States can retain when funds allocated to agricultural expenditure are reclaimed actually flow into the Member States’ budgets. In other words, the Member States are entitled to use this 20%, which they may retain for administrative expenses as they see fit, because they are required, of course, to meet the administrative costs incurred by the paying agency, and these funds are effectively intended to help defray such administrative costs.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Mr Blak’s comments about the former project officer for the Dotcom project, let me say that this matter is currently being re-examined by Vice-President Neil Kinnock. The question of the extent to which support is granted under Article 24 of the Staff Regulations is currently under consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">A word to Mr Camre: you made accusations against members of the Commission staff, Mr Camre, which I must refute. I will emphasise once again that, when irregularities – particularly fraud – are suspected, is suspected, there is an obligation to inform OLAF, which will then conduct the appropriate investigations. OLAF, on which I recently presented a report, is not our only watchdog: we also have the internal Audit Service, and we have established inspection capacities in every directorate-general. The situation portrayed by Mr Bösch in which an individual acts as both an administrator of resources and a financial inspector is no longer permissible under the new Financial Regulation; these functions must now be performed by different people. This now applies to the agencies as well; as you may know, the necessary adjustments have been made in recent weeks to bring the relevant rules, including the provisions of the agencies’ founding instruments, into line with the new Financial Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">On the accounting system, let me reiterate that, in the year 2000, we commissioned a study to review the accounting system. After receiving the findings, the Director-General and I once again amended the proposals for the revision of the Financial Regulation and incorporated new accounting rules. That was in 2001. I should like to reiterate my thanks to Mr Dell’Alba for his commendation of Mr Megason, who has truly performed sterling work for the Commission and who has always been a particularly staunch advocate of greater Parliamentary involvement in the budgetary process. Much of the ‘soft law’ we have introduced in this domain over the past few years to enable Parliament to participate more fully in the process has been due to his commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">And then, still in the year 2001, the Commission published a working paper on the reform of the accounting system. The work that should have been done in response to that paper, however, was delayed for several months because of a situation of which you are all aware. Strenuous efforts have now been made to make up for lost time. The Committee on Budgetary Control, as you know, has welcomed the outline reform proposals and especially the road map – the sequence of specific planned measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Stauner’s allegation that no cash audits had taken place for ten years is simply unfounded. The European Court of Auditors carries out a cash audit every year as an elementary component, so to speak, of its auditing activity. The Court of Auditors has once again informed the Committee on Budgetary Control of its annual audit. I believe it is quite wrong for anyone here to more or less disregard the work of the European Court of Auditors.</p>
<p class="contents">This was a very spirited debate here today, matching the intensity of the entire reform process and reflecting the intensive, committed and meticulous way in which Parliament has conducted the whole discharge process. These are, of course, sweeping reforms, and critical support on the part of Parliament is essential if they are to be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank Parliament, and particularly the Committee on Budgetary Control, for its critical but unstinting support.</p>
