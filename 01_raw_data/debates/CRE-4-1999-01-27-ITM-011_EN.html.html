<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Tappin </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span><span class="italic"> rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, as colleagues will know, this report offers a broad outline of the progress we have made and should be making in the immediate future on the question of public procurement. In general, the Commission is showing that our past discussions during the debate on the Green Paper have been listened to. What we now need is to ensure that although the broad approach is right, the detail must be equally precise, firstly, in terms of social and environmental standards and sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the adoption of the Amsterdam Treaty where the EU underlined its commitment to the greening of European policies, we need to clarify how these principles will affect public procurement legislation. Members may remember from previous discussions that we asked the Commission for an assurance that there would be horizontal harmonisation of EU directives. It is ridiculous if the right DG does not know what the left DG is doing. The same applies to parliamentary committees. It is even worse if we are aware of the discrepancies but do not take positive action to eliminate them. In this way we have to confront the problems of building a certain model within our Union which is not always reflected in the directives we pass.</p>
<p class="contents">We have further requirements placed upon us by global or international commitments. We must recognise these. This is not a plea for one policy position or another but a recognition of the need for clear legislation which builds upon a secure base and thus becomes operational. Until we address this problem, which does not only affect procurement, we lay ourselves open to allegations that the Member State is the origin of all clarity and wisdom and it is the EU which is generally mucking up the system.</p>
<p class="contents">Since, following the Green Paper, we have agreed that contracting authorities have a right to set environmental standards if they so wish, we need to know exactly how they can implement those rights without breaching the overriding rules on competition. I shall say again – and let us be clear on this – we are not recommending a particular policy. We are recognising the need for clarity, simplicity and applicability. In the same way, concerning the issues of social affairs and employment, we have consistently said that public procurement is not a vehicle for promoting a particular policy in this area but adhesion to the rules and regulations of procurement must not be allowed to impede good employment practices. Again we need clear guidelines on how this can be operationalised.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has promised a report on this. We wait with bated breath. We want to see how they are taking forward the principles of clarity, simplicity and legal applicability and making public procurement legislation pertinent, effective and enforceable within our modern society. Any further legislation put forward now must cover these areas. This point is important. We are already looking to exempt telecoms from the procurement directives. I do not think anyone would dispute that, generally, the choice available to the average user is increasing. There may be some differences still which can be identified at national level but it is clear that the process of liberalisation in this sector is irreversible. However, we are now also looking at the future liberalisation and possible exemption from procurement rules of other sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a couple of issues here. Firstly, we are waiting for the Commission to come forward with proposals for the process which they intend to use for these sectors: which article, what will be the criteria for deciding who can or cannot apply. Secondly, we go back to the point we made at the very beginning of the Green Paper negotiations, namely the issue of competitiveness. We must never forget that procurement legislation exists to benefit and protect the consumer. That is the reason why we favour competition. It is supposed to benefit the user so the underlying principle of any decision on competition must always include the consumer to ensure they retain the right to choose the most cost‐effective service for them. Retaining consumer choice will be a key element in proving that real competition exists.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have said before, new simple procedures must not undermine the principles of best practice through full competition. I am aware that getting a fixed definition of what constitutes competition is not going to be easy. It is not our aim to make it harder but if European industry is not to continue being disadvantaged by a requirement to prove <span class="italic">de jure</span> and <span class="italic">de facto</span> competition, it is a challenge we have to face. We have tabled an amendment to this effect and hope the House will support us.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to make just one oral amendment tomorrow. I should like to thank the Commission for listening. I spoke to Mr Monti outside. I have another engagement now and I know he will understand my reason for leaving.</p>

I am very grateful to Mr Tappin for incorporating many of our conclusions into his report.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not the first time we find ourselves debating this subject. I have to say, Commissioner, that I am quite disappointed that the European Commission has not had the courage to take an important step forward in this communication, but has settled for an interpretative text here.</p>
<p class="contents">We for our part are convinced that ‘soft law" is not enough. The practice surrounding social clauses differs widely in the various Member States. There are huge difficulties of interpretation and so we think that clear legislation is required. I shall focus on two points here.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, public contracts must indeed be adaptable to the needs of the market, but the market must not be abused, Commissioner, as a way of weakening social legislation. Contract guidelines must therefore explicitly state that international and national social legislation must be respected, as well as collective labour agreements, both by main contractors and subcontractors.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, very many Member States and local authorities use public contracts to take positive measures to help the long‐term unemployed, the integration of migrants or the launch of neighbourhood campaigns. The Court has clearly ruled that such positive measures are not in conflict with the principles of competition. But to avoid confusion, Commissioner, the guidelines must state very clearly that positive measures are admissible and in what way social clauses can be introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that the United Kingdom too, under Labour, has radically altered its position on social clauses in public contracts, I look forward to seeing how the Commission will respond to our recommendations.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Paasilinna </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FI)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has issued a communication on public procurement: it wishes to establish a legal framework, to simplify procedures, and bring a degree of flexibility to the market. In addition, however, it is important to bear in mind the broader social objectives: principles of humanity, the demands of society and the working principles of the public sector, which are not always directly compatible with models of private enterprise.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank my colleague, Mr Tappin, for an excellent report. He feels that it is necessary to harmonise the social principles of the Union with EU legislation. Workers" rights, such as minimum pay, working hours and health and safety, have not been such obvious issues to those who have profited from competitive bidding. Why, for example, in the privatisation of transport, has it turned out that old drivers are being got rid of while at the same time they have started using old buses? In developing EU procurement legislation the regulations need to be tightened up, and we have to make methods of monitoring their enforcement more effective. Obviously, there have been problems in adhering to the content of directives.</p>
<p class="contents">The are even grounds for suspecting that it is not just a question of practical problems, such as legal complications or problems of varying labour market cultures. What if it were also that bidding for public procurement contracts is not compatible with other principles that apply in the public sector? Public corporations have also had to meet certain social policy objectives while involved in the business of procurement. The quality of services has to be improved, employment figures have to rise, and environmental questions have to be tackled. I await the report promised by the Commission on the total impact of procurement.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the Commission communication and Mr Tappin"s report raise the issue of the need to make it easier for SMEs to access the public procurement market. That is only right. It is important as there appears to be a danger of cartels forming connected with bidding for procurement contracts. SMEs, and especially those that are obliged to observe labour legislation and environmental standards, need more information and training, however. That is particularly important when it comes to using information technology as mentioned by the rapporteur, and that too has to be broadly applied, as it speeds up and simplifies processes.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also remember that local authorities, because of their democratic nature, generally have a better sense of morality than the business world.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Peijs </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the directives on public procurement were an important step in our efforts to make the European market more competitive and more open. A good deal has changed in Europe since the first directive in this area. A sector like telecommunications has been liberalised, and there have been optimistic signs here and there concerning public contracts. Generally speaking, red tape was once again the villain of the piece. The procedures which business and industry had to grapple with were unbelievably complex and inefficient. We talk of a 720 billion euro market which really must be opened up if we ever want to have a truly single market. But at what cost?</p>
<p class="contents">The directive provides for thresholds whereby it is no longer possible, above a given threshold, to tender in a private or national capacity. In principle, that is a good thing. The problem is that the incredibly complex bureaucracy involved makes it virtually impossible for small and medium‐sized businesses to get a look in. The fact is that under the system, framework contracts are not really feasible.</p>
<p class="contents">Large companies simply decide to have nothing further to do with public contracts and concentrate solely on the ordinary market. The concept of the economically most advantageous bid is also frequently understood as meaning the cheapest bid. That works against sustainable building methods, for example, since public authorities are interested only in the lowest price. Many authorities have no provision for the service of capital, a system which is short‐sighted and expensive for the citizen in the long run. It is a poor system for small businesses, which do not have the longer‐term strength of a bigger company that can calculate its profit out of capital resources. So it is right that the Commission should give special attention to SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, a large or medium‐sized company can use digital systems to obtain information on published calls for tender. But there is a good deal of ground to cover between the announcement of an opportunity and actually securing a contract. In addition to the expense of putting together a bid, the firm or consortium has to demonstrate that it is financially sound and has enough experience in the field in question.</p>
<p class="contents">Registration systems may be the answer here. These mean that companies only have to prove once that they are sound and competent, but for an authority which does not put work out to tender often, it makes no sense to set up a system of this kind. I have therefore tabled an amendment jointly with Mr Langen and my group, an amendment which won the backing of the Committee on Economic Affairs, to have the threshold amounts increased.</p>
<p class="contents">This places the majority of contracts outside the scope of the directive. To my mind, the thresholds are at present unacceptably low, given the huge amount of bureaucracy – hence the need to raise them.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission produced a green paper in 1996 and now it has produced a communication. The communication does include some constructive proposals, but not a word on threshold amounts. I hope that Parliament will give a clear message to the Commission with this report that things have to change, and that the Commission will address the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">My group will be voting against Mr Tappin"s Amendment No 5. It is unacceptable for firms to be blacklisted because accusations have been made against them. In my country, you are innocent until proved guilty. That would make competition far too easy. We oppose Amendment No 4 because we have no idea what it means. We have already requested a number of split votes and, lastly, we congratulate Mr Tappin on his report.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Schörling </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, in its communication, the Commission has stressed the importance of full and fair competition. However, similar emphasis has not been placed on the fact that it should be possible to apply environmental and social criteria to public procurement. This point has been made by the rapporteur, as well as by Mrs Van Lancker in her capacity as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. They are proposing certain amendments which would mean that environmental and social considerations are taken into account in public procurement, but in my view the wording should have been tighter and clearer. Nevertheless, the Green Group will vote in favour of the amendments, which still go further than the Commission's proposal or the report itself.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me to be quite a commonly held view that applying environmental and social criteria to public procurement would destroy free competition. Nothing could be further from the truth, since environmental and social considerations naturally involve additional costs for individual firms. If public procurement is not subject to the same extra costs, then those firms will be at a disadvantage – so much for full and fair competition.</p>

<p class="contents">There are many innovations, an ambitious timetable has been proposed, and naturally we hope the various measures can be implemented smoothly.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two points I want to make: the first is to explain why I have tabled Amendment No 1 to paragraph 30, which is about making the competitive dialogue procedures more widely available. I have to say that I am opposed to the possibility of <span class="italic">post</span> ‐tendering negotiations because even if they could be done transparently – and I find that hard to believe as there does not seem to be much point to them beyond publicity as an end in itself – surely such negotiations would damage parity of conditions, given that only the successful tenderer would enjoy its results. That is what is behind Amendment No 1.</p>
<p class="contents">I also tabled Amendment No 2, but I hereby withdraw it so obviously I shall not dwell on it. That just leaves Amendment No 1 from me.</p>
<p class="contents">At a general level, I want to take this opportunity to emphasise the need to make the tender procedure more transparent at European level, both procedurally and in terms of the dissemination of information.</p>
<p class="contents">This laudable initiative must not prejudice the need to simplify and remove some of the red tape, as my colleague Mrs Peijs and others have already said, particularly with a view to further integrating small and medium‐sized firms into the single market.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Langen </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to draw your attention to one aspect of these directives and of this report by the Commission. Parliament, through the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, has called for a marked increase in the thresholds, and I believe, Commissioner, that the Commission ought to display considerably more courage in this matter than it has done in the past. The thresholds that apply today are far too low in many areas. In particular, experience has shown that, with cross‐border transactions accounting for less than 3 % of public procurement, the whole bureaucratic fuss, if I may say so, is a waste of time, because the thresholds are so low that no genuine competition takes place at all.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why our amendment provides for a marked increase in the thresholds, amounting to an average rise of 100 %. It is a proposal that we ask you to incorporate into the next amendment of the directives, and we would urge you not to wait until something happens on the international front, but to ensure that Europe takes the lead in increasing these thresholds. There is no point at all in insisting that all procurement contracts are put out to tender if the procedure is insufficiently transparent, small and medium‐sized businesses do not bid, and these thresholds are ultimately devoid of impact on the competitive structure in Europe. That is why we ask you, Commissioner, not only to improve the transparency of the public procurement system, but also to take the initiative now in preparation for the next round of international negotiations in the GATT framework in the year 2000 by substantially increasing the thresholds, not only for services but also for public works contracts. I believe that this, along with the exemption of telecommunications from the utilities directive, will signal Europe's future intentions with regard to the development of public procurement.</p>
<p class="contents">If additional transparency can also be achieved through the use of modern media, such as the Internet, I believe all these things will put us on the right path, and I am convinced that the Commission can also take action to that end with the support of Parliament.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Monti, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (IT)</span> Mr President, first I would like to thank the European Parliament and the rapporteur, Mr Tappin, for the very significant contribution which his report makes towards making procurement policy more effective and adapting it to the needs of today"s society.</p>
<p class="contents">The largely positive assessment of the action programme launched by the Commission with the communication on public procurement, which emerges from reading Mr Tappin"s report and the motion for a resolution, is further evidence of the fruitful spirit of cooperation developing between the Commission and the European Parliament in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">So it gives me great satisfaction to welcome the proposals and suggestions in the report on which there is a substantial convergence of view between our two institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">This applies first and foremost to Parliament"s manifest concern about environmental and social issues, which the Commission fully shares and has already addressed in the communication. It is our intention to examine these issues in depth to identify appropriate ways of reconciling the objectives of competition and transparency pursued by the rules on procurement contracts with the legitimate environmental and social protection requirements, which have been strengthened by the Treaty of Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="contents">Here we should not forget that the current rules already offer concrete opportunities for achieving adequate levels of protection, environmental in particular, but also social, without this altering the fundamental purpose of procurement policy, which remains essentially economic in nature. These opportunities are not widely known and the Commission therefore believes they should be promoted and their scope clarified. That is why we propose to adopt instruments for this specific purpose as soon as possible. If this proves inadequate, the Commission will certainly consider whether it is appropriate to put forward more incisive proposals. With reference to the social aspects mentioned by Mrs Van Lancker, Mr Paasilinna and Mr Schörling, I would point out that respecting current social legislation forms part of the clear and recognised obligation to comply with current legislation – all current legislation, not just social legislation – arising not from the directive but from the national legal system into which the directive is transposed. Positive action is far more feasible than is commonly believed. Of course it must respect the principles of the Treaty, and the interpretative communication we will be publishing is precisely intended to clarify all this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add that there are provisions in the directives to exclude candidates failing to comply with national social legislation. The case‐law of the Court of Justice confirms, in the Benjes judgment, that social requirements can be taken into account if this is stated in the general specifications for a contract. Again, the Commission will spell out the possibility of taking these requirements into account in its interpretative communication.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the need, mentioned by Mr Secchi in particular, to simplify the current rules and related procedures and make them more flexible and adaptable to market developments, the Commission intends to clarify the scope of obscure or complex provisions and, if necessary, modify the current system. With a view to this, proposals are being put forward designed to exclude from the scope of Directive 93/38 the sectors and/or services covered by it which operate under conditions of effective competition – water, energy, transport and telecommunications – and establish more flexible procedures, like the procedure known as ‘competitive dialogue' and the framework agreements system. With two ‘public procurement' consultative committees, we are examining a new competitive dialogue procedure which ensures maximum transparency, as well as allowing greater flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the report also specifically refers to the need for the new initiatives announced in the communication to help to ensure healthy and effective competition between economic operators during the tendering procedure. This is an aim the Commission has always pursued in public procurement and it is the ultimate purpose of the interpretative communication on concessions and other forms of public and private partnership, which will be published in draft form in the next few weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to touch very quickly on the important point raised, in particular, by Mrs Peijs. We are aware of the difficulties currently faced by small and medium‐sized businesses in taking part directly in tendering procedures, especially cross‐border. To reduce these difficulties and encourage the participation of small and medium‐sized businesses, the Commission is drafting a communication to highlight the possibilities for giving SMEs increased access to public procurement in general, both through appropriate legislative changes and by identifying the opportunities currently offered by the existing programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Internationally, the Commission will continue to act to ensure that the principle of reciprocity is established in the context of the current World Trade Organisation negotiations on the modification and simplification of the public procurement agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Tappin when he says that communication simply announces the initiatives the Commission intends to take and presents them in general terms, without providing details and particulars on each of them. Mr Tappin is absolutely right. That is inherent in the very nature of a general policy statement like the communication in question. Obviously the details on each initiative will emerge when the initiatives themselves take shape. As regards the legislative initiatives, these will be based on Article 100a of the Treaty and their adoption will therefore require the active participation of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the drafting of the interpretative instruments, while emphasising that this is an institutional responsibility entrusted to it by the Treaty, the Commission naturally appreciates the support of Parliament. In this regard I have already proposed that a discussion group should be set up in Parliament for ad hoc informal meetings, tasked with interacting with the Commission departments concerned, and I think this idea should be studied in greater depth and acted upon, while still, of course, respecting the separate spheres of responsibility of our two institutions.</p>
