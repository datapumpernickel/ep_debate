The report will summarise the current state of affairs, but will not set out any political guidelines or proposals as yet since, in accordance with Article 88a, these are to be made later, as a second step. As soon as the final version of the report is available, it will be presented immediately to the Council and the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">When preparing this report, the Commission services have held extensive consultations with patients’ and consumers’ organisations, Member States and other interested parties. According to the usual procedure, the public consultation lasted for more than two months – from April to June of this year. The draft has been published on the website of the Directorate-General for Enterprise and Industry, and opinions have been requested.</p>
<p class="contents">So far, more than 50 contributions have been received already, and several more arrive every day. Ten of these contributions are from patients’ or consumers’ organisations. This is strong proof that consumers’ organisations and all other interested parties, and also the general public, have had the opportunity to give their opinions on, and make contributions to, this report – and indeed they have done so abundantly.</p>
<p class="contents">The responses received are being examined very carefully, and the final report will have to consider, on the basis of this examination, the best strategy to give all European citizens the same access to the clearest possible information on medicinal products.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to assure the honourable Member that this issue is a great personal concern of mine and that I shall do my utmost to bring the process to a conclusion as quickly as possible. Nevertheless, it is most crucial that our proposals be based on comprehensive information and extensive consultation with the public; and, as I see it, precision and quality are definitely more important in this matter than speed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think there is great concern over how parties have been consulted. Many of us here feel that there should be no change to the current legislation, i.e. keep the ban on direct consumer advertising and no backdoor routes to direct advertising of pharmaceuticals. We need to allow more consumer involvement in the pharmaceutical forum with a focus on what patients and ordinary consumers want and need to know rather than what industry wants to provide. Therefore, will the Commissioner consider changes to the timetable adopted to allow for appropriate consideration of all alternative points of view and to address the problem of information in a patient-centred way with patient-centred solutions? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The problem we face today is that some groups of patients have access to all manner of information via the Internet and other modern communication technologies, whereas many patients do not have this information, and that is a situation we must eliminate.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to reiterate quite clearly that we shall not cross the line separating patient information from product advertising. In addition, we shall lay down quite clearly what rules and criteria apply to the information concerned.</p>

Never have so many people worked in Europe, and unemployment figures are at their lowest for a long time. It remains true, however, that the unemployment rate among young people remains high, at around twice the EU average. Youth unemployment is first and foremost the responsibility of the Member States, within the context of their labour market policies. It is also true, however, that the EU must contribute towards resolving this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s key task consists of supporting the Member States in the following two areas:</p>
<p class="contents">– coordination and monitoring of national Member State policy on unemployment in the context of the Lisbon Strategy and</p>
<p class="contents">– financial support, in particular via the European social fund.</p>
<p class="contents">The framework for policy coordination is provided by the relaunched Lisbon Strategy. The Commission is monitoring national unemployment policies very closely. In the latest Community report on unemployment, the Commission and the Council underlined the urgent need to improve the situation for young people in the labour market. Although the Member States have undertaken to offer young people a fresh start, most of the 4.6 million unemployed young people do not receive a job offer, an offer of education or vocational training in the first six months of their unemployment. Young people who do find a job often have insecure contractual conditions. The Commission takes the view that this is an unsatisfactory state of affairs and has recommended that the Member States improve the situation for young people, in particular in the field of education or vocational training.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission’s view, steps should be taken in particular in the following three areas:</p>
<p class="contents">firstly, social inclusion, which is a vital prerequisite for sustainable development in Europe. The Commission will support active cohesion aimed at helping people who are on the margins of the labour market to integrate into the labour market, as well as programmes ensuring an appropriate minimum wage and access to high-quality social services.</p>
<p class="contents">secondly, lifelong learning, because there can be no doubt that education engenders education and people who are educated and who have higher qualifications have greater access to lifelong learning than those who most need it, that is, people with low qualifications or older people with outdated skills. As regards the Lisbon Strategy, the Commission has issued a number of recommendations to the Member States in the area of education and vocational training, especially concerning early school leaving, with a view to raising the levels of the education that Europeans receive. I should like to point out that the EU’s reference target is to bring the number of early school leavers down to below 10%. The figure is currently 15.2% and in some countries significantly higher than that. Reducing early school leaving is in our view one of the most important factors in improving opportunities for young people on the labour market. Another Commission recommendation is that of supporting geographical mobility. Despite unemployment, we are in a situation where some regions and sectors do not have enough people in the labour force. Young people should therefore be urged to take advantage of these opportunities to work.</p>
<p class="contents">A further possibility is EU financial support via the European social fund. As well as coordinating policy, the Union supports the Member States’ efforts to modernise the labour market. During the period 2007-2013 the Member States will receive EUR 72.6 billion towards funding the reform of national labour markets, over 90% of which will go directly towards fulfilling the Lisbon goals. Investment in human capital, which represents one third of the budget of the European social fund, is the most important priority for 2007-2013. A further 30% of that amount will be earmarked for social cohesion in respect of disadvantaged groups.</p>
<p class="contents">The European social fund has already yielded practical results. Every year, some 2 million people gain access to employment after taking advantage of support from European social fund projects. In 2007, 25% of unemployed people in the EU will take part in European social fund projects, from which some 1 million of society’s marginalised or disadvantaged people benefit every year. Around 4 million people every year graduate from vocational courses as part of the lifelong learning programme, which is supported by the European social fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that, as I emphasised, the issue of youth unemployment remains a problem, the Commission is looking for more effective solutions. For this reason, the Commission is now finalising a draft communication on bringing young people into education, employment and society, the adoption of which is planned for September of this year. This communication will be accompanied by a Commission working document on youth employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, as I emphasised, the question of youth unemployment is of course mainly a matter for the Member States, their employment policies, their education policies and so forth, although the EU cannot and will not remain inactive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the short time available to me, I will focus on three specific areas.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, with regard to youth unemployment, we see that there is a huge skills shortage, not just in the areas of the internet, communications or technology, but also in terms of the traditional skills used, for example, by carpenters, electricians, stonemasons and so on. There does not seem to be any new initiative to try and enforce extra training out of resources in there.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to the mobility question, there are barriers that are put in place that affect young people, in particular, in travelling to get jobs and have their qualifications recognised where they have them.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, and finally, with regard to long-term unemployment, back-to-work schemes are important, allowing people to retain some of their social rights and thus helping them integrate back into the work system again. What proposals are there for that in particular? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Naturally, within the framework of the European social fund’s active employment policy, we are striving to open up qualifications, and as you correctly pointed out qualifications are not a purely intellectual matter but also involve manual trades and other activities. The Commission is therefore preparing a forum, within the framework of the forum for restructuring, to address the future labour market, that is to say, a labour market with jobs that can be viewed in the long term as either stable or newly-arising, and part of our efforts will be to formulate appropriate requirements for qualifications, appropriate modules for acquiring qualifications and flexible, resilient methods for pursuing the balance between the future labour market and qualifications.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards workers’ mobility, there is once again a series of different points and ways in which we can support mobility. The most important of these is the objective set out by my colleague Mr Figel, namely the draft policy on recognising qualifications not only in sectors in which qualifications are already recognised but in other sectors too, including so-called trades. I feel that if we embark on this project, we will significantly improve the situation for young people in the labour market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The EU is under an obligation to support an open debate in closed societies and dictatorships. However, in far too many countries, the expression of opinions continues to be life-threatening. Journalists and writers are murdered, kidnapped and persecuted worldwide. Freedom of expression is important if dictatorships are to develop into open, democratic societies. The Commission could send a clear signal about the value of freedom of expression by offering temporary refuge to writers and journalists persecuted as a result of restrictions on such freedom. The Danish Government recently put forward such a proposal.</p>

<p class="contents">In this context, the concept of political opinion encompasses any opinion concerning matters on which the state, government or society is engaged, going beyond identification with a specific political party or recognised ideology.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States are therefore obliged by virtue of EU law to offer protection to journalists and writers who, as a result of exercising their freedom of expression, have in their countries of origin a well-founded fear of persecution in the form of a threat to their life, physical freedom or other serious violations of their human rights.</p>

It will be recalled that the Council of Ministers adopted the proposed regulation concerning management measures for the sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources in the Mediterranean Sea in late 2006. That regulation consequently entered into force in January 2007. The Commission believes that the regulation represents a fair and vigorous response to the problems raised by the honourable Member as far as both demersal and small pelagic species are concerned. For other highly migratory species like bluefin tuna, the Community also recently adopted new legislation that will contribute to improving the conservation status of these stocks.</p>

Both Member States and fishermen’s organisations have a fundamental role to play in this respect. The Commission will be very attentive to ensure proper enforcement of all the measures. It is for this reason that on 2 April 2007 I wrote to the Ministers of the Member States concerned to assess where we stand as regards the application of the regulation a few months after its adoption. My departments will continue to monitor the situation and the implementation by the Member States of the various provisions contained in that regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to Community measures that may be further complemented in the future, it is also fundamental to promote fisheries management measures in the framework of the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM), so that Mediterranean countries that are not members of the European Union can also contribute to the sustainability of marine living resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Active participation of Member States’ scientists in the proceedings of the GFCM Scientific Advisory Committee is an important way to achieve this. In the case of the Aegean Sea, it is primarily the responsibility of Greece and Turkey to ensure adequate scientific cooperation in order to provide sound scientific advice for fisheries management.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to facilitate and promote further scientific cooperation in the Mediterranean eastern basin, the Commission, together with Greece and Italy, is planning to support a new FAO regional project named EastMed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In that regard I made reference specifically to the Mediterranean regulation, which has just come into effect and we are monitoring it closely in order to see that there is proper implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously the Mediterranean Sea, and your part of the Mediterranean Sea, involves third countries with whom we have relationships. With Turkey in particular there is the association relationship, and Turkey is also a candidate for membership. With regard to fisheries, we try to work closely with these third countries in other fora which are responsible for the management of fisheries in the Mediterranean, in particular the GFCM, which is the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean. As regards highly migratory species there is ICCAT, which is the commission that has responsibility for blue fin tuna, in particular, and swordfish. Here we are trying to work closely with third countries who are also members of these fora in order to push forward common regulatory measures. In that way we are trying to maintain and establish as level a playing field as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously it is essential that European Union take the lead, and therefore in establishing our own regulatory regime for fisheries in Community waters, we set the example and do our utmost to see to it that third countries with fishing rights in the Mediterranean adopt similar measures through GFCM or ICCAT so that our fishers would not be prejudiced as a result of having more stringent fishing rules for the management of the fishery. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, one cannot be as selective as one would like to be and the measures that apply in the Mediterranean are based more on technical measures than on setting total allowable catches and quotas.</p>
<p class="contents">However, having said that, the Mediterranean fisheries policy has introduced regulations, for the first time, that are quite tough in order to regulate Mediterranean fisheries and in particular coastal fisheries. There is a requirement on the part of Member States to draw up management plans for fisheries with regard to the coastal dimension and, in particular, measures relating to the types of gear used, as well as measures relating to minimum landing sizes.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now monitoring the implementation of this regulation, as I said in my reply to the question. This was adopted just at the end of last year and came into effect at the beginning of this year. The timeframes are being introduced during the course of this year and next year. I hope that within the timeframes set in the regulation, the Member States will have the necessary measures in place so that we will be able to have a much more sustainable fishery in the Mediterranean, especially with regard to coastal fisheries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission communication of 4 July 2006 'Towards a European strategy on the rights of the child' estimates, under the heading 'Global situation', that some 300 000 children are fighting as child soldiers in more than 30 armed conflicts around the world.

And we are working actively, both at the policy level and also through our different funding instruments, to promote the rights of the child in armed conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three levels here. One is the policy level. The European Union has established a particularly robust basis to work on these issues. Since 2003, several important policy documents have been adopted including the EU guidelines on children and armed conflict, the EU concept for support for this disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration and the checklist for integration of the protection of children affected by armed conflict into ESDP operations and, finally, the Commission communication towards an EU strategy on children’s rights from 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, in our political dialogues with partner countries, we regularly raise issues related to children’s rights. For example, we raised with the Lebanese Government the ratification of the optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. We also urge states that have not yet done so to ratify and fully implement the statute of the International Criminal Court which classifies enlisting children as a war crime. And we have been financially supporting the recent revision of the Cape Town principle, resulting in February of this year in the adoption of the Paris principles. Furthermore, we also continue to work with and actively support the UN’s special representatives for children in armed conflict, UNICEF, OHCHR, UNHCR and other non-governmental bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have made this issue a high priority in our assistance efforts at individual country level, for instance, with regard to projects on disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration programmes, for instance, in Sudan or with regard to prevention of child recruitment in Colombia or demobilisation, reintegration and prevention of recruitment of child soldiers. That has facilitated the demobilisation of more than 3000 children.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, within the new European instrument for democracy and human rights, we have also earmarked an amount of EUR 6.8 million for 2007 to 2010, aiming to protect children’s rights in armed-conflict situations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Beyond the three EU Member States, the Black Sea region comprises seven other countries covered by European Union policies: one is the neighbourhood policy, the pre-accession process in the case of Turkey is the second, and then we have the strategic partnership with Russia. These, and mainly the European neighbourhood policy, determine our strategy towards the region as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Promoting prosperity and stability is therefore one of our main goals, and we offer substantial cooperation programmes. Recently we have, as you know, put forward a Black Sea synergy initiative that has just been adopted under the German Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">The region is of key importance to us, particularly for EU energy supplies – not only security of energy supplies but also diversification. We are also promoting a dialogue with all the Black Sea countries on energy security to provide a transparent framework for production, transport and transit, not only in a regional context but also to enhance our own energy security and supplies through diversification.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also working on upgrading the existing energy infrastructure and on promoting the development of new infrastructure in the context of a Caspian Sea-Black Sea-EU energy corridor. There are also all the human rights standards as set out by the Council of Europe and the OSCE that also apply to all the Black Sea states. We therefore want to improve human rights standards, but we also want to support and strengthen democratic structures and civil society in particular. This is key.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, security is the third point and, in particular, the ‘frozen conflicts’ that present a huge challenge. We hope that active EU involvement in ongoing efforts to address these conflicts will provide an opportunity to resolve them in the not too distant future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We know that talks have been held between President Voronin and President Putin of Russia, but the important thing is that these link up with the ‘five plus two’ talks we are holding. We are making a great effort to give Moldova every possible support along the way. Time and again, there are human-rights issues to be raised – as I have done personally, both in a letter to President Voronin and directly in our talks – but it is imperative that we support this country, the poorest in Europe, and that is what we are doing with our programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the tensions in the South Caucasus, it is true that these have escalated. We have pointed out time and again that a solution to the conflicts in South Ossetia, Abkhazia and of course Nagorno-Karabakh is only possible by stepping up political dialogue. We are in very close contact with the various Special Representatives of the High Representative, and we have channelled our neighbourhood policy towards the creation of an environment conducive to finding a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Whereas, on the one hand, Nagorno-Karabakh has had an opportunity – sadly, the President has yet to take it, but we all hope for a breakthrough – and certain improvements are discernible in South Ossetia; on the other hand, ever greater problems can be seen in Abkhazia, and we have to be particularly vigilant with regard to that country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Вие, г-жо комисар, характеризирате тези преговори като деликатни. Обикновено често казвате така. Всъщност търпение и деликатност проявява Европейската комисия. Либийският режим, който не иска да търси истинската причина за СПИН-епидемията до този момент, не проявява деликатност и си е намерил за тази цел дългосрочни заложници. Той драстично нарушава човешките права на европейски граждани вече 8 години и развива удобната му теза за независимото либийско правосъдие. А то е толкова независимо, колкото например са либийските медии, които за този период не посмяха нито един път да представят другата гледна точка, за разлика от българските и европейските медии.</p>
<p class="contents">Попитах Ви за политическата оценка, защото този процес е политически. Логично е за утрешното заседание на съда в Либия и неговото решение, както и за всички решения до сега, либийските власти да носят отговорност. Бих желал да Ви попитам: „Имате ли алтернативен план за действие (<span class="italic">председателят се опитва да го прекъсне.</span>), ако Либия продължи да използва преговорите за удължаването на агонията на медицинските сестри и палестинския лекар?“ </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On 27 February of this year, <span class="italic">Natsionalna Elektricheska Kompania</span> (National Electric Company) notified the Commission, under Article 41 of Euratom, of its investment project. The notification concerns the construction of a new third-generation VVER-1000 nuclear plant in Belene (Bulgaria).</p>
<p class="contents">The closure of units three and four of Kozlodui nuclear power plant, as an integral part of Bulgaria’s Treaty of Accession to the European Union, is also happening. The Commission, in its role as Guardian of the Treaties, will oversee the correct implementation of the relevant clauses of this Treaty. The closure of these units should not cause major energy supply concerns. The Community assistance for decommissioning, based on the Treaty of Accession, also covers measures consequential to the closure of the reactors in the field of replacement capacity, energy efficiency and supply actions.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, in the opinion of both the Commission and the World Bank, new base load investments are needed throughout the whole region. However, there are no particular structural problems in generation at present.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has consistently underlined that it is for each Member State to decide whether or not to rely on nuclear power for the generation of electricity. Should Member States decide to invest in new nuclear power generation, the Commission will exercise available powers to ensure that new investment projects meet the highest standards of safety, security and non-proliferation, as required by the Euratom Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">On the seismic issue, pursuant to Article 37 of Euratom, Bulgaria is required to provide the Commission with general data relating to the plan for the disposal of radioactive waste. This will apply to the new nuclear power plant in Belene. The submission of this data is due at least six months before any discharge authorisation of radioactive effluents is granted by the Bulgarian competent authorities. On the basis of this data, and after consultation of the Article 31 Group of Experts, the Commission will deliver an opinion. The latter will check whether the implementation of the plan, both in normal operation and in the event of accident, is liable to result in a radioactive contamination of the water, soil or air space of another Member State. As the Commission review also covers accidental scenarios, the general data to be provided by Member States should contain information on the degree of seismic activity in the region, on probable maximum seismic activity and on the designed seismic resistance of the nuclear installation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The liberalisation of the market will not have any effect, because nuclear energy is a part of national energy mix and each country would like to make its own decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a highly sensitive political issue, so I believe that market liberalisation will have no influence on this type of decision. Countries that normally oppose the use of nuclear power will not change their mind. Those countries that use nuclear power continue to use it. Therefore, I believe that the best way to promote the directive is to work in a high level group of all 27 Member States and, in this way, to establish a broader consensus on establishing higher nuclear safety standards and better treatment of nuclear waste. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If it was for any other reason, such as excess of power – but it was not, it was only for safety reasons, recognised by Bulgarian authorities when they subscribed to the Treaty.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Maintenance of fuel stocks in Greece</span></p>
<p class="contents">By decision 334/V/2007, adopted after a review of the market in petroleum products, the Hellenic Competition Commission (EEA) put forward a number of measures and proposals with particular reference to the maintenance of stocks. The EEA had already identified certain problems with the stock maintenance system at the public consultation stage. It pointed out that the current legal arrangements governing the maintenance of security stocks effectively obstruct imports of petroleum products, thereby confining competition for refining to the two domestic refineries. This situation arises because those refineries are not subjected to strong competitive pressure from (low) import prices and the prices which they both charge the distributing companies in Greece are higher than those in the other Member States despite the low cost of crude which the domestic refineries enjoy.</p>
<p class="contents">Has the Greek Government implemented the measures proposed by the EEA? What are the Commission's views on the current system of stock maintenance and the solutions proposed? Will the Commission make representations to the Greek Government to implement the above and other, related proposals and strengthen competition? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU legislation imposes certain obligations on stock levels. It does impose requirements on internal arrangements to keep those stocks apart from some general conditions which apply to stockholding arrangements such as the principles of fairness, non-discrimination and transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of the information provided by the Greek authorities, the European Commission considers for the time being that there is no evidence to justify an infringement procedure in relation to the stockholding arrangements undertaken in relation to the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking the above into consideration, the Commission will continue to monitor regularly the level of stocks held in Greece in order to ensure levels required by EU legislation. At the same time, the European Commission would like to point out that in 2001 the European Court of Justice decided that a stockholding arrangement in Greece, not regulated by the above-mentioned directive, breached Article 28 of the European Community Treaty on the free movement of goods. The case was closed after the Commission was informed that the Greek authorities complied with the judgement of the Court of Justice.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: 'Druzhba' pipeline</span></p>
<p class="contents">In July 2006 Russia broke off oil supplies to Lithuania and Latvia through the 'Druzhba' pipeline. For almost a year, we have received no official information on the reasons for supplies being halted or the prospects for a resumption. Russia cites the ongoing economic and technical studies on the renovation of the 'Druzhba' pipeline, which will show whether it is viable for Russia to repair the pipeline or whether a new pipeline will need to be built running from Unecha to Primorsk via Velikie Luki. Experts believe that the Russian Government has already taken the politically motivated decision to abandon the 'Druzhba' pipeline, since the new pipeline would mean that Russia would no longer have to transport the oil through the territory of Belarus and Poland but could ship it to the European Union through the Baltic port of Primorsk. This would run counter to the EU strategy of transporting less oil by sea in order to prevent the negative ecological impact and would have considerable repercussions on oil supplies to eight countries, six of them EU Member States, namely Lithuania, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU Heads of State and Government declared in March that the objective of energy policy was the security of energy supply to EU countries and the diversification of energy infrastructure. The closure of the 'Druzhba' pipeline would represent the clear failure of this EU policy. What practical steps will the Commission take in these circumstances? What forecasts and recommendations are being made by the Network of Energy Security Correspondents (Nesco)? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This transparency was repeatedly requested by letter and in several bilateral meetings up to the highest level, including the last EU-Russia Summit in May of summer this year. The Commission notes the resolution of the Russian Government of 21 May 2007 to go ahead with the preparation for the construction of a pipeline from Unecha to the Primorsk terminal on the Baltic, a development which could presumably lead to reduced deliveries via the Druzhba pipeline.</p>
<p class="contents">The possibility of further increases in oil exports via Primorsk underline the importance of a strong legislative framework for maritime safety and environmental risks related to the tanker traffic and effective implementation of that framework. The Baltic Sea is a focus of particular attention, its establishment of traffic lines, monitoring of single hub tanker traffic by the European Maritime Safety Agency – EMSA. In the dialogue on transport, it has been agreed that maritime safety is one of the most important subjects.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that pipeline transport of oil is preferable to tanker transport when there is maritime safety or environmental risks. Such risks need to be taken into account by investors and promoters. In March 2007 the European Council endorsed an energy policy for Europe containing an extensive action plan which sets out the strategy. The strategy should be assessed as a whole. Security of supply should be achieved by advances in several parts of the action plan, notably the establishment and functioning of the internal energy market and solidarity arrangement between the Member States within the market. These also include the diversification of energy, making an effort in terms of energy efficiency and last, but not least, work towards a strong single voice in external energy relations.</p>
<p class="contents">The network of energy security correspondents set up in May has just started preparing its work but it will be a very good instrument in the future in assessing the external supply risks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are not asking too much. We need clear data and commitments. Will they use the pipe? If so, when do they expect to use it? We are not asking for secret data. We are just asking normal questions that good neighbours should exchange because it is not related to security of supply. We are saying that it is a good idea to use the pipeline because it stops congestion on the seas and diminishes environmental risks.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all hoping that the pipeline will be back in use as soon as possible and, if necessary, we would be willing to provide whatever support was necessary. Therefore, Nesco has a very limited role in this because it is an instrument for alleviating supply risks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would say it is high time to reconsider this because we have undervalued supply risks concerning oil. So we should bring oil back into our energy debate in this House, as well as in the Council and in the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now preparing a study evaluating all the risks of oil supply, which parts of the world we get it from, what role is played by congestion, where the risks come from etc. I believe at some stage we should move to promote particular projects. One very obvious oil project where we would like to promote development is the reversal of the flow of the Odessa-Brody-Płock-Gdańsk pipeline because it brings oil from the congested Black Sea region to its markets. This is a project I can already mention where I would envisage the need for such a coordinator, but today the legal framework does not apply to oil. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
