<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hans Winkler, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. <span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has a long tradition of solidarity with the Palestinian people, as have all its institutions, not least this House. In the past, we were always agreed on the basis and the principles by which this solidarity with the Palestinian people – and the European Union’s Middle East policy itself – were determined.</p>
<p class="contents">They were founded upon the right of Israel to exist within secured and recognised borders, and on the Palestinian people’s right of self-determination. What has become known as the Oslo process, and the Roadmap, have begun to give this right of self-determination practical shape in the form of a independent Palestinian state coexisting side by side with Israel. The European Union, then, is firmly committed to the two-state solution, and to these principles all its policy measures, and all the support that the European Union gives, were made subservient.</p>
<p class="contents">These principles continue to apply, and the Council takes the view that the peace process can succeed only if it is conducted in harmony with them. Let me go through them again. There must, first of all, be a clear renunciation of every form of violence as a solution to the conflict, with, in its place, a process of thorough negotiation. Secondly, there must be an acknowledgement of Israel’s right to exist, and also, finally, of the undertakings on the basis of the existing agreement, including the Roadmap.</p>
<p class="contents">It is by these principles that the Council’s Middle East policy is guided, and it is for that reason that the European Union will continue to support the peace policy adopted by the Palestinian President, Mr Abbas, who was directly, and with a large majority, elected by the people. The Council has very carefully monitored what has been happening in the Middle East over recent months. We did of course hope that a newly-elected Palestinian government would be guided by the principles I have enumerated, and the Council observed very closely to what degree there was any perceptible movement in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, though, it is an unfortunate fact that we cannot find any evidence of the Hamas Government giving any indication of being prepared to accept without reservation this basis for support from the European Union, and nor was its response to the suicide bombing in Tel Aviv at the beginning of last week an encouraging sign.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, though, the Council does have an interest in the continuation of support for the Palestinian people and their basic needs. The Council’s policy – and the Commission’s, too – must be determined by the tension between, on the one hand, the Palestinian people’s election of a government that is not founded upon the principles that the European Union regards as binding, and, on the other, our striving not to abandon them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make it clear that the Commission has acted very responsibly in this regard by taking the precautionary measure of suspending payments and the provision of technical assistance to the Palestinian Government until such time as a final decision is taken.</p>
<p class="contents">The last time the foreign ministers of the European Union met in Council, they reached agreement – after very serious and thorough debate – that, while direct payments to the Palestinian Authority were to be suspended indefinitely, at the same time, the attempt would be made to maintain the provision of aid via non-governmental and international organisations in order that the basic needs of the Palestinian people, not least in health and education, might continue to be met. The major donors – and the EU continues to give more than any of them – will continue to attempt to maintain the supply of aid without funds having to go straight to Palestinian Government institutions, so no funds will go directly to the government or be distributed by it.</p>
<p class="contents">The World Bank, too, has carried out a study examining the effects not only of reduced aid provision but also, and primarily, of the Israeli Government’s retention of Palestinian customs and tax revenue. The Council has, in terms that admit of no misunderstanding, demanded of the Israeli Government that it should take action to improve the Palestinians’ humanitarian and economic situation, and in particular that it should remit to the Palestinian authority the customs and tax revenue that constitute that body’s principal source of income.</p>
<p class="contents">We must of course ask ourselves whether there is any alternative to this policy. It is our belief that, given the fact that Hamas is an organisation that is on the list of terrorist organisations and gives no indication of any tendency to acknowledge the fundamental principles to which I have referred, the European Union has no choice but to adopt a policy of suspending direct payments to this government, although it is to be hoped that this will be only a temporary measure.</p>
<p class="contents">It will remain a priority that the new Palestinian Government should share with us the fundamental principles that are indispensable to the success of the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">A two-state solution without a Palestinian Authority functioning on a democratic basis is by its very nature unthinkable, and so we must hope that the Palestinian government will be guided, both in the medium and longer term, by these principles, and must work, and send out clear signals, to that end.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that the European Union should maintain a common front with the international community; the Middle East quartet plays a vitally important part in this, and it is important that we, in our dealings with the Palestinian Government and people, should all be saying the same things, and saying them clearly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Benita Ferrero-Waldner, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, President-in-Office, the election victory of Hamas in January presented the European Union with a totally new situation. We supported the Palestinian elections and we also, I have to say, respect the outcome. But the heart of the matter is indeed the emergence of a Palestinian Authority whose government is led by members of an organisation included in the EU terrorist list, and that continues to this day to attempt also to justify, for instance, suicide bombings in Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">In January, the Council and the Quartet set out clear principles – that have just been mentioned again – for continued engagement with the Palestinian Authority. I am the first to regret that the new government has so far refused to renounce violence, recognise the right of Israel to exist and accept existing agreements. These principles are indeed the expression of a commitment to work, as we said, for peace by peaceful means. They are not new: they have underpinned our cooperation with the Palestinians for many years. As a result, the Council, meeting two weeks ago as was just mentioned, endorsed the decision of the Commission to temporarily put on hold assistance to or through the Palestinian Government and its ministries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s action is a precautionary measure taken to ensure that no Community funds pass into the hands of Hamas. We have taken it pending the possible evolution of the Palestinian Authority position and a definitive decision by the Council on relations with the Palestinian Authority. It is not a definite decision: we are currently reviewing our projects involving payments to or through the Palestinian Authority to see whether we can find alternative solutions. My services have already held a meeting for instance with the office of President Mahmoud Abbas to discuss implementing some of those projects, for instance through the office of the President.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to make very clear what this means. We have suspended payments going, as was said, to the Palestinian Government, but we have not suspended aid to the Palestinian people. On the contrary, since the beginning of this year, we have stepped up our aid to the Palestinians. On 27 February, I announced a EUR 120 million package of aid, including help for refugees and help with fuel bills. This means that we committed almost half of our normal year’s budget in only two months. EUR 100 million of this has already been paid: five times more than we paid for the same period in 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">This represents an acceleration of our aid to the Palestinian people, not a suspension of aid to the people. The Commission is all too aware that the economic, social and humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian territories is unfortunately getting worse. I have seen the reports from the visits that some Members made to the region in the last few days, and I know you share our deep concern. We will also come forward with further measures to help the population, but we must also be clear on one point: the key to preventing a humanitarian disaster in the Palestinian territories lies with Israel and the Palestinian Authority, not with the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">I have heard some people say that Europe has been paying the salaries of the Palestinian Authority. This is just not true. Our support to the Palestinian Authority budget in the past has been linked to reform. At most it has covered less than 10% of the salary bill. The real question is that of Israel withholding Palestinian customs and tax revenues. These are Palestinian taxes which people have already paid. Withholding them means that basic services will not be delivered, salaries cannot be paid and families will suffer.</p>
<p class="contents">Israel has also increased the closures of territory in the West Bank and into and out of Gaza. Addressing these problems will do more to help the Palestinian people than any measure the EU can take. All of us in the international community have to intensify our diplomatic efforts with Israel on these two issues.</p>
<p class="contents">On the Palestinian side, President Abbas has indeed a key role to play, including in negotiating with Israel. We are looking at how we might best support his Office, but we are not in the business of parallel structures. Rather, we are looking with other donors at the possibility of establishing an international supervision mechanism that could facilitate the control of funds for donors to meet needs, for instance in the health and education sectors. The Quartet meeting on 9 May is an opportunity for the international community to address this question, as well as measures Israel could take to ease the humanitarian situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to conclude by stressing our wish to see an evolution of the positions taken by the Government of the Palestinian Authority, not its failure. In this way we are looking to address the contradiction between the positions currently espoused by members of the new Palestinian Government and by Hamas as an organisation and the EU objective of a negotiated solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with Israel living side-by-side and at peace with a future Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In any event, as Mrs Ferrero-Waldner pointed out, we are clearly dealing with a double contradiction: an internal contradiction from the European Union's point of view, because it is not possible for the European Union to include the party that has won the elections on its list of terrorist organisations and, on the other, to make a financial contribution from the Community budget to an organisation that does not renounce violence.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also an external aspect to this problem: the international community, Mr President, must be united in its rejection of terrorism and of violence.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this Parliament must support the statement by the Presidency-in-Office of the Council. We must be forthright in defence of our principles; we must try to channel the aid via the President of the Palestinian National Authority; we must try to ensure that the Palestinian people do not suffer, as Mrs Ferrero-Waldner has stressed, and we must continue to provide aid for fundamentally humanitarian reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Ferrero-Waldner has also said that nobody has helped the Palestinian people as much as the European Union. And that is absolutely the case, because of every 100 dollars spent on this peace process, 60 have been provided by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we cannot carry on helping the Palestinian people if their government does not help them, if it does not reject terrorism entirely and for good, if it does not renounce violence and if it does not recognise the State of Israel and the agreements that have been reached between the Palestinian National Authority and the other party in the peace process. Aid must be conditional upon these things, Mr President, and I believe that we in this Parliament must fully support the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commission, whose position is more than reasonable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am worried about the fact that the decisions made by the Council are liable not to facilitate even a gradual transformation of an objectively difficult situation; I am worried about the risk of further radicalisation that may result from the desperation in Palestine.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not disputing the fact that the requests directed by the Union to the new government in Palestine are fair; it is the means used for this purpose that puzzle me: the Palestinian people must be able to count on our full economic, political and moral support.</p>
<p class="contents">You say that you want to continue to guarantee the provision not only of emergency aid, but also of education and healthcare. I do not understand how this can be done if the administration is completely excluded. We also need to pay a great deal of attention to the delicate – and I stress the word delicate – relationship between the presidency and the government in Palestine.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by making three suggestions:</p>
<p class="contents">- we should work towards consolidating Hamas’ decision to call a truce, a decision that has also been confirmed;</p>
<p class="contents">- we should work towards developing, and devolving responsibility to, all of the actors involved in the Palestinian political framework, even with a change in the government in prospect, and propose to both of the negotiating parties that they acknowledge the agreements and the road map;</p>
<p class="contents">- we should work towards achieving a new chapter of mutual legitimisation with the prospect of a definitive solution in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, we can only confirm our opposition to any unilateral initiative that might jeopardise the possibility of finding a solution to unresolved issues such as that relating to borders, up to and including the status of Jerusalem.</p>

We supported democratic elections in Palestine and ended up with a government run by a movement which figures on our list of international terrorists. Continuing financial aid to the Hamas-led government would lend support to a regime which denies the right of its neighbour to exist; stopping financial support renders the Palestinian State unviable, puts the jobs of 140 000 public servants at risk and ultimately adds to tension.</p>
<p class="contents">All political groups in this House are divided about what we should do. Mine is no exception. We supported the Palestinian Authority with USD 600 million a year because we wanted to influence the peace process. If we do not, others will. Hamas needs USD 170 million a month to pay its wage bill. Iran said ten days ago that it will give 50 million; on Saturday Russia offered help; the Gulf countries have promised some 80 million. By contrast, Israel is holding back tax revenue which belongs to the Palestinians and the US Treasury tightened the screws on Palestinian cash this week when it banned American nationals from doing business with the first democratically elected Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p class="contents">What message is the European Union sending by stopping aid to the Palestinians? The Council wants to stress that aid is conditional on an explicit political commitment. The answer that a delegation from this House was given by moderate Palestinians and by EU officials working there was that we are perceived to punish Palestinians for electing a Hamas-led government.</p>
<p class="contents">President-in-Office, Commissioner, people read the headlines, they do not always read the details. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE)</span> And you know from your own country that an opposition party, once it gets into government, does not always do the things it said it would when it was in opposition. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Liberals and Democrats urge Hamas to recognise the right of Israel to exist; they must recognise that being a democratically elected government brings responsibilities. However, we must understand their perception as settlement after settlement is built on the West Bank that Israel denies their right to enjoy a viable State.</p>
<p class="contents">The longer we delay recognition of that government, the longer ordinary Palestinians will suffer and the longer Israeli's will continue to live in fear in insecurity. It is incumbent on us all to create a new dynamic in the Middle East, taking advantage in the change in the protagonists. Hamas must be made to acknowledge that they will get no quarter from the international community until they renounce violence, recognise Israel and recognise the commitments to the Roadmap.</p>
<p class="contents">Israel must be told that its policy of settlement outwith its borders must stop and that parts of its wall must come down. Officially Hamas's ceasefire is unbroken although there are those who would wish to have it otherwise.</p>
<p class="contents">As long as that ceasefire holds there is hope of bringing the two sides together again for dialogue and negotiation. Let us, the European Union take the initiative, not leave it to countries like Iran.</p>

The population has been hit by a brutal blockade, because they have chosen people the West does not like. Now they are isolated behind Israel’s dividing wall, with no ability to create a healthy economy for themselves. The only people to gain from what is now happening are the extremists. There is, in actual fact, an imminent danger of everything exploding.</p>
<p class="contents">I was one of seven Members of Parliament’s five large groups who visited the area two weeks ago and had meetings with representatives of all the parties in the Palestinian Parliament, including Change and Reform, which is Hamas’s parliamentary wing. It became clear that they recognise the pre-1967 borders and, therefore, Israel. Hamas has now, for 18 months, refrained from using serious violence against Israel, while Israel has systematically bombarded Gaza and frequently killed civilians, including children. Hamas has not set its face against the PLO sticking to the negotiating policy it has adopted. If the EU really wished to do so, it would not, in short, be difficult for it to find means of cooperating with the Palestinian authorities so that peaceful development might be strengthened and Hamas made more democratic.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not, however, what we are doing. Moreover, we accept a situation in which Israel sets aside all of the EU’s conditions. The EU’s and the United States’s double standard is all too apparent. Why should Israel not recognise Palestine and the pre-1967 borders? Why should they not respect the ruling given by the Court of Justice in The Hague and remove the illegal wall? Why should they not call a halt to the annexation of East Jerusalem? In defiance of the so-called roadmap etc, they are now putting up buildings in E1. Why should they not pay the Palestinians’ own money back, that is to say all the money that they are illegally withholding? Mr Solana has said that they ought to do so. Mrs Ferrero-Waldner has also now said very clearly that they should do so. They are not doing so, however, and absolutely nothing is happening. Lawlessness is on the increase, and it is our, that is to say the EU’s, responsibility because we allow Israel blithely to ignore all the agreements. When we meet the Palestinians, it is, however, impossible to explain the double standard we have got used to exercising in relation to Israel. They cannot understand this approach, our employment of which is perhaps the absolutely most dangerous thing we are doing at the moment. It is not our money dealings but our unsustainable double standard that is the problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In return, an old police station located in Ras Al-Amud, in the centre of the Arab quarter of East Jerusalem, will be handed over.</p>
<p class="contents">Between 13 and 15 April, young people were killed, bombings took place in Gaza, 41 Palestinians were wounded and 10 homes were occupied by soldiers. I did not compile this list myself, it arrives every day, on a daily basis, from the European Commission in Jerusalem. There is nothing stopping anyone from knowing about it or looking at it.</p>
<p class="contents">In Gaza, the people are being bombed and starved, as you are only too well aware. In Gaza, the agreements that were made between the European Union and the Quartet in relation to Rafah and the Tul Karm crossing point to Rafah can be enforced by the European Union. The Tul Karm crossing point is closed, and the issue is not just a humanitarian one, and it is not just a matter of the Palestinians inside Gaza starving: the problem is one of freedom and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ask ourselves a question and then revert the terms. What should we be asking? We should not only be politely asking the Israeli Government to pay back customs monies, which were well and truly stolen, or to stop building the illegal wall.</p>
<p class="contents">We must push the Israeli Government, not just ask it to do something. We are continuing to demand, and rightly so in my view, that Hamas, for example, denounces violence, but we must also set store by the fact that Hamas has not carried out any violence for 18 months now and says that it wants to continue like that.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made demands, and Hamas has rejected them; but have we spoken to Hamas? Have any of you spoken to Hamas? They told us, the ones who went to Palestine, that we had not. No one has tried to talk to Hamas! It is really crucial that we do not appear as though we are collectively punishing the Palestinian population. For although projects have merely been suspended, the fact is that they are at a standstill. The European Commission in East Jerusalem has indicated that it will stop some project or other; it is the Palestinian population, not Hamas, that will suffer.</p>
<p class="contents">Basically, the Palestinians, like us, are divided: 235 000 people voted for Hamas and 213 000 for Al-Fatah and other parties. We must have the courage to admit the extent to which we are responsible for a policy that will come to nothing in the Middle East if we do not treat Israel and Palestine in the same way. It is really essential that we negotiate, just as many Israelis are saying, so let us also listen to those voices in Israel that are pleading for us to negotiate.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us try to understand what is happening in the Israeli Government: if a person such as Mr Liebermann, a racist and xenophobe, assumes power, what will we say? The European Union really can say and do more, if we are serious about having two peoples and two States, instead of what is happening now: one State that exists and another one that does not exist and is being constantly eroded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The spending of taxpayers’ money in Palestine by the European Union has long been a scandal in that these monies have never been fully accounted for and have almost certainly found their way into terrorist pockets.

It is unthinkable that taxpayers’ money should be handed straight over to an authority, a sort of government, that does not renounce violence and is opposed to another state’s right to exist being recognised. It is for that reason that it is unthinkable that they should be given the money, although we do know, on the other hand, that there are others who will stand in our stead and gain influence, and that is not a particularly good outcome. The only way of getting policy right in this area is to welcome the suspension of payments to the authority, while at the same time finding ways in which we may help the population directly, but this aid must have a high degree of visibility, so that the people on the ground see us as supporters of social and humanitarian processes, and so that it dawns on the population that opting for peace is worth it, for it is peace that most Palestinians – like most Israelis – want. They have had enough of violence and want to live together peaceably in two viable states, whose continued existence in the region is guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is with this in mind that we must continue to explore the ways in which another legitimate authority in the Palestinian sphere, namely President Abbas, can be helpful and what room for manoeuvre he possesses, for he – in exactly the same way as the Palestinian parliament – was directly elected by the people and possesses a democratic legitimacy of his own. He has renounced violence; he has recognised the State of Israel’s right to exist, and the Commission must consider in what ways this might be given shape in terms of actions and support.</p>
<p class="contents">These two possibilities are alternatives to paying the money to the Hamas-run Palestinian Authority, which has responded to the suicide bombing by making appalling statements, while the Israeli Prime Minister Mr Olmert has been measured in his words. I hope that the process may be set in motion by the continued use of well-judged language on our side too, and also wish to thank the presidency for its evident efforts at guiding the process down this path. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am not going to ask you what you are going to do now, but why you have done it now.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the logic <span class="bold"></span> I am not talking about the justification but, rather, of the logic <span class="bold"></span> behind a decision that has immediately led to a resumption of violence, including the tragic bombing in Tel Aviv which produced ten victims and which constitutes a breach of Hamas’ truce; a decision that has led to the outbreak of a humanitarian crisis in Gaza and in the West Bank, with no alternative plan ready to be brought into operation; to Palestine’s swing towards Iran at the very time when the breakdown of negotiations on nuclear power with that country has us fearing the worst; and, finally, to the political weakening of Mahmoud Abbas who, if we support him too openly, is in danger of looking like a puppet operated by the West?</p>
<p class="contents">If, in short, elections were to take place tomorrow, I fear that it would no longer be 44% of the votes that Hamas would gain, but perhaps 70%. That is very serious. Some Members here, and I am one of them, made a bet that Hamas would embark upon a course of political resistance if given the time to do so. That is an absurd bet, but the history of terrorist movements shows that there is good reason for such absurdity. What is the reason, then, for a brutal decision that has had incalculable political consequences? Palestine is on the brink of civil war, the public services are collapsing and European policy has the image of sticking like a piece of chewing gum to US policy.</p>
<p class="contents">People had better not say to us that their patience was exhausted, that Hamas had been warned and that humanitarian aid will continue to be granted. The enormity of this decision warrants more plausible explanations. No one in this Chamber is unaware of the fact that a terrorist movement does not lay down its weapons without negotiating and especially not if the purpose of its resistance continues to be a factor. In Palestine, the occupation is omnipresent. As Mrs Morgantini said, there have been almost 50 deaths since January 2006, the construction of the wall continues, the banks of the river Jordan are being annexed and East Jerusalem is being suffocated.</p>
<p class="contents">What kind of game are we playing, then? Why are the Palestinians being punished? If nothing else, let us dare no longer to talk about money, but to turn our attentions back to the road map and to schedule an international conference focusing on Palestine and on peace. That was the second stage of the road map, and it is what we are waiting for.</p>

I regret certain of the interventions made during the last half hour and regard them as excessively partisan.</p>
<p class="contents">This House, like Europe, has supported the idea of the Palestinian people having a state of their own for longer than anyone can remember, but we have now reached a point at which it has to be spelled out that no democratic election can legitimise terrorism, anti-Semitism and racism; no democratic election can legitimise a constitution that incites genocide and teems with Nazi slogans, references to Jewish world conspiracies such as that of the Elders of Zion, and similar Nazi propaganda. That is no basis on which Europe can negotiate and grant aid. Israel’s misdeeds – or whatever you want to call them – its mistakes, its use of violence, are not capable of being compared with the quite fundamental historical issue that we have come up against here. I welcome this stance.</p>
<p class="contents">In order that this conflict be resolved, much has been demanded of Israel, and much remains to be demanded of it. It is necessary not only that Israel should recognise the Palestinian state, but also itself bring it into being and make it viable. It must vacate the illegally occupied territories, hand over East Jerusalem, do away with the death lists, relax its economic stranglehold and hand back the territory it gained by building the wall. The list could well become an endless one, but there is one thing that must never again be demanded of Israel, and that is that it should bargain for its very existence with a government whose manifesto included the annihilation of the Jews and the destruction of Israel, a government that declared, immediately on being elected, that it would not lose sight of that goal, that it was – of course – not daft, that it would pursue its objective pragmatically and step by step, and that it would not, of course, not make it too obvious to the West that that was what they were about, and yet that is what they want to do – and today we have got to the point where this has to be said loud and clear; thank you for having done just that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to the official report by the UN special coordinator for the Middle East to the Security Council, 40 people lost their lives last month, including at least three Palestinian children. And yet the vicious circle of violence continued with suicide attacks. We condemn the acts of violence against unarmed civilians, which can only cause pain and additional hardship.</p>
<p class="contents">This escalation in the situation is not helping to resolve the problem. The European Union is being called on and must also play its part in addressing the situation, by making an active contribution to stabilisation and to the resumption of talks to resolve the Palestinian problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Here, we want to express our support for the recent statement by the Palestinian President, Mahmoud Abbas, who is expressing his readiness to resume talks with Israel, and our disappointment, Commissioner, at the recent rejection of this proposal by the Israeli Government.</p>
<p class="contents">How in truth can the situation be stabilised when the European Council decides to freeze funding to the Palestinian Authority, support funds connected to whether or not the Palestinian people can survive – albeit with difficulty – and, at the same time, strengthen its state structures as a guarantee for the future creation of an independent Palestinian state?</p>
<p class="contents">What message are we sending with this decision to the Israelis, I wonder? How does the state of Israel see this? Possibly as a blank cheque for the continuation of the acts of violence and economic isolation, at a time when the international community is punishing the Palestinians. Who knows how late it will be by the time the quartet meets on 9 May.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to comment on the statement by my honourable friend Mr Batten, about the 'sad' decision taken by the Palestinian people. How on earth can we qualify as 'sad' a decision taken in a free, democratic manner, while under occupation, by a people in elections which we have called fair and transparent? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I always questioned Western legitimisation and acceptance of Hamas candidates committed to armed struggle and to wiping the state of Israel off the map. I took the trouble of reading their 1988 charter, which is chillingly medieval, bigoted and steeped in incitement to anti-Semitism and support for Jihad and Sharia law. With hindsight we should have spelt it out more clearly, as we were clearly warned by Israel at the time that Hamas candidates should not have been allowed to stand unless they foreswore terrorist violence and recognised the right of the State of Israel to exist and they were committed to the undertakings of the PLO and the agreements made by the PLO on the Oslo peace accord, with the Quartet and on the roadmap for peace.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas’s spiritual mentors in Egypt, were not allowed to stand on a platform advocating a violent overthrow of their government. Furthermore, the entire generous aid package to the Palestinian Authority was predicated on a commitment to a two-state solution, achieved by peaceful negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally find it abominable that the Hamas government openly supported the suicide Passover attack in Tel Aviv recently and continue to allow rocket attacks which fall indiscriminately and deliberately on civilian targets in Israel: a war crime under international law.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, you know someone by the friends they keep, and last week allegedly Osama bin Laden himself, as well as President Ahmadinejad of Iran, endorsed the Islamist agenda of Hamas in their so-called Holy War against Israel. We must therefore find ways now to bypass Hamas in the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people, perhaps through UNRWA, NGOs etc., and raise the visibility of the European Union in the process. We cannot give direct budgetary aid to an unreformed Hamas leading the Palestinian authority, that is completely unacceptable to the people who vote for me in London. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Teachers and doctors have not been paid for months and it is the Palestinian people, civilians, who are paying the price of the EU’s position, which represents a collective punishment against the Palestinian people for their democratic choices. Not only that, but it is also utterly counter-productive. To suspend funding is to undermine the very political and judicial reforms which the EU has been supporting; to suspend funding is to drive people into the arms of extremists and into the arms of Iran in particular, with risks of much greater fundamentalist influence.</p>
<p class="contents">You talk about principles, but it is vital that the EU is consistent. You cannot make demands of Hamas that you do not make of Israel. Yes, mutual recognition and an end to violence on both sides are urgently needed, but it has to be on both sides. Israel has to recognise Palestine and to stop its state violence too. So my question to the Council is this: in the coming days the Israeli Government will be formed. Will the Council ask the new Israeli Government if it is committed to the roadmap and to the past agreement as presented by the Quartet, and will it ask if the Israeli Government is committed to a cessation of violence against the Palestinians, just as we ask Hamas to do all in its power to end violence against Israel? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Allow me to use this opportunity to thank the Commission very much for consulting us and cooperating with us almost every day in this very particular situation.</p>
<p class="contents">We fully support the Quartet and the roadmap – the Quartet because of Russia. We have to make one thing very clear: this is not the consequence of fully democratic elections, but a failure of the Palestinian partner to recognise a legal base for mutual financing to recognise the Oslo, Paris and Cairo agreements and, of course, to recognise the State of Israel. We have to be here with humanitarian aid and here I support the position of our group. Our European aid should be visible and I deeply doubt that the United Nations Relief and Works Agency is actually a good thing to bring European visibility. We have to try to find another tool.</p>
<p class="contents">Financial supervision and international control mechanisms are of paramount importance, and here we will follow your intention and we will support you. We know that EUR 165 million has already been paid to Palestinians, so we have not stopped helping, we are there, and I think the Commission should be more vocal about the fact that we have paid the money to support the emergence of a viable Palestinian state.</p>
<p class="contents">Where are we now? We are in a position in which the Muslim Brotherhood pilot project Hamas has to turn to Iran to beg for money, making Saudis and Egyptians furious. This is a great success, because it leads to deep cleavage within Hamas and we are already weakening Hamas. However, we need to strengthen Palestinian liberals, we need a European initiative for democracy and human rights, and an international financial human rights tool to help the Palestinians strengthen moderate, liberal political parties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was a correct one taken easily – not lightly, but easily – because it is an adherence to principles. However, the difficult task now begins.</p>
<p class="contents">We are at a crossroads. I am certain, looking back in history, that if there was a terrorist list 30 years ago, the PLO would have been on it. What was said today about Hamas, and whatever there is in its statute and its declarations, also applied to the PLO 50 years ago. And yet the PLO became an interlocutor with Israel in seeking peace. Therefore we must spare no effort in encouraging Hamas to change its position and come round to a position that we hope will promote the peace process. It is not that difficult to achieve, provided that we give the organisation some space: perhaps renunciation of violence, maybe an indefinite ceasefire for a long period of time, or something of that nature.</p>
<p class="contents">The second difficult task is yours, Madam Commissioner; I am sure you will do it with great effectiveness and dedication.

I repeat – and I stand by this – that there was no choice. I think – and I thank all those who have supported this position – that the European Union is a community of values which stands by principles and cannot deviate from those principles. This is something that is shared unanimously in the Council, and I am sure this position will also prevail in the future – it must prevail.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time many speakers have insisted that we should not forget the Palestinian people, and we do not. Mr Kasoulides, Mr Brok and others have said that we should make it very clear to the Palestinian people that it is the European Union that is helping them. Of course, there is a risk and a danger that the Palestinians will turn to other sources. We must make it clear to them that we are willing to help them. They must understand that there is not only the willingness but the wish and the desire of the European Union to help them. But there must be an understanding that we cannot deviate from principles.</p>
<p class="contents">What Mr Watson said about hoping that things that are said when a party is in opposition will change once they are in government is very much the hope of the European Union. Indeed, it will probably take time, but the Union must make it very clear and must work towards that end. That is what we are doing.</p>
<p class="contents">Many speakers have referred to the need for even-handedness. I would like to make it very clear that the Council in its resolution and in its conclusions over the years, and especially in the past month, has never left a doubt that we demand from Israel the same compliance with international obligations that we ask from the Hamas government. I would like to quote two sentences from the last Council conclusions to this effect: ‘The Council called on Israel to desist from any action, such as settlement activities and the construction of the separation barrier on Palestinian land, that is contrary to international law and threatens the viability of an agreed two-state solution. The Council urged Israel to take steps to improve the humanitarian and economic situation of the Palestinians including by resuming transfers of the withheld Palestinian tax and customs revenues’.</p>
<p class="contents">This is very clear language and we are using the same kind of urgent tone with Israel when it comes to compliance with international law. We will certainly continue to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The Middle East Quartet will meet at Foreign Minister level on 9 May, and of course President Abbas’s recent appeal to hold an international peace conference will be a subject at that meeting. I cannot of course prejudge what the decision will be, but this is certainly going to be a subject which will be discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Kasoulides, I agree with you we are at a crossroads: we must make the right decisions; we must help the Palestinian people, but at the same time we must stick with our principles. This must be the continued basis for our policy, it certainly will be the basis for the policy of the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I thank the majority of Members that have given us support in this very difficult situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Why do we not just give funds to the Hamas-led government? We have been very clear on that. There are certain principles that even every democratic government also has to maintain. That is absolutely clear for every democratically elected government, it should be clear and we have clearly outlined it. I would like to repeat that we have not stopped aid to the Palestinian people, as some have said. On the contrary, we have accelerated our aid by already giving more than EUR 100 million at the very beginning of this year. At the same time last year, we had not even given one fifth of that, as I mentioned very clearly. It is just a matter of listening to what we are saying. It is true that we have to make this aid very visible to the Palestinian people. They have to know we have not let them down, but at the same time it is very clear that we cannot give direct aid to a government that is not responding to this very clear demand on the principles.</p>
<p class="contents">However, regarding the second question, it is also true that we will indeed also want to support Mahmoud Abbas in a very cautious way because we do not want to undermine his position. However, at the same time we want to find ways and means of providing an opportunity for the help to go on, and that is why I also mentioned that we need an international supervisory mechanism to ensure that any financial contribution really goes to the right places. We are already working with the United Nations, the IMF, the World Bank and other big donors in order to see how we can set up such a mechanism. Of course we have to do it rather quickly, and this also goes for health, education and other issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Are we applying double standards? As our Council Presidency said, we are applying the same criteria that we have applied. We have always mentioned very clearly to the Israelis that they too have quite a number of obligations. In addition, in September 2005, for instance, the Quartet expressed very clearly its concern that settlement expansion must stop and Israel must remove unauthorised outposts. It also pointed out that we continue to note with concern the route of the Israeli separation barrier, particularly as it results in the confiscation of Palestinian land, cuts off the movement of people and goods and thus also undermines Palestinian trust in the roadmap.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we could have not been clearer, but what we want to see now is the new Israeli Government engaging with the Palestinian Authority. Here, President Mahmoud Abbas has shown his readiness.</p>
<p class="contents">For the time being we cannot do anything else but clearly follow this line. I hope that also, from the side of the Hamas-led Government, they understand our messages. We will want to give them a little bit more time, but they should now also be more flexible in their positions, because then there is also a chance to work with a government that wants peace by peaceful means. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU decision to end direct funding for the democratically-elected Palestinian Authority is likely to have disastrous consequences for the delivery of basic services in cash-strapped Palestine.</p>
<p class="contents">As a defender of human rights and an ‘honest broker’ in the Middle East the EU should be consistent in its approach to third countries which flout international law. Refusal to recognise another state or the rights of its people is a charge of great magnitude. Yet it is a charge that could also be directed at the Israeli authorities. Therefore we should reconsider the decision to suspend GBP 340 million aid to the Palestinian authority in the light of the precedent of funding for successive Israeli governments.</p>
<p class="contents">For its part, Hamas should recognise that its ability to fulfil its duties and serve the people will be linked to its willingness to renounce violence and recognise the rights of the people of Israel. I hope Hamas will commit to peaceful means. However, my view is that cooperation is the only viable policy option and that isolation will only exacerbate the desperate conditions in Palestine, conditions which give rise to frustrations and violence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
