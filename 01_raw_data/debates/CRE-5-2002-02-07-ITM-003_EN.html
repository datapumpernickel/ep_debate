<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hermange (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, almost two years ago, we adopted the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The right to knowledge and, consequently, the right to know how to read, write and count are part of this Charter.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the opportunity to learn how to read and write should be available to all as a fundamental right, and parents, teachers and politicians should recognise their obligation to ensure that this opportunity is grasped by all, in particular because, when people cannot express themselves with words, they often do so with their fists, as they feel excluded from school, business or even their own family.</p>
<p class="contents">This right to knowledge is not currently realised, however, as 10 to 20% of the population of the European Union, or as many as 30 % if we count the candidate countries, are considered to be illiterate: 45% in Portugal, 35% in Italy, 22% in Ireland and Great Britain, 15% in Germany and France and, to add the candidate countries: 42% in Slovenia and Poland, 33% in Hungary, 29% in Bulgaria and 20% in Lithuania.</p>
<p class="contents">Illiteracy increases the divide between privileged members of society who are in a situation of relative security and those who are disadvantaged and marginalised, who do not have access to the labour market and consequently suffer financial insecurity, psychological isolation and social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">From an economic perspective, we all know that illiteracy also affects our businesses and their modernisation: it leads to increases in costs relating to the accident rate, employers’ contributions and time taken to complete work because of the need for additional supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">However, although the European Commission and our institutions have produced a number of documents, there are still a number of obstacles: gaps due to a lack of reliable data, the lack of clarity of certain programmes proposed and policies which are still insufficiently integrated. This matter, which I consider to be serious, Commissioner, should also be addressed through integrated policies associating social, and cultural and educational objectives, and should be discussed at policy level to increase awareness of this phenomenon.</p>
<p class="contents">It is with this in mind that I call on the Commission to submit to Parliament and the Council a Green Paper on Illiteracy, together with a timetable for achieving tangible objectives along the lines of the social agenda, precisely defining the measures to be taken at European level. In the same vein, I call on the Commission, in connection with the employment guidelines, to propose specific indicators and benchmarks relating to illiteracy, in close cooperation with the social players. I also ask the Commission to submit to Parliament, each year, a written report, incorporating statistical data, on progress towards the objectives of combating illiteracy and social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">We should all be aware that this matter is a key issue for development and for harmony in our societies. We are not always aware of this, which is why I would also like us to be able to set up, not another observatory but, within the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training, based at Thessaloniki, a sort of European illiteracy monitoring centre, as suggested by my group, specifically by submitting Amendment No 5.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to say, with regard to the amendments tabled recently, in particular by the Group of the Greens, that I am in favour of Amendment No 4 and that I would have been in favour of Amendment No 2 had it been considered as an additional item. As for Amendment No 3, even though I am not against it in principle - the amendment requesting a Green Paper on illiteracy and mathematical illiteracy - I call for a vote against it because I think that, in the wording “Green Paper on Illiteracy”, the problem of mathematical illiteracy is obviously included. Lastly, I cannot accept Amendment No 1.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, those were the points I wanted to mention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The idea that functional illiteracy affects over 10% of the European Union’s population is horrifying, to say the least, in a developed society in which Europe is pursuing ambitious goals such as those set by the Lisbon Council: firstly, the need for every citizen to have the necessary skills to be able to live and work in the new information society; and secondly, to make Europe the most competitive, dynamic economy in the world. I feel that we must approach the debate on illiteracy, or rather the problem itself, with great vigour, taking this approach and with these goals before us.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution focuses on certain points which I would like to mention briefly: firstly, knowing how to read and write is a fundamental right which must be guaranteed to all people; secondly, combating illiteracy is essential because it secures and strengthens the freedom of the individual; thirdly, the task of combating this disturbing situation must be undertaken by society as a whole and by public authorities and administrations in particular; fourthly, ‘returning’ illiteracy, which particularly affects elderly people, especially those in danger of social exclusion – who, as they lose their self-sufficiency, are obliged to live in sheltered accommodation, leaving their family and socio-cultural environment behind them for good – is a scourge which must be combated. Therefore, governments should promote an incisive initiative through Community programmes, while it is up to you, Commissioner – and, as we know, you are very aware of the problem – to honour the undertaking to address this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Furthermore, we must remember that, as she herself has said, between 10 and 20% of the European population is functionally illiterate. The situation of these people severely restricts their ability to find decent work and to integrate themselves into the society in which they live. They also have difficulties in reading some of the official documents which we regularly present.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation really contributes to the fact that, in a prosperous continent such as Europe, between 18 and 20% of people live in poverty, if we consider that they are below 60% of the average in their country of origin. This is an intolerable situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur proposes a series of objectives which we agree with and which must be taken into account in future decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, a definition of the different forms of illiteracy – which we still do not have – with common criteria and mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, common action against the situation of functional illiteracy, with an open method of cooperation between the various countries. This fight against illiteracy must be incorporated into other Union policies and must be taken into account whenever we talk about education and training. There must be a timetable for specific achievements, and Parliament must take account of the progress made, as the rapporteur has said. The matter must be integrated into equal opportunities policy. We have just discussed another report which speaks about this and we are perfectly aware that illiteracy figures in all countries are always higher amongst women. And finally, there must be participation by social agents and the sectors involved.</p>
<p class="contents">This participation is crucial. In previous programmes to combat poverty, as you will recall, there were concrete projects which spoke of the crucial importance of participation by all the sectors involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, there are increasingly pockets of marginalisation in the cities, there is an immigrant population establishing itself in our cities and that means that the problem of illiteracy, and particularly functional illiteracy, is a really serious problem today, because it is always linked to poverty, to marginalisation and to social exclusion. As defenders of human rights – and this is one of the most fundamental rights, as has been pointed out here – we have an obligation to draw attention to this matter so that programmes are set up to resolve the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The worst affected are the young people who come from these sections of the population, who do not have employment opportunities, or in some cases find insecure jobs, without any opportunity to improve their working conditions. Since the Lisbon Summit, becoming the most competitive information society in the world has been one of our objectives. If the information society is fundamental to work in the future, these young people who can hardly find work under normal conditions, will not have any opportunity unless we integrate them into this information and knowledge society.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore urgent to carry out programmes and actions by means of the Green Paper which the rapporteur is requesting, so that these sections of the population, which are increasing with the immigration of recent years, are offered a solution to this fundamental problem, so that they can access other systems of personal welfare. We always focus on health, housing and employment, but this is a fundamental problem and resolving it should be a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">I once again congratulate the rapporteur on this wonderful initiative, which draws attention to a problem that is still facing us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We know that Europe is one of the most prosperous continents in the world but, despite that, a substantial number of our citizens live in conditions of extreme poverty and social marginalisation. One of the parameters for measuring these conditions, in addition to income, is, without a doubt, illiteracy, for illiteracy is a cause of exclusion and prevents access to human rights, as the rapporteur rightly said in her report. Illiteracy, understood to mean either a lack of basic education or ‘returning’ illiteracy, is causing an increasing divide between those who are privileged and enjoy relative security and those who are disadvantaged and marginalised, who do not have access to work, who are in danger of isolation and do not participate in social life.</p>
<p class="contents">Illiteracy also represents an expense, a cost both for businesses and in social terms, as well as a cause of exclusion. It is an ongoing problem in Europe, although it is not thought of as a cost, but there are no reliable data available for analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">Combating illiteracy and social marginalisation is now essentially the responsibility of the Member States, but at the Lisbon Summit – as has already been said – the Heads of State and Government set themselves the goal of making Europe the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world, etc, etc. Moreover, the European Social Agenda was adopted at Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, combating illiteracy and marginalisation must become one of the priorities of the Union and the Member States, with all the relevant policies applied in the context of a global, integrated strategy. We therefore firmly support the rapporteur’s calls for a Green Paper and an Action Plan. I will not go into their contents because they are already outlined in the report. However, we do call strongly upon the Commission to promote these texts: Parliament will support them and stand shoulder to shoulder with the Commission to ensure the Council endorses them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even I will readily concede that I am not in a position to fill in my German tax return forms without expert help, let alone actually fill in an application form for a project promoted by Europe. It is, though, surely not this sort of documents to which this report refers.</p>
<p class="contents">People who have difficulty with reading and writing are restricted in their ability to participate in the life of society, and, when it comes to earning a living, are relegated to work for which minimal qualifications are required and which is therefore badly paid. On economic, but above all on ethical and moral grounds, it is our duty to preserve people from this fate in this century of the information society and of lifelong learning. Parliament is therefore doing the right thing with this report by describing a problem which is often shamefacedly hushed up, and offering solutions to it.</p>
<p class="contents">That has been done in this report as thoroughly as necessary and as briefly as possible, by the rapporteur, Mrs Hermange. European legislation, though, is limited in this task to measures of development and support, as general and vocational education falls within the remit of the Member States, and that is where it should stay. The Member States’ sole duty is to make real the right to education which is now also enshrined in Article 14 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The work of the monitoring centre which the report calls for should be carried on in the already-existing Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop) in Thessaloniki, using the resources available there. That makes sense in view of the costs involved and of the relevance to the functions Cedefop performs in any case, and so I ask you to support our Amendment No 5.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also subscribe to and support a European Year devoted to books and to reading, in view of our young people's widespread mania for television. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As Marie-Thérèse Hermange, our rapporteur, reminded us, the right of each individual to know how to read, write and count is the practical basis that enables these individuals to exercise their rights as citizens. This right must be guaranteed by practical measures wherever the scourge of illiteracy is present; it is therefore enlightening to be reminded of the figures.</p>
<p class="contents">In practical terms, I believe it must be possible to develop these actions in two directions. We need to make the connection between illiteracy and unemployment, on the one hand – for example there are the proposed actions targeting illiteracy in the workplace – in order to ensure the coherent implementation of the decisions made in Lisbon, and between illiteracy and social inclusion on the other. We should devise actions for social inclusion that are independent of the professional situation of the people concerned, and I am thinking of women in particular. I believe the case of migrant women must be considered in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also calls for the creation of a monitoring centre, and I think it is realistic to plan this within an existing tool, Cedefop, since compatible indicators and benchmarks between Member States are the basis of any coherent Community policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I believe that this report must be seen as a tool to facilitate the drawing-up of a measure involving local, national and Community levels, each with their own specific responsibilities. Today, the handling of these issues requires Community initiatives and the impetus to encourage the Member States to make decisions that are essential for their people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the first time I have had the pleasure of seeing her this year and I am sure she will be just as successful in her work in the second part of the legislature as she was during the first two and a half years.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that this document is extremely important, and it is crucial that Mrs Hermange has stressed that illiteracy does not just mean not knowing how to read and write, but not understanding discussions and being unable to move about in modern society, where it is not enough to know how to read and write but where a certain culture and <span class="italic">savoir-faire</span> are necessary for a person to have any status. In some States of the European Union, this form of illiteracy is as high as 30 to 35%. I would therefore stress the importance of resolving this issue. There is another Commission document on the issue, which has been referred to the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport – on that famous subject ‘lifelong learning’ – but this is a question of learning not the languages of other States but our own. Well then, I am concerned by what happens as a result of this kind of illiteracy during elections. Voters who are illiterate in this way do not know what or whom they are voting for when they go to the ballots and they do not understand the programmes. This means that democracy is diminished. Pensioners, I must say, know exactly which way to vote when they go to the ballots, but we must be sure that everyone understands why and for whom they are voting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The nightmare scenario for the future is that society will be divided into two groups: the initiated, who know everything and are plugged into the knowledge society, and those who have been left behind and will therefore be marginalised in society. Nor is there any doubt that this is a European issue, which is why I also sincerely support what the rapporteur has said about open coordination being the best method of achieving progress in this area. The only way is to make it genuinely very embarrassing for the Member States if they do not do something in this area, and for the status of their efforts to be made as public as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We must proceed with the proposal on lifelong learning as quickly as possible, and I naturally hope that the Commission will include the views adopted by Parliament today in the proposal on lifelong learning, for that is where they in fact belong. I also think that we must endeavour to get some new thinking into this area. We must bear in mind that, if adults are to learn about a subject, going back to school is not an option. Instead, they have to learn in some other way. They have to learn in the context of the labour market; they have to have time off work to be able to go to classes; and they have to learn through the process of schools and teaching coming out to the workplace. I believe it is very important to establish the connection between work and learning so that we can continue with lifelong learning.</p>
<p class="contents">The last thing I want to say concerns an idea for the Commissioner that could perhaps be taken further and might also put pressure on the Member States to demonstrate that they are doing something in this area. It is the possibility of introducing ‘knowledge accounts’ for the individual Member States through which the latter would simply report each year on how much they had done in the area of lifelong learning to combat illiteracy and promote knowledge and education in general. ‘Knowledge accounts’ are a good idea, Commissioner, which I hope you will consider. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I consider it a thoroughly positive thing that we live in a performance-oriented society, one which wants to become the most competitive, the most dynamic and also the most reliant on knowledge. That being so, it is of course quite deplorable that we see society actually disintegrating and that we have in our society a new grouping which is weak in social and educational terms. In view of this, I support the report and am of the opinion that there is a need to address these documents that have been mentioned several times today in the context of the Green Paper and that the amendment on the monitoring centre tabled by Mr Pronk and Mrs Stauner should be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to address a second aspect of this topic, the issue of to what extent it is possible to compensate for differences between the various Member States in education, training, schooling, and the current state of knowledge. The idea of States retaining their own competences in this area is, after all, pretty obsolete. This is where we should be reorienting ourselves and also accepting a degree of harmonisation, even if that were to lead to substantial restructuring in certain countries. It is not fair to tell the citizens of this EU of ours that there is freedom of movement and of establishment when differing school systems and recognition of training standards mean that there are significant differences, and therefore discrimination, when it comes to actually putting it into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">We should, for this reason, be taking this report as an opportunity to take steps towards harmonisation in the cultural sphere.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamantopoulou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, today's report on illiteracy is a very important contribution to the wider issue at European level, i.e. our review of the basic skills of literacy and a working knowledge of arithmetic as prerequisites to social integration, as prerequisites to the European Union's achieving the Lisbon objective of a knowledge-based economy.</p>
<p class="contents">We have, without doubt, entered a new stage, in which basic skills do not stop at reading and writing and now include IT skills, high-tech skills, entrepreneurship, foreign languages, interpersonal communication skills and social skills. All this can be summed up nowadays in four simple words: the need to learn. The Commission's policy in this sector will be expressed in a series of initiatives and programmes which are currently in the pipeline as a result of cooperation between the Council, Parliament and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">My first point is that the Lisbon Council in 2000 called for the Commission to draft a report on the specific future objectives of education and training systems. This report was presented in Stockholm and we are currently preparing a programme of work on the subject of the universal acquisition of basic skills, which will be presented in Barcelona. The acquisition of basic skills is one of the 13 basic objectives for the education and training systems of the European Union. This objective includes defining indicators to measure over a ten-year period the extent to which Member States ensure that all their citizens acquire a working knowledge of reading, writing and arithmetic. This is the first specific indicator which will reflect developments in this sector over a ten-year period.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to remind the House of the communication which the Commission published in November 2001 on creating a European area of lifelong learning, which stresses that lifelong learning depends on acquiring basic skills.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I should like to mention the forthcoming action plan on skills and mobility in the European Union which the Commission, by which I mean President Prodi and I, are due to announce next week, the aim of which is to achieve a real European job market based on mobility and a minimum level of common skills at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">My fourth point concerns the Community strategy on combating social exclusion. As you know, the bottom line in the national actions plans of most countries is that there is a direct link between social exclusion and the acquisition of basic skills. And both the Equal programme and the Social Fund make provision for funding for individual programmes relating to access to basic skills, especially by groups subject to discrimination. And we must not forget that certain groups, such as people with disabilities and immigrants, must overcome even greater problems in order to acquire basic skills.</p>
<p class="contents">My fifth point concerns cooperation at international level, in other words, our international strategy. The European Commission is working with the OECD, ΑSΕΜ and G8 to support direct action to get basic skills put on the corresponding agendas.</p>
<p class="contents">Which brings me to the report and, more specifically, to the application of the open method of coordination. As I mentioned in relation to the strategy on exclusion, we can take it as given that the Council of education ministers will approve the open method of coordination on common objectives for education and training systems next week.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Green Paper is concerned, I must express a certain reticence, mainly because numerous new policy initiatives have been started, important matters are in the pipeline in various Councils and we are now in a position to take action on illiteracy; it would perhaps mean additional delays if we were to proceed with the Green Paper, given that we now have most of the information we need from work carried out in previous years.</p>
<p class="contents">Which brings me to the recommendation to Member States on reading and writing lessons and access to basic skills. I must stress here that we need to respect the principle of subsidiarity and take particular care in our approach to education, which is a strictly national matter. The open method of cooperation is an excellent tool, giving the Member States added value in the form of indicators and exchanges of best practices.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of a European illiteracy monitoring centre, I have taken note of the proposal by the Members of Parliament on the need to use existing institutions, such as Cedefop, and I would remind the House that there are already a number of programmes, such as the OECD Pisa programme, which provide some initial answers. Before creating new tools, we need to be sure that we are making efficient use of tools which already exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as far as the proposal for an annual report on illiteracy to Parliament is concerned, we want to look at the most efficient way of informing Parliament and what use Parliament can make of reports on national action plans on social integration and reports via the open method of coordination, i.e. how existing means, reports which are drafted every year anyway, how this dimension can be used so that the information provided is exponential and more efficient. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
