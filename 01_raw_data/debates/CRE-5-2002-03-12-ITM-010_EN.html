<p class="contents">There is no doubt that there have been serious problems in Romania regarding the protection of children in state-run institutions and also regarding the system of international adoptions. Romania has signed the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Hague Convention on Protection of Children. The Hague Convention signatory states have joined with us in expressing their frequent concerns to the Romanian Government about the very serious shortcomings in the Romanian legislation and procedures governing adoption and the way in which they are implemented in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">I must tell you, Mr Gil-Robles, that I personally had no choice but to acknowledge that in Romania, there has been a very high incidence of commercial trafficking of children – which is just about the worst crime imaginable – but that on the other hand, adoptions have of course also taken place entirely in accordance with the proper procedures, and that a substantial grey area between the trafficking of children and normal international adoptions has existed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission therefore brought intensive pressure to bear on the Romanian Government to embark on a radical overhaul of the entire system, starting with the legislation and including the institutions, structures, procedures and decision-making channels – indeed, every aspect of the process. Nothing in Romania's system of international adoptions could possibly remain as it was.</p>
<p class="contents">To ensure that no abuse of children can occur while these reforms are under way, the Commission resolutely supported the imposition of a moratorium on international adoptions. I am very pleased to say that the present Romanian Government has succeeded in enforcing this moratorium. It is not the Commission's policy to block international adoptions. Quite the contrary – the Commission's policy is to help ensure that these international adoptions take place within a system which is entirely transparent, conforms with internationally recognised rules, and excludes any possibility that a single case of child abuse could occur.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that appropriate legislation and administrative procedures will be put in place in Romania within the near future so that the normal systems governing international adoptions can be resumed. The cases which you referred to in your question, Mr Gil-Robles, and which had already been initiated but where a decision was still pending when the moratorium was imposed are being examined by the Romanian Government on a case-by-case basis, and if it is quite clear that there are no problems with the adoption, the Romanian Government has the option of suspending the moratorium in these individual cases. I believe that this will help to resolve the problem you describe.</p>
<p class="contents">However, let me say again, Mr Gil-Robles, even though this may not be welcome in some quarters: in striking a balance between protecting children in Romania and the needs of prospective parents – whichever country they may live in – our first priority must always be to protect the child. I think it is quite reasonable to say to families who wish to welcome an adopted child into their lives that they have to wait another few months, rather than run the risk that even a single case of the corruption which was rife in Romania's child protection system could recur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have had a moratorium in place since June 2001 and the Romanian Government has formally declared that this legislation would be ready by the end of last year. According to my information, however, although it has been approved by the Council of Ministers, it has not been submitted to Parliament and is still floating around, no one knows exactly where. I am surprised that the Commission, whose intentions the Commissioner has expressed very clearly, is not attempting to kick-start this process.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree that the priority must be the children’s welfare, but this will not improve by holding up legislation that will enable international adoptions to take place. The way to improve their welfare is to push ahead, as quickly as possible, with this legislation, and not to leave these children in the orphanages until that happens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, as regards the Association Council, there was full agreement between the Member States and the Commission on what we should say about this issue, and also between the Presidency and the Commission. There were no conflicts here; rather, there was a common position.</p>
<p class="contents">On the fundamental issue, let me reiterate: our policy is clear and unequivocal. The child's interests are the priority. Until the system in Romania guarantees that international adoptions take place in accordance with our required standards, I shall continue to oppose any re-opening of the gates to allow international adoptions to take place without restrictions. I have said to you that special permission may be granted in cases when adoptions had already been initiated before the moratorium came into force. The Commission will vigorously resist – I repeat – vigorously resist any situation in which the corruption which we witnessed in Romania has any chance of re-emerging.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat, I believe it is better to tell prospective parents that they must wait a little longer until we have a system which provides an absolute guarantee of protection to the children, rather than run any kind of risk. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The latter introduced the CE marking into a number of sectoral technical harmonisation directives.</p>
<p class="contents">The CE conformity marking must be affixed to any product falling within the scope of a technical harmonisation directive providing for it. It signifies that the product complies with the legally binding requirements of the applicable technical harmonisation directive. The manufacturer is responsible for affixing the CE conformity marking, although the directives often require the intervention of a third-party conformity-assessment body. Member States are responsible for the designation of such bodies in accordance with the applicable provisions of the directives.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of services in the Commission are responsible for technical harmonisation directives providing for the CE conformity marking, although most fall under the responsibility of DG Enterprise. However, the Commission intervenes directly neither in the process of evaluating the conformity of products nor in the award of the CE conformity marking.</p>
<p class="contents">All manufacturers of stun weapons falling within the scope of the technical harmonisation directives providing for the CE conformity marking must affix this marking to the relevant products. The Commission does not have information about the number of manufacturers involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already replied to this issue in 1997. The question was then posed by Mrs Wemheuer. The Commission then noted that a wide variety of equipment could potentially be used for the purpose of torture. Moreover, it is not always possible to determine in advance to what use such equipment will be put. I am therefore of the opinion that it is not feasible to apply a different treatment in the context of these directives to equipment that could potentially be used as an instrument of torture. Nevertheless, and in order to take account of the concerns of the honourable Member of Parliament, the Commission, and especially the Director-General for External Relations is currently preparing a proposal for a Council regulation concerning trade in equipment which may be used for torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of this regulation is, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, to impose controls on exports of equipment which may be used for such purposes in a third country, which will in principle include electric shock equipment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The developments in this case are also being followed closely by the Commission Delegation in Abuja. An appeal has been lodged by the defendant and will be heard on 18 March 2002. In the meantime, the sentence has been suspended by the Islamic Appeal Court of Sokoto.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is strongly opposed to the use of the death penalty. With a view to attaining the prime objective of abolishing the death penalty where it still exists, the EU calls for its use to be progressively restricted and made subject to minimum standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is also pressing for moratoria to be introduced where relevant. The Troika recently made a demarche on the application of the death penalty in Nigeria. The Commission is seeking to end the practice of public and particularly cruel executions pursued in certain Islamic countries. In the case of Nigeria, the Commission will work through the framework of the Cotonou Agreement, two of the fundamental conditions of which are respect for human rights and equality between men and women. Where these conditions are not met, the Agreement allows for a process of political dialogue between the national authorities and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The country support strategy for Nigeria has identified the strengthening of democracy and respect for human rights as areas requiring action and corresponding programmes will soon be forthcoming, including programmes to improve the status of women. In addition, within the framework of the Community budget, the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights includes Nigeria as a "focal country". Nigeria is eligible for support for measures in the field of good governance and this will have a positive impact on the status of women by raising awareness among them of their legal rights.

However, could I take this opportunity to ensure that, with the good offices of the Commission, and utilising the partnership agreements we have with Nigeria, there will be a greater understanding, not only of the respect for human rights, but also of our total abhorrence of the death penalty in any form, whether it be by electric chair or by stoning or by any other method. I would have this strength of feeling with regard to America, as much as with Nigeria or any other country in the world that continues to use the death penalty.

It is still, however, a bit early for the Commission to provide final answers to those questions. The Commission has launched a thorough examination of the recommendations made by the Group of High Level Company Law Experts relating to takeover bids and has consulted interested parties in order to decide whether and how such recommendations could be included in a new proposal for a directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware of the criticism raised by certain Member States regarding the specific recommendation on multiple voting rights and the possible loss of certain rights after a takeover bid via the "breakthrough" mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will, wherever possible, do its utmost to take account of the various opinions expressed during this phase of informal consultation with all interested parties. I am afraid I can say no more at this moment, but no doubt Mrs Riis-Jörgensen, the committee of which she is a member and myself will engage in dialogue as soon as a more concrete proposal has been formulated. I would also like to ask Mrs Riis-Jörgensen to contain her impatience until then. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In paragraph 39 of the report on openness and democracy in world trade, which the European Parliament adopted in October 2001, Members expressed concern at the direct and grave effects of some WTO dispute settlement cases on undertakings throughout Europe, particularly SMUs. Parliament called on the Commission to take concrete steps, both within the EU and at the WTO, to give such undertakings legal recourse to seek compensation. What concrete steps has the Commission so far taken to this end? What steps are planned? What is the Commission’s view of the call for WTO punitive duties to be paid from the general budgets of WTO Members rather than by private enterprise? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As you know, the WTO disputes settlement procedure is essential in ensuring that the multilateral trade system is secure and predictable. The suspension of trade concessions, which are sometimes wrongly referred to as sanctions, is the last resort for a State which uses the dispute settlement procedure where the State that is at fault has breached either the agreements or the decisions taken under the WTO dispute settlement procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">From our point of view, the main benefit of the system for European businesses, including SMUs, is that it applies great pressure to respect the rules of the World Trade Organisation. This is the main benefit for our businesses, and therefore for SMUs too.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, without doubt, cases where the international agreements have been breached and these must, of course, continue to be the exception. On this point, we believe that compensation must be preferable to the withdrawal of trade concessions and, within the framework of the WTO, compensation, which is a voluntary measure agreed by the plaintiff State, is a better option. In addition, this measure is only provisional. Otherwise, the system would not be as secure and predictable.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to give you two examples. Firstly, in the case of hormone-treated beef, we effectively lost a case at the WTO. The Commission submitted a proposal for a directive in 2000. We also hope, and I want to make this clear to the House, that the co-legislators are going to take a close interest in this. We regret that this is not the case at the moment. In the meantime, we are conducting negotiations with the United States to find an interim solution which, broadly speaking, would enable them to export greater quantities of hormone-free beef. This is a case where, temporarily, compensation may enable a solution to be found.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as part of the reform of the disputes settlement procedure, we recently submitted a proposal to the WTO in order to facilitate recourse to seeking compensation, as a real alternative to the retaliatory measures, in particular by providing for an arbitration mechanism on the amount of compensation. This would have the huge advantage of enabling all parties involved in a dispute to negotiate on the basis of a figure set by a third party.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rübig, this is the information that I can give you on the solution that is sometimes envisaged of possibly establishing such a supranational punitive system at the WTO. We do not believe in such a system. It would involve a fundamental change in international relations. That is why we do not feel that the international fine option is, at this stage, the correct course of action, if only because it does not provide an answer to the question of what coercive measures to implement in order to force parties to pay a fine that they wish to avoid.</p>
<p class="contents">In contrast, we prefer the current system and the compensation system, which – and this will be my final point – is always provisional since the underlying objective of any system that imposes discipline and respect for these disciplines is to force the State at fault to toe the line. That is our guiding principle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But the idea that businesses, which may fall victim to a system of sanctions, could have the right to compensation, for one reason or another, is not recognised in either international or Community law. We have also challenged the American system at the WTO, for example. This system was conceived several years ago and finalised last year and involves compensating businesses that fall victim to antidumping with the income from antidumping rights. We believe that this system provides an incentive to commit fraud and, therefore, we are not considering compensation systems. Once again, sanctions are only there to apply discipline and if we can effect the transition to a compensation system, then we would have a system that is more voluntary and is, if I may so, less random and punitive than sanctions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The international legal system, and that of the WTO is rather slow although it is in fact not much slower than our national legal systems when dealing with this type of case, but ‘summary’ type proceedings, which you refer to as injunctions, might be appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two comments to make in response to this point. First of all, it is a good idea. Secondly, as it happens, the WTO disputes settlement procedure is still in its infancy. It is barely five years old, which, for legal proceedings, is still very young, especially for France and we are, for the time being, working on improving other parts of the procedure. I acknowledge, however, that this is a question that we must ask ourselves when the time arises.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this type of procedure does not provide a response to an objection raised, which is how do we go about ensuring that injunctions or summary proceedings of this sort are observed? If they are breached, do we have recourse to trade measures? I do not think that the use of law enforcement authorities provided for in Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter is applicable in this case. And as soon as this ceases to be the case and that there is no, if I may say so, State authority in command of a police force, you come back to the problem of sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea is a good one, but we must still answer the question of knowing how to implement this, if not through sanctions and compensation pay-outs, which brings us back to the previous problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is clear that ever-tightening legislative requirements designed to limit, and indeed remove, environmentally damaging substances from the system act as one sort of incentive for product manufacturers and chemical companies to clean up their acts and look for alternative, 'environmentally friendly' constituents. However, are there any financial rewards or incentives available to help companies make the transition from using environmentally damaging substances – hazardous substances entering our sewer systems via our homes as a direct result of domestic product use and from industry as a result of direct discharge to sewers – to less harmful ones, and if not, does the Commission feel we should benefit from a Europe-wide scheme of this nature? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will address all relevant sources of pollution, including industrial activities. As a tool to achieve this objective the directive follows a combined approach of emission controls addressing pollution at the source and water quality standards to be achieved for the particular water body. Complementing existing Community legislation on major sources of pollution, urban waste water discharges, pollution from agriculture and impacts from large industrial installations, the water framework directive foresees emission controls for particularly hazardous substances and water quality standards at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">Commission proposals for these to Parliament and the Council have to be submitted by December 2003, also taking into account cost-effectiveness and proportionality. Participation of all relevant stakeholders will be one of the key elements of the directive. This will be achieved by mandatory public participation when developing and adopting the necessary river basin management plans, but also by broad participatory processes at EU level, facilitating the implementation of the directive. This process is to ensure input and participation by all interested and involved parties. Further, Community research efforts under the Sixth Framework Programme will support the implementation of the directive, as will the LIFE financial instrument in the field of innovative and integrated techniques and methods.</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond those measures the Treaty provides for clear guidance as regards financing Community environmental policy being, as a rule, the responsibility of Member States. On state aids the Commission does not intend to propose changes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In response to the question, the Commission has compared the following two reports: its own radiation protection report 127 (<span class="italic">Radioactive effluents from nuclear power stations and nuclear fuel reprocessing plants in the European Union, 1995-1999</span>), published in December 2001; and the so-called WISE report, drawn up for the European Parliament's Scientific and Technological Options Assessment Programme (STOA), on the possible toxic effects from the nuclear reprocessing plants at Sellafield and Cap de la Hague in France, published in November 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, the Commission compared the reporting of radioactive effluents released from the Sellafield and La Hague sites. The Commission can confirm that the data reported in the two documents were found to be consistent. The difference between the two documents lies in the fact that the Commission document simply reports discharge data whereas the WISE report presents an analysis of the impact of these discharges on human health and the environment. A separate analysis of the data carried out on behalf of the European Commission is now available on the Europa website and I will ensure that a copy is made available to the honourable Member.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to obtain a more complete picture of the impact of all historical discharges on the northern European marine environment, in 2000 the European Commission launched the so-called Marina II study, which will be completed this summer. It will provide additional detailed information on radioactive discharges and resulting activity concentrations. It will also make an assessment of their levels in northern European marine waters and their impact on human health and on the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I should like to ask, based on that and the assessment you have already made, what further steps the Commissioner would recommend to control the continued emissions of radionuclides from Sellafield and La Hague. They are the largest man-made radioactive emissions and pollutants and do not pollute just EU Member States but migrate across the globe. Indeed, Norway has complained particularly about the Arctic fishing grounds being affected. What would you recommend as a result of all this assessment and forthcoming studies?</p>
<p class="contents">You recently visited Ireland – you have your Irish scarf on! You indicated that you are concerned about the emissions from Sellafield. We also have a recent RPII report, which I would recommend the Commission to study. You urged the Irish Government to pursue the issue at EU level instead of simply under the OSPAR. I have also made a complaint. I want to ask you to address that in depth. I have had to engage a lawyer to follow up the fact that this has not been dealt with responsibly over the last couple of years.</p>

That is our task, but only after the Marina study is complete will we be provided with a good basis and platform, a scientific assessment of the situation enabling us to judge what exactly we should do and find the correct measures, if necessary, to help reduce discharges.

Previous studies have shown that penta-BDE is also found in mothers' breast milk. That is the brominated flame retardant that belongs to a group of ten chemicals known as polybrominated diphenyl ethers, PDBEs. Three polybrominated diphenyl ether flame retardants are available on the market. These are: penta-BDE, octa-BDE and deca-BDE. Penta-BDE is used almost exclusively as a flame retardant in polyurethane foams such as those found in vehicle upholstery and household furniture. At present there is a Commission proposal to ban the use of penta-BDE as from 1 July 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">A major use of octa-BDE is as a flame retardant in acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastics, whereas deca-BDE is the flame retardant of choice in high impact polystyrene. These plastics are used to mould, for example, housings for computers and as packaging for electronic appliances. Due in part to the presence of brominated flame retardants, including octa-BDE and deca-BDE, in electrical and electronic equipment, the Commission has proposed that Member States set up separate collection schemes and ensure the proper treatment, recovery and disposal of such equipment. Furthermore, in a parallel proposal the Commission has called for a ban on the use of polybrominated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers in electrical and electronic equipment as from 1 January 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position adopted by the Council on 4 December 2001 brought forward this date to 1 January 2007. At present, octa-BDE and deca-BDE are undergoing risk assessment within the framework of Council Regulation 793/93 on the evaluation and control of the risks of existing substances. Risk reduction measures in addition to those mentioned above may, if necessary, be proposed in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I can remember a time when no one could discover how to replace asbestos. What in reality got things moving was the desire to ban the material. I can now understand people’s wanting to make collections. That is also all well and good. However, it is of course not only a question of what happens to the material when it is worn out but also of what happens to it while it is in use. The problem is that, when in use, it emits materials that are absorbed partly into our blood, partly into our layers of fat and partly into mother’s milk. Now that there has been an investigation indicating that the quantity of brominated flame retardants in mother’s milk is forty times greater than had previously been assumed, we would ask if it might not then have been a good idea to draw up a long-term plan for when these substances might also be banned in their two aforementioned forms, which I shall refrain from trying to pronounce. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Linkage has already been established between Member State compliance with key aspects of the habitats and nitrates directives, and funding under the Structural Funds Regulation and the Rural Development Regulation. As the linkage deadline for structural funds approached at the end of 2000, Ireland dramatically improved its level of compliance with the habitats directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The immediate focus is now on the Nitrates directive. Ireland is currently the only Member State with no nitrate-vulnerable zones. In its rural development plan, Ireland committed itself to complete designation by the end of 2001. As this has not yet happened, the Commission will not approve any modifications proposed by Ireland to its programme under the Rural Development Regulation. Recently, Ireland brought forward a routine modification which is now blocked by the Commission's services. The amount of discussion on designation in Ireland at present reinforces the importance of this action and I look forward to Ireland completing its designation very soon.</p>
<p class="contents">The framework waste directive is not an issue since Ireland has submitted a complete set of up-to-date waste management plans.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the toughness of Commission enforcement procedures, steady incremental reforms have already speeded up case handling. These reforms involve better internal use of information technology and a quicker dispatch of warning letters to Member States. Furthermore, in 2000, the Court of Justice imposed its first financial penalty in a case concerning waste management.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the allocation of supplementary resources to speed up the handling of Irish cases, my services keep resource needs under constant review. However, the honourable Member will be aware that the Commission must operate within overall constraints that are very tight, and that there are many competing demands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a major problem that has to be addressed, because the rights of EU citizens are being denied where complaints are not being fully examined. At the same time environmental damage continues. We must address that.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to waste, the problem with Ireland is that it is failing to comply with the waste directive. In today's <span class="italic">Irish Times</span> Wicklow County Council admits to the existence of up to 88 illegal dumps, 19 of which have not even been examined yet. That council has been suspected of being involved in dumping in some of these illegal sites and the EPA, the body responsible for protecting the environment, has actually granted a waste licence to one of these illegal sites.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately our minister has today ruled out any kind of independent inquiry into this. In the light of the failure of the Irish authorities to comply with EU directives, particularly in relation to waste, is there any possibility that the Commission might consider sending in an independent team to investigate the damage that is being done and the irregularities present in relation to waste in this area in particular? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Quota buy-back by tobacco producers</span></p>
<p class="contents">The regulation on tobacco, as last amended, makes provision for tobacco producers to buy back quotas allocated to other producers, who are leaving the sector, in order to improve their business and their financial position. However, the Commission's recent announcements and decisions concerning the phasing out of aid over three years have effectively scuppered the quota buy-back programme as tobacco producers cannot afford the outlay and additional investment required when they do not know whether tobacco subsidies will be available for the 7-8 years minimum period they need to recoup their costs.</p>
<p class="contents">What guarantees can the Commission provide to induce producers to take part in the quota buy-back programme under Regulation (EC) 1636/98<a href="#def_1_4" name="ref_1_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>? Will the Commission use unallocated appropriations from the Tobacco Fund to finance studies into the social and economic situation which will arise in some regions, such as Aitolia-Akarnania and Thrace, as a result of changes in tobacco subsidies? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For specific types of tobacco which face steadily declining markets, the buyback price was increased significantly so that producers have an incentive to cease cultivation.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the acquisition of quotas from the buyback programme, however, the other tobacco farmers who wish to purchase the quotas have priority. We can only buy back the quotas which are not bought by other tobacco farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">For the coming three years, the Commission has submitted a proposal for a Council regulation which sets the premiums and quotas until 2004. Among other things, this proposal provides for a restructuring of the Community Tobacco Fund in order to finance studies in the Member States on the opportunities for conversion of tobacco production to other crops outside the tobacco sector, and on the initial experiences of this conversion.</p>
<p class="contents">In this proposal, the Commission has also announced a further proposal for the first half of 2003, which will be based on the guidelines contained in the Commission communication of 16 May 2001 on the European Union Strategy for Sustainable Development. To this end, it is essential to ensure that there is precise information available on possible alternatives and the socio-economic impact of phasing out tobacco subsidies. A study is therefore also being undertaken at present to evaluate the common organisation of the market in raw tobacco. This study should be ready at the end of this year. It assesses the socio-economic impact of tobacco cultivation in the various production areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that the question by my fellow Member, Mr Alavanos, was based on the following argument, which is extremely serious. If you subsidise the takeover of quotas by other producers, obviously the producers who take over this production potential need some time to amortise their investment, about 7 or 8 years. If you say that you are going to stop paying them a subsidy within three years, then there is no point in their taking over the quotas. And I should also like you to explain the following contradiction. You say, Commissioner, that you will carry out a study to see what the possibilities are for other crops. Quite right too and we have been supporting that here for some time now; however, you yourself have replied to repeated questions which honourable Members have put to you in the past, saying that this is more or less impossible.

Firstly: it is quite clear, also from what was agreed at the summit, that the phasing out of tobacco subsidies must be accompanied by an appropriate range of alternatives. This means that we can only implement the phasing-out process if we are able to offer genuine alternatives. That is my position here. We want to use the Community Tobacco Fund in the coming years for precisely this purpose, so that we are able to try out options and genuine alternatives and see what works and what does not. Only then will a decision by the Agriculture Council and an opinion by Parliament be necessary, based on a Commission proposal which will draw on the findings of this year's study. And only then can this phasing out be implemented in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">This is exactly why we intend to undertake a study, at local level, of the options available in the most-affected regions: in Granada, in Estremadura, in Thrace in Greece, and a number of other regions. We will not be fobbed off with far-fetched ideas; we want to investigate the reality. I think that this is an entirely fair approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my reply, I also mentioned the very negotiations you refer to, which were held on 15 March. The only detail I omitted was the date when they took place.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I really must remind you that the procedure for liberalising trade in agricultural products with Morocco was established as early as 1995. The purpose of the current negotiations is merely to decide on the next step in this liberalisation process. It must be clear that liberalisation must be a two-way street. It is not merely a matter of agreeing on the concessions we should make to the Kingdom of Morocco; the question is also which concessions the Kingdom of Morocco will make to us in the trade in agricultural products.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, if you look at recent trends in the trade in agricultural products, you will see that interestingly enough, Morocco's imports such as grain from the USA have increased very substantially. With regard to the trend in imports from the European Union, the opposite is true. This is not a one-way street, it is a two-way street. Of course, we must also be prepared to make further concessions. Our approach to the negotiations is very constructive. After all, the talks have only just begun and still have a long way to go. They are scheduled to close at the end of this year, so there is still enough time to make progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A total of EUR 197 million will be allocated to the programme: EUR 170 million in this year's budget and EUR 27 million in next year's budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The funds are to be used as follows: The share of aid to be allocated to the scrapping or permanent conversion of vessels to activities other than fishing must represent at least 40% of the global amount. A maximum of 28% of the total amount can be used for the permanent transfer of vessels to a third country with or without the creation of a joint enterprise, or for the modernisation of vessels. At least 32% of the total amount of aid must be allocated to social measures such as retraining for fishermen who have lost their jobs or part-financing of early retirement schemes. Thus the permanent transfer of vessels to Morocco through sale or creation of a joint enterprise in Morocco is also eligible for funding.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the premium for the creation of a joint enterprise amounts to just 80% of the scrapping premium, and the premium for export of a vessel amounts to just 50% of the scrapping premium. Furthermore, vessel owners who purchased their ship with Community aid and who now wish to export it or transfer it to a joint enterprise with a Community subsidy must repay a proportion of the subsidy received for the original purchase. The amount to be repaid depends on the age of the vessel. In the case of a five-year-old ship, for example, half the subsidy must be repaid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 52 by Jonas Sjöstedt (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2002-0086_EN.html">H-0086/02</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: EU export subsidies for agricultural produce</span></p>
<p class="contents">The EU spends nearly EUR five billion each year on subsidies of exports of its own agricultural produce. These subsidies seriously damage the prospects of other countries, particularly developing ones, of maintaining a viable position on the market in agricultural produce. The Court of Auditors has also highlighted the fact that the expenditure is not checked in a satisfactory manner. The EU's subsidies have come in for strong criticism in the WTO and part of the conclusions of the WTO meeting in Qatar was an objective to review subsidies. What plans does the EU have for scaling down or phasing out these subsidies in the years to come?</p>
<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 53 by Paulo Casaca (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2002-0142_EN.html">H-0142/02</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Phasing-out of export subsidies</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Commission undertook in Doha to launch negotiations for the 'reduction of all forms of export subsidies, "with a view to phasing out"'. This agreement, like any of the others and as is usual with such texts, is conditional on the final outcome of the talks.</p>
<p class="contents">This bold undertaking by the Commission is also justified internally, given the considerable inefficiencies and abuses which this system has given rise to, not to mention its dubious impact on fulfilment of the objectives of Article 33 of the Treaty, especially regarding action to ensure a fair income for farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission explain, in terms of timetables and procedures, how it intends to act on this objective, on the basis of full compliance with Article 33, paragraph 1(b) of the Treaty?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the Doha Ministerial Declaration, the WTO members pledged to engage in comprehensive negotiations aimed at reductions of, with a view to phasing out, all forms of export subsidies, although the text ultimately adopted in Doha left the final outcome of the negotiations open.</p>
<p class="contents">The negotiations will cover all forms of export subsidies, not only our export refunds. For example, they will also focus on a regime for export credits, the export subsidy element of various food programmes, and trade-distorting practices by state-owned trading companies. It would be unacceptable to demand a further reduction of subsidies from the European Union alone. We have already made this very clear in the proposal we put forward as part of the Article 20 negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the European Union has already reduced its export refunds by 50%. In 1993, export refunds still totalled EUR 10 billion, whereas they currently amount to less than EUR 5 billion. The Commission is also endeavouring to shape its export policies in such a way as to avoid negative impacts on developing countries' production when granting refunds. As far as the common agricultural policy permits, the process of reducing subsidies will continue, with due account being taken of the interests of our own producers and trading companies in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to the criticism voiced by the Court of Auditors regarding the use of export refunds, the Commission has devised an action plan which will be implemented during the first half of this year and which will introduce substantial changes to the current system. As the WTO negotiating round which has now been agreed is scheduled to end in 2004, it would be premature at this stage to determine the European Union's positions in detail or, indeed, predict the outcomes of the negotiations. Our final positions must be established against the background of the overall negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my view, we should also remind ourselves sometimes that the European Union alone imports more agricultural products from the developing countries than the USA, Japan, Canada, New Zealand and Australia put together. We therefore have every reason to hold our heads high when dealing with the other developed states. Furthermore, as you are aware, we have agreed on an open-door policy for products from the poorest countries of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to exports, a key factor in this context is that we can only reduce export refunds in sectors where appropriate reforms of the common agricultural policy are taking place. If you look at the structure of export refunds, you will see that we spend by far the most substantial proportion of funds on exports of milk products, sugar and sugar products. Why? Because the gap with the world market price is still very high in these sectors, and this price can only be reached by carrying out reforms in these two sectors. On the other hand, in the last two years, we have more or less phased out export subsidies on grain, and massively reduced them on beef. Given the pace of the common agricultural policy reforms, further reductions in export refunds can therefore also be anticipated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But I must confess, Commissioner, that I am somewhat disappointed at the lack of force in what you had to say about this commitment to phase out subsidies for farm exports, which is absolutely essential. According to the press, since last December this type of compensation has risen very substantially in the meat sector. I must also point out that in 2001 this reduction was closely connected to the rise in the value of the dollar and not to any reform of agricultural policy; and I must also say that there have been substantial increases in the amounts of subsidies for all products not included in Annex I. This is a situation that concerns me and I should like to ask Commissioner Fischler if he thinks it realistic that these reforms of the CAP that he has been talking about will be carried out in good enough time to be able to gradually eliminate these export subsidies? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us take the milk production sector as an example, as I have already mentioned. Under our current organisation of the market, we have a commitment to guarantee a specific price for skimmed milk powder and butter. As long as this commitment is in place, we can only export butter and skimmed milk powder with appropriate subsidies. As you probably know, there is currently no political majority in the European Union in favour of reforming the existing organisation of the milk market. It is therefore a little over-simplistic merely to point out to the Commission that reforms are required. That is something which should be drawn to the attention, first and foremost, of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to sugar, the situation is as follows: We have pledged, also to this House, that we will undertake a study of competition in the sugar industry this year and that depending on the findings, the Commission will then exercise the option included in the extension of the common organisation of the market in sugar: we can utilise the review clause which it contains and then make further proposals in line with this clause.</p>
<p class="contents">The reform process, too, is set to continue. As you know, the next step is the mid-term review in June this year, but in some sectors, further measures are already planned, for example in the olive sector, the fruit and vegetable sector, and in many others too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
