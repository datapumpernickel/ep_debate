<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mann, Erika (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span>– <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner and Members of the Commission, at this late hour, I would like to use the speaking time available to me to give you a brief introduction to the Commission proposal for a Council regulation concerning the implementation of projects promoting cooperation and commercial relations between the EU and the industrialised countries of North America, the Far East and Australasia, together with my report on it.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from the rather misleading formulation of the title, which mentions the industrialised countries and which does not of course include all the industrialised countries in the world, but only those with which we do not have any free-trade areas, cooperation or partnership agreements, I would expressly like to thank the Commission for its proposal for a regulation. As I see it, this is not the only area where it has done some splendid work, bearing in mind all the difficult political debates on this issue that have taken place in the Council, and also the cooperation with the European Parliament, which has perhaps not always been easy, no, it has done something else rather wonderful in that is has actually brought the many and varied, small-scale existing projects and programmes to be found in the aforementioned countries together in a single budget line, thereby creating a legal basis as well. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to say a heartfelt thank you to the Commission for the excellent cooperation we have had.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal for a Council regulation under consideration seeks to create a solid legal and budgetary framework to underpin actions taken under the various bilateral agreements signed between the EU and the six industrialised countries mentioned. These actions are currently financed from a number of different budget lines and some have to be undertaken as pilot schemes or preparatory actions due to the absence of a legal basis for the budget lines in question.</p>
<p class="contents">In producing this proposal for a regulation, the Commission has now created a legal basis. In drafting the proposal, the Commission aimed to ensure that Member States retain the primary responsibility for export promotion. Community action is thus restricted to measures that complement the endeavours of the Member States and other EU public bodies, and – as we always put it so nicely – thereby create European added value.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal provides for regular reports to be made in future to the European Parliament and the Council. We have amended it slightly in several places and we have also inserted the stipulation that the regulation is to expire at the end of December 2005. In addition, I have tabled an amendment which I hope the Commission and Council will support, requesting the Commission to submit a new proposal as early as the year 2003, in which it might like to outline the overall framework for a new trade policy and philosophy. This would also solve the dilemma that we are still facing, namely the fact that we have no positive definition of trade policy whatsoever in our Treaty. Instead we only define it in a negative way by excluding what it does not cover. I would be grateful if the Commission could use this positive definition in future.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the post-Nice Process lends itself extremely well to this, and in this connection I would also ask the Commission to always keep in mind that Parliament is not happy with the current wording of Article 133. This should come as no surprise to you, Commissioner Patten, rather I assume that, naturally, you are familiar with Parliament’s view of the matter. Incidentally, I would also be grateful if you would include your position in this new wording, i.e. your position in relation to one of the countries, namely the United States, which you have now set out – indeed you have provided a very comprehensive overview of our relations with the United States. I would also like the ruminations that are currently taking place within the Commission, especially on the part of Commissioner Lamy – who would like a policy statement to be produced in the sphere of trade policy at some stage – to be included in a review in the year 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">The projects, which are now to be financed in concrete terms under this budget line, encompass cooperation projects, business-related training programmes and programmes for promoting trade relations. These include the above-mentioned programmes concerning the United States, and especially those set up with Japan.</p>
<p class="contents">On a final note, I would like to say another big thank you for all the experimental projects you have tested out in relation to the various countries. It would be beneficial if you could draw conclusions from this, and summarise what you think could be passed on to programmes with other countries, what, in your opinion, may not have proved as successful or what you think does not stand a chance of surviving the post-2005 period. If you carry out this review, then as I see it, we will have an excellent foundation on which to base a real trade policy and philosophy. In the light of globalisation and the next world trade round, you will then have established an excellent basis to my mind. Once again, I would like to thank you warmly for this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, the ever-increasing challenges faced by European companies call for a more clearly defined legal framework and for a single budget line. It would then be possible to develop these operations in a more coherent and coordinated manner and bring added value to the activities undertaken by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation put forward by the Commission is therefore very timely, and Mrs Mann’s excellent report is even more so. On behalf of my group I would like to congratulate Mrs Mann on her work, thanks to which, the Commission’s proposal is now much more coherent and effective. My group also tabled a number of amendments to this proposal. These were aimed chiefly at making decision-making processes more transparent by involving the European Parliament in the programming and definition of the various subprogrammes to be undertaken in the partner countries. Our amendments were also intended to ensure greater transparency for the activities of those involved, both the European Union and the associated countries, in connection with programmes involving cooperation and commercial relations. In particular, my group has requested the Commission to submit the relevant documentation after decisions have been taken concerning definition of the nature of the objectives of the various programmes and the timetable for invitations to tender. As we see it, this is the only way to improve efficiency and access to these programmes by European citizens and companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like to refer with regret to the fact that Parliament was unable to adopt this report – the Mann report – at last December’s part-session. Had the report been adopted the programme could have entered into force quickly, as planned. Let us hope that it will, nevertheless, serve its purpose. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think Mrs Mann has produced an absolutely outstanding piece of work. I would like to focus once more on two particular points. One is the issue of transparency and the other is the problem of a trade doctrine which still endures.</p>
<p class="contents">On the matter of transparency, I would urge the Commission, in particular, to throw its weight behind Amendments Nos 9 to 11. I think that is precisely the line we should be taking, in other words, not only should Parliament be kept duly informed, but since so much has been made of transparency under the European transparency initiative, a fully comprehensive array of documents should also be made available on the Internet, so that they can be called up any time, and can, in their turn, help enhance the credibility of what we all stand for, namely the development of a new Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">What is extremely interesting – and you certainly cannot say that of every report – is the justification part that has been appended. This brings me to the second issue, that of the fundamental organisation of trade policy. It certainly has not become any easier to get the message across that what trade means to us, when it is properly organised, is increased prosperity, worldwide I might add. After Seattle and Davos, we have grown increasingly aware that we are dealing with irrational opponents of globalisation. It is all a matter of having the right rules. What it comes down to is fine-tuning, and to some extent, to information too. If only all those who do not have a good word to say about globalisation could recognise, for example, how strong Europe has already become in the sphere of foreign direct investments, as is evident from this report, or indeed in all kinds of other areas. What we need to do is set about convincing them. It is to be hoped that the Commission, in particular, will quickly get to grips with these fundamental issues, so that we can submit corresponding programmes setting out the basic principles, well in advance of 2005 and use them to win the public over. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, the question of trade and trade relations between the EU and the industrialised countries, particularly the US, is a very hot topic. So it is a pity that she missed the opportunity to address it in a more political way. However, the proposal to establish a single budget line could simplify the work of the European Parliament as a whole and increase transparency. I do not therefore have a problem with her technical proposals nor indeed the Commission’s proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a pity, however, that we failed to discuss whether we needed more export promotion and, if so, what for, and to go into this whole question in more detail. Instead she used the opportunity to expound a rather theoretical framework on trade which is her own rather than anyone else’s.</p>
<p class="contents">She also failed to deal with issues such as coherency with development issues and the very strong trade complex that we had. But once again simplifying the work of Parliament and the Commission is to be welcomed and therefore we will not be opposing this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I would like to echo Mrs Mann’s commendation of the Commissioner for the excellent cooperation we have had, but I would especially like to join the group of delegates present here today in praising your work, Mrs Mann, because it was no easy task and I know it has been a tripartite business, involving the Commission, the Member States and Parliament. We must try to find a reasonable basis, because we will only make progress in this matter if we work together.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we have, in this new draft regulation, a solid basis for a political and economic debate with the industrialised states. That is why I do not want to restrict it to trade alone. I believe it is important to achieve a closer association with the industrialised countries of North America, the Far East and Australasia, and to step up our exchange activities. This is necessary if we are to press home to people again– including MEPs – the significance of Asia. I believe there are still some marked differences in this respect. There are some excellent programmes when it comes to Japan. I believe the Executive Training Programme in Japan is exemplary and could be adopted elsewhere, indeed there is now a similar project in Korea which is in its pilot phase. The Gateway to Japan project is also outstanding as a trade promotion project. Other industrialised countries could emulate it. Conversely, I believe we delegates should consider taking our example from the relations between the legislative bodies, the American Congress for example, and Asia, because contact between the European Parliament and Asia is not firmly established enough yet.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe we should seize on this example, in a bid to build closer relations between the two houses of the Japanese parliament and the European Parliament, and just as the Americans do, working from a legal basis, so should we use the same opportunities with regard to Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">Permit me to close with a brief remark. Even though we have adopted this kind of division of responsibility, partly for reasons of experience, on account of the different legal basis, we should be aware, nonetheless, that we have very different styles of working. Take for example my area, Asia, which keeps me extremely busy. I believe we should underpin the ASEM Process much more firmly in political and parliamentary terms. One thing we must be sure to do is hold a conference for parliamentarians before the next ASEM meeting. So regardless as to what the legal situation is, Europe and Asia must grow closer together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The importance, as Mrs Mann has emphasised and the Commission proposed, of a single budget line, is not just about simplifying Parliament’s work. It is so that we can properly evaluate and vote on what money we are spending on which projects so that the Commission and Parliament can jointly consider what is best value for money and how we need to spend money in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The emphasis Mrs Mann has given to the importance of clarity about the division of responsibility between the Community and the Member States in the field of export promotion is also crucial. There is some sensitivity about this and clarity about the budget line and the legal base are not only going to help us to do our work in a more logical way but also reassure the Member States that there is a proper allocation of responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to comment very briefly on two other matters. I was very pleased as President of the delegation between this Parliament and the US Congress that the transatlantic legislators’ dialogue merited a mention in the budget report. You know, colleagues, how much emphasis this Parliament has put on the TLD. And Mrs Mann’s report mentioned, among the many other excellent projects, the European Institute in Washington supported by the Commission. It is just one example, but an excellent one, of how cooperation, not only financial but political, industrial and commercial, can pay very considerable dividends.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted to support Mrs Mann and as I am finishing my speech with one second to spare, I hope I will receive a bit of applause for that.</p>

In these eighteen months I have been a Member of the European Parliament, I have become familiar with the fact that Mrs Mann is well versed in a number of areas and particularly transatlantic relations; and this report is an indication of that also. I disagree with Mrs Ahern, who seems to have left the Chamber already, that the report is not sufficiently political. There are actually very political elements contained, for example, in the explanatory statement, which I, at least, enjoyed reading. Of course, the tone is not one of party politics.</p>
<p class="contents">I warmly support the targeted programme of measures to make the general commercial policy of the EU and its Member States more effective. Closer cooperation might even be regarded as an inevitability when we take into account the amendments made at Nice to Article 133 and those many speeches which were made during the night at Nice in favour of a solution that would also go much further. I agree with the rapporteur, too, that the post-Nice agenda should include finding a new approach to the EU’s commercial policy. The rapporteur’s opinion on the processes of globalisation is also to be supported, and especially her opinion regarding a closer common competition policy, which concerns my own committee in particular – the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. The deadline set for the Commission to submit proposals to Parliament must also receive our support, as too should the use of the ‘sunset’ clause in this regulation. These dates set should not, however, mean that the Commission should not have an ongoing obligation to keep Parliament up to date on the progress of the action programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Of all the actions covered by the proposal I would in particular like to emphasise the importance of cooperation projects with the United States of America. For example, TABD, the TransAtlantic Business Dialogue, has, as far as I can see, worked well and succeeded in preventing trade disputes and bringing about coordinated views in areas requiring a swift reaction. A good example is the Istanbul World Radio Conference last spring. Transatlantic trade is still the thread of life as far as the global economy is concerned, and the importance of cooperation in this area must not be underrated. We have to remember that there is also a strongly political element connected with this cooperation, the basis for which was created in 1995 with the signing of the New Transatlantic Agenda. Furthermore, Parliament wants to be involved in this work and has therefore attempted to seal its relationship with the US Congress in the spirit of the transatlantic dialogue that my colleague, Mrs Read, also mentioned earlier. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let me begin first by thanking Parliament for the support that it has given to this Commission proposal, firstly by allocating a budget for the implementation of this regulation in line with the Commission’s request for 2001 of EUR 15.6 million. We are extremely grateful to Parliament for that.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to thank Parliament for adopting unanimously, as I hope it will, the favourable report from the rapporteur, Ms Mann. I take this is as a strong token of Parliament’s broad endorsement of the Commission’s proposal regarding the industrialised countries. At this stage may I express our warm gratitude to Ms Mann, and indeed to her colleague Ms Read, for their consistent, constructive support for the development of our transatlantic relationship. Since I am visiting the United States, Canada, Japan and Australia during the course of the next three months, I am very pleased that we have made this progress this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">Our relations with the industrialised countries have significantly deepened, and indeed broadened, in recent years. We are moving away from a narrow focus on trade to comprehensive relationships encompassing everything from the Common Foreign and Security Policy, justice and home affairs, education and culture, environmental issues, science and research and, which I regard as particularly important, people-to-people exchanges.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of the United States and Canada, these comprehensive relationships are already a reality, while other partners like Japan, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand and Australia are keen to develop similar relationships. The cornerstones of these relationships are the common values and the similar interests that we share.</p>
<p class="contents">So while we see on the one hand an increasing demand for closer cooperation with some of our most important partners, on the other, we have lacked the legal framework to be able to follow things up. Indeed, we currently only have legal bases for actions with Canada and Japan. The latter is limited to market access activities and it expires at the end of this year. For the United States, we do not have a legal basis at all, compelling us to implement projects under the new transatlantic agenda as pilot projects or preparatory actions which do not require a legal base but which are limited in time to either two or three years.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal under discussion aims to resolve this situation by establishing a solid and common legal base which can underpin our relations with the industrialised countries. A common legal base is appropriate since our relations with all these countries are based on common values and shared interests. It is also appropriate because it would enable the Commission to develop similar programmes to the extent possible with all or some of these countries. In addition, if linked to a single budget line as we have proposed, we would have clear administrative advantages. We would greatly improve efficiency by aiming for economies of scale and create optimal flexibility. Improved budget transparency both for Parliament, and I must say for the Council, would also be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a common legal base linked to a single budget line is in line with the Commission’s policy of limiting the number of small legal bases and budget lines. I would like to emphasise the importance the Commission attaches to this proposal. The benefits of a common, legal and budgetary framework to support our relationships with the industrialised countries are clear. I am confident that our first report to Parliament on the results of the implementation of this regulation which we present in a couple of years’ time will prove that to Parliament’s satisfaction.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to the 14 amendments adopted by Parliament. I am delighted to say that the Commission can accept 11 of them. Ms Mann and Mr Ferrer, referred in particular to Amendment No 5. Amendments Nos 4 and 5 refer to the division of responsibility between the Community and Member States on market access and export promotion. Ms Read pointed out that the Member States are very sensitive to this issue. Accepting these two amendments would result in a substantial shift away from Member States, well beyond what we agreed for the Japan market access regulation a few years ago. Although I am not afraid of having occasional disagreements with the Council, I would advise against the adoption of these two amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 14 of the Budget Committee would be a derogation from the 1999 comitology decision and therefore is not acceptable either. At any rate, on that amendment, I do not believe that it is the number of participants in committee meetings that should really matter to us or to Parliament, it is how many of them are reimbursed by Community funds. This is a horizontal issue which should find a general solution instead of being addressed in every regulation and I hope we can proceed on that basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Again, I would like to thank the rapporteur very warmly for her constructive and intelligent help in developing our relationship with some of our closest friends around the world. We are, in this particular instance, correcting an anomaly and filling an important gap as Mr Jarzembowski pointed out a few moments ago. So I thank Parliament for their understanding and I trust that it will not take too violent exception to the fact that there are three of the 14 amendments which I would advise against. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
