<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Florenz (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, I too would like to join in the congratulations. I would like to thank Commissioner Wallström for the fact that the Commission developed this thematic strategy. I would also like to encourage her to pursue this issue because I believe that we are currently in a phase in Europe where we must consider whether the waste policy can be continued as we have done to date or if it is not the case that we have for a long time had new knowledge and must no longer just tighten up the loose screws, but rather perhaps here and there also change the system.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, this is the first regulation – that both the Commission and Parliament have had to address – that makes it urgently necessary that we look at the transposal of the law in force in Europe. For example, the implementation of the landfill directive is abysmal, to say the least. Some countries go over the top but some are not doing anything in this area. This is why I believe that, alongside a high level of protection, we must also pay attention here to the transposal of such things.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing that is very dear to me is that we ensure, in the areas of waste and recycling, that the instruments and regulations that run in parallel, such as for example REACH and IVO, as well as other product policies and the resource strategies – that we should have also included in the debate now – are compatible with this report. Otherwise, I think the legislation will not be watertight and loopholes will open up; that we really do not want.</p>
<p class="contents">We warmly welcome the Commission’s approach, which involves developing sustainable waste management whilst giving equal value to the environmental, economic and social aspects and, therefore, to develop sustainable policies. We also believe that the entire lifecycle of resources and waste policy too must be considered together; not just a part, but the entire lifecycle must be taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Wallström, I must give my particular support to the approach to set up cost-benefit analyses. Without them, I believe that we would be doing Europe no favours as a location for industry. I do not want to question the sustainable combination within the waste hierarchy at all, but we must subject this waste hierarchy to a certain degree of transparency and flexibility since prevention, reuse, recycling, energy recovery and environment-friendly waste disposal are the tried and completely trusted instruments. The order is also right, but I would once again like to expressly point out the flexibility that we actually need here.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy clearly dealt with the issues where more proposals for harmonisation must be made, and where existing regulations must actually be implemented. I am extremely pleased that there will in future also be certain rules and systems concepts for recovery facilities, so that one person does not think one thing and someone else another as regards recovery facilities. I hope that the committee and the Commission agree with me that the competitiveness of secondary raw materials as well as of primary raw materials must be guaranteed. I think that help from outside is also necessary, probably from the area of taxation, in order to develop an adequate and above all a continual flow of secondary raw materials for the manufacturing industry.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of the landfill directive is a difficult one and, together with environmentalists, we are looking into whether or not to bring in a landfill tax. I do not think much of this idea at all, as it makes Europe more expensive as an industrial location. I do, however, believe in ultimately raising landfill standards to a level where they can be compared. Raising taxes is basically the easiest thing to do in this sphere but achieving the required equal standards for landfill would also entail harmonising the costs. That would be a much more sensible route to take. We have, therefore, proposed standardisation and a truly ‘European’ landfill regulation and we have gained a huge majority for it.</p>
<p class="contents">A further important point – this is hard to believe – is this issue of whether to differentiate between recovery and disposal and so on and so forth. All these things will in future be regulated under this directive and will be tracked by the Commission and by you in line with the objectives. I would like to thank all Members, who were involved in this report and I hope that we will reach a successful conclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the Sixth Environmental Action Programme the European Union set out a vision integrating resource, product and waste policies, and now with the development of the Thematic Strategy on the Prevention and Recycling of Waste we are designing the concrete policy which will take the next step towards turning this vision into reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to share with you some thoughts on the challenges we are facing. The first challenge ahead of us is for waste policy to adapt to enlargement and the increased diversity of the European Union. We must set common rules guaranteeing a high level of environmental protection for all facilities in the European waste recovery market. We must ensure that our legislation gives the right signals to Member States, whilst allowing them to adapt policies to national issues. This means waste legislation must take more of a framework approach.</p>
<p class="contents">The second challenge we are facing lies in defining the environmental objective of waste policy. We need to accurately target environmental impacts and look at how waste prevention, re-use and increased recycling can best reduce this impact.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the most concrete challenge will be to design cost-effective instruments. In the past we have focused on products with particular issues like end-of-life cars and computers. However, these wastes represent small fractions of total waste flows, and we have outlined in the communication ways to promote recycling more generally. We need to influence the economic attractiveness of recycling and set the scene for materials to re-enter the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a few comments on some key aspects of the report before you. It rightly stresses the general objective of reducing environmental impacts of waste and the primary role waste prevention should play. However, we must accept that there is no miraculous instrument that can stop waste at source. We will have to adopt a flexible approach, enabling Member States to use a wide range of measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the support given to developing common standards for waste management facilities and promoting the use of economic instruments such as landfill taxes. I believe these elements should play a key role. Landfill bans can also be useful, but only as part of an overall policy. I would like to stress that it will not be possible to increase indefinitely the number of product directives. The waste flows covered are too small, and implementation is complex.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, if we are to move forward in the face of changing circumstances we need to get our strategy right. We need to focus on the most significant environmental impacts of waste, and adopt framework actions to tackle them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is recognised in the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, presented by Mr Langen, and I welcome him.</p>
<p class="contents">Our position in this regard is clear. We must adopt a flexible approach which takes account of the diversity of geographical, social and economic situations in the various Member States. We recognise that it is necessary to reduce the quantity of waste produced and achieve the highest possible levels of reuse of materials, and that all possibilities for dealing with waste are valid, provided that they are sustainable.</p>
<p class="contents">Recycling 100% of waste is highly desirable, but impossible. Imposing obligatory objectives, particularly in the case of prevention, and charges and taxes may have effects that are counter-productive for the management of waste. There are markets in waste which already function perfectly and which handle great quantities in an efficient manner. Therefore, establishing obligatory rules and taxes on waste may have distorting effects, in the opinion of the Committee on Industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, industrial waste is often easier to recycle and, therefore, we call on the Commission to take this factor into account and to include in its proposal the separate collection of recyclable material originating from industry.</p>
<p class="contents">We also urge the Commission to produce an evaluation of the consultation procedure carried out on the definition of ‘waste’, publishing its results and presenting a response on the definition of this concept and other parallel concepts, such as waste recycling.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we impatiently await the thematic strategy on waste and we will always draft our proposals for improvements in accordance with what is best for the environment and for the general public. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This has been the aim in the Community approach to the problem of waste for a long time now, and this has also been the main thread running through the commendable report by my colleague, Mr Florenz.</p>
<p class="contents">The principles that lie behind waste prevention and its effective treatment and recovery, however, can easily be interpreted as a threat to each other. We have organisations that are opposed to the effective recovery of waste because they fear the successful treatment of waste threatens the principle of prevention. This is madness and the sort of ideological inflexibility the world can no longer afford. Every single means must be used, first prevention, then recovery, and our politicians must be able to find a system in which these objectives do not pose a threat to one another. We will be bad politicians unless we can make the system a more rational one.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that the definition of waste will be of central importance. Our problem is the differing and often too restricting definitions in the waste sector, as the large number of problem cases before the European Court of Justice shows. This problem has to be addressed though the clarification and harmonisation of legislation. It will be necessary to define the difference between recovery and disposal quickly when the next parliamentary term starts.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment it seems that with competition more effective operations really will lead to better efficiency, which in most cases also means eco-efficiency in the use of materials. Thus competition in conjunction with Community legislation already implemented is satisfactorily steering towards the prevention of waste. The trend is absolutely the right one and only needs to be endorsed. The greatest untapped potential still lies in how materials and by-products classified as waste can be recovered so that the use of virgin materials can be reduced and waste disposal made unnecessary. Industry accounts for enormous quantities of waste whose precise composition is known and which at source could be treated separately from the rest of the waste flow. This would facilitate its recovery with the risks fully under control. Europe is acting properly in its aim towards sustainable waste management and there can be no compromise regarding this objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to thank Mr Florenz for his contribution to the debate and for his interesting report.</p>
<p class="contents">The European directives have certainly started the ball rolling. We are sorting and collecting our packaging waste, and we make sure our appliances are disposed of effectively. All over Europe, there are now recycling installations, and all over Europe, people are committed to processing the waste we are all producing. That is heavy and demanding work. However, we should do this for the environment and should continue doing this, because the waste mountain is still growing. We should therefore not turn a blind eye to a few obstacles in European waste policy.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, there are large discrepancies among the Member States in the implementation of the directive. This is sometimes attributable to indolence, but often to real problems, such as the lack of potential markets. These differences in implementation also lead to competitive problems. In some countries, it is the governments and taxpayers who collect, and industry contributes little, while in other countries, it is precisely the other way round.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the environmental benefit, which is not always clear. We think that recycling benefits the environment, but there is a limit. For example, in the case of excessive transport distances, the environmental benefit becomes a burden.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we are still not sufficiently engaging in prevention and reuse. Packaging is important to protect the product, but surely a double layer of plastic around a small piece of bread is taking things slightly too far. Although the Group of the Party of European Socialists is not a keen advocate of expressing prevention targets in weight, because this stimulates the use of lighter materials, such as plastic, we have to note that, in Belgium for example, reuse targets work very well. Germany too offers much inspiration with regard to its deposit system.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the amendments are concerned, we wholeheartedly back all amendments which stimulate reuse and prevention, except for amendments in which prevention is expressed in a percentage, such as in Amendment No 13. As for the definition of waste, I think that we should remind ourselves of the objective that the environmental burden of production and consumption should decrease. For this, the whole chain has to be examined, from raw material down to waste. It does not seem useful to me to have continual discussions about the definitions of waste and prevention. I share Mr Florenz' view that the reduction of waste is an essential element of sustainable waste management. The wording is of secondary importance.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to comment on the economic and social aspects of waste prevention. Our key topic is the environment, but that also encompasses other aspects, particularly in the economic and social areas. It is precisely these aspects that have been insufficiently addressed, even if the costs have been regularly mentioned recently in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. In the past, we have called for the introduction of a supercommissioner for sustainable development. This may be a good time to repeat this request. The Lisbon objective needs a shot in the arm and that should come from a new Parliament and a new Commissioner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we take municipal waste for example, what we produce is far in excess of the targets set in the Fifth Environmental Action Programme. The prevention of waste is one of the ways of tackling it, because the disposal of waste – whether through landfill or incineration – causes health and environmental problems. Many people in the European Union are trying to tackle the issue of landfill sites situated near homes or the fact that incinerators are being planned in some countries, including my own to try to deal with the waste problem. That is the wrong road to go down.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's communication is a first step towards having a strategy that covers prevention and recycling. We welcome the fact that the report has included some very important things, such as <span class="italic">compulsory</span> waste reduction plans. It is all very well to say we will have them, but this is meaningless without some effort to ensure that happens, so it is essential that they are compulsory. The promotion of re-use is extremely important and particularly respect for the judgment of the European Court of Justice that waste incineration of municipal household waste is disposal and not recovery. It was regrettable that the review of the packaging directive did not deal with this properly. The judgment was clear in itself, so how could anyone consider that the incineration of household waste was the same as recovery?</p>
<p class="contents">We regret that we were unable to change the whole pro-incineration approach to a pro-recycling approach. This is essential because, by following the road of incineration, any incentive to reduce and look at alternative ways of dealing with the reduction of waste is destroyed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is often mentioned as being important, which of course it is. In its communication the Commission stated that it would consider changes to waste definition if the need for such changes was demonstrated, and also that the alternative proposal guarantees a high level of environmental protection. The Commission also stressed that the debate on waste definition should focus on easing the application of the definition of waste. This has also been widely supported by stakeholders.</p>
<p class="contents">It would seem useful to mitigate the impact of the definition of waste in some circumstances, and this may involve changes to the Waste Framework Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to waste prevention, since it has been discussed, and the subject of setting targets for waste prevention. This is a complex issue, and the potential for waste prevention will vary; it depends on economic growth and also the maturity of different industrial production processes. Furthermore, specific information and instruments are needed to influence each decision taken at production-process, management, design and consumer levels.</p>
<p class="contents">EU legislation contains the seeds of mandatory waste prevention plans, because under the Waste Framework Directive Member States must draw up waste management plans which promote, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, waste prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">On recycling and recovery: in general, but not always, recycling is environmentally more favourable than energy recovery. For example, low quality of recycling, a high proportion of recovered energy or highly mixed waste can influence environmental performance. In such circumstances, case-by-case assessment may be necessary to determine the best option. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
