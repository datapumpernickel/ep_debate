Turkey also has, and will have, an important role to play in maintaining peace and stability in our continent. This has once again been proven with the recent events in the Balkans. </p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the Union and Turkey need one another. The importance of that cooperation was underlined four years ago, when the Customs Union became effective. It is our belief that the Customs Union has benefited both sides. Last year, EU exports to Turkey accounted for more than half of Turkey’s total imports, and Turkey’s exports to the Union area in the same year accounted for approximately half of its total exports. In this connection, it is worth noting, however, that the financial and institutional cooperation, which was agreed when the Customs Union agreement was made, has not come about in the way that was planned. </p>
<p class="contents">By virtue of the decisions made at Luxembourg in 1997 and Cardiff in 1998, Turkey is involved in the enlargement process. Turkey has had created for it, its own strategy for preparing for membership: the so-called European Strategy. This strategy involves both a broadening of cooperation in different areas, as well as financial cooperation. Finland, as the country holding the Presidency, is endeavouring to enhance the implementation of the European Strategy. Two proposals for a Regulation relating to financial cooperation in respect of the European Strategy are at present on the agenda in the European Parliament. It will be very difficult to implement the strategy fully without financing. As the country holding the Presidency, we appeal to Parliament to debate these regulations in a positive frame of mind, and as promptly as possible. As we all know, there was a tragic earthquake in Turkey in August. The damage the country suffered as a result, as well as the serious economic damage, underline even more the importance of financing.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union is closely following the development of democracy in her partner in cooperation. There are serious failings with regard to human rights in Turkey, including the rights of minority groups. We hear all too frequently about, <span class="italic">inter alia, </span>restrictions on the freedom of speech. This is not in harmony with our European values. We have, however, noted with satisfaction a recent move on the part of the Turkish Government to implement democratic reforms and improve the situation regarding human rights. We also wish to encourage Turkey to continue on its path to reform. The OSCE <br />Summit in Istanbul on 18 – 19 November will be an important opportunity for Turkey to show that it is trying to improve the situation with regard to generally accepted civil liberties.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union opposes the death penalty everywhere, and whatever the case. It is a common objective of the Union to abolish capital punishment everywhere in the world. Under Turkish legislation, it is still possible to pass and implement the death sentence. However, the death sentence has not been carried out in the country since 1984. We hope that Turkey will refrain from implementing the death sentence in cases where such a sentence has been passed – including the PKK leader, Abdullah Öçalan. We expect Turkey to remove the death sentence from its statutes entirely and continue with its moratorium until that time. In addition, we would like to remind everyone that non-implementation of the death penalty belongs to the common set of values of the Union, a Union whose membership Turkey has indicated it aspires to.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently we have seen encouraging signs that relations between Turkey and Greece have improved. We hold in high regard the contribution that Greece has made to this development, and we consider the dialogue that has started between these countries to be a very positive step forward. It has been quite moving to see the genuine show of sympathy and solidarity in both Turkey and Greece, as a result of earthquakes in both countries. We hope that the positive climate that has recently developed will be a step towards a more lasting improvement in relations between the countries. Increased cooperation breeds trust, which can only lead to reinforced stability in the eastern Mediterranean and the whole of Europe. This is to our common advantage.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the dialogue I mentioned awakens optimism in us, difficult questions remain. The European Union and the country holding the Presidency give their full support to UN efforts to achieve a lasting and just solution to the situation in Cyprus. This autumn we hope to make headway in finding a solution to a problem that has dragged on for too long. We believe that Turkey, for its part, can contribute to the process wherein a just solution may be found,</p>
<p class="contents">When I went to Turkey, two weeks ago, I discovered that the destruction resulting from August’s earthquake was the most extensive in Europe since the Second World War. Turkey cannot cope alone with the demanding task of reconstruction. There is no full reckoning as yet of the cost of repairing the damage caused, but estimates vary between USD 3 million and 6.5 million. The earthquake left 400,000 people homeless. At present, they are living in tents. With winter approaching, it is no longer possible to live in such conditions. The European Union wishes to support the reconstruction work in Turkey. We also trust in the constructive cooperation on the part of the European Parliament in this important area.</p>
<p class="contents">During its presidential term, Finland will strive to do its best to integrate Turkey more closely into European structures. This aspiration on the part of the country holding the Presidency has been given a good basis by an exchange of letters between Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit and the Union’s previous country to hold the Presidency. Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit reconfirmed in his letter that he thought the Copenhagen criteria were a basis for Turkey’s aspirations for membership.</p>
<p class="contents">There is unanimity among the countries in the Union with regard both to Turkey’s importance as our partner in cooperation and the need for closer cooperation. It is something that has been mentioned by the European Union and individual Union countries in many connections. Just a few days ago, Prime Minister Costas Simitis and Chancellor Schröder stated that the Union, for its part, would make a serious attempt to reach a positive conclusion at the forthcoming Summit in Helsinki. The central issue will be how to strengthen Turkey’s status as a candidate. There must be much active work and goodwill shown on the part of both the Union and Turkey to achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">We are firmly of the opinion that bringing Turkey closer to the Union will be the best way of aiding the implementation of democratic reforms in the country. In this respect, the path of isolation does no more to promote the aims of Turkey than it does the aims of the Union. In this there is no doubt that we need the support of concrete action on the part of the European Parliament in matters of financing and general support to develop and consolidate relations between the European Union and Turkey. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Verheugen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is extremely pleased to see that the European Parliament, so soon after the start of its work, is having a full debate on the subject of Turkey, since this is in fact one of the most important political and strategic matters which we have to settle in Europe at the present time. Today’s discussions are taking place at a time when relations between the European Union and Turkey have the opportunity to pursue a new course: exactly two months before the European Council meeting in Helsinki, which is expected to make important decisions with regard to the enlargement process as a whole and with regard to Turkey in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">The representative of the Presidency has just given a political analysis of the current situation, which the Commission can fully endorse. I would like to add the following thoughts, from the viewpoint of the Commission. Since the European Council meeting in Luxembourg in December 1997, relations between the European Union and Turkey have deteriorated, for obvious reasons. As you know, Turkey did not see the European Council confirmation that it should be considered for accession as sufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Shortly after the European Council of December 1997, the Commission discharged the “European Strategy” on Turkey’s preparation for accession in all relevant areas. This European Strategy was drawn up as a specific, customised introductory strategy with the goal of expanding and deepening the existing Customs Union. The Commission proposals were approved politically at the Summit meeting in Cardiff in June 1998. Since Cardiff, several meetings on the implementation of specific aspects of this strategy have taken place, but thus far, the lack of appropriate funding has prevented substantial progress, although I must point out that the overall picture is not so black as it is sometimes painted.</p>
<p class="contents">The Customs Union was improved in some areas, and the exploratory talks regarding a possible free trade agreement in the service sector have made good progress. The Commission experts visited Turkey in order to improve our general knowledge of Turkish legislation in all the areas concerned. Concerning financing, I wish to point out that by the end of this year, Turkey will receive a share of EUR 375 million from the MEDA I financing programme. We must in any case make further efforts to fulfil our arrangements with Turkey. The Commission would like to encourage the European Parliament as soon as possible to issue its position on the draft regulations, with which the European Strategy should be supported.</p>
<p class="contents">Without this financial support, we are in danger of losing the credibility of the European Strategy. Credibility is urgently needed in order to convince the Turkish side that they have to make an active contribution to the implementation of this strategy. If we really want to help Turkey in the preparations for accession, as the European Council in Luxembourg wanted it with the European Strategy, then we must also show that we ourselves will make a significant contribution to the achievement of this goal. The European Parliament clearly has a key role in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, I would like to express my satisfaction at the fact that the Commission reacted so promptly following the devastating earthquake which shook Turkey on 17 August. The decision to make EUR 30 million in emergency aid available for reconstruction was possibly thanks to the speedy reaction of the budgetary authority. In future, the European Investment Bank will grant medium-term loans of up to EUR 600 million for reconstruction, and also macro-financial aid of up to EUR 200 million, in order to support the current reforms in close agreement with the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">But we should look to the future. As has already been mentioned, the European Council in Helsinki will once again deal with the question of the European Union’s relations with Turkey. In this respect, I would like to make it absolutely clear that all accession candidates are assessed according to the Copenhagen criteria, and are all treated equally in this assessment. Turkey does not fulfil the political part of these criteria. In addition, there are deficiencies in terms of democracy, rule of law, human rights and minority rights. However, the question is how we can ensure that the necessary reforms are initiated in Turkey and that Turkey is resolutely and irreversibly on the way to becoming an established member of the family of European democracies. I am firmly convinced that this process in Turkey will only get underway and can only be successful if Turkey has the green light to enter Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently Turkey has made some progress, though by no means enough, in the field of democratisation and human rights, and I can point out that this will also be made clear in the next progress report on Turkey. Next week, in exactly one week’s time, this progress report will already have been discussed and decided by the Commission. This report will indicate, among other things, that in June of this year, the system of special courts was changed and the military judge eliminated from the Turkish national security court. It will point out that a number of important legislative and administrative measures have been carried out in order to prevent the abuse of human rights by public servants. We expect Turkey to go one important step further and finally abolish capital punishment.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to stress that the rapprochement between Greece and Turkey which had been achieved shortly before the earthquake in various matters of mutual interest is an encouraging sign for the future. I sincerely hope that the trust achieved between both these countries by means of détente will give them the possibility of addressing the difficult issues of security in the region in the same spirit as in previous discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, Turkey has decided in favour of Europe and is ready to undertake its obligations under the Treaty of Amsterdam. I therefore think that, at its forthcoming meeting in Helsinki, the European Council should clarify what place Turkey can assume in the structure of Europe. I would like to inform you as early as today that next week I shall be proposing that the Commission issues a recommendation for the Helsinki Summit to the effect that Turkey should also be treated as a candidate for accession on the same basis as all the others. This means that Turkey must undertake the obligations of the Copenhagen and Madrid criteria. Turkey still has a great deal of work to do, and considerable progress in the political and the economic field is still needed. Still, in view of the enormous strategic importance of Turkey for the future of Europe, for long-term security, stability and peace in Europe it would be a grave mistake to deny Turkey entry into the enlargement process on equal terms.</p>
<p class="contents">The time leading up to the Helsinki Summit must be used by Turkey and by us to agree jointly upon a timetable for Turkey. There was already some discussion of this timetable in the exchange of letters between Chancellor Schröder and Prime Minister Ecevit prior to the Cologne Summit. This would concern specific measures in the areas covered by the Copenhagen criteria in order to assist Turkey in the fulfilment of these criteria in the medium or long term. Appropriate initiatives by Turkey in the run-up to the Helsinki Summit would doubtless increase the chances of success of this European Council meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that this Parliament will play an essential role in the forthcoming debate, particularly when, following the decision at Helsinki to grant Turkey candidate status, the comprehensive process of alignment of legislation, of screening begins. I would like to clarify one thing at this stage in order to prevent misunderstandings. We are not now discussing initiating accession negotiations with Turkey, instead we are discussing taking the very first step. The very first step involves granting Turkey candidate status so that the process may be initiated and so that we have the opportunity to be able to speak on the subject of starting negotiations in the foreseeable future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree specifically with Mr Verheugen when he says that this is one of the most important strategic questions affecting the future of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet we ask ourselves: what has changed since December 1997 in Luxembourg, when Turkey was invited to a European Conference and refused the invitation? Let us recall the arguments put forward by Turkey in 1997. They said they were suffering discrimination, because they were not included in the accession process. I see Mr Poos, who was present at the time, who belongs to another large group here. If we now grant Turkey candidate status – and I say this in all seriousness –, but then start negotiations with all the other Central European countries, as we can indeed probably also expect from Helsinki, then there will be another sort of discrimination because Turkey is being treated differently to the countries of Central Europe. How shall we then answer that charge?</p>
<p class="contents">My group was involved in the drafting of the compromise text of the motion. I must tell you, though, that we could not support this compromise text of the motion in this form, neither Item D nor clause 1, because it would give the impression specifically that Turkey’s membership would have a positive influence on security, stability and development in the European Union. We do not think it right, to say this at this time. We can also see contradictions in the resolution. If clause 2 specifies that the Copenhagen criteria must be respected, i.e. democracy, rule of law, human rights, minority rights, and article 3 in clause 3 then specifies that Turkey a long way from meeting these criteria, then we must indeed take note of this. We cannot believe, on the basis of a deluded policy, that Turkey is today already so far on the way to being granted candidate status.</p>
<p class="contents">I am speaking in all seriousness, and certainly not for the sake of being controversial. I know how complicated the Socialist Group made matters regarding the Customs Union, and we in the Group of the European People’s Party were then always in favour of it. I am not saying that in order to reproach you for the change in your attitude in striving after accession status for Turkey. Rather, I am saying it because we in the Group of the European People’s Party were always in favour of having as close a partnership and as friendly relations as possible with Turkey, and that is, of course, still true today.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore want to establish a forum between the European Union and Turkey in which we can discuss all Community issues. I would like to say in conclusion that Turkey of course has a European vocation. But if we grant Turkey candidate status now, the question arises as to what we will say to Ukraine or Russia tomorrow if we refuse them candidate status. We therefore say that this is not the right time to grant Turkey this status. Enlargement to the countries of central Europe must be initiated first. Only when that has been successfully concluded can we perhaps take a further step. But let us not take the second step before the first and, above all, let us do all we can so that this European Union, this great project of European unification, will be a strong, empowered and democratic European Union in the 21st century! This must take priority over all other considerations because we want a Europe of peace and stability in good, clear partnership with Turkey. But the time has not yet come to make strategic decisions regarding Turkey’s membership of the European Union.</p>

This is in complete agreement with what the Commissioner has also said here today.</p>
<p class="contents">With commendable candour, the Commissioner has clearly set forth what he is in favour of. I would also like to spell out clearly that my group cannot today say either yes or no to it, because we are familiar neither with the progress report nor with the discussions which the Council is having with Turkey. I would however like to say just as clearly that I deeply regret, Mr Pöttering, not that you do not accept the consolidated resolution, that is not the essential thing, but that you are going back on the decision which this Parliament reached with a very large majority. I find that lamentable. We must pursue this process of rapprochement, which is a difficult one, and which will last a long time – of that I have absolutely no doubt – in the interests of the development of Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">What has changed within Turkey? Firstly, particularly on the initiative of the Greek Foreign Minister, to whom I should like to pay great tribute, a considerably better, though still not perfect, relationship between Turkey and our fellow Member State, Greece, has been achieved, as well as a step in the direction of finding a solution to the Cyprus issue which is so important.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on the Kurdish question there was, albeit in unfortunate circumstances given the death sentence on Öçalan, still the first step towards a political solution. Also, in the field of human rights, it was not only possible to achieve the release of Akim Birdal, even if only for health reasons, but there were also some legislative changes, which will hopefully also be put in practice. I do not want to exaggerate matters, I do not wish to paint a totally rosy picture, but there are changes which we must respond to. What should a country make of it if we keep saying “You must take this step and that step,” and then, when it does take these steps, there is no real positive answer and no sign of recognition?</p>
<p class="contents">My criterion and our criterion in the Social-Democrat Group is as follows: by sending a positive sign can we reinforce the positive changes which are emerging in Turkey, or not? That is the crux of the matter. Secondly, what do the human rights organisations say? What do the representatives of the Kurds in Turkey say? Whoever you speak to in Turkey, even in the field of human rights, even with the representatives of the Kurds, you will hear the message loud and clear: relations between Turkey and Europe are improving! This is our opportunity to be able to take more action, this is our chance to be able to do more to bring about the appropriate changes in Turkey!</p>
<p class="contents">In this spirit, Madam President, I would like to make it clear. We shall give an equally clear response to the clear statement by the Commissioner when we have all the facts and all the documents. But we have one goal as Socialists and Social Democrats and that is to change things and relationships in Turkey in such as way as to be able to speak of real democracy, freedom and respect for human rights there. If a signal is given in Helsinki, then it must have that as its goal, and it must give full support to those who fight for human rights in Turkey. In this spirit, on behalf of my group, I am hoping for a good decision in Helsinki.</p>

A failure to do so will provoke a serious crisis in our relations with Turkey. Nobody wants special treatment for Turkey and nobody should ignore the series of problems over the treatment of the Kurds or over the situation in Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">My group believes that the discipline of candidate status will involve Turkey in more serious preparation for membership, a stronger dialogue and greater exposure to European Union culture and politics. Parliament has certainly been dragging its feet on this issue, as the MEDA programme and the financial support for the European strategy show.</p>
<p class="contents">The Liberal and Green groups have tabled an amendment calling for the clear prospect for membership to be opened up. This would encourage the forces of progress and reform within Turkey and increase the leverage of the European Union upon Turkey’s future development. This position is supported by the Cypriot and Greek governments and Parliament would be reactionary should it fail to be in the vanguard of progress here.</p>
<p class="contents">I plead to all those who want Turkey to modernise on the basis of its European traditions to support our amendment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With the words, “Turkey is a country with a constitution but it is not a constitutional state,” he condemned the Turkish constitution. The constitution apparently protected the rights of the state at the expense of the freedom of the citizens. “We need more democracy and more citizens who are allowed freedom of thought without being restricted by the laws of the land,” said the judge. He spoke in favour of widespread democratic reform and also fundamental restructuring of the political system. He is right. His demands are identical to our expectations. I am even convinced that the majority in this House is also in favour of a democratic Turkey, in which human rights and minority rights are respected. It is my conviction, too, that we are bound to support democratic circles and their modest successes not just on moral grounds but also because a democratic Turkey, which can solve its own problems within Turkey, will be advantageous for the internal security of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">By means of our policy we could make a contribution towards ensuring that the proponents of a European democracy in Turkey may be successful and that the hawks who are against Europe may be the losers. In other words, at the present time, we need a policy which assists Turkey whilst maintaining a critical attitude and a policy which induces it to settle obvious issues such as the Kurdish question, the Cyprus issue or the human rights problems speedily and humanely. This cannot be the policy of the exclusion or the isolation of Turkey! Therefore, whatever the timetable or the exact procedure, in Helsinki a sign must be given towards the people of Turkish and Kurdish origin and towards democracy in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot as yet say anything for sure on behalf of my group on the integration of Turkey, because we are still having discussions, but for me personally, it means as Mr Verheugen has already said, that it has candidate status for accession to the European Union. Its integration is urgently necessary, not just for the democratisation of Turkey, but also for peace and stability in the Balkans and in South-Eastern Europe. The Greek Foreign Minister Papandreou yesterday said at the University of Istanbul, “We want Turkey in the European Union right now!” Nothing further need be said! I think he made it perfectly clear! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also in favour of a more open policy as regards granting financial assistance, provided this aid can benefit in particular the plight of its many earthquake victims. This does not mean, however, that we agree with the delegate of the Finnish Presidency or with Mr Verheugen or with the joint motion for a resolution being tabled in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that we, the European Union, must be a community of principles and not a cynical political entity pursuing geo-strategic policies which, to a large extent, come from Washington. Why did we lay down certain conditions for Slovakia and refuse to grant it applicant status. Was this a bad thing for Slovakia? And why did we do the same for the Baltic States on the grounds of respect for minorities? Was this a bad thing for the Baltic States? Were we not aware that Slovakia and the Baltic States had made specific progress? So why should we change our standpoint as regards Turkey? </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Verheugen said that it is up to us to provide Turkey with an incentive, a signal or a symbol to help set in motion the democratisation process in Turkey. Have we not already done this? Did we not do this with the Customs Union? Did we not do this with the proposal for the European Conference? Did we not do this with the MEDA programme? We had no response. Therefore, I believe that we must insist on the preconditions and demand that specific progress be made by Turkey. Finally, I would like to mention that I was disappointed to hear the three groups referring to the Greek Foreign Minister’s statements and standpoints to endorse their argument for intensifying relations unconditionally. I myself do not wish to comment on this. It is not an area on which I would like us to comment. However, I would like to say that Mr Swoboda is wrong to say that progress has been made on the Cyprus issue because Mr Papandreou said so. No progress has been made on the Cyprus issue! We also heard Mr Ecevit saying that there will be no intercommunal agreements unless Mr Denktash’ regime receives official recognition. No progress has been made on the Cyprus issue and no progress has been made on the Kurdish issue!</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, this should be condemned in the name of both democracy and mutual civil respect of populations. I am saying this because this is the real Turkish problem, along with the relations between us as the Community and the Turkish State. </p>
<p class="contents">Before the Öçalan case, nobody questioned the wisdom of the best possible relations with a State which had always declared its desire for an ever-closer cooperation with the Community, even to the point of asking to accede. Mr Poettering himself stated just now in his report that at the time of the customs agreements, he was in favour of this step. On the one hand, both as a Catholic first and as a politician second, I must stress the need in Turkey for more genuine respect for civil rights and fundamental values, especially as regards human rights. But on the other hand, we have to consider that all the commitments made by Turkey to the Community in recent years in terms of foreign policy, cooperation, economy and also in the cultural field, have always been honoured. So in my opinion, we need to press both the President of the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council, as well as ourselves in this Parliament, to make sure that all the agreements made with the Turkish State are upheld and complied with. And also that the competent Community bodies continue the timely and very thorough task of checking that the democratisation process and the peaceful resolution of the differences with other States are actually going ahead and are not mere words spoken by the Turkish State. </p>
<p class="contents">If we continue with the goal of enlarging the Community and, at the same time, of ensuring it complies with fundamental principles and values, this institution will assume its true role once more, which is fundamental in terms of foreign policy and international credibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The three provinces in the disaster area account for no less than 17% of the country’s industrial production. One in every hundred workers in the region did not survive the earthquake. One in every four inhabitants lost relatives and their homes. Who in Europe could not feel pity for the victims of this disaster? There is no doubt that a helping hand was and continues to be provided. Indeed this is our moral duty from a Biblical point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the offshoots of the disaster was a sudden change in the worldview of the Turks. The spontaneous assistance provided by their traditional arch enemies Greece and Armenia refuted the Turks saying that a Turk will only find friends among fellow countrymen.</p>
<p class="contents">The earthquake made people painfully aware of the great shortcomings of the ostensibly powerful state machinery in Turkey. Non-governmental organisations had their hour. Since then, calls for sweeping political and social reforms have been on the increase. These have come from people at all levels of society and even from President Demirel himself who only last Friday refrained from describing the Turkish constitution as democratic.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, prominent representatives of the Turkish business community are suppressing these positive noises. They are not saying a word about the dangerous polarisation between state and society, whilst at the same time, the gulf between rich and poor is widening. The aforementioned industrialists are endeavouring to defuse this explosive situation by calling for people to join forces for a civilian society.</p>
<p class="contents">What attitude should the European Union adopt towards Turkey, a country at odds with itself? Certainly one that bears witness to genuine good neighbourliness, which includes providing political and economic support. Offering the prospect of membership of the European Union is not on the agenda yet though. In any case, we still await progress reports.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely Ankara’s unaltered, hard military line as regards the Kurdish question, notwithstanding the PKK’s request for dialogue and the fact that they gave up the armed struggle, that underlines how important it is for us to assess Turkey’s compliance with the accession criteria. The still unresolved question of Cyprus is another reason worth mentioning.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He spoke of economic criteria, of strategic criteria and of security. He made absolutely no mention of democracy and human rights. In Turkey, the death penalty is still in force, and neither individuals’ rights nor peoples’ rights are respected. Apart from the Kurdish question, there is the question of other minorities too. Antidemocratic rulings are still present in the legislation – for example, Article 155 of the penal code and Article 8 of the so-called Anti-terrorist Law. So before giving Turkey candidate status, I think we should verify that Turkey is making the necessary legislative changes. Only then will it be able to take the path to accession. </p>
<p class="contents">I was a member of the committee established by the Council of Europe to monitor the Öçalan case, and I have to say that the penal process completely transgresses democratic rules.

But the problem you are now confronted with is that whilst, as a politician, you obviously have to act when the going is good, you also of course have to ask the question as to what will actually happen next once a country has been granted candidate status. For we are not talking about political dealings here but about preparations for a country to become an EU Member</p>
<p class="contents">You only have to look at what effort it is costing the countries of Central and Eastern Europe for the inevitable question to come to mind as to what the Commission’s offer will mean to Turkey. I would like to ask the Commissioner if we are proposing to leave Turkey in this position for decades? Would it not make far more sense to achieve things little by little and to continue to work on the process we have set in motion in order to bring it to completion. Mr Swoboda’s little list of developments in Turkey was of course extraordinarily lean. As things stand we are proposing to grant candidate status to a country that does not yet fulfil the Copenhagen criteria in any way, shape or form, so as to send out a positive signal from Helsinki.</p>
<p class="contents">I am absolutely convinced, Madam President, that it will not turn out to be a positive signal from Helsinki but that it will, on the contrary, become one big source of frustration. Moreover, what is the state of play as regards the European Union’s own preparations for the future membership of Turkey? How much thought has been given to the implications it will have for our borders? How much thought has been given to the implications it will have for our agricultural policy and for the deepening of the European Union that we are currently working on? We are simply going to have to answer all these kinds of questions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time for us to deepen the Union. It is time we started pondering questions of this kind now that this proposal, which is completely premature, is to be put forward in Helsinki. I hope that we will come to see the error of our ways as far as this is concerned, for it would be extremely frustrating, for the Turkish Government and the Turkish people too, if we were to grant a status which will not offer any real prospect of membership for decades.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Also in Athens, Chancellor Schreider, following his meeting with the Greek Prime Minister, Mr Simitis, stated that he thought it would be a mistake in a public debate and at a press conference to mention the conditions that Turkey must meet in order to be considered a candidate country. I believe, this suggests Madam President, that Turkey must meet certain conditions before it can be considered a candidate country. </p>
<p class="contents">Public debate is certainly the biggest flaw of democracy. Governments can negotiate behind-the-scenes but Parliament cannot have this luxury of silence. I believe that we all, or at least most of us, agree on certain basic issues. We want Turkey to have a positive European vocation. We want Turkey to be given generous humanitarian aid for the earthquake tragedy. Finally, we all, or at least most of us, know that, in Turkey, individual freedoms, freedom of the press, the prison service and methods of police interrogation bear no correlation with democracy or with European culture. I cannot forget the comment of the Prime Minister of Luxembourg during the Luxembourg Presidency when he declared, quite justifiably, that Europe cannot sit at the table with torturers. </p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, the anachronism of the regime was demonstrated by the sacrifice of the Turkish people themselves in terms of human lives during the earthquakes. This could not have happened in a country with a fully functioning legal system, democratic control and freedom of the press. I consider very optimistic the remarks of the Commissioner that, by the time the Helsinki Summit comes around, Turkey will have fulfilled the criteria laid down by the Copenhagen Council to become a candidate country.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greek people showed their heartfelt sentiments towards the Turkish people during the earthquake tragedy and I believe that the Turkish people also have heartfelt sentiments towards the Greek people. The Greek Government has stated that it is prepared to accept the progress made by Turkey towards candidate status provided that Turkey can show some signs it intends to fundamentally change its attitude. Turkey has shown no signs of this. It still persists with the partition and military occupation of Cyprus. It still persists with its threats of war against Greece if Greece should enforce the international law on territorial waters. As long as Turkey persists with these, it will not be possible. What has been said here about Mr Papandreou acknowledging that Turkey has made progress on the Cyprus issue is totally wrong. I can assure you that Mr Papandreou made no such statement. It is not right that such statements can be distorted just to impress. If Turkey does show signs of progress, then of course we will welcome it with open arms, but it must show some signs. The ball, Commissioner, is in Turkey’s court and the next move must come from them. Europe has given it sufficient encouragement yet we have not seen, on an official level, and not from the Turkish people who are also suffering under the regime imposed on them, the response Europe needs to proceed to the next phase. We would need to have the necessary response and then, of course, we can proceed with the issue of Turkish candidature.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That leads me to insist that the chief obstacle to Turkey’s accession is not prejudice or discrimination. The EU is not a Christian club. Europe is culturally richer for having Muslim citizens and residents, and I welcome that. The chief obstacle to Turkey’s entry is its inability to meet the political criteria laid down at Copenhagen, especially regarding democracy, human rights and the rights of minorities, especially the Kurdish people. And it is patronising and insulting to treat Turkey differently from other candidates as if suggesting Turkey is second class and incapable of aspiring to European political standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The main cancer in the Turkish system is the repression of the Kurdish people. This has distorted the Turkish State and justified its militarisation. Hundreds of thousands of people have died and millions have been evicted from their homes. The PKK has committed some atrocities but these have been far outweighed by those perpetrated by the Turkish army. There is insufficient response to the PKK’s ceasefire. Our mistake is to perceive Turkey more as a strategic military ally than as a political partner. We must intensify our relationship and contribute to constructive change, but must not say yet that Turkey is on track to join. That is why I cannot support my own Group’s Amendment 1.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In our opinion, this once again shows that total hypocrisy is an underlying principle of the European Union, with its double standard policies of selective sensitivity towards human rights and respect for international law.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally, I am not surprised by the proposals brought by the Council and the Commission. When the Union itself can bomb Yugoslavia, an independent country, it cannot have any problem with the bombings carried out by Turkey on Kurds in Iraq. These double standard policies, based purely on the financial and political interests of the powers that be in the European Union, are making us turn a blind eye to what is happening in Turkey today; that is, Turkey’s refusal to acknowledge democratisation and respect for human rights, not to mention the violations of all the principles of international law. The prisons are full, the tortures and the executions are continuing. The Turkish regime has ignored the gestures of the PKK who actually sent some representatives to Turkey, just as a sign of peace, and called a cease-fire.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, this means nothing to the Turkish regime. It still insists, at all costs, on a military solution to the Kurdish question, and on enacting genocides on Kurdish people. Cyprus is still suffering the invasion and occupation of the Turkish troops and yet, we are still turning a blind eye to it. If we vote in favour of the proposal of the Commission and the Council, then rest assured that this will not in itself encourage democratisation. It will, however, encourage Turkey to reinforce the current inhuman, objectionable policy it is pursuing and to intensify the incursions against Greece and the incursions against humanity. A few days ago, in the EU-Turkey joint committee, the representative from the Turkish delegation told us, “This is how we are; we are a democratic country. Take us or leave us”. </p>

However, they are resolutely opposed to the integration of Turkey into the European Union where this would be in the interests neither of the Union nor of Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">The Turkish nation is a great nation, but it is distinct from the nations of Europe in terms of its origin, its language, its history, its culture, its religion and its institutions. The main part of its territory and population is in Asia. The integration of Turkey into the European Union would cause insoluble problems: immigration aggravated by demographic differences, economic competition aggravated by differences in earnings and labour costs. We must finally rid ourselves of these internationalist delusions which seek to extend the Union indefinitely, without taking national identity into account. We must also find a way out of the humiliating impasse that we have been keeping Turkey in for years. We must have the courage to say that the pre-eminent role of Turkey is to serve as a bridge between Europe and Asia, between East and West, and not to attempt integration which will be damaging for all the nations involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Turning to the representative of the Commission, I would like to ask: is this situation really in the European Union’s best interests?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, Mr President, that we must make ourselves clear, and be able to distinguish between what we can actually do and the promises we would like to make. I think that one of the messages that we have to put across in Helsinki – and I am directing this remark to the Presidency-in-Office of the Council – is that the climate for negotiating in Luxembourg must be improved. How can we do this? Well, we have to bring Turkey closer to the European Union and the European Union closer to Turkey on the basis of actions which are concrete, tangible and resounding.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think that dodging a question that we will have to face up to sooner or later is a good idea. We cannot put this off any longer. Do we want Turkey to become firmly anchored in the democratic system of Western values or not? What are we prepared to do in order to achieve this?</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey has been a loyal ally of the European Union and deserves a clear and honest answer. I think that within the European Union, we must face up to this situation with clarity, not by replacing reality with a reality of our own invention, because when all is said and done, that produces nothing but discontent and frustration. I shall direct these remarks, for the sake of this clarity, to the Commission’s representative because in the end, the Commission’s decision will be definitive, or at least will have great bearing on the way Heads of State and Government see the matter. Is the Commission going to propose more of the same to the European Council, or will the Commission, on the basis of the requirements of the Copenhagen criteria and of its own conviction about the Turks, offer the Turks the chance of not missing the boat in the future?</p>

It is essential not to give out wrong or unrealistic messages either to the Ankara Government or to the Turkish people, and to base our position on two principles.</p>
<p class="contents">The first one is that relations between the European Union and Turkey are vital to both parties, now and in the future, in all areas and at all levels. Secondly, that the European Union must give priority to promoting Turkey’s democratisation in an intelligent way. To achieve this, we have to use the means available to us – the Association Agreement and certainly the Customs Union too. The European Union must demand that Turkey fulfils the Copenhagen criteria, but we must not add new ones.</p>
<p class="contents">I was perturbed to hear how Mr Poettering, on behalf of the European People’s Party, added a so-called cultural criterion to our relations with Turkey. What was he referring to? To the fact that there are unavoidable cultural differences between Europeans and Turks, which prevent Ankara from having the chance that their country might join the European Union? I am radically against this unacceptable view.</p>
<p class="contents">We can require that there be political principles, democracy, respect for human rights, and fair treatment of minorities and of the Kurdish people, and that international law be respected. But to add other criteria would certainly not be European in the best sense of the word. I would therefore like the EPP and Mr Poettering to make their position clear on this matter. Turkish public opinion, a progressive public opinion in terms of politics, society and business, requires that we give a clear message. But this message includes a rapprochement between the European Union and Turkey and at the same time, a push for the democratic values which today are still not being fulfilled. Leyla Zana is surely the most striking example of what I am talking about. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Supreme authority must fall to the government and no longer to the military. As long as Turkey infringes human rights and Ankara attempts to resolve the Kurdish question primarily by military intervention, there is not the remotest possibility of its actually becoming a member of the EU. The resolution we have before us articulates this view, Madam President, particularly in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3. However, I consider paragraph 9 to be unacceptable because it suggests, unjustifiably, that Turkey is attempting to resolve the Kurdish problem by peaceful means.

That is why the European Parliament wanted Article 6, which contains such wording, to be included in the Treaty of Amsterdam. Article 7 even provides for the suspension of those Member States that do not abide by Article 6. It therefore follows that negotiations on accession to the European Union cannot be undertaken with countries that are not full constitutional States. We have had prior experience of this with Slovakia. We adopted a very clear position at that time. Slovakia did not satisfy the political criteria established in Copenhagen.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Verheugen is also absolutely right in saying that Turkey does not satisfy the political criteria, and certain consequences flow from that statement. Of course, we cannot compromise the character of the European Union on geopolitical grounds and for reasons of <span class="italic">Realpolitik. </span>We cannot allow a State that is not a constitutional State to determine our common future; there cannot even be negotiations on that point. We must give the character of the Union due consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has politely said that Turkey is doing its best to become more of a constitutional state. The Right Honourable Member, Mr Swoboda has scratched around for some ideas, with a view to showing that there really is some truth in this. He himself will not be too happy with the list he has submitted. What actual evidence is there that Turkey is doing its best? Could we cite its dealings in relation to Cyprus or the Kurdish question, or the treatment meted out to Christian minority groups in Turkey? Could we cite the fact that command is being taken of the police, who have become a law unto themselves at local level, or the fact that the role of the army is under review? Could we cite the changes that are afoot as regards religious freedoms? I would like to see either the Council or the Commission produce a documented report on the positive steps that Turkey has taken, together with an overview of the points which still need to be worked on.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one point on which we, as the European Union, fall short and that is the completion of the Customs Union in financial terms. Immediately after the earthquake, the Greek Government made very friendly noises about Turkey’s becoming a member but I do not think we can take them at their word. The litmus test for the Greek Government consists in their willingness to lift the blockade on the financial aspects of the Customs Union. That is the only real contribution the Greek Government can make and any friendly noises it might otherwise make are completely empty gestures. We want them to put their money where their mouth is. Nor must the European Union disappoint Turkey in this respect. Fond words about the earthquake do not help either, for it did not alter the constitutional state in any way.</p>

I would like to return this sympathy on the grounds of the ease, with which the Group of the European People’s Party has undergone a complete U-turn in its position since the agreement on Customs Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I have listened attentively to what the President of the Council and also Commissioner Verheugen have said on the subject of the possible candidacy of Turkey in Helsinki. I would have welcomed it if it really had been an honourable position of the European Union with regard to Turkey. But I am afraid that we are re-establishing a policy which, for decades, has permitted us to hide behind the Greeks and say that the Greeks would never agree to it. Now, as the Greeks are showing that they would agree under certain circumstances, we must, in fact, come clean. We must really ask ourselves in all conscience if we want to have Turkey in the European Union or not. Nuances of wording, whether it concerns one candidate for one candidacy, as in this case, or whether we should establish a new category of candidates, who are indeed valid candidates but with whom no negotiations are held, will by no means be beneficial to our relationship with Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">My last remark concerns a matter in which nuances of wording once again play a role. We are always talking about the Kurdish question, but we never talk about the Kurdish people. This is a people of between 12 and 20 million individuals, who nowhere, either in Turkey or in other countries, can enjoy their freedoms, human rights and rights as citizens. We must support the cause of these people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We Greeks seek the consolidation of peace and stability throughout the whole of the South-Eastern Mediterranean. It is therefore evident that we consider closer rapprochement between Turkey and the European Union a positive development. I ought to stress the point, so as to avoid any misunderstanding, that the rapprochement of Greece and Turkey, despite the historical antagonism and the fundamental differences, is in fact one of the most significant issues in our country’s foreign and security policy. </p>
<p class="contents">Turkey’s vocation within Europe, however, is a debate of great interest within the international community. Any positive development depends solely on Turkey itself. Provided that Turkey conforms to the prerogatives and duties imposed on those states wishing to join the European Union, and provided it subsequently fulfils the criteria and follows the programme stipulated in the joint decisions in Copenhagen and Luxembourg, then it could progress with its European goals. It is unfortunate that Turkey’s behaviour both nationally and internationally is a far cry from that of stable Europe. As regards democratisation and respect for individuals’ rights, the gap is major. Internationally, Turkey is known for its lack of stability, persisting with actions which promote rather than prevent destabilisation of the local geopolitical environment. </p>
<p class="contents">International Law cannot accommodate threats of violence, political blackmail by the larger States or disputes over borders and obligations arising from involvement in the international arena. Nor can it accommodate countries adopting defiant stances in the international arena.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, the stance taken by Turkey in relation to the Cyprus issue proves that nothing has changed, despite the distorted view propagated by the international press during the disastrous earthquakes. Turkey wants to join the Union, but it wants to do this without changing anything in its internal functioning and approach. Is this possible when it does not respect international law? It is self-explanatory that one cannot justify such preferential treatment, such behaviour and such forfeitures of rules and principles within this Community. It would be wrong for other applicant countries and would set an unpleasant precedent in the framework of enlargement and of current and future…..</p>

However, we must also find the courage to admit that now, Parliament is waiting for the Copenhagen political criteria to be complied with, even before there is compliance with the Copenhagen economic criteria. The Copenhagen political criteria are ethical criteria which represent the real identity of Parliament and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union bases its own identity on the fact that it follows the principle of the rule of law, which is much more important and significant than being able to mint a common currency or have a common defence policy. The ethical criteria mean human rights, democracy and respect for minorities. I think that the summary we have made in our motion is a fair one, and that we should impose it on Turkey. Candidate status and the cooperation signals are fine as long as we have the courage to repeat first to ourselves that it will be difficult to welcome Turkey into the European Union while the Turkish Government continues to ignore the Security Council’s resolutions on the invasion of Cyprus, while it continues to deny the existence of a Kurdish minority by referring to them generically as terrorists and until the threat of the death sentence no longer hangs over Öçalan. </p>
<p class="contents">I think that in our reasoning, we should rise above a purely economics-orientated approach and reading. We must demand genuine results at a democratic level, and this is a guarantee required not only by our Treaties but above all by our peoples, especially the Turkish people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In its infancy it questioned the eligibility of British membership and rejected its application to join. At that time many thought Greece or Spain – I suppose these days all that is forgotten – would never qualify for membership.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last ten years we have witnessed huge changes. Membership has expanded to 15 Member States, Parliament is beginning to acquire political power and will, I hope, cease to be a mere talking-shop.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey’s application has to be judged on the basis of the following criteria: Turkey’s strategic geographic and economic position and how this impacts on Europe; Turkey’s crucial role as a member of NATO and how this membership could be sustained if the door is permanently shut in its face; Turkey, which as a future responsible member of the EU could be the fire extinguisher for the fires of discontent that burn in the Middle East and beyond.</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate the fears of those who worry about Turkey’s Islamic population. The reality is that there are large numbers of Turks living in Germany and France, large numbers of Muslims – including Turkish Cypriots – who live in Britain. The populations of Kosovo and Albania are predominantly Muslim. The religious complexion of Turkey is a matter of historical accident, like Spain under the Moors for a few hundred years. Turkey’s culture is distinctly European and its religious complexion should not devalue its European identity.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us look ahead over the next 10, 15 or 25 years and examine what is in Europe’s best interest: what will contribute to the prosperity and peace of this family of nations that we call the Europe of today. Let us not be hypocritical, and let us ask ourselves what is the intellectual basis for excluding Turkey. Young Europeans, socially mobile and far less religious than us, expect us to develop a Europe of opportunities for work and prosperity that we can all enjoy.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey cannot join the EU today; but geography, culture, history, security and common sense . . .</p>

<p class="contents">In this resolution, there were four points which constituted inescapable obstacles in examining the possible accession of Turkey to the Community. Let me remind you of these four points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the refusal of the Turkish Government to acknowledge the genocide previously committed against the Armenians; secondly, its reluctance to apply the standards of international law in its dispute with Greece; thirdly, the maintenance of Turkish occupation forces in Cyprus; fourthly, the denial of the Kurdish problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Nothing has changed since then. Of course, the resolution we are voting on today does repeat some of these points, but we must insist absolutely on the fact that the current situation in Turkey is not acceptable to us nor in terms of the Copenhagen criteria, as indeed highlighted in the third paragraph.</p>
<p class="contents">It is up to Turkey to change its attitude if it really wishes to join the European Union. It is up to them to change. Obviously, for us, there is no way around the question of Cyprus, and Turkey cannot conceal the Kurdish problem. These are key issues.</p>
<p class="contents">We must remain firm in our demands if we wish to be credible and if we want Turkey to change. We know that democracy can be strong in a country, as history has recently shown, only if this country is able to recognise the rights of minorities and to respect them.</p>

Turkey is and remains an important partner of Europe. But this partnership is not strengthened by now offering the prospect of accession to Turkey. We need pragmatic steps on the way to an autonomous European Union Policy on Turkey. We said yes to Customs Union. But in this House the financial services of the Customs Union were blocked. I am asking for these pragmatic steps to be implemented at the earliest possible juncture. We need Turkey as a reliable partner in a geostrategically unsettled region on the edge of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">An autonomous policy on Turkey cannot, however, have Turkey’s accession to the European Union as its objective. The prospect of accession, Mr Verheugen, which the Helsinki Summit will open up and which you have described here on behalf of the Commission, is, we are firmly convinced, clearly the wrong way to go. We are pleading emphatically in favour of an autonomous European Union policy on Turkey, based on the three pillars: partnership in security matters, close economic integration and ongoing dialogue on political, economic, cultural and democratic issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The admission of Turkey into the European Union would excessively overstretch the European Union and would impose radical political change on Turkey, which it cannot fulfil in the foreseeable future and, I know, does not even want to fulfil. Therefore, the admission of Turkey would lead for a variety of reasons to a qualitative change in the European Union and to an inevitable standstill in European efforts for integration. The Ankara Agreement is not a sufficient reason for this as, since this Agreement with the EEC, in three amendments to the Treaties, the Single European Act, the Maastricht Treaty and the Amsterdam Treaty, Europe has documented its willingness and capacity to transfer further competences from the national to the European level and thus deepen Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is, therefore, in favour of an autonomous policy on Turkey just short of accession. We want these high level relations with Turkey for reasons of security policy, economics and politics. But we also want to deepen Europe further and not let it be undermined by accessions which we cannot cope with.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, this debate has puzzled me somewhat and therefore I would like to put a question to Mr Sasi and Commissioner Verheugen, namely: What is the difference between what is going to happen in Helsinki and what happened in Luxembourg? In Luxembourg we confirmed Turkey’s eligibility for accession to the EU. I understand we are talking about confirmation of Turkey’s candidate status in Helsinki. However, whenever I ask Commissioner van den Broek if Turkey is a candidate, he says the Commission regards Turkey as already being a candidate. So what exactly is new in Helsinki?</p>
<p class="contents">All candidate countries of course must meet the Copenhagen criteria and Turkey is surely no different. None of the applicant countries meet the Copenhagen criteria yet, otherwise by definition they would be members now, so what is the difference with Turkey?</p>
<p class="contents">Meeting the Copenhagen criteria is not a static process – it is a dynamic process. We are working with the other applicant countries to help them meet the Copenhagen criteria. Human rights problems in Latvia and Slovakia would never have been dealt with without the positive prospects of European Union membership and Turkey should be treated in the same way.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to be actively involved in order to improve the implementation of the European strategy. We need to harmonise Turkey’s legislation to the <span class="italic">acquis</span> and we need to work with Turkey to build a civil society. We cannot do that unless we do what we did with the other Central and Eastern European countries and are prepared to spend the money we have promised: that is the crucial factor. We have to become involved as we promised to do in the Customs Union and in the association agreement, and we must work to make Turkey ready for European Union membership, just like all the other applicant countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In this light, there is a wide consensus in favour of according Turkey a special position due, specifically, to the history and geography of Europe. As a result there is some agreement on the need to intensify the relationship between the European Union and this country. Yet, even though we must acknowledge the progress that Turkey has made towards rapprochement, doubts remain as to its ability and even its intention to meet all the Copenhagen criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">The time has come to get rid of this ambiguous position. This is why our group has suggested that a discussion forum be set up, uniting politicians from the European Union and from Turkey, naturally, but also representatives from elsewhere in society. The objective would be to look in depth into the matters which are still problematic, those involving respect for human rights and minority rights, of course, but also matters relating to economic relationships, and in this respect Europe must fulfil its commitments regarding the Customs Union and expedite the establishment of the appropriate financial protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">In consideration of the geostrategic importance of Turkey and the role it continues to play in the defence of Europe, it seems to us, finally, that it would be appropriate also to table a discussion of questions of security and foreign policy. Establishment of a forum of this type seems to me the only way to respond to the questions that remain without hypocrisy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first is that Turkey has the right to become part of the European Union and that we need Turkey for our project, which will not be complete unless Turkey is incorporated into it.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is that in order for Turkey to be integrated, it must meet the same requirements accepted by the other Members of the project. </p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that we need Turkey not just for reasons of security but also to regain the credibility and universality of the project of European construction. A large secular State with a majority Muslim population will prove that the Europe we are building is not a Europe with a Christian outlook, but is rather one based on universal values relevant to every citizen of Europe, of any faith or of none at all. This Europe that we are committed to is capable of sharing values with other great groups of humanity from whom a project based on a religious outlook would separate us. </p>
<p class="contents">If we state emphatically that Turkey’s place is ready for them, that we are waiting for our fellow European Turks to come and join us at the Union’s table, we must state, just as firmly that there will be no weakening of the conditions set out in Copenhagen. We must do this because we acknowledge that Turkey has a long way to go, basically in the area of human rights and of the rights of their various peoples and minorities, whether they are recognised as such or not, who make up the population of that country. Turkey also has a long way to go in terms of the way it acts towards Cyprus. We must make Turkey aware of this firmly but without exaggerating or caricaturing things, by describing their shortcomings and the obstacles they must overcome without shying away from them, but neither must we portray these difficulties as insurmountable. The European Union must see their shortcomings, even the most serious ones, as problems, and we will be committed to helping Turkey to find solutions to them, always bearing in mind the fact that our shared objective is to achieve the integration of Turkey into the European Union.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We cannot hide from the true situation of a country which, however, has always sided with NATO. Turkey must still make a lot of progress, embrace western democratic values, and resolve the question of relations with Greece and Cyprus. But to facilitate this process, I think that serious consideration should be given to President Poettering’s proposal to establish a timetable of regular meetings between Turkey and the European Union in order to discuss democracy, the human rights of minorities, economic and social development and foreign security policy. There is a long, long way to go, but open dialogue between the partners, which will be strengthened with the forum proposed by Mr Poettering, cannot and must not stop. Ending talks would mean increasing the risk of a growing Islamic extremist presence in Turkey. This would have a destabilising effect in the Mediterranean region. So we favour continuing talks between the European Union and Turkey, but invite Turkey to make actual progress. </p>
<p class="contents">A policy of promises is not sufficient. We need a policy of concrete facts, we need respect for human rights and we need the abolition of the death penalty. However we know that the Kurdish question does not only involve Turkey. Respect for the human rights of the Kurdish minorities also involves Iran. When we speak of respect for human rights and guarantees for the Kurds, we have to look beyond the Turkish borders because otherwise it would only become a political propaganda tool. So I think that the proposal to continue the dialogue should be supported but, I repeat, Turkey must give real proof that it is adhering to European democratic values. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are worlds apart as regards capital punishment, human rights, minority rights, democracy and rule of law. Scarcely less deep are the rifts on important matters such as economic, social and environmental legislation, to name but a few areas. The continuing military occupation of part of Cyprus is no contribution to peace and security in Europe. There is no getting around these facts. Anyone who says otherwise is, in the best analysis, hypocritical. No trust is to be gained by means of hypocritical set phrases, either in Turkey as our partner, or with our citizens at home. Therefore, we cannot say yes to substantial passages in the compromise resolution before us. If the relevant sections are not deleted from the text then we shall reject the whole resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey’s membership of the European Union is not really an important contribution to the future development of the Union. To put it correctly, we are making a contribution to greater clarity in Turkey and on behalf of Turkey. At the same time we retain our credibility in the eyes of our own citizens. In order to make further progress along the long road which Europe and Turkey must travel to become closer, we urgently need credibility. In this sense, we can support everything that has been mentioned many times today. This includes, for example, the requirement to take the European Union’s financial commitments towards Turkey under the financial protocol seriously and not just verbally, but also to make the necessary funds available. In so doing we will be showing both our own citizens, and also Turkey and the citizens of Turkey, that we take invitations and declarations of belief seriously. We do wish to be partners in future! This is however conditional upon our not proceeding to the second step before taking the first, as one may already have supposed on many occasions today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Suominen (PPE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FI) </span>Mr President, when Romano Prodi was presenting his programme, he told the European Parliament that we had 20 or even 30 years of enlargement in the Union ahead of us, during which time the number of Members would rise to 25 – perhaps more than that. His time perspective was a realistic one, and remains so.</p>
<p class="contents">I fear that many countries, which are much closer to possible accession than Turkey, were given the impression years ago, from many quarters – and I do not mean Parliament, but government representatives – that full membership for the Baltic Countries, Poland and Hungary, for example, would be possible by the year 2002 or 2003. The internal development of these States, and, above all, their ability to fulfil the obligations of the Union in order to acquire Union rights, may not be sufficient for such speedy accession as they themselves would hope.</p>
<p class="contents">We must make one thing clear for ourselves, however. In my opinion, it is not honest to say that developments in Turkey remain inadequate, when we mean that Turkey cannot be a Member at all. No, in my opinion, we have to say, as Mr Sasi, representing the Council here, said, that we must see a lot more development in Turkey, but that we wish to show goodwill. In other words, we shall not exclude Turkey. Furthermore, the Union must take stock of the burden of enlargement, when, in a few years’ time, Poland, with its population of almost 40 million, one quarter of which still derives its livelihood from agriculture, becomes a Member. And the Union’s potential is not boundless, either, which is why it is easy to agree with the words of Mr Poettering: yes to a reformed Turkey in the future, but that time is not now.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Just imagine if the Turks were actually to fulfil the criteria! We, in the European Union would be in no position whatsoever to integrate Turkey. That is the reality! For we have a principle in this European Union of ours, the socialist principle of redistribution of wealth from the rich to the poor. We call it economic and social cohesion. If Turkey were to become a Member of the European Union, then of course Turkey would also have a claim in having this principle respected. The European Union would be completely overtaxed by this.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are planning now, is already a show of strength of the first order, i.e. integrating the Poles, the Czechs and Hungary, whom I would have in the European Union tomorrow rather than the day after. But we cannot yet integrate Turkey too. And as regards identity, as this is an argument which keeps being brought into play, I think that if Turkey is European, then Ukraine and Russia, at least, should first belong to the European Union, and that is impossible too. But it is equally impossible to integrate Turkey. We should dismiss this thought. We should not string Turkey along any longer. It is just unfair and thoughtless. It is not we but our children who will have to pay the price. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to stress that political situations have to be exploited to promote peace, stability and human rights. Now we have this opportunity. The Kosovo crisis gave us a concrete picture of how important it is for us to build cooperation and peace in Europe. That can only happen through commitment to European structures, and we know that Turkey has an important part to play in promoting stability in South-East Europe. The other major event has been the earthquakes in both Turkey and Greece. They have generated a sprit of goodwill between the Greek and Turkish people and laid the groundwork for closer political relations between these countries. We therefore have an opportunity for better cooperation to take the place of estrangement.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that closer cooperation will also aid real development in Turkey. I believe that will mean that, in Turkey, improved human rights, democracy and political climate will be seen as absolutely vital steps to take. I also believe that it will give us the opportunity to make headway on the Cyprus question, as Turkey has an indisputable influence on that issue, and its cooperation will be needed for progress to be made here.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Verheugen of the Commission referred in his speech to Turkey’s possible candidate status. In this regard, it has to be said we still have a lot of work to do before the Helsinki Summit in order to reach a conclusion here. We have work to do in the Union, but it is also important that Turkey gives out positive signals during the whole of this process that the country is on the right track for development and that the position of democracy and human rights in Turkey is being strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">The Copenhagen criteria have been discussed here. Regarding these, it should be stated that they are a condition of the opening of talks. We are now discussing Turkey’s candidate status. If candidate status can be approved, the Copenhagen criteria will be an important path for Turkey to follow for its development, and they will be an ideal vehicle to take that development in the right direction: towards the values that we advocate here.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to emphasise Turkey’s importance with regard to the stability of the region that surrounds it. I believe that if the Islamic countries see that Turkey’s new road towards Western values offers it greater economic opportunities and better political operating prerequisites, it will serve as an important example to the Islamic countries surrounding it, and it may also in this way have a stabilising influence on developments in Europe’s neighbouring regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I value the motion for a resolution proposed here very highly, and I would like to say that I am particularly satisfied that Parliament is promising to act swiftly in matters relating to the Turkish question. Once again I would like to appeal to Parliament that the regulations on funding be dealt with in Parliament as quickly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Verheugen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, I would like to thank the Parliament very sincerely for a debate which assists both the work of the Commission and the decision which we have to make. Permit me to answer a few of the questions which have been asked.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there is no question today or next week or at Helsinki of giving Turkey the prospect of acceding to the European Union. Turkey has had this prospect for decades. The fact that it has been confirmed again and again, most recently in Luxembourg in 1997. Turkey is already part of the process of enlargement of the European Union. Therefore it is indeed I and nobody else, who is responsible for Turkey, including within the Commission. This is indeed part of the enlargement process. What we are talking about today is only a tactical change. In Luxembourg, the decision was taken, to select a different form of approach to the time of negotiations for Turkey as opposed to the other applicants for accession. This Luxembourg decision has not proved to be manageable because Turkey perceives it as discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">If I am asked whether we will ever live to see Turkey as a Member of the European Union, I say I do not know. If I am asked, whether we will get to the stage of negotiations with Turkey concerning accession, I again say I do not know. But we will never find out if we do not now try to start Turkey along the path which will perhaps bring it to a position where, if it wishes, it can enter into accession negotiations with us. Candidate status does not mean that we are negotiating about accession but that we are checking what needs to happen for the Copenhagen criteria to be fulfilled. Everyone here in this House has agreed that we want a democratic Turkey, a Turkey which respects the rights of minorities, a Turkey which protects human rights and a Turkey which makes a contribution to peace and stability in the whole region. All the speakers have wished for this. Perhaps someone could please answer the question how we can move the process forwards other than by discussions with Turkey!</p>
<p class="contents">The Helsinki decision that I would like to see would mean that we engage in very serious dialogue with Turkey, engage in the harmonisation of legislation, and tell Turkey specifically what needs to be changed. Only when these changes have taken place, only then will it be possible to discuss negotiations. I guarantee you that no one is going to come here and say, “We want to begin accession negotiations with Turkey now”, if the political Copenhagen criteria have not been absolutely clearly fulfilled. This means that Turkey must already have changed in the direction of democracy and rule of law before we can start accession negotiations. Hopefully that makes it quite clear what the real question is here!</p>
<p class="contents">For years, Turkey has been answered in the form of the arguments which I have heard again here today and which I would like to sum up in the phrase “not thus and not now!” Now is the time for truth! This expression “not thus and not now!” can no longer continue in this way! Anyone who does not now recognise that this is the hour of truth and that we must now provide Turkey with a clear and honest answer, may have to face the possibility that none of the things we are asking of Turkey will be attainable. Rather, a quite different development will set in for which responsibility will also have to be taken in any case; that is to say, responsibility will have to be taken for the fact that Turkey will no longer be seeking to join the Community of democratic values in Europe but will be following its own path in a quite different direction. One should then also be prepared to accept the responsibility for this, if one wants this.</p>
<p class="contents">A last word on the cultural aspect. I do not dispute that there are cultural differences between Europe, which is overwhelmingly typically Christian, and this part of Europe and Turkey, which is typically Islamic. I do not dispute that. But if you just imagine how the world may develop in times to come, then the answer to cultural difference can surely not be that cultures should shut themselves off from each other, the answer can only be that cultures must open themselves up to each other! Cooperation between Europe and Turkey could be an encouraging and promising example of how cultures living side by side as neighbours can find a joint path towards achieving peace, democracy and rule of law, and also opportunities for prosperity, for their people.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask the European Parliament, to offer us the possibility in this spirit to discuss matters credibly with Turkey and to contribute credibly towards achieving changes in Turkey. This involves strictly keeping our commitments, including our financial commitments towards Turkey.</p>
