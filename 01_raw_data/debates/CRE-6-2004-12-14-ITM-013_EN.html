<p class="contents">The Council of Ministers has already begun working on an <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> committee, as its representative, Mr Nicolaï, has told us, and we in the European Parliament have created a temporary committee, which it is my honour to chair, which has already produced a series of documents and within which our rapporteur, Mr Böge, is doing very considerable work on making Parliament's position coherent.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all, therefore, aware of the importance of this task, which must serve to establish the political priorities and define the budgetary resources available to the Union during 2007-2013.</p>
<p class="contents">Everybody knows – though I must remind you of it – that without the agreement of Parliament there will be no financial perspectives. Without the agreement of Parliament it will not be possible to reach an interinstitutional agreement which does not appear in the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament wishes to reach an agreement within the time limit laid down in the timetable, but it wants a good agreement, and in order to achieve one, certain issues must be clarified straightaway. Firstly, we need to know whether the current Commission officially accepts the proposals of the outgoing Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that you, Commissioner, have already told us in the meeting of the Temporary Committee on Policy Challenges and Budgetary Means, that the Commission headed by Mr Barroso directly accepts the proposals of the outgoing Commission. Shortly afterwards, however, leaks and comments have appeared in the media suggesting that the Commission intends, or at least accepts, not going as far as the proposals produced by the Prodi Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the time for you, Commissioner, here in Parliament, in the absence of the President of the Commission, formally to tell us, in your opinion, the level of resources Europe needs in order to fulfil its ambitions. It would also be good if you could explain to us which income structures you believe are most appropriate in order for the Union to be able to confront its current and future needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it would also be a good thing for us to explore what would happen in the event that certain Member States prevent an agreement from being reached within the relevant time limit. Would the Commission then be prepared to provide for the transitional provisions necessary to ensure the continuity of multi-annual programmes in the absence of a framework agreement on the financial perspectives?</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, Parliament has already expressed its preference with regard to the duration of these financial perspectives. We believe that five years is preferable since it is more in line with the duration of the terms in office of Parliament and of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, Mr President, by creating a Temporary Committee on Policy Challenges and Budgetary Means and appointing its own President as <span class="italic">ex oficio </span>chairman of that committee, which is not normal, this Parliament wished to give a clear demonstration of its interest and political commitment to a process which is so sensitive and essential to the future of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that we are facing some very important challenges. How to fund the enlargement we have just carried out. How to confront the enlargements which are on the horizon and which will undoubtedly take place within the framework of the future financial perspectives. How to ensure that Europe’s increasing role in the world is backed up with sufficient economic resources. How to realise the policies which will make Europe what we always call, when speaking of Lisbon, the most dynamic and competitive economy in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this must be included in the budget, because what is not in the budget does not exist, as Finance Ministers say. The expression may be somewhat of an exaggeration, but we know that, in order for certain things to exist, they must first appear in the budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, Mr President, the Barroso Commission has been confirmed by means of a very broad vote of confidence from this House. This is the time for you to demonstrate that you are not simply mediators between Parliament and the Council, but that you are able to show strong political leadership. The financial perspectives offer a great opportunity to demonstrate this.</p>

In order to be able to press on with our work, we do of course need answers to the questions that this House’s President has just addressed. In fact, Commissioner, there are plenty of discussions and rumours afoot, and perhaps today’s debate will help clarify matters. For example, you told a meeting of the Temporary Committee that the agriculture policy was a relic of the nineteenth century. If that is the case, why is there no proposal from the Commission to change it? Or does it not after all contribute something to the Lisbon strategy and to sustainability, in view of the current state of play where decisions on agricultural reform are concerned? Commissioner Verheugen has said that, in order to make a success of Lisbon, we need more responsibility and greater commitment from the Member States, but we see it as also involving the question of added value for Europe, of whether Lisbon is meant to implement the Budget more vigorously, particularly in connection with the programmes that bring Europe added value, in research and the multiannual education programmes. Then, we hear reports of internal discussions even at this early stage about the possibility of moving away from the 1.14%, and then someone puts forward the idea that 1.06%, or 1.07%, would be a workable compromise, so let me, as rapporteur, make it perfectly clear that nobody in the other institutions should imagine that Parliament is prepared to negotiate below the margins set as a network by Article 272 of the Treaty. Let me add that this is without taking account of the European Development Fund, which adds another 0.03% and has, for the first time, been included in the figure of 1.14% in the Commission proposal and hence also in the Budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you described a crisis situation featuring all the things that can happen if agreement fails to be achieved. We want agreement, and that is why, yet again today, we insist on a monthly trilogue capable of ensuring that difficult chapters are not left to be dealt with at the end of the procedure, but rather that issues of flexibility, duration of the Financial Perspective and many points of substance can be discussed in good time and considered jointly as part of a permanent dialogue between the institutions.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Grybauskaitė,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I am supposed to say that officially I am responding on behalf of the Commission to four questions from Parliament, but I received a lot more. I will try to answer them as well as giving the 'official' response.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say at the outset that in the Commission there are no internal discussions on ceilings other than the official proposal that was presented to you and to the Council. Despite media rumours, this is not a subject for discussion in the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Now the 'official' response to the first question: does the new Commission endorse the structure of the new financial perspective? Yes, the enlarged European Union faces new challenges and needs to meet new expectations. We need to update the structure of our financial perspectives to better reflect these new priorities. This entails a new classification of expenditure to give a new profile for the Union's finances. This more limited number of expenditure headings reflects the Union's main priorities, making them more visible to European citizens and rationalising expenditure accordingly. This Commission endorses the same priorities, i.e. transforming the European Union into a dynamic knowledge-based economy, pursuing greater cohesion in the context of the enlargement of the European Union, preserving and managing the European Union's natural resources – including agriculture, fisheries and the environment – and developing the area of freedom, security and justice and the role of the Union as a global partner.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals before us reflect the needs of the Union, firstly because these priorities identify and represent a common consensus about where Europe must intensify its actions. Secondly, the proposed structure also offers a real step towards simplification and rationalisation, which was welcomed by Parliament in its resolution of 22 April. Finally, the proposals have already allowed both the Council and Parliament to have substantial discussions and prepare the ground for an agreement next year.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question: does the new Commission endorse the duration of the financial programmes which will commit the next Commission and the next European Parliament? Let me assure you that the Commission is fully aware of Parliament's position – which was also expressed in the resolution of 22 April – in which it calls for a financial framework to be established for a period of only five years. However, we looked into this question and concluded that for the next programming period, seven years would be the best solution because the ceiling for market-related expenditure and direct payments – in agriculture, for example – has already been fixed by the European Council until 2013. A seven-year timetable also maximises the benefits of long-term planning, in particular in cohesion policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The third question: does the new Commission endorse all the proposals in what is known as the 'Prodi package', or does it consider that it should be readjusted and, if so, on which issues? As I said earlier, we endorse all the proposals. The Commission stands by the package proposed earlier this year. We do not call it by that name: it is the Commission's proposal and we endorse that proposal, namely the proposed financial framework, complemented by a series of legislative and non-legislative proposals adopted between February and September 2004. They have been submitted to the Council and to various committees of this Parliament. The Commission foresees the adoption of the remaining necessary proposals early next year.</p>
<p class="contents">The political project which underpins the financial perspectives is based on a number of well-established priorities on which a consensus already exists between the European institutions on the number of commitments already made, for example on agriculture, enlargement, Lisbon, etc. Building on this, the Commission is now also preparing its five-year strategic objectives, which will be presented to Parliament by the end of January 2005. The Commission believes that the proposals constitute a good basis for an agreement for the next financial perspective. To reach such an agreement the Commission will be taking an active part in the discussions and negotiations that will take place with the European Parliament and the Council. In this context, the Commission will take fully into account the key points of the discussion and will strive to reach a political agreement by the end of June 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth question: is the Commission ready to take account of other institutions' priorities? The answer is yes. The Commission will of course take careful account of Parliament's position in relation to the initiatives already proposed and in view of those that will arrive in 2005. The package is already based on a very broad consensus about where actions are required, in the light of European Parliament resolutions, European Council conclusions and, indeed, discussions within the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The forthcoming discussions on the Commission's strategic objectives are directly linked to this, and the Commission attaches considerable importance to the establishment of common priorities. The Constitution will mean a codified multiannual financial framework, and I would like a common vision for the next programming period to be our first step on this path.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make two brief points in finalising the official answer to the question tabled. First, I wish to remind you of what President Barroso has said in this House: the European Union needs to match its political ambition with its financial resources. Increased spending has been proposed because, with enlargement and with a demand for action in new areas, it was inevitable. We cannot have a larger European Union with less money. Secondly, I underline the Commission's strong commitment to the need to respect the target of a political agreement by June 2005 and the adoption of legislative proposals by the end of that year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Irish and Netherlands presidencies have achieved considerable progress during their respective terms in the Council. We all need to sustain the momentum and actively support the efforts of the Luxembourg presidency to achieve political agreement by the end of its term.

In so doing, you have confirmed what you said to our Temporary Committee and the Committee on Budgets. In short, I have to say that your response does not altogether satisfy us since it amounts to saying that the new Commission is adopting the previous Commission’s proposals without examining them in detail, and that it believes that the ball is now in Parliament’s and the European Council’s courts.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in fact looking to the Commission to show not the passive attitude of a mediator but the leadership of a political executive strong in the confidence massively expressed by Parliament scarcely a month ago, to quote President Borrell. It is all the more necessary and urgent that the new Commission should adopt a strong position now that initial soundings of all concerned in the Council have revealed that, for the first time, some Member States are proposing to cut the relative amount of the present budget, as Mr Böge said.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, the Commissioner for industry is saying publicly that there are currently 27 priorities for the Lisbon strategy and that they should be combined into one. Will that not be reflected in the budget?</p>
<p class="contents">You say there has been no debate in the Commission over the proposed amount for the ceiling of own resources. When will that debate take place? In what areas would financial sacrifices be inescapable for the Commission if this resources ceiling were not obtained?</p>
<p class="contents">Can the proposals made by Mr Prodi reasonably be financed on the basis of the present system of European Union financing, or does the Commission believe that negotiations should cover income as well as expenditure?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, what provisional measures should be taken, and when, if, as seems highly likely, the Council fails to reach a consensus before the process of ratifying the Constitution is completed? As you have reminded us, President Barroso says we cannot have more Europe for less money. How much money does the policy proposed by President Barroso require? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Alongside the tasks we have to perform in dealing with the Financial Perspective, the specialist committees and most especially the Committee on Regional Development have the task of preparing the relevant Regulations for each Fund for the new financial period of 2007 to 2013. I see the anchoring of this cohesion and structural policy, including in our Constitution, on the basis of the Lisbon and Copenhagen conclusions, as creating very modern political approaches to the implementation of a European policy for the public’s benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">What we in the Committee on Regional Development need for our work is a reliable statement and foundation, and both I and my group believe that only the Prodi proposal can fulfil that role. I will permit myself the aside that I get the impression that regional policy appears to be used by everyone as a sort of piggy bank. The Council does it by attempting to get a percentage accepted while a majority of its members want to make cuts because agriculture has already ground to a halt. Having seen the way you, Commissioner, deal with the Committee on Budgets and the temporary committee on the political challenges and Budget resources for the enlarged EU between 2007 and 2013, I can say that the Commission does too, calling ever more frequently for a Financial Perspective. I get the impression that the second half of that sentence is missing: ‘whether that Perspective be good or bad’. That is something we cannot afford.</p>
<p class="contents">The attempt is made ever more frequently to use structural policy measures to fund other things; the example I would give is the way in which the funding of Natura 2000 is being removed from the environmental sector and moved to structural policy. Let me also say, though, that regional policy was necessary in the old EU of 15 Member States, and it is necessary in the new one, with its 25. We need efficiency, but we cannot afford it to happen that drastic cuts in this area punish a large part of the population for something that we all wanted and that the European Union always has made tangible and accessible to millions of citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you said that the newspapers report only failures. In Germany, we have a saying to the effect that there is no smoke without fire. That is why debates about 1.05% or 1.06% are not helpful. Let me remind you that the European Union has always worked well when the Commission has strengthened Parliament and vice versa. We can negotiate well together, whether the Council is on the same side or our opponent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jensen (ALDE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the ALDE Group.</span> <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe were very pleased to see that the Prodi Commission attached such great importance to the Lisbon objectives when it presented its draft financial estimates. We also note that improved competitiveness and increased growth in Europe are among the things that are genuinely high on the Barroso Commission’s agenda and have been so right from the start. That is something we have also seen following the clear observations made by Mr Barroso today here in plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think it only natural to ask the Commission whether it will face the implications of its sharp focus on the Lisbon objectives and amend the Prodi Commission’s proposal. Is there anywhere it will allocate more resources to improve competitiveness and to create increased growth and more jobs? Are there any changes to the structure of the financial framework? Is there to be more focus upon growth-oriented policy areas? Are there things to be dispensed with?</p>
<p class="contents">What we have here is a large complex of legislation and proposals. I appreciate that what exists at present forms the point of departure, but it might however be interesting to hear whether there is anything to which more weight is to be given and whether there are any negative priorities. If there are to be priorities, where are the cutbacks to be made first?</p>
<p class="contents">When we in Parliament debate the financial estimates, we do not focus upon an expenditure ceiling, as some countries in the Council do. We do not wish to become tied up in the Council’s blinkered discussions of 1% or whatever. I am pleased that, in this House today, you have said that percentages are not being discussed in the Commission either – at any rate, not at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not talk about quantity, but quality. Parliament must therefore call upon the Commission to preserve a stoical calm and first of all discuss the content of EU policy. We can discuss budget ceilings subsequently. We now have a unique opportunity to consider what we want, as well as what we want the future EU to look like between 2007 and 2013, and that is an opportunity we must not waste.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as my own group is concerned, it is important to have the focus on research, to strengthen the common research programmes and perhaps even to consider creating a fund for basic research that can strengthen research in future technologies such as nanotechnology, allowing the EU also to be a key player. We must consider obtaining increased benchmarking of our universities in Europe in terms of a fair comparison of who does what best on a cross-border basis, and we must create healthy competition. We must look at our training programmes and see whether they take account of needs in the new Member States where, for example, many students cannot afford to travel and learn new things.</p>
<p class="contents">Again, it may be asked: ‘Have we obtained the correct focus in what we now have?’ This, clearly, is the debate in which we in Parliament shall engage and on which we shall work. That being said, the big battle will clearly centre upon regional policy. It is regional policy that is the difficult area. When you attended the hearings here in Parliament, you were courageous enough to express the view that some of the new countries were probably able to absorb more than 4% of gross domestic product. I shall be interested to hear whether you still hold that view, Mrs Grybauskaite, once you are Commissioner. In this area too, we shall of course look at how to make most effective use of the money and at how to create quality rather than just look to quantity. What we are able to come up with on the issue of regional policy is therefore crucial, and we appreciate, of course, that this is quite a difficult subject, including for the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we can obtain a constructive dialogue and a monthly trialogue, for it is important for us to go on discussing these matters. It is quite a package that we have here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I understand that you now want to refer to it as the Barroso package instead of the Prodi package. That is fine with me. After all, I am concerned with content. I very much welcome 1.14% of the GDP for investments in the Lisbon strategy, for money for an economic incentive in the poorer regions and for reinforcing the EU’s role in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is also critical of your plans, though. After all, the future generations, our children, appear to be getting a rough deal. Investments in renewable, sustainable energy sources are inadequate, which is detrimental to the environment and is also feeding dependency on all kinds of dubious regimes in countries where oil flows in abundance. There is no separate fund for Natura 2000, there are insufficient resources for improving the reception of refugees in the region and the increase in funds for culture and exchange programmes for young people is too small. We would like to promote Europe a little less and ensure that people experience Europe a little more.</p>
<p class="contents">So, it is 1.14% ‘plus’, as far as my group is concerned. That is, indeed, quite different from what many Member States say. Some of those Member States still apply the 1% mantra. Meanwhile, they have sneakily become more radical, because I noticed that they are meanwhile applying 1% in the commitment appropriations instead of in the payments, which have traditionally always been somewhat lower. That would mean that up to 2013, we would have a budget that is lower than we have at present, while the European Union has enlarged. All the while, we are busy making lists of ambitions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States do not all follow the same view. The cuts in agriculture and the structural funds are, in fact, very controversial. A child will therefore realise that those will mainly remain intact in the major negotiations. Where will the cuts be made? In the funds for research, development, human rights, the environment, external policy and culture. Precisely those areas that are close to people’s hearts and that are given a visible added value if they are implemented at European level. A budget that is borne out of euroscepticism will only feed that euroscepticism even more. In that way, we will retain a Europe that is mainly focused on the market and the currency, and that is heading absolutely the wrong way.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Lamassoure, who states that we need more active leadership from the Commission. If we really want – and that is what we uphold, after all – that Europe is a Europe that is united in diversity, we will need to actively invest in this. I would also like to call on the Commission to use us, because they do not know our position yet. We may be arguing in favour of 1.5%, because we are far more ambitious than the Member States. With 1.14%, the Commission will therefore be treading a middle path.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that you will gain the strategic insight to dispel all the smoke that is continuously being created and which we think may be indicative of a small fire – you may have dropped 1.07% somewhere in secret after all. We urge you to table a clear position about where you want to take this Europe. Show your leadership. Prove it in the negotiations, for that is the only way of creating a Europe that is not the old Europe of the market and of the currency, but a Europe that takes people and the environment to heart. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The decade 2004-2013 will be characterised by the accession of 12 new countries. The Union needs to decide whether it is going to promote the unification of Europe and equality of opportunity, or whether it is to create divisions and heighten inequalities. Research establishments<span class="italic">, </span>civic society, entrepreneurs and others ought to contribute to the debate on the future of Europe, not just politicians. Unfortunately, the Union is not in favour of a public debate of this kind. Instead, the future of Europe is being decided in remote offices. Bureaucrats and politicians are taking the decisions on tasks and resources, and they also decide how to allocate funds and on the amounts involved. In the meantime, Parliament is busy debating minor issues together with the possibility of broadening its competences. Even if Parliament’s competences were to be increased, there will be no time to prepare our own draft budget tackling two major issues, namely how to speed up the pace of economic development and how to reduce the differences between richer and poorer regions of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">A new budget is required, however, as the Commission’s draft runs counter to the notion of solidarity and is not conducive to speeding up the development of Europe. This is true both of the proposals and the sums referred to therein. The best example I could mention is the fact that the countries of the old Fifteen, which are all rich, are to receive in excess of EUR 194 billion from the Cohesion Fund, whilst the ten new Member States and Romania and Bulgaria are only due to receive EUR 180 billion. It is also worth remembering that a significant proportion of the second sum will end up in the richer countries, in the form of order and of payments to advisers and experts.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, the European Parliament ought to come up with its own draft budget. This should either be undertaken in opposition to the Commission and the Council, or in cooperation with them. This budget would be based on three principles. The first of these is that the greater the Union, the greater the budget. The second is that the greater the differences in development, the more funding should go to less-developed regions and Member States. The third principle is that tax and investment concessions are required, as are other appropriate measures for the benefit of less-developed regions and countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, Commissioner, you have confirmed that the current Commission is maintaining the proposal of the previous Commission. I would add – to those people who are constantly claiming to be Europeanists – that less money means the renationalisation of the cohesion policy, which is equivalent to less Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the Commission will probably soon propose amendments depending on how the negotiations develop. And I am sure that the Commission’s proposals will be based on the principle of balance. I would, therefore, like to ask the European Commission to review the aspects of its proposal which could lead to unfair results because of their lack of balance, Commissioner. Because I believe that to a certain extent that is what is happening at this point in the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to provide material for this debate – either endorsing it or rejecting it – I would call on the European Commission to make public in this House the information available to it on the impact on the fifteen Member States of the costs of enlargement – which, of course, is absolutely essential – because the intention to pay for the convergence requirements of our new partners at the expense of solidarity with the countries and regions of the existing States would be profoundly anti-European and harmful to our shared future.</p>

The real debate is about the question whether we are prepared to actually pay for the political priorities included in the new European Constitution. It is a case of putting your money where your mouth is, therefore. It is precisely in that area that our citizens have seen European leadership fail too often. I have six observations to make.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is that Europe must be a social Europe, but in most countries, private and public investments in education and research are trailing behind. The cuts are harsh at 3%, but there is not enough room for extra investments in research and education. The golden rule is not an option in the Stability Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we are not prepared to make the real switch from agricultural subsidy to rural and environmental policy for the sake of internal social cohesion and our priority, which is knowledge. This would create actual room for knowledge innovation in the countryside and in the urban areas, with priority being given to the ten new acceding countries. In Europe, we say in the Constitution that we want Europe to have a central role in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, one in five people across the globe have no access to education or health care. We talk about millennium objectives and about 2015, but what we see are, in fact, levels of spending by the EU Member States and by the EU itself that are far below par in this respect, despite resolutions by this House. We want the Commission’s new plans and the Commission communication about development policy to be given priority in January, with broad backing from Parliament, for these millennium objectives in Heading 4: 35% for the millennium objectives and 20% for basic education and basic health care. Mr Borrell was right in saying that if it is not in the budget, then it does not exist. That, then, is why we want it.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth is that bad European leadership is at its most prominent in external policy, with major decisions, but no funding. We want a Middle East policy overnight, and we get the funding from the budget to fight poverty in Africa. We want a new neighbourhood policy. All well and good, but the money is once again taken from the budget to fight poverty in Asia and Central America. Each objective deserves its own budget. We should not have to shift funding around.</p>
<p class="contents">The fifth is that we want national fraud and accountant certification bureaus in order to guarantee swift and fraud-proof implementation and subsequent approval in each country. We are still far too vulnerable on that score.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixthly and finally, the public wants to see that each country makes a fair contribution to the combined European budget according to its own capacity. If that is 1% or 1.15%, so be it; as long as it is done according to the capacity and the means of each country. Equal shares. That applies to the Netherlands as well as to other countries. Only then will we receive the support of our European citizens for a truly serious policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not just the volume of EU funding that is at issue, but what future action is to consist of in general. The first serious disagreement among the Member States concerns the extent of financing. The Commission’s proposal is based on the payment appropriations, which on average would amount to 1.14% of GDP. The proposal by six countries for a ceiling on expenditure of 1% is a stringent one. It does not even reflect the extent of next year’s budget, although the transition phase for the new Member States is only just starting. A call has now been made for joint liability. Will it end when it is a matter of money?</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem is the call for a rebate on contributions by the largest net contributors, known as the ‘generalised correction mechanism’. That does not seem fair, as these same Member States also benefit most from the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal puts great emphasis on improving employment and competitiveness. In my opinion, that is absolutely the right focus. There have already been enough resolutions. Industry and enterprise cannot succeed if there is no serious research and development work. On the other hand, research is so expensive that no Member State on its own can compete, for example, with the United States of America or Japan. For that reason, European cooperation is needed. We already have examples of this in the fields of space technology and particle research.</p>
<p class="contents">The creation of new research programmes must be based on the premise that they will focus on projects that call for Europe-wide cooperation. They must not be allowed to become bureaucratic Structural Funds programmes, the like of which we have now. There must also be more substantial production of training courses in connection with programmes of research. It is very important that we should agree on the future financial framework next year. Then we would avoid the sort of mess we saw at the start of the Agenda 2000 programme, which was delayed, resulting in serious delays in the drafting of several programmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, I welcome your commitment to the original Commission proposals, although we have heard from other sources that the Commission – somewhere – is preparing for alternative outcomes. I would ask you to consider publishing what analysis you have carried out of alternative outcomes of the financial perspectives. That would be particularly helpful to the debate within our own nation-states.</p>
<p class="contents">My own country, the UK – as opposed to my own nation, Scotland – is putting forward a position that is as unconstructive as it is unclear. An objective analysis of what the UK position would mean in terms of numbers and political ramifications would be a hugely helpful contribution to the debate. The UK contribution to the debate thus far, with its position on the UK rebate, the statistical effect, the nationalisation of structural funds and the limiting of the EU budget to one per cent of GNI is nothing less than a cumulative act of vandalism. An objective analysis of this contribution from the Commission would be a very helpful debating tool for us in the United Kingdom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will place a restriction on the annual budgets right up until 2013. This will be crucial to choices of areas and to how great a commitment the EU can assume during the next seven to eight years.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent days, the Commission has presented its view of the long-term budget. The new Commission has taken over the old Commission’s proposal, or what is known as the Prodi package. This means a significant rise in expenditure. In the case of some countries, it is a question of a 50% real increase. That is something I find unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">My view is that the new Commission should have listened more closely to the views of the six largest net contributors. They demanded that the financial perspective should include an expenditure ceiling of 1% of gross national income. There should be a ceiling not only for payments, but also for commitments. It is not acceptable, as the Commission proposes, to allow the commitments to proliferate to 1.27% of gross national income. That is the upper limit that the Members have undertaken to pay. After 2013, there will be no way of expanding over and above general economic growth unless all the countries agree to give up their right of veto. That is not something I believe they will do.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission therefore proposes that the EU introduce some form of EU tax. We are definitely and strongly opposed to the EU’s being given its own right of taxation. Without monitoring by the individual Member States, there is no limit upon the EU’s ambition to grow into a federal superstate. Each Member State should allow its parliament to vote on the EU’s financial perspective before the Council of Ministers takes its decision so that the decision is not taken secretly but openly and clearly, with people aware of the financial commitments they will assume.</p>
<p class="contents">So that the national parliaments might be provided with a sound basis for their decisions, the Commission should prepare a draft alternative perspective contained within the 1% expenditure ceiling we have proposed. There is otherwise a palpable risk of the Commission’s ultimately being forced into ill thought-out cutbacks in expenditure and commitments, instead of having properly considered prioritising that makes it possible to keep the promises made to the new countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
