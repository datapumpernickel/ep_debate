<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Theorin (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, following the end of the Cold War, the battlefield has shifted to small communities, streets and homes. Conflicts are more likely to arise within rather than between States. Wars and other conflicts have always been a male province, but the majority of victims – 90 per cent – are civilian. It is women and girls who, in addition, are exposed to special forms of atrocity. They are raped, abducted and kept as sex slaves. Those widowed by conflicts are forced to bring up children and look after the elderly by themselves. Women are nonetheless excluded from the peace negotiations, and their needs and priorities are overlooked.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission for the Reconstruction of Tajikistan, which has 25 000 widows, only one of 26 participants was a woman. In the initial peace negotiations to bring an end to the conflict in Burundi, two out of 126 delegates were women. <span class="italic">No </span>Bosnian women took part in the peace negotiations which brought the war in Bosnia to an end, and this despite the fact that the whole world was aware of the systematic rape to which women were exposed and of the responsibility they would be forced to accept for reconstructing Bosnian society. In the negotiations which preceded NATO’s bombing of Kosovo four years later, there was only one woman in the delegation. When the stability pact for the reconstruction of South-Eastern Europe was created, no women at all were appointed in spite of their unique experience in peacemaking at grass roots level. They had even less of a role to play in the committee responsible for reconstruction.</p>
<p class="contents">A house cannot be built on half a plot of land. If we exclude 50 per cent of the population, we shall not obtain a sustainable peace. Women must participate fully in all peace negotiations, in all reconstruction work and in peace-keeping operations. While formal peace processes are almost exclusively a male domain, international experience and declarations show the importance of women’s participation in resolving conflicts and building peace. In the few cases in which civil society and women have taken part in formal peace negotiations, it has, however, been successful, for example in South Africa, Guatemala and Cambodia. This is also apparent from a series of UN documents, most recently the resolution concerning women, peace and security adopted by the Security Council two weeks ago.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a question of protecting the civilian population, refugees and asylum seekers, of combating exemption from punishment for rape committed in war and of promoting women’s active participation in resolving conflicts and building peace at all levels. These areas are the subject of my report, which has obtained broad support in committee. To make it possible for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to vote in favour of the resolution, I have gone along with compromise Amendment No 19 up to Paragraph 12, which is backed by both the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. I propose a supplement to the fourth Geneva protocol whereby rape, forced pregnancy and sexual slavery are to be defined as war crimes in the same way as terrorism and torture. I urge the Member States to ratify the Treaty of Rome for a permanent international criminal court. Such a court is absolutely essential if the tendency to systematically use rape as a strategy of war is to be precluded. In addition, all peacekeeping personnel, men as well as women, ought to undergo equality training. This applies especially to peacekeeping forces. The goal should be to have at least 40 per cent women involved in all peace and reconstruction work.</p>
<p class="contents">Local participation in the peace and reconciliation processes is important. I therefore urge the Member States and the Commission to support individual organisations engaged in conflict prevention and peace work at a technical, financial and political level. Despite the fact that only a limited number of women have been involved, studies show that women’s participation in the UN’s peacekeeping forces improves relations with the local population, as well as general morale. However, the presence of male peacekeepers leads to an increase in sexual violence and prostitution around the camps. UN soldiers, including soldiers from EU countries, have been sent home following complaints of sexual violence in Somalia and Mozambique.</p>
<p class="contents">Peace is far too heavy a burden to be placed upon only <span class="italic">one</span> institution, <span class="italic">one </span>government or <span class="italic">one</span> sex. Sustainable peace cannot be created if half the human race is ignored. Peace can <span class="italic">only</span> be achieved if women participate fully in the peace process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Women are especially affected by wars and conflict situations because of their responsibility for their family, their children and the elderly, but also because they often assume sole responsibility in the absence of their husbands and fathers and accordingly often have to ensure, single-handed, that their family survives.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is also particularly difficult for women, however, if they still have to fight for recognition and for equal rights in practice. Decisions on implementing relief programmes are the responsibility of crisis teams, and the specialist knowledge and expertise of women is often not recognised or not given due respect by such teams. Yet it seems all too obvious that the people to involve in such difficult situations are those who bear responsibility on the ground, on the home front as it were, and can contribute to resolving conflicts from their own experience. As, unfortunately, this is not regarded as obvious, this report makes a very specific demand for women to be integrated into these bodies and for them to be given a participatory role.</p>
<p class="contents">The report denounces the fact that conflict situations are still associated with violent assaults and also appalling sexual assaults. Preventative measures are needed, including the provision of special protection for women in refugee camps by segregating said camps. We must help women who are victims of violence. That much we agree on. This chapter of violence against women in conflicts goes beyond the actual subject of this report and really should have been developed further in view of its importance and highly explosive nature. The Theorin report goes into a lot of detail and repetition, which we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats consider do not belong in an official document.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to make sure that requests are made in a realistic framework. For example, I hope that the compromise reached, which Mrs Theorin referred to in connection with Paragraph 12, will also gain the support of this House. In areas where decisions are within the competence of Member States, we in the European Parliament can highlight changes and desirable improvements. But we have no legal power to achieve them. It is the responsibility of the Member States to take decisions regarding women in refugee camps. The PPE-DE Group has gone to great pains to table appropriate amendments, and I ask honourable Members also to support the compromise amendment tabled by the rapporteur on Paragraph 12. If we want our voice to be heard on the international stage, we must take matters forward through diplomatic channels, recognising their sensitivity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The subject was often exploited as a politically opportunist argument between warring parties. This was also clearly the case with successive UN world conferences held since 1975, particularly with regard to the conflict in the Middle East. Since the issue of women and peace itself carried little political weight, the utopian movements were able to dominate the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been a sea change since the World Conference for Women held in Beijing in 1995. It was there that the initial impetus was given to a mature treatment of the subject. In particular, in the years that followed, a great deal of work was set in train within and around the UN and its associated organisations. It is therefore high time that we put this into practice at European level too and, as has often proved to be the case with women’s rights issues, Europe is lagging behind somewhat in this area. The aversion some men in this House have shown towards having a serious discussion of this issue means the writing is on the wall. They obviously want to keep their powerful position in matters of foreign policy and defence for themselves, yet feel that men <span class="italic">can </span>promote women’s interests. Mrs Theorin should be praised for the tenacity with which she has defended this issue in the face of considerable opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">On 31 October, the Security Council adopted a resolution entitled ‘Women, peace and security’, following a two day debate. Mrs Theorin referred to this earlier. In terms of objectives, this resolution broadly resembles the proposal now on the table. That too is an illustration of how important the issue is.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I wish to express my disappointment at what I see as shifty manoeuvres that have lead to the watering down of Paragraph 12 concerning the rights and freedom of choice of women who fall victim to rape and states of war. As far as I am concerned, these rights are not for haggling over. Politically speaking, I would be more inclined to interpret the amendment in question, i.e. Amendment No 19, as a tactical defeat or a tactical withdrawal than a compromise on the substance, and in truth that is unworthy of this women’s issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problem with a report like this, however, is that it does not list its many proposals in order of priority. Nor, I freely admit, was that the intention. We are therefore easily in danger, however, of just moving on to the next subject once the vote has taken place. I therefore wish to propose that we assign a level of priority to our next step and that we begin with what we can do in practical terms to put these proposals into practice in connection with the civil and military tool which is being developed in the course of these very months. I shall therefore urge the Council, Mr Solana and the Commission, including Chris Patten, to go through the many ideas in the report and draw inspiration from them and then introduce these ideas and proposals into the work which is going on right now before our very eyes and the future practical implementation of which we unfortunately do not know very much about.</p>
<p class="contents">It may be a very good test of what all the words regarding equality, mainstreaming, the strengthening of the role of women etc. means in practice. Let us begin with practical measures. The Council and the Commission ought shortly to be coming back to Parliament with a report on what could be done. There are many issues on the table to set to work on, for example, police education or the training of military personnel. There is certainly cause for increasing understanding of the fact that rape really is an atrocity that cannot be accepted, just as we cannot accept torture either. There could also be training in involving NGOs and in developing facilities for people affected by crises etc. We could subsequently hold hearings, seminars etc. on these subjects. We should also, into the bargain, like to see openness about the whole process and about the development of these preventative measures. If this could happen on the basis of involving women, then we might perhaps, suddenly and quite unexpectedly, have given the EU a human face in one particular area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now we have to move on to practical work and I have two topical points to make.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards women, since women are participants in history, they must now become players in the peace process. I am one of the ten women MEPs which went as a delegation to the Middle East two weeks ago, so it is topical – Mrs Morgantini will be able to fill you in on the details – not only so that women would be present in the peace process, but also so that there would be a European policy and that we women would support a European policy to promote peace in the Middle East. We really need to be practical.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns, not the female peacemakers, but the victims of war. In two weeks’ time, there will be a tribunal in Tokyo organised by NGOs. This attempt at a tribunal to denounce what ‘comfort women’ were made to do during the Second World War will take place in December 2000. I call on this Parliament to support it. This point is very important because this tribunal also wants to act as a pioneer and to be the first to raise the question of the crimes against humanity committed against women.</p>
<p class="contents">Comfort women, mostly from Korea, were raped and duped into becoming sexual slaves during the Second World War by Japan, which does not want to acknowledge this crime. They were held prisoner. There is now a film and witness statements which will be presented to this tribunal. I hope, Mrs Theorin, that we will take an initiative on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities to support this action with a view to recognising and making reparations for this crime against humanity perpetrated against women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The majority of refugees are women and children. Women are double victims of armed conflicts since they are also subjected to rapes and sexual abuse, which have sometimes been used as weapons of war. The serious problems which this causes women are increased, because they are then repudiated in their home communities. It has been seen that the participation of women in the resolution of conflicts and in the organisation of refugee camps can be extremely positive.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree that rapes, forced pregnancy, forced sterilisation and any other type of sexual violence should be recognised as crimes against humanity, and legal texts should therefore be updated to protect women effectively. Furthermore, there must be financial resources to help women who are victims of this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Women’s participation in the diplomatic resolution of conflicts and in reconstruction initiatives would be of enormous help in achieving these objectives. The training of men in all aspects of gender-related issues would also be of real help to the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">This report, which we consider to be important given the nature of the issue it deals with, is, nevertheless, too repetitive and contains certain elements which we do not like, but we recognise that it deals with a real problem which must be resolved and our group will therefore support it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And yet, when we look at the participation of women in decision making about the prevention and resolution of armed conflicts or in peace initiatives, we see that they have a very limited presence. We cannot allow this state of affairs to continue, because the rights, priorities and interests of women are often ignored in peace negotiations and also because the few examples of women in decision-making positions in these areas have proved to be very effective.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall mention just two examples that clearly illustrate what I have just said: Mary Robinson, who directs the United Nations’ humanitarian aid programmes, has performed her duties with enormous courage and determination, visiting dangerous places in dangerous times, condemning appalling situations, and forcing countries and international bodies not to hide behind a complicit silence and to adopt the measures that are needed. Portugal, which only opened up its diplomatic service to women following the “Revolution of April 1974”, has recently demonstrated with the case of East Timor and our ambassador to Indonesia, Ana Gomes, how the role of a woman and her sensitivity to the problems and sufferings of a people that fought unaided for its freedom for 25 years can be recognised by the whole world and especially here in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The time has come to say "enough" to the absence of women in the settlement of this type of problem. We must do so in a sensible but determined way, so that in future political leaders will be perfectly aware of the fact that wars are problems that affect everyone and not just men, that women suffer more than anyone and that for this very reason women should be represented in all organisations which address situations of armed conflict. Above all, women should be represented in order to sound the alarm and, if possible, to prevent armed conflicts breaking out, or at least to mitigate such situations and to restore dignity to those who are innocent but who are nonetheless the main victims – women and children. These are some of the reasons why we shall be voting in favour of this very important report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a feminist and a pacifist who is involved, together with other women, in building relations and bridges of peace in places of conflict, I have found that this report contains the wealth of experience gained from many peace-building projects carried out by women in recent years. Peace is more than the absence of war: it is recognition of economic and social justice. It is true that we women are those who suffer most in war zones but we are more than just victims: we are the bearers of alternatives to war and violence and the builders and protagonists of change. There is the example of the international network of the 'Women in Black' who are against war and violence and have been demonstrating for 12 years in Israel against the military occupation of Palestine, in dialogue and solidarity with Palestinian women. We women Members of Parliament also saw them during our visit to the Middle East at this tragic time. Similarly, during the war in the former Yugoslavia, the 'Women in Black' of Belgrade built up relationships with Croatian and Bosnian women. In various different countries of the world, we have transcended borders, united in the refusal to abide by national allegiance.</p>
<p class="contents">But these projects and the skills which women have, diplomacy on a practical level, which provides an alternative to State diplomacy, can no longer be disregarded; they must be used in decision-making forums and at all levels of diplomacy. This is why more women must be involved in negotiations, in prevention operations, in management ...</p>

I would like to congratulate Mrs Theorin for broaching a subject at European level that we have rarely discussed. When I listen to the various comments made, I find myself agreeing with those who recommend that we take a look at our priorities and then limit the number of aims we want to achieve. There is a great deal in the report and we will not be able to do everything straightaway. I will mention several of my own priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we must urge all the Member States to ratify the Treaty of Rome. Remarkably few have done so up to now; only two or three, so I am told. So achieving that alone would be a start. It is recognised in this Treaty that rape committed during wars, and all the consequences thereof, must be regarded as a war crime. Perhaps that is exactly what you would expect in this day and age, but it certainly was not the norm up until very recently, nor did it happen as a matter of course.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on 31 October a resolution was approved in the Security Council, namely resolution 1325, which ‘calls for broad participation of women<span class="italic"> </span>in peacebuilding and post-conflict reconstruction<span class="italic">"</span>. I am referring to the Security Council of the United Nations. I think it would be worthwhile, under the circumstances, for the European Union to take a look at what points were raised too, because they have been adopted within the United Nations, and so they must also be taken on board at European level. Around eighteen points were raised, which is quite a few.</p>

This is made possible by the fact that, historically, women as a whole have stood for non-violence, have different experiences from men of war and conflict and devote all their time to protecting life with dialogue, reconciliation and negotiation. These pacific qualities in women could provide an alternative solution, the basis for the foundations of a new civilisation, a civilisation of peace, in which dialogue is protected at all levels and from which war and violence are excluded as a means of resolving differences.</p>
<p class="contents">The absence of women, and of the pacific system of women, is all the more noticeable in areas in crisis, such as the Middle East, which I visited recently. I am convinced that if women, both Palestinian and Israeli, had a say and a role in the peace process, there is every likelihood that a fair and viable solution to the Palestinian question would have been found and we would not now be facing the present crisis, which is the outcome of 7 whole years of failed negotiation. In the case of Iraq, which I visited as a member of a mission to contest the embargo in practice, women would not, under any circumstances, have put political or military objectives above human life and would not have sacrificed 6,000 innocent children a month in the name of any form of political, economic or strategic interest in the area. That is why this dimension needs to be taken into account when drawing up European Union policies in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has chosen her words carefully in denouncing violations of women's dignity and in demanding action to achieve change. The report not only refers to the social exclusion of women as a problem in itself, it also rightly emphasises that protection against criminality and personal safety are no longer something that can be guaranteed solely within national borders. I therefore support the demands made in the report for women to be given the right to diplomatic influence. I support the initiative taken in this report and I support the statement contained in it that sexually abused women need the Community's protection and that it is high time the perpetrators stopped going unpunished. Women and men, and people in general, are all different. Equal opportunities means treating people differently – but how they are treated is still determined by the people themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I want to focus briefly on just one paragraph of the report – Paragraph 3 – which condemns the use of so-called child soldiers. Unfortunately terms are not defined and distinctions are not made. We all condemn unreservedly the brutal abduction of children, some not even in their teens, particularly in certain African countries such as Sierra Leone or Uganda, and their corruption into murderous habits and involvement in barbaric practices such as mutilation and maiming. These are not soldiers and they should be distinguished from young people in our own armed forces. The trouble is that when we talk of child soldiers, then some interest groups use this as an opportunity to criticise distinguished institutions such as the British Army and this has happened recently. As a guiding principle, we try to avoid sending young people into operational areas, but sometimes it happens and they serve with pride in well-disciplined units.</p>
<p class="contents">We should really avoid any possibility of confusing such honourable activity – which should be encouraged – with the sort of barbarism which I am sure the author of this report has in mind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President, this report opens up new territory in European policy, that of women’s’ contribution to peace. In my view, this territory is full of possibilities and could surely change the grim landscape of failures which, for centuries, have resulted from the exclusive domination of men. In this field there has been nothing but shameful failures but nevertheless we are still faced with a brick wall which excludes women. This is a very well informed, in-depth, and rigorous report, which is capable of stating fundamental principles with the clarity demonstrated in Paragraph 17. It is audacious but, at the same time, contains considerable practical sense and very necessary proposals. Mr President, it is a great shame that it has had to be diminished for the sake of reaching a consensus! My only consolation is that this says a great deal about Mrs Theorin’s parliamentary abilities.</p>
<p class="contents">It is shameful that nobody is here representing the Council. Mr President, please tell me who is representing the Council at the moment, or the High Representative for the CFSP.

In my case, it is impossible to do that because I think that Mrs Theorin’s report ought to be rejected. I also think that the draftsperson of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities is on shaky ground when she maintains that there is broad support for a report adopted on the basis of eight votes in favour and five against.</p>
<p class="contents">It is an insult to Parliament to use an own-initiative report to push issues not covered by the mandate. Mrs Theorin was to write an own-initiative report on women’s participation in peaceful conflict resolution. Instead, the report deals with everything from the conditions experienced by women in refugee camps to the ways in which women develop strength and active influence. In her eagerness to oppose everything that is evil, systematic rape and sexual slavery are condemned. I for my part want to condemn all rape and all slavery.</p>
<p class="contents">There are points in the report, for example the issue of the various diplomatic corps, which might well be suited to a report that could be seriously discussed across all the committees, with parties concerned with foreign and security policy also involved in the discussion. Mrs Theorin fought for a long time to stop Sweden becoming a member of the European Union. Now, she is suddenly campaigning for the EU to determine which officials our foreign administration is to appoint. There is a lack of consistency here. Let us instead make conflict resolution an issue through which the conditions for peace at all levels and involving all players can be strengthened, rather than getting bogged down in gender issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly object to the attitude of mind, expressed in this Chamber this evening, whereby one sex is made collectively guilty. I think it is an insult to all those men who have died to defend freedom, peace and democracy in their own countries or in the context of peacekeeping efforts. To create antagonism between the sexes, as there is a determination to do in this Chamber this evening, is neither peaceful nor constructive in my view. That is why I and many others in addition to myself intend voting against this report tomorrow. I do not, in fact, consider it to be a serious piece of work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamantopoulou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span><span class="bold">.</span> – <span class="italic">(EL)</span> Mr President, I think this really is an innovative report, an innovative resolution, one which introduces a new dimension into foreign policy in a very specific manner.</p>
<p class="contents">No one can claim that women would make better generals or better negotiators. No one can claim that women are more democratic or more supportive of peace. But what is clear in the resolution is that a basic social component is missing every time there is any political crisis management, every time there is any political conflict management and every time war takes its toll on society. The gender dimension is missing. Women are not people with fewer or more capabilities, they just have a different take on society. They are people with different experiences and these experiences are essential to the way in which policy is applied, especially in conflict management. This state of affairs is described in the report with interesting and often shocking details. However, I agree with some of the lady members who said that we need very specific objectives and measures if the gender dimension is to inform policies, programmes and individual projects.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to refer to some of the basic recommendations in the resolution which require action by the Commission. First, the recommendation about raising the awareness of both sexes of initiatives for peace and security is, as far as the rapid reaction facility is concerned, already contained in the regulation which will be voted on 4 December and which clearly states that security and stability beyond the borders of the European Union must take account of the physical integrity of men and women wherever it is threatened.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there are the regulations for human rights. These regulations provide for a legal basis for our political activities vis-à-vis third countries as regards action taken by the Union to prevent conflict, deal with its consequences, implement confidence-building measures, promote humanitarian law and support international, regional and local organisations involved in conflict prevention. All these projects funded by the European Commission already include the gender dimension. Take the example of Angola: last year it received funding so that women and women's organisations could participate in endeavours to achieve final settlement of the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The third element is the participation of the European Community in rehabilitating victims of torture. One of our aims is to pay particular attention to the special needs of women. The first example occurred last year, with initiatives taken to provide medical, psychological and social support to exiled women in Bosnia.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth example is the important role of women in the peace process which the European Community is supporting in the Balkans and in the Mediterranean basin.</p>
<p class="contents">The fifth point is the role of ECHO, the European Commission Humanitarian Aid Office, which has been invited by Parliament to help evaluate the gender dimension. I must say that, as a rule, ECHO programmes do take account of the gender dimension and an effort is always made to include the gender dimension in many of the programmes funded by ECHO for the benefit of other organisations, such as the High Commissioner of the United Nations, the International Federation of Red Cross Societies and others. And we have implemented specific projects over recent years on women's protection, health and social status and large chunks of the programmes are dedicated to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to refer to the European Refugee Fund. Article 4.2 states that, as far as terms of acceptance and access to asylum procedures are concerned, special measures may be taken for people who are especially vulnerable, such as women. Again in connection with this programme, because it is mentioned in the resolution, I should point out that projects are undertaken by the Member States. At the Commission's initiative, 5% of the resources may be provided for special projects, such as training civil servants at reception centres, the police and public hygiene officials in how to deal with the special needs of women refugees. As the resolution stresses, the European Fund takes account, where possible, of the gender dimension in this activity.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, what is clear is that we are witnessing an initial stage in which the gender dimension, the participation of women, is starting to become, if not the rule, then at least an element in various programmes. Clearly it is not enough. Clearly it is an initial stage, but I think that, with political action and initiatives such as this resolution and with specific objectives which both Parliament and the Commission must set, we may bring about a change.</p>

<p class="contents">The debate is closed.</p>
<p class="contents">The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.</p>
<p class="contents">Before we continue with the agenda, I would like to make two comments. Mrs Izquierdo Rojo complained earlier about the lack of a Council representative. Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, the Council never attends sittings in the evening. Part of the problem is that when we arrange the agenda we postpone important subjects until the evening. The Conference of Presidents is responsible for this, and if we wish to change this, then we need to make sure that debates on renewable energy sources or important women's issues are not scheduled for the evening, because, as I have said, the Council is never present at that time.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may make a personal comment, I believe that we would make rather more progress, regardless of what you may think about the contribution of the only man taking part in this debate, if more men participated in debates of this kind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
