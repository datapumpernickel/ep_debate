<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Günter Verheugen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>.<span class="italic"> </span>–<span class="italic"> (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to be able to present to you this evening the Commission’s proposal for a regulation on medicinal products for paediatric use. This is a very important proposal, which will improve child health in Europe and spare many families the suffering which the premature death of a child brings.</p>
<p class="contents">Over 50% of the medicinal products used on children in the European Union today are neither tested on children nor authorised for paediatric use. This means that we cannot always be sure that these medicines are effective or safe. As I understand it, none of us is prepared to take that risk any more. The Commission’s proposal tackles this aspect of public health head-on. It will provide an incentive for high-quality research and bring about the development and authorisation of paediatric medicinal products that will be of<span class="bold"> </span>high quality, extremely safe and extremely effective. The proposal not only addresses this important aspect of public health, but also aims to stimulate innovation and competition and contribute towards growth and employment in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to extend my thanks and congratulations to Mrs Grossetête, the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, for her work and the effort she put in to complete this report. She has made a truly outstanding job of it. I also wish to thank Mrs Toia for drafting the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and all the members of both committees for their support for the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to proceed directly to the specific point that I know has been the subject of extremely intensive debate in Parliament. I am talking about the Commission’s proposal for a fixed six-month extension of the Supplementary Protection Certificate for the products concerned here. This is one of the most fundamental provisions of our proposal, without which it is of little value.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me start by explaining why we have given preference to a fixed over a variable extension of the Supplementary Protection Certificate. A fixed extension is simple to use and can be foreseen exactly. It creates only a small administrative burden, and is compatible with existing patent law. In contrast, a variable extension of the Supplementary Protection Certificate would contravene the principles of patent law and, moreover, would not be conducive to innovation. A provision to this effect would be highly impracticable, as it would require a precise economic analysis for each medicinal product.</p>
<p class="contents">I also doubt whether a variable solution, being based on sales figures, would be fair. One thing that should be borne in mind in this regard is that sales success is not an indication of the innovativeness of a medicinal product; nor of the outlay on research. I should like to make it clear that the Commission is very determined about this, and I do not believe that the Commission sees any prospect of compromise in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to explain the Commission’s reasons for proposing a six-month extension of the Supplementary Protection Certificate. Based on our impact assessment, which was very thorough, we believe that this period strikes a balance between the aims of the proposal on the one hand, and the costs and benefits to public health, industry and public health service finances on the other. The Commission can support in principle the amendment advocating a review of the regulation on medicinal products for paediatric use, in order to enable a proper assessment of its impact, particularly the financial impact of bonuses and incentives. We must ensure that any review carried out also takes into account the desired benefits to public health of this regulation. Finally, the financial impact of the regulation should not be assessed until such time as sufficient data are available.</p>
<p class="contents">Understandably, I have not been able to discuss every single amendment, but the Commission’s position on all of the amendments has been communicated to Parliament’s services<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The proposal for a regulation on medicinal products for paediatric use is important from the points of view of child health, innovation and competitiveness. I have no doubt that today’s debate will show that we are on the right track here. By way of conclusion, I should like to emphasise most strongly that the issue here is the health and welfare of children for whom no help was previously available. This is far more important than the interests of any pharmaceutical-industry lobby group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Françoise Grossetête (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have been waiting for this moment for a long time, because our Parliament has been calling for this specific European regulation on paediatric medicinal products for many years.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you explained it very well: it seems inconceivable that, today, our children cannot get treatment adapted to their needs. It is, however, a reality. In 2005, a large number of the medicinal products administered to children were not specifically developed for paediatric use. In many cases, the products used for the very young are the same as those prescribed to adults, the only difference being that the doses are smaller. However, children do not have the same metabolism as adults. Children therefore need specifically adapted pharmaceutical forms, not only so that they are better tolerated, but also so that they are safer and more effective. That is the aim of this regulation and I would like to thank all of my fellow Members who have participated in the work.</p>
<p class="contents">My report presents some considerable advances, which have the approval of a large number of Members. They aim in particular to improve the readability of the actions of the Paediatric Committee, which will be set up within the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products, to avoid additional clinical trials being performed on children when they are not necessary, to promote the transparency of the instruments, to reduce administrative delays, to strengthen pharmacovigilance, to introduce an obligation to perform paediatric research for any new medicinal product intended for adults, without this system delaying the placing on the market of innovative medicinal products, to call on the Paediatric Committee to draw up an inventory of therapeutic needs of children, and finally, to create a European research fund intended to finance research on medicines which are not patent-protected but which could be of great benefit to children.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the main point in this text is still that connected with the incentive. I have put a great deal of work into this issue. I have listened carefully and, having debated it with you all, I think that the proposal for a fixed incentive, namely a six-month extension of the supplementary protection certificate, is the best possible solution. This period is the fairest and most pragmatic that we could come up with. I definitely say six months, not five months. The US has set up a recognised system with a period of six months. Why should Europe not do the same?</p>
<p class="contents">I must admit that I do not really understand the amendment proposed by Mr Maaten. Mr Maaten, we are always asking the European Parliament to look for better solutions by means of benchmarking. Indeed, the United States have a good system in this regard; since they have had this regulation, around 100 paediatric medicinal products have become available to American children. Why should we be unable to provide the same support for pharmaceutical research in Europe? I have the impression that we are forever haggling, and I find it regrettable, because what is at stake here is public health for children. I think it is a shame, Mr Maaten, that we could not agree on this period of six months.</p>
<p class="contents">Research is, by definition, risky and if the European Union wants, as you all hope, to develop this strategic sector, we cannot create a watered-down system or institute vague measures. Some of my fellow Members have drawn up a proposal based on proportional rewards. However, this system imposes too many restrictions. I have asked my fellow Members some important questions, questions relating to public health. I am still waiting for the responses of those who advocate this proportionality. Moreover, while waiting for information that never comes from the authors of these amendments, I have been wondering about the reasons for this long silence. It is a question of saving children’s lives and not of balancing the books. Proportionality, however, balances the ‘lives saved’ column against the ‘sales volume’ column.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the proportional system, three months plus three months, or four plus four, the second part would be granted depending on whether or not a particular sales volume or turnover had been achieved. In my view, the danger of this system is this: we would be moving from a health-based system to a market-based system. Why? There is no Europe-wide price for medicinal products. Each Member State sets its own price and, as we know, they vary considerably. With the turnover-based system, laboratories will get out their calculators and choose a country depending on the prices set and not depending on health needs. Moreover, who will be able to verify the sales figures? Some Members have suggested using an independent audit, but without specifying what procedures should apply. They have not assessed the costs, or the additional delays that this bureaucratic procedure would bring, or the possible remedies in case of dispute. The European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products itself has told us that this system is unrealistic, because it does not have the resources. What, then, is the benefit of this proposal?</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the proportional system is not good, and it is not applicable. The system I am proposing is also not based on the medicine itself but on studies conducted under the authority of the Paediatric Committee. I would ask you to take a close look at this condition.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the impact of this measure on the public health budgets of our countries, a study presented to the Council concludes that, with a fixed six-month period, the increase in health spending would be infinitesimal, between 0.7 and 1%. Finally, I wanted to include in the amendments a review clause for the incentive. In six years’ time, the Commission will have to assess the situation, indicating the precise conditions under which the six-month extension has been granted, with what costs and what benefits. With this text, we have the opportunity to move from words to actions. We must stop always being philosophical and be more pragmatic instead. Let us make no mistake. If we do not set up a stable framework to promote research in Europe, it will favour the industry in the US and Asia. This would therefore be a real absurdity in terms of politics, science and health.</p>
<p class="contents">What is Europe good for? This regulation can show our fellow citizens just how useful it is. This matter, which affects everyone, can only be regulated at Community level. No Member State on its own can support the research policy with regard to the pharmaceutical industry. Your vote will be decisive. If we say ‘yes’ to a fixed incentive of six months, our children will soon benefit, thanks to the European Union, from appropriate, safe medicinal products. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">From this point of view, we are all aware that the current situation in Europe is testimony to a very inferior level of development. This positive and important regulation thus needs to be adopted urgently. It is based on certain vital points, which I will go over briefly.</p>
<p class="contents">The creation of the Paediatric Committee is of great importance, as is its composition: it must be made up of high-level, authoritative and independent figures, in view of the extremely delicate tasks for which they will be responsible. They will have to assess the paediatric investigation plans, approve them and evaluate their results.</p>
<p class="contents">The Paediatric Committee will have to create a databank, a network of skills, to be able to avoid – and this is absolutely necessary – duplications of these experiments, and to achieve a position where consideration can be given to the ethical and human aspects necessitated by experiments on such a fragile group of people as sick children and their families.</p>
<p class="contents">Another vital point is the incentives/responsibility, incentives/prescriptions mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, for which I am the draftsman, has as you know approved a proposal for a proportional system. I would therefore like to call on Mrs Grossetête and the other Members who are in favour of different solutions not to demonise our proposal but to try to understand that each of us, representing only ourselves and our own ideas, has put forward what we each believe to be the most appropriate solution for paediatric medicines, and thus child health.</p>
<p class="contents">A proportional solution, which could be extended past the six months, might also help those medicines that are very expensive because of the research involved and that have a small market to have a longer extension.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, regardless of the position that this Parliament adopts, I ask the Commissioner to agree with this proposal, by giving a positive opinion to enable an assessment mechanism to be created which, after a certain period, will enable us to understand what the best proposal is in the light of the facts.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the most important point, because our children, the children of Europe, have the right to see their needs and their requirements met. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is who we are talking about today. We are talking about half the medicines we provide to help them through their young lives not being properly researched, tested or authorised. We have what I call 'the half-an-aspirin syndrome': you give a child half the dose you would give an adult, because you think it ought to have less than the full dose. That may do no harm, it may do no good or it may even harm the child, because it may not be correct for it to have the dose at all, or it should have more or less than that. Therefore I very much welcome both the Commission's proposal and the rapporteur's report.</p>
<p class="contents">The key is how we provide incentives to research. That is what we want and what our children need. We have to maintain a balance between the need for more research and the need to keep costs under control.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has mentioned the example of the United States. Since the system was introduced there in the 1990s, over one hundred new children-specific medicines have come on stream. We want to catch up with that.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate we have had, and perhaps are still having, centres on the patent extension. Some wanted a variable number of months; some wanted a longer period, others a shorter period. The Commission proposed six months; the Council – or 22 Member States in the Council – proposed six months; the rapporteur proposed six months; the committee agreed six months. It must be said that six months is right: it is simple and is a single extension.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also concerned that we avoid double extensions and double claims. Therefore, the aim of my amendment to Article 36 was to make clear that we should not have double rewards for the same paediatric formulation. We need to ensure that it is correctly worded. That is something that the Council and the Commission will now be able to look at. However, when I hear, on the one side, companies saying that it is going too far and, on the other side, generics saying that it is not going far enough, perhaps we have got it right.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the MICE. We do not often welcome MICE into this Chamber, but the MICE – the fund for paediatric medicine research – is very much to be welcomed. The report as a whole and the Commission's proposal are good and will help the two million children who have health problems now and could be helped through this measure in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall tell you in a minute why I find the pedantry, and sometimes even the simplicity, of this debate distasteful.</p>
<p class="contents">We have tabled amendments in committee – I have even tabled them myself – stating the need for this legislation to enter into force more quickly, the reason being that we have waited so long for it, on behalf of the children in the European Union. In addition – and this I say for Mrs Toia’s benefit – the role of the Paediatric Committee, which is to be set up in accordance with the legislation, must be enhanced. We have an interest in a strong Paediatric Committee, and what is more one which takes the lead.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Bowis, Mrs Grossetête and all the others who have said that we need the MICE research programme, another EU initiative. This must be given a proper basis in law, and the proper place for it is in the Seventh Framework Research Programme. I would ask Commissioner Verheugen to urge the Commission that scope and funding be made available for this within the Seventh Framework Research Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I have said that this is a great success, and so I regret that this success is not being given due emphasis in this debate. I find it cheap, pitiful and even shameful that this debate has focused almost exclusively on the extension of patent protection. It is interesting that there has been no discussion of the ten-year extension of data protection for medicinal products whose patent protection has expired: ‘PUMA’, as it is known.</p>
<p class="contents">We should ask ourselves why this is not being discussed: because it creates a level playing field, as it were, between generic medicinal products and pharmaceutical manufacturers engaged in research. Not a single word has been spoken about it: despite going much further – ten-year data protection – it evidently enjoys widespread approval. Yet a dispute of which I have seldom seen the like in this House has developed about a six-month period to be given to those pharmaceutical manufacturers engaged in research who still have a patent, or are applying for one. I would ask all of those who have a fixed opinion on this whether they have spoken to patients’ representatives; I have. I have also spoken to parents with sick children. They could not understand it. They could not understand this discussion, some of which they followed in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. They were just saying, ‘We want these medicines for our children’.</p>
<p class="contents">If what Commissioner Verheugen said does happen, and there is an incentive to procure more medicinal products more quickly, it will be marvellous; it will be exactly what we want. We do not care whether someone earns half a million more or less in the process. There should be considerable benefits to research, and children should also stand to gain. That is what patients’ and parents’ representatives are saying.</p>
<p class="contents">I am a relatively long-standing Member of this House, and do not want to see it split into two, with the countries and representatives of countries which have no research-oriented pharmaceutical industry but only a generics industry objecting that six months is too long, and others saying the opposite. Our sole concern should be doing what is best for patients, which is what the Commission is proposing. The majority of my group will be supporting that, and so shall I.</p>

It is also a good example of what Europe can mean to the citizen, exactly at a time when many citizens appear to be in doubt about this, and deserves all our support for that reason.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation is so important because at present, children are all too often prescribed medicines that have not been developed for children or tested on them, and so the positive or negative effects that the use of these medicines may have on a child are often not known, with all the consequences that this entails. It is therefore vital that more should be invested in the development of medicines that are specifically tailored to children. The proposal is right to try to promote the development of sound and safe children’s medicines by requiring producers of medicines, whenever they apply for a license to market one, to examine its suitability for children.</p>
<p class="contents">Another good example that has been mentioned before is the creation of a children’s medicine committee that will be responsible for the assessment and approval of plans for paediatric research. Similarly, the rapporteur’s proposal in connection with the investigation programme for paediatric research, MICE, for funding research into the paediatric use of medicines that are not protected by a patent or additional protection certificate, will considerably stimulate the production of children’s medicines. I also believe in general that investments are needed, particularly in innovation, more so than in patent protection, the subject we are debating today.</p>
<p class="contents">Research involving children should, of course, be done with due care. Double trials must be avoided and all kinds of measures must be taken to prevent them being carried out. I am also delighted that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has already approved a number of amendments to that effect.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with anyone who says that it is regrettable that in this discussion, we have apparently lost sight of the importance of the child amid the discussions that focus on who in the industry should reap most benefits. In fact, I think that both sides are guilty of this and it is extremely frustrating indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">In principle, I think that such a patent extension should be as short as possible, for in the final analysis, it is the user, or the citizen, who picks up the tab. It is their money we are carving up. A patent is a temporary monopoly that is granted to promote innovation, but in this proposal, research is a requirement and the patent a way of recovering costs, and that is what sets us apart from the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore be tempted to move the spotlight away from patent protection. We have decided in favour of five months while the rapporteur made a passionate plea for six. I myself have changed my mind, first from a flexible period to four months, and I have now proposed five months. Your plea has therefore not been an entire waste. I do fear, though, that we have not really moved any closer to each other, although I value the rapporteur’s work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that over 50% of the medicinal products used in Europe to treat children are neither tested on children nor authorised for paediatric use is preposterous and no longer acceptable. Why has the pharmaceutical industry, which is, after all, always preaching personal responsibility, not seen fit in the past to conduct these very studies itself? This is an indictment of the pharmaceutical industry: it is out to make a killing, a huge profit.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I think it appropriate that we should be honest about, and make no bones about, the fact that this debate in this House is about how this regulation must not be allowed to become the means whereby the few help themselves to the profits they are interested in. We must also, then, seek to lay down very clear conditions. We are not just talking of a couple of million euros here, but of sums into the millions and billions.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with those Members who say that patents need to be protected for a shorter period of time. We have re-tabled an amendment to extend patent protection to just four months, and I should once more like to ask all my fellow Members to support this amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">We need, however, to make the conditions even clearer. These medicinal products must have a therapeutic benefit. After all, it is senseless to knowingly allow children to be made guinea pigs in tests in the absence of any therapeutic benefit: this is unacceptable. The clear aim must be for rewards to be reserved exclusively for those whose clinical trials have been successful. Only if we really act together on this can we truly speak of a success. We should not, however, allow this to give rise to an industry wish list; the focus must be on the interests of the children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We needed to establish the tasks of the Paediatric Committee more clearly, clarify the system and ensure monitoring of paediatric investigation plans, while at the same time giving the committee the important job of identifying special needs in the paediatric sector. At the same time, however, the various administrative deadlines and timetables needed to be reduced and clarified.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important in my opinion – and I happen to be a doctor – that the six-month extension to which producers of medicinal products for paediatric use are entitled should be reduced, given that their products are already protected by pharmaceutical patents.</p>
<p class="contents">Any such reward is out of proportion if we take account of the huge profits which companies make from this exclusivity, given that no one else can manufacture the medicinal product. Most importantly, consumers and, by extension, the state are forced to pay heavily for the brand until others are allowed to sell the medicinal product.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Behrendt said earlier, what if we were to ask the patients, the babies, what if we were to ask the parents? I want to ask Mrs Behrendt if she has asked a mother or father who have children and who do not have the money to buy the medicinal product. That too is something we need to bear in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall support the reduction in the time to three plus three months; I should also like to add that there must be no abuse – and I agree with John Bowis – of the new system of rewards by repeating previous rewards. The legislation must clearly state that the new additional protection, which compensates for paediatric trials, will not be granted again through any other system for protecting the market from competition. Amendment 75 aims to clarify this and I call on you to vote for it. The objective of the report by the European Parliament must be to establish real dialogue between the interested parties.</p>

I can also support the majority of the amendments that have been adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. Even so, I voted against the amended report in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, because I was disappointed that the duration of the patent extension had not been amended.</p>
<p class="contents">It will be plain to everyone that for many medicines, a six-month extension is not necessary. The extra costs involved in research that is necessary to obtain approval for paediatric use are relatively low, but that is not the case for all medicines. For some drugs with a low turnover, the six-month extension may prove necessary after all in order to recoup the costs. That is also the thrust of the amendments tabled by our group. We would like to see a three-month extension put in place by way of standard, and provide for an additional three-month extension for those medicines where this proves too short. That is fair on everyone and cost-saving for national health systems.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be irresponsible on our part to apply the six-month extension to all products. After all, health insurance is expensive enough as it is. I would therefore call on everyone’s support for Amendment 89 tabled by Mrs Breyer, Mrs McAvan and Mrs Corbey or Amendments 91 to 93 tabled by my group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its aim is to improve the current state of affairs, which is untenable from the medical point of view and, from the ethical point of view, it is unfair to children, to say the least.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it does not require medical education to understand that a child is not just a miniature adult. Children are individuals whose metabolism is very different from that of adults. It is not possible to simply reduce the dose of medication needed to treat a child proportionately to its weight. For, we know that medications often have side effects that are well tolerated by adults, while they may lead to serious health complications in a child.</p>
<p class="contents">I realise that it has not been easy to acknowledge the medical viewpoint, requirements and recommendations of the physicians while at the same time respecting the often legitimate claims and demands of the pharmaceuticals industry. But, what bothers me more, is that the discussion about this directive in Parliament concentrated on whether patent protection should last six months, three plus three or four plus two. From the aspect of priorities, this fact is not important or decisive. What is important and urgent is that children get the final product – a medication developed with due account of and respect for the distinctive status, that of a child.</p>

In this discussion we should be focusing on the medical considerations, and not allow ourselves to be influenced solely by financial considerations: who will profit or who will lose.</p>
<p class="contents">As a doctor I am in favour of and strongly support the view that research into paediatric medicines must always be compulsory, safe, highly professional and subject to constant checks, if for nothing else, because there is still a shortage of medicines for children, and because the development of new substances must go ahead. We should also realise that the development of medicines for children should not be based on the premise – already mentioned several times before – that a child is just a reduced version of an adult. Children have their own specific characteristics, completely different metabolism, and different susceptibility to medicines, as Dr Belohorská said just before me. The European Union must set out binding regulations for all Member States that will not harm the health of children, but that will ensure the availability of high-quality children’s medicines within optimum timescales.</p>
<p class="contents">Also for this reason the debate in our committee took account of the widest variety of viewpoints of major stakeholders and their professional arguments, and I therefore propose, with full support of my political group, that the incentives for manufacturers take into consideration the costs borne by the manufacturer in developing the drugs, and that at least a minimum period of time be set during which the newly developed medicine may not be manufactured by generic companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Responsibility teaches us to check, after six years, the effectiveness of the measures taken and, if necessary, to adapt the established parameters accordingly. In finishing, Mr President, I would like to voice my support for rapporteur Françoise Grossetête’s idea to set up the MICE (Medicines Investigation for the Children of Europe) agency. In this way we will be able to ensure that all children in the European Union will have the same access to first-class medicines, and I call upon you to take that responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, we must be demanding. Tomorrow, we will have the opportunity to improve this proposal for a regulation so that it best serves the interests of children and public health, and we will improve it by adopting those amendments focussing on research into and the placing on the market of medicinal products with the greatest added value, providing a real therapeutic benefit; indeed, how can we achieve the objective of limiting clinical trials on children without limiting the number of medicinal products placed on the market?</p>
<p class="contents">If the criterion of the medicinal product’s added value were taken into consideration, this would avoid many unnecessary studies in children. We will also be able to improve the text tomorrow by adopting the amendments that propose greater transparency for pharmacovigilance data and their accessibility to the public. The financial issue is also important for the stability of our social security systems and the guarantee of access to healthcare for all. It is increasingly important when it comes to finding the right financial incentive so that the pharmaceutical industries take a greater interest in paediatric medicinal products. It is important for all European citizens, because it is public money that indirectly finances these financial incentives in the form of the extension of market exclusivity.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, in view of the results of the impact assessments, in view of the enormous gaps ranging from EUR 1 to 4 million, it seems to me that we should at least be able to suggest to the industry a two-stage system: a fixed three-month incentive and a three-month extension depending on the level of benefit provided by the medicinal product sold. All of us here want the best for our children, as soon as possible, but we must not be hypocritical. Those who are talking about urgency were not willing to support the proposal to reduce the gap between marketing authorisation and placing on the market, which is currently two years. That is why we will have other meetings and we will really see what we can do for the health of European children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However we must take steps to prevent the accumulation of rewards under this regulation and other areas of European legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">A large part of the debate has revolved around questions that have already been superseded by the establishment of a sensitive balance between the producers of original and generic medicines in the recent revision of European pharmaceutical legislation, questions such as ‘Who will get more?’ and the like.</p>
<p class="contents">When we also take national health budgets into account the picture changes. The entry of producers of generic medicines into the market increases competition, reduces the cost of drugs and reduces the strain on health budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">If such a goal is to be reached and the producers of original medical products are to be reimbursed for the true additional costs they incur as a result of clinical trials, it makes sense for European legislation to be based on verified information regarding these costs.

As a doctor, I believe that the draft’s most important feature is its attempt to afford greater protection to child patients, in view of the fact that they constitute a particularly vulnerable group of patients.</p>

The provisions of this report are based on the obvious truth that children are not mini-adults and they must have medicines tailored and tested specifically for their use. There is another, less obvious, truth that underlies this report that I feel I must state in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">This truth is that an alarming number of children are sick and the number suffering from chronic, acute and fatal diseases is on the increase. As the scourge of contagious diseases among children in the West has been largely contained, all other types of illness are increasing, some to epidemic levels.</p>
<p class="contents">In my country, it seems that every other child is ill. How many children have inhalers, or have to avoid certain foods or pets because of allergies? Education budgets are straining with the increase in learning, behaviour and communication disorders. Eczema, disabling autism, cerebral palsy, diabetes, epilepsy and arthritis are all increasing, as well as life-threatening leukaemia and tumours – the list goes on and on. Why have children become such a profitable market place for medicines that powerful lobbies should find it worth their while to fight for a few months here and there over extended patents?</p>
<p class="contents">In the West, we should have the healthiest children in the history of the world. We have the affluence, we have good sanitation, the wherewithal for proper – even superior – nutrition. Our children should be thriving; they are not.</p>
<p class="contents">What are we doing to children? We need to do some serious soul-searching and serious research, not just into drugs and that kind of profitable research, but into children's growth and immune system development, and identify the new factors in our environment, in our food, our birthing and child-rearing practices, in our medical practices and in our lifestyles, and find the culprits that are sickening and even killing our children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an expression of our concern about the health of children in Europe, and also, in the long term, of children in non-European countries. Nevertheless, it should not be forgotten that the negative financial impact of the regulation will be greater for some countries than for others.</p>
<p class="contents">As former Commissioner for Enlargement, Mr Verheugen is probably better acquainted than anyone with the major financial problems facing the health service sector in Poland. Unduly long periods of protection for patents and registration data would have particularly harsh consequences for less wealthy countries whose market economies, which act as a guarantee of normal economic conditions, have only been in place for a short time. We should take joint action to ensure that the pharmaceutical sector does not earn excessive amounts at the expense of the public in the Member States, since this sector has in any case no cause for complaint about profits.</p>
<p class="contents">I am opposed to the pharmaceutical sector receiving anything other than minimal rewards, and I am in favour of opportunities being made available as rapidly as possible for the production of generic medicines. As Mrs Roth-Behrendt concluded, however, the quality of children’s health care is more important than the amount of money saved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At long last, research and development of children’s medicines are given the attention they deserve. Enterprises can, and should, be rewarded for investing in research of this kind, only incentives of this kind will ensure that they continue to invest in new medicines for children. Moreover, we should not overlook the fact that they employ thousands of people in the process. A fixed six-month extension of the supplementary protection certificate is preferable for all kinds of reasons, but transparency and sound agreements are key words in this respect. We must consider the potential implications of a patent extension for all children in the world. In Belgium, for example, it was Dr Janssens who made Sporanox, his antifungal, available to the developing countries, but now that Janssens Farmaceutica has been taken over, it will be interesting to see whether the new owners will adopt the same line. In addition to attention to research, it goes without saying that the government must also continue to guarantee accessibility to medicines. Let me give you an example: in Belgium, the manufacturer of Rilatin independently increased the price of a box of tablets from EUR 2.60 to EUR 6.52, the level of the European guide price. The increase for parents of children with ADHD is prohibitive, certainly if you consider that there are children who need a few boxes a day. The pharmaceutical industry can, and must, therefore be stimulated in the area of research, but should, at the same time, consider the people who have to pay for those medicines. I have just one more question for the Commissioner. Apparently, products not covered by a supplementary protection certificate, including certain AIDS medicines, do not qualify for an extension if research is carried out during the period of patent protection. Can the Commissioner confirm this, and if so, is it possible for this clause to be changed at this stage? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its aim is to ensure better medicines at reasonable prices that every mother can afford.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her work on this regulation, which will allow us to send a positive message to our voters. It will demonstrate that Parliament supports the development of paediatric medicines, and that we attach a great deal of importance to the treatment our children receive and to their health. Although we made a number of mistakes when drawing up this draft regulation, fortunately we still have a chance to rectify these mistakes during tomorrow’s vote.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly I wish to express my opposition to what are termed double rewards, that is to say, the granting of financial assistance twice to the same investigations or investments. Secondly, I believe that it is a mistake to waive the requirement for a paediatric medicine to be registered in all Member States before additional patent protection may be obtained. Paediatric medicines should be registered and available in all Member States, and not merely in a few.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot consent to certain EU citizens being deprived of the chance to receive treatment using new and improved medicines, and I find it intolerable that companies producing such medicines should be rewarded regardless. This is unfair in social terms, unjustified in legal terms and contrary to the principle of equality. It should not be tolerated by Parliament. Thirdly, I have serious doubts regarding the proposal to extend patent protection for paediatric medicines, as every new medicine is in any case protected by a patent, regardless of whether it is used to treat children, women or elderly people.</p>
<p class="contents">There can be no doubt that extending patent protection would limit access to the market for generic medicines. We should not consent to this. Every mother would pay any price to protect the health of her child, but the question I would ask is why mothers should pay more, given that Parliament could adopt amendments that make it possible for them to pay only as much as is necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In a world in which it seems, perhaps, inevitable that economic profit is, to a great extent, the cornerstone of our existence, the Commission has finally brought before us a remedial proposal based mainly on financial terms and mores. The pharmaceutical companies will now have to measure a child's ill-health on financial balance sheets and proceed with paediatric drug development only if it is profitable. I do not necessarily blame them: they produce medicines to make money and if they do not make money they will not be able to produce medicines. This is unfortunately the harsh reality and those of us with more romantic aspirational fantasies will just have to accept it.</p>
<p class="contents">This piece of legislation, despite its ideological shortcomings, will help develop more and safer drugs for children.

I should like to start by giving my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Grossetête, for her deeply committed speech, and also for her fair discussion of the matter. Of course, by the end of the debate it is difficult to introduce new points of view, so I should just like to make my point symbolically. 120 seconds’ speaking time in this House is very little in view of the significance of this milestone in European pharmaceutical legislation; but a great deal – as I know from many years’ personal experience as a chief emergency physician – when it comes to saving children’s lives. We can also see this 120 seconds as a symbol that it is time for Europe to at last roll out an appropriate regulation for paediatric medicinal products.</p>
<p class="contents">I should very much like to see a consensus at first reading, so that our European community can be restored to a respectable competitive position on the important international market in pharmaceutical research and manufacture. I support the proposal for a uniform extension of patent protection. Mrs Grossetête, and now Commissioner Verheugen as well, have convinced me that this is the right, simple, and practicable way to go. We have included a revision clause entitling us to make improvements for the eventuality that the profits are as exorbitant as we suspect they will be. We have to take great care when discussing this issue, as it concerns children – the most precious things we have – and human lives, on the one hand, and economic interests on the other.

After congratulating my honourable friend, Mrs Grossetête, I should like to draw the House's attention not only to the basic outlines, but also to the details relating to public health, access to quality services and the creation of reliable control mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">Special attention needs to be given to the question of the production, testing and marketing of medicinal products, mainly due to the obvious need for greater transparency, given that direct and indirect financial interests attach to the production and marketing of these products and a whole set of medical practices and actions depend, either at research level or at application level, on their use.</p>
<p class="contents">We need with this report to safeguard the important right of child patients to protection both from the needless administration of medicinal products and from their subjection to treatment or research protocols of unknown value and efficacy.</p>
<p class="contents">Medical and paediatric research programmes, licensing requirements for medicines and post-marketing studies must become beneficial means, both for patients and for medical and pharmaceutical research centres, so that we can safeguard maximum possible medical efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">Creating a strong system of risk management, creating a list which will be given to all health agencies, companies and workers involved and providing the facility for informing patients about the treatment protocol to which they are to submit and its anticipated therapeutic value constitute, in conjunction with the foregoing, a strong system of protection and improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">There are no scales for weighing the health of children against financial interests.</p>

<p class="contents">Recently, the Belgian paediatric association rang the alarm bell: 50% of medicinal products prescribed to children and almost 90% of those used in intensive care are not approved for paediatric use. Clearly, this regulation is urgently needed: research and development are expensive and we must support the efforts that will be required of the pharmaceutical firms, and thus also support the fixed period of six months during which they will not be subject to competition from the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we must promote lower-cost paediatric research, the clause regarding review in six years, the MICE programme for paediatric research and, as is vital when children are involved, measures aimed at avoiding the unnecessary duplication of studies that meet this requirement.</p>
<p class="contents">It is this delicate balance that we need to maintain in our vote tomorrow, a balance that meets the expectations of paediatricians, families and the millions of young patients in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do think, though, that the Commission deserves criticism for being so tardy in presenting this proposal on medicinal products for paediatric use; after all, 100 million children in the EU are affected. That being the case, coordinated European action is not only important but indispensable. Why is that?</p>
<p class="contents">Three problem areas can be identified. The first is that the national markets for paediatric medicinal products are much too small to be of interest to pharmaceutical companies; only the Community market is large enough to be significant. Secondly, clinical trials on children should and must be avoided as far as possible. Where they are absolutely necessary, they must comply with the strict conditions of the Clinical Trials Directive. This makes it all the more necessary to make all test results centrally accessible, in order to avoid unnecessary duplication of trials.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the compulsory investigation of the potential effects of medicinal products on children which is provided for under the proposal must not impede the development of new medicinal products for adults. It follows that the Paediatric Committee, which is envisaged as forming part of the EMEA in London, has to assume the important role of resolving these issues quickly for the whole of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee should, of course, also be better placed to judge the need for medicines and studies when assessing draft paediatric investigation plans, exemptions and deferrals; and provide healthcare professionals and patients with a reliable source of information. This is the only way of better managing the organisation of the ethical and financial problems which paediatric medicinal products present.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to create a harmonised, functional European market in this field, so that we are finally able to give our children the medicines that they deserve, namely the best. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission’s proposal is of major significance to children, parents and industry alike. Pharmaceutical companies must be given reasonable compensation for the research they carry out into paediatric medicines. As far as I am concerned, this compensation could even be generous, but a six-month extension of the patent protection is in many cases extremely big-hearted. According to a well-known British innovative company, research into paediatric indications generally costs some EUR 8 million. The returns of a six-month patent extension are a multiple of this, some EUR 200 to 300 million, and sums in excess of this have been mentioned for blockbusters.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore call for proportionality: three months, but with the possibility of adding another three months if the turnover is below EUR 100 million. Three plus three also adds up to six, but only for companies that really need it. Along with Mrs McAvan, I tabled these amendments that have been signed by 44 Members from Belgium, Estonia, France, Portugal, Greece Poland, Hungary, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. In our view, the reward should be proportionate to the costs incurred. That is a very simple and fundamental principle. It would be unseemly to rake in enormous profits on the back of sick children. It is always good to remind ourselves of who ends up paying for this: the people taking the medicines and the insured.</p>
<p class="contents">The cost of health insurance is rising; medicines account for some 10% of total public health outgoings. The price of medicines need not become unnecessarily expensive. The money would be better spent on care than on nice little extras for the industry. Of course the pharmaceutical industry will lobby very energetically in favour of six months. Anything else, they say, would be bureaucratic and complex, but there is nothing bureaucratic about providing turnover figures that are already known anyway.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at the pharmaceutical industry, I can see major problems ahead. There is too little in the way of innovation in Europe. That innovation does not come about by handing out extras to the pharmaceutical companies. Quite the reverse: real innovation is possible if we insist on added therapeutic value, and that is why I back the amendments tabled by Mrs Ferreira and the Group of the Greens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission’s proposal was well-balanced and was based on impact assessments. A six-month extension of patent protection as an incentive for pharmaceutical manufacturers is reasonable. This period is based on the results of the impact study and is a clear, fair basis for calculation for all manufacturers.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that a majority in Parliament supports this fixed period. Variable patent protection is impracticable and entails a considerable administrative burden. In addition, the duration of a patent must never be dependent on a product’s sales figures. The international competitive situation of the research-oriented pharmaceutical industry demands that we take a look at Europe’s attractiveness as a research destination. This is another reason why I see no material arguments in favour of the reduction in the fixed six-month period that is still under discussion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I support the proposed regulation and I also support Mrs Grossetête’s excellent report, and I wish to raise three brief points with regard to it. The first, which is something we all know, is that research into medicinal products for paediatric use is not good business. It is not profitable and for that reason not enough is done. In my opinion, this proposal for a regulation is an incentive for further research, and should be supported. My second remark is that the six month supplementary protection proposed by the Commission and Françoise Grossetête is a good thing, as at present we rely too much on the use of medicines intended for adults as medication directly adapted for children. That is not a good thing. My last point is that I think it is ultimately a question of whether we conduct clinical research or learn through our mistakes when children have received the wrong drugs. I would support the first option. By the same token, the Commission and Françoise Grossetête’s report deserve our full support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sure that on many issues both sides have the right arguments, as both the innovative and generic industries have an important role in the medicine sector. Whilst I understand the importance of innovation, as a Socialist and Hungarian MEP I think that the social aspect should take priority. For retired people and families with children in Hungary, medicine represents a large part of their living expenses. In the transition to capitalism, the cost of medicine became extremely high in Hungary compared to people's incomes. Further increases would be unacceptable for me.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has to understand that the extra price of the extension period would be paid by the most vulnerable strata of society, the poor and their children.

I have to tell Mrs Grossetête that the difference between us and the United States is that we boast a sound social security system that should also balance its books. Those of you in this House who argue in favour of six months protection are also those who very often caution in their own countries that the social security budget must be kept under control, and that cuts must be made. In order to keep this budget in balance, everyone must contribute, including the pharmaceutical industry. In our view, the six-month extension will lead to an unnecessary additional cost.

There does seem to be a broad consensus in the House that something needs to be done in the field of medicinal products for paediatric use. I have listened very closely and should like to start by dealing with the question posed by many Members; that is, whether the Commission can guarantee that the funding required to ensure the necessary scientific and research-policy safeguards for this legislative proposal will be made available within the Seventh Framework Research Programme. The answer is yes, I can assure you of that. I have already reached the appropriate agreement with my fellow-Commissioner Mr Potočnik. The Seventh Framework Research Programme makes clear reference to child health, and I am assuming that the Commission will be deciding on the relevant programmes in just a few weeks, as planned.</p>
<p class="contents">It may come as a surprise to hear this from the person responsible for enterprise and industry in Europe, but I should like to reiterate categorically that what interests me here is neither the interests of enterprises nor those of industry, nor even the interests of national health authorities; my one and only concern is the interests of the children to whom this proposal relates.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been dismayed to hear a number of arguments here this evening that clearly betray support for cold economic interests. I wish to make it perfectly clear to you that the Commission will have nothing to do with this. We shall not deviate from our proposal on the crucial point: the duration of the Protection Certificate. This is the cornerstone of the whole proposal, without which the European pharmaceutical industry – which is of course privately organised – will not produce the necessary research investment.</p>
<p class="contents">It may sadden you to hear that the European pharmaceutical industry needs to make a profit, but that is just the way it is, and neither I nor anyone else in this House can change that. That is why we have an interest in the European pharmaceutical industry generating revenue: it will invest heavily in research only where it sees the prospect of financial gain. There is no way of getting around this.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the things I have heard here are naïve, at best. Appeals are of no use whatsoever in the face of the profit-driven mentality; only clear free-market incentives. We are creating such incentives, and for that reason I once again urge you most strongly to lend your support – not in the interests of industry, the health sector or the authorities, but solely in the interests of the children and their parents.</p>
