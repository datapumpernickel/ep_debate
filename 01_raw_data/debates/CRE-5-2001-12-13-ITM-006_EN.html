<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">McKenna (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – </span>This report deals with a serious issue and that is fishing under flags of convenience. Vessels that fish under flags of convenience ignore all the rules, they exploit the best fishing grounds and they wreak havoc. In recent times, as fleets continue to increase and resource abundance plummets, flags of convenience are increasingly used as a means of avoiding measures taken by countries or regional fisheries organisations to manage fisheries and conserve stocks. Pirate fishing can be seen as a undesirable consequence of states at last attempting to improve the management of fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">The environmental impact of pirate fishing vessels is virtually impossible to evaluate as by definition data on catches are non-existent or, at the very best, unreliable. The impact is known to be severe, even if undocumented, as pirate vessels target mainly high-value species such as tuna, shrimp, toothfish etc.. There are also serious social problems. Ship-owners take advantage of the lack of controls to reduce training safety standards, pay minimal wages, and lower standards of living and working conditions. They require long working periods without proper rest and they provide completely inadequate medical attention. They are responsible for many other offences.</p>
<p class="contents">Fishing is now a global industry. Fleets from the EU cover all the oceans of the world, as do those of several other distant water-nations. Markets are also global. One-third of the total fish production that entered international trade in 1998 was worth over USD 50 billion. Capital is perhaps the most global commodity of all. EU fisheries investments can be found in many countries. As a result, a concerted international effort is needed to eliminate fishing under flags of convenience. This will involve the countries issuing the flags or whose citizens work on the fishing vessels, the ports into which they come for re-supply or off-loading, the markets in which the fish is consumed or the home of the capital which finances this destructive phenomenon.</p>
<p class="contents">As the EU has both one of the largest fishing fleets and one of the largest markets for fish, it can play a particularly important role in regard to flags of convenience fishing. Many EU-owned vessels use flags of convenience. Some may even have had FIFG money to transfer to those countries and I am pleased to see that the Commission has now proposed regulations to prevent public funding being used to transfer to flags-of-convenience countries. I would call upon the Council to adopt them this week.</p>
<p class="contents">In contrast, I should mention Japan and Taiwan, who have recognised the extent to which their longline industries use flags of convenience and they have taken corrective measures by launching programmes to repatriate or to scrap a large number of tuna longliners. At least 62 Japanese-built flags-of-convenience longliners will be scrapped by the end of 2002. A further 67 FOC longliners built in Taiwan will be repatriated to replace older vessels, with no overall increase in fleet capacity. It is expected that this will reduce the FOC tuna longline fleet by about half. These programmes are funded by both government and industry. I believe these moves should be highly praised and that this is the way we should proceed as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Spain is proposing a law to list certain flags-of-convenience countries and we welcome that.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding market state responsibility, the EU is a large market and so it must improve control measures. For instance, currently it only wants to ensure that fish are caught according to rules of regional fisheries organisations which the EU belongs to. This needs to be extended to ensure that fish are caught according to the rules of all regional organisations. It must also be made illegal for EU citizens or companies to trade in fish caught by flags-of-convenience vessels. This is called for in the FOA plan of action on illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing. We should go in that direction also.</p>
<p class="contents">The campaign that must be waged against pirate fishing is a global and multifaceted one. All countries with any involvement in the fishing industry – such as catching the fish, owning or crewing vessels, providing harbours, buying the final product – must participate.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU, as one of the most important regions from all these points of view, clearly has a special responsibility. I can only hope that the Commission and the Spanish presidency acting together will begin to tackle this very important matter in the months ahead. It is in the interests of all EU fishing industries to ensure that this is done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the European Parliament is thereby heading in the right direction in terms of unravelling an issue which is complicated but crucial to the future of fishing in the world and to fisheries resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I believe it was also appropriate that it should be produced by Mrs McKenna, with whom I disagree on so many fisheries issues, but not on this report, which has been unanimously approved by our committee, despite the difficulty of this issue, and furthermore with no amendments from the House. I therefore congratulate the Committee on Fisheries and our rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">There is still no doubt much to do, but, in this report, the European Parliament supports the condemnation and prosecution of flags of convenience in fishing and in marketing. Certain Member States of the Union – such as my own, Spain, as the rapporteur has mentioned here and in the report – are promoting innovative legislative proposals in this field, which is no easy task, as has been said before.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Committee on Fisheries are going to closely monitor the objectives and proposals in this report, aimed at dealing with the serious problem of illegal fishing. By fighting it, and eventually eradicating it, we will have taken an enormous step towards sustainable worldwide fishing. Some regional fisheries organisations, such as the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), say that 50% of catches of species such as the swordfish originate from illegal fishing under flags of convenience. If this percentage of illegal fishing were to be controlled, it would lead to an unquestionable improvement in the fish stock and would therefore clearly benefit legal fishermen, who have so much need for these catches and who behave in a totally controlled, and therefore responsible, manner.</p>
<p class="contents">The marketing of these fish and landings in European Union ports – as has been said here – are key issues in this process, as is the definition of flags of convenience and clearly identifying the countries which permit them and tolerate them.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these issues are in the report. I would once again like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs McKenna, and simply point out that I believe the European Parliament has today taken a very important step towards responsible fishing in the world. Having congratulated everybody, it only remains for me to ask the Commissioner – whose presence I appreciate – for the Commission’s support for the proposals in this report, because it is a very positive step, and that he take account, of course, of the fact that it has the unanimous approval of the Committee on Fisheries, and I hope that the vote for Mrs McKenna’s report will also be unanimous this afternoon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Socialist Group is in total agreement with the conclusions of this report, above all with those which demonstrate the bad treatment received by the workers on these types of ships, in terms of working conditions, wages, safety and hygiene on board.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that it is necessary to encourage the governments which have not yet done so to sign up to the United Nations agreement on fish stocks, which is directly aimed at combating this kind of fishing. The control Regulation must be rigorously applied by all Member States and by the Commission, so that the landing in ports of this type of catch is not permitted.</p>
<p class="contents">We also agree absolutely with the rapporteur when he asks the Commission to seal off the markets of all Member States against the products of illegal fishing, by adopting effective Community commercial and customs legislation. We believe that we will have to combat this type of fishing in ports and in terms of the marketing of products obtained from it. We believe that we will have to adopt as many measures as possible in order to eradicate illegal fishing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Quite right: evading management measures, plundering the riches of the sea and the maltreatment of crew members have no place in fishing. Unfortunately, this type of fishing does exist in the shape of fishing vessels sailing under flags of convenience. I agree completely with the rapporteur, Mrs McKenna and would like to add the following comment. We must involve the countries that issue those flags of convenience in an effort to put an end to these practices. Should these countries comply only by striking ships off their registers without tightening controls, we must consider economic sanctions against them. The fishing agreements that the European Union enters into with third countries could also play a part. We should exclude countries that allow fishing vessels under flags of convenience and their accompanying transport and refrigeration vessels into their harbours from fishing agreements with the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, there is nothing heroic or romantic about the background to my thoughts on piracy now, as I speak to you here, and there is quite definitely nothing to get excited about. On the contrary, all we have here is a destructive fisheries practice and flags of convenience.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not see these modern pirates who sail the seven seas as tough old characters with wooden legs and eye patches; no, these pirates operate on powerful trawlers, often owned by nationals of Member States of the EU. So exactly what havoc do these ships and flags of convenience wreak? This House has always battled for sustainable fisheries and tried to ensure that working conditions meet minimum standards. The parlous state of fish stocks and the economic recession tell us that a great deal still needs to be done, and we are addressing these problems in our debate on the Green Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">However, regulations and stock management measures have to be complied with and this compliance can only be achieved with controls which actually work and effective sanctions – including political sanctions. This is the huge attraction of flags of convenience to shipowners, because the countries which generously include them in their registers are not exactly known for their controls and sense of responsibility. The consequences are catastrophic, to both fish and man. Regional stock management measures are ignored, stocks which are already endangered are depleted without a second thought and conventions to protect employees are simply ignored.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is no point in lamenting what is an obvious situation any further, so my proposal is that we should keep trying to influence flag-of-convenience states and remind them of their international obligations. Even in Europe we can and must act. The port state controls adopted in the Erika I package must also be applied to pirate activities, and we must close our markets to the catches landed by these fleets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fischler,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen. I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs McKenna, and the Committee on Fisheries and its chairman, Mr Varela, for having taken on such an important problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the European Parliament, the Commission is also extremely concerned about these international fishing pirates and the use of so-called flags of convenience. One thing is clear: anyone fishing under a flag of convenience is flouting maritime law and resolutions and the resolutions of regional fisheries organisations and ruining all our efforts at sustainable stock management in the process. Plus, it is not only unfair to honest fishermen, it is outright unfair competition and may indeed, as Mrs McKenna said, cause social problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has not been sitting on its hands. We have proposed an amendment to the FIFG regulation so as to prevent ships from transferring to flag-of-convenience states. This proposal is still before the Council, awaiting its decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking the FAO's international plan of action to combat pirate fisheries as our starting point, we also intend to work out a Community action plan to deal with these practices during the course of our reform of the Common Fisheries Policy. What will this entail? First, we need a definition of the concept of the actual link between ship and flag state and we then need to anchor this definition in international law.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need to draw up a list of the supervision and control duties incumbent upon each country for every ship berthed in its ports, in order to avoid so-called ports of convenience.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we need to strengthen the fisheries control regulation in general.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, if I may, I should like to comment briefly on your specific proposals. As far as No 6 is concerned, there is already a fleet register at Community level and we therefore feel this paragraph is superfluous. I fully share the concerns set out in No 9. No new Member State can accede unless it transposes the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire </span>into its national legislation. We also concur on Nos 15, 19 and 22. As you know, we are already in the process of drafting proposals for reforming the Common Fisheries Policy, which we shall submit to Parliament as soon as we receive your opinion on the Green Paper, taking account, needless to say, of the proposals on control policy which you have made in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">As for No 16, we too subscribe to the principle that we need a list of countries which offer flags of convenience. Finally, some of your demands on this point were met when we proposed that the FIFG rules be revised.</p>
<p class="contents">Parts of No 17 are already included in the control regulation. The Member States are required to keep a tally of imports in order to ensure that the catch quotas of the regional fisheries organisations are not exceeded.</p>
<p class="contents">As for No 18, as I have already said, first we need a legal definition of flag-of-convenience states.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards No 21, the Commission has already submitted a proposal to the Member States suggesting that GSP status be withdrawn from Belize, Honduras and Equatorial Guinea because they have violated the UN Fish Stocks Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">So you can see that we too are genuinely concerned. I should like to close by reiterating that the guidelines which you have submitted are extremely useful to us and will give us good food for thought when we come to reform the Common Fisheries Policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
