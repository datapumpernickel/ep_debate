The Commission is prepared to conduct an in-depth investigation of the alleged abuse of a dominant position in the European Union’s fish production as and when evidence of such abuse is produced. As long ago as 1992, we ruled to prohibit a price cartel operated by Norwegian, Scottish and Irish salmon breeders. We are liasing on a regular basis with the Norwegian authorities as regards observation of the markets referred to in the question. As I have said, I am prepared to examine the available information in depth and, if need be, to set in motion other investigations into this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is extremely important that this allegation of abuse of dominant position should be investigated.</p>
<p class="contents">A particular concern is that the breeders of juvenile fish, or smolt, are mainly based in Scotland and Ireland and are dependent entirely on sales to the ongrowers who are in turn affected by the feed manufacturers. The feed manufacturers and the ongrowing concerns are heavily dominated by Norwegian interests and that is where the abuse of dominant position within the market arises. One particular risk that it gives rise to is that a particular asset currently in the hands of EU-owned salmon breeders is the genetic data and genotyped brood stock, which is of fundamental importance, as I am sure the Commissioner well realises. In conducting his further investigation, with which I will be very happy to cooperate as much as I can, will he take a particularly close and concerned look at that aspect of the situation? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The draft framework decision covers five basic rights: access to legal advice; access to free interpretation and translation, ensuring that persons who are not able to understand or follow the proceedings receive specific attention; the right of foreign detained persons to communicate with their consular authorities; and written notification of their rights.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the right to silence, the Commission has asked the Law Society of England and Wales to carry out a study on gathering and handling of evidence, including how the right to silence is interpreted in all the Member States and in the acceding countries.

I am aware of what a terrible minefield this proposal is going to be.

It is going to be very difficult to get this proposal through, but you have the backing of our committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Two big obstacles lie ahead of you. There is a problem of mutual recognition versus standardisation. Standardisation would be better, but mutual recognition is the easier approach. How are you going to achieve that and ensure it works when there is the European Convention on Human Rights, and every smart lawyer will immediately say that he does not recognise somebody else's ability to pass judgement and is going to appeal to Strasbourg? How are you going to make this work in practice? It is going to be very difficult and I look forward to receiving some reassurance from you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The most important of these will be the coordination of the joint deployment of the control services in the Member States. The checks are to be carried out by, among others, multinational teams, with the inspection strategies to be used, such as benchmarking and common priorities, laid down by the Commission. We will also be involving experts from the Member States in the setting-up of the agency and consulting the various interest groups. We expect a study to be produced in September on the operational aspects of this agency, and its results will be discussed by the Council when making its decision. On the occasion of my most recent visit to Vigo, the Galician fisheries sector suggested potential sites for this agency; I will of course examine these suggestions in detail, and they will also be considered in the studies to which I have referred. Provided that the Council accepts our proposal, it will then be possible to appoint the board of management and the executive director, and then this enterprise will be, in a sense, up and running. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In anticipation of the liberalisation of access to the waters of the Azores, which was to come into force on 1 August 2004, dozens of Community vessels not registered in the Azores have entered these waters, alleging that they have been authorised to do so by third Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Portuguese authorities have proved incapable of checking the fishing techniques used and the quantities and species of fish being caught by these vessels, and the Azores’ regional authorities fear that the pillaging of resources they foresaw as a consequence of the entry into force of the provisions of Regulation (EC) 1954/2003<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> has already begun, ahead of schedule.</p>

Article 5 of this Regulation, which governs the conditions under which fish may be caught in the waters around the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands, states that the Member States can reserve to local vessels the catching of fish within 110 miles of the coast. That has been the case ever since 14 November 2003, when this legal provision entered into force. It is for the Member States to ensure that these regulations are complied with. It follows that the presence of Spanish vessels in the waters around the Azores outside the 100 nautical-mile limit does not justify any emergency measures of the kind suggested by Mr Casaca, as these ships are complying with the rules on access.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind you, in this context, of the Commission’s statement on the occasion of Regulation 1954/2003’s adoption by the Council, when we also announced a ban on trawling off the Azores, with the intention of preventing damage to the vulnerable ecosystems on the sea bed. On 3 February this year, we submitted to the Council a proposal for a regulation on this subject. The Commission is also engaged in an ongoing dialogue with the Member States concerned with the intention of ensuring that any friction in the implementation of the new rules is minimised as far as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Recognition of Spanish productive circumstances in the future COM in olive oil</span></p>
<p class="contents">The 1998 reform of the COM in the olive sector established a transition period for the provision of reliable data on the olive oil sector, in the wake of the complaints made by Spain regarding the failure to adjust its national quota. Since then, the data made available and the evolution of the existing COM have confirmed its inadequacy and its discriminatory impact by comparison with the productive circumstances of other Member States. The olive growers of Spain, and especially Andalusia, receive less aid on average than all others, with an average penalisation of 33% over the entire period.</p>
<p class="contents">This unfair state of affairs needs to be corrected for the future. The new COM in olive oil offers the Commission the opportunity to bring the national quota for Spain into line with the real productive circumstances of its olive sector, thus averting the consolidation of a discriminatory situation which would lead to major losses in budget terms for the oil-growing regions and areas for whose economy the sector is vital.</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission undertake the necessary review and bring the financial arrangements for Spain into line with the real productive circumstances? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Turning to the question itself, the general principle underlying last June’s reform of the common agricultural policy was that the funds per country would have to relate to the average aid granted in the course of the reference period. There is no reason why olive oil should be treated any differently. The Council of Ministers has already decided to deal with it in parallel to the June reform. Reviewing the national quotas at the present time would also be contrary to the thinking that prompted us to introduce them in 1998 and it therefore follows that the Member States are responsible for keeping increases in production under control. At that time, the national quotas were fixed at a level that subsequent studies have confirmed as corresponding to the sector’s structural dimension in the individual producer Member States at the time. As you are no doubt aware, Spain has a 43% share of the overall maximum, between its share of the number of olive trees cultivated – 39% – and its share in the area under olive groves, which was 44% in 1998. Looked at from that angle, what we are debating is very definitely a fair offer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The quota of 419 000 tonnes created serious problems for small olive producers.

This is very far from being the same situation as in Spain, nor is it very astute of you, as a Greek MEP, to argue along these lines, as, in 1998, when these things were laid down, Greece’s national guaranteed quota was – as you quite rightly said – 419.5 thousand tonnes, corresponding to 23.6% of the total for the EU. If you compare that with the number of trees that you have, which make up only 20% of the overall total, and with the surface in hectares, which amounts to only 18.8% of that in the EU, there would actually be justification for transferring part of your guaranteed amount to Spain, rather than in the direction in which you have called for it to go. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Use of specific traditional wine appellations by third countries</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 23 February 2004, the Commission adopted a package of amendments to Regulation (EC) 753/2002<a href="#def_1_2" name="ref_1_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> which is allowing the use of specific traditional appellations by third countries. These include tawny, ruby, vintage and late bottled which are exclusive to port wine, and others traditionally used for Madeira wine and various regional varieties produced in Portugal. The amendments adopted by the Commission will most definitely have a negative impact on the production and marketing of all the wines in question, but the effects will be particularly bad in the case of port wine, both because of what it means to the economy of a huge part of the country the Douro region, where there are 33 000 wine-growers and, because of its significance in terms of revenue: it accounts for over two-thirds of wine exports, and some one-fifth of agro-food production. Furthermore, the trivialisation of appellations referring only to port wine, its standing and quality, could actually damage the wine’s very image at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that the Commission has perpetrated this error, does it not think it should now make good the harm it has done, and rescind its decision? What guarantees can the Commission offer that the world image of port wine will not be affected, specifically in terms of its genuineness, reputation and the ease with which it can be identified by the consumer?</p>

To put it another way, these traditional appellations may be freely used with reference to other quality wines.</p>
<p class="contents">In order, though, to be allowed to use these appellations, which are traditional in Portugal, a third country must comply with certain requirements and meet the following conditions:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the appellation must be specific, in other words, it must be recognised as a label of quality.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the appellation must be characteristic or enjoy a certain reputation, that is to say, the average consumer must be able to recognise it as distinguishing between one wine and another.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the appellation must be traditionally used within the territory of the third country in question.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the rules laid down by the third country must not mislead the European consumer in the event of the wine from the third country appearing on a market within the European Community.</p>
<p class="contents">The fifth condition is that the official language of the third country must be English, which it is in the case of South Africa, Australia and the USA. Where English is not the official language of the country in question, its use must be provided for in legislation and English must have been used for this traditional appellation for at least 25 years without interruption. As English is not the official language in such third countries as Argentina, Chile or Brazil, and the laws of these countries contain no such provision, these countries cannot use the traditional appellations on the EC market.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to be allowed to use a traditional appellation in the EC, a third country must submit a dossier to the Commission, which will permit its use only if the various conditions I have enumerated are complied with. Consultation of the Member States is guaranteed by the involvement of the Management Committee in this procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Amending the Labelling Regulation will have no adverse effects on trade, as the traditional appellations for fortified wines are limited, whereas third countries generally export ordinary or unfortified wines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do believe that the rules we have put in place are in any event sufficient to guarantee adequate protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The risk of misuse or of counterfeits, to which you referred, is another issue. The new provisions do nothing to alter the risk of counterfeiting; it is always there, as the use of these prestigious names is always an attractive option. In order to address this risk, we have to ensure that appropriate controls are in place, and also that names such as these are not used by those not entitled to them, as happened frequently in the past. The main thing here is that cooperation with the import authorities should run smoothly, as these imports cannot just find their way across the border, but have to be declared. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a thorough impact analysis has shown that implementing the ‘Everything But Arms’ agreement with the help of an ordered system of rights to supply the market would have a similar effect to what is being done already, we decided instead to consider the ‘fixed quotas’ option as a variant of the status quo, so all the options continue to be open to discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also remind you, though, that the ‘Everything But Arms’ initiative is the part of the EC’s general preference system that envisages the complete liberalisation of sugar imports from the least developed countries by 2009. Until then, the sugar trade would normally continue on the same basis as trade in other agricultural produce. The least developed countries’<span class="italic"> </span>reference to flexibility in terms of quantity and negotiated quantitative restrictions could raise questions about compatibility with WTO rules if they were to be seen as a sort of voluntary limitation of exports. As you will be able to gather from what I have said, we really will not, in our deliberations, lose sight of the situation of the least developed countries, and will be taking it very seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">On 3 March, representatives and ministers from the least developed countries presented a new initiative in relation to our rules on the duty-free preferential access of their sugar to the Community market, and I discussed it with them. We will examine this proposal with great care, as we do all contributions to our preparations for the reform of the common market organisation for sugar. The initiative aims, over an extended period, to broaden the access that is at present limited. As we work on these proposals in preparation for their presentation this summer, we will take due account of all contributions received. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like you to comment more specifically on their argument that the fall in price that is integral to two of the Commission's three options would 'make the EBA initiative meaningless for sugar. The Commission seems to prefer maintaining free access for the LDCs into a market with a price that is too low for them to compete, over that of negotiating with the LDCs an orderly market that achieves a price that allows them to compete and create development'. Commissioner, do you not see a parallel with that in the arguments from sugar beet growers in Europe, not least in the UK, who also call for an orderly market with, as they say, European price levels that would allow both domestic and developing country industries to invest for a sustainable future?</p>
<p class="contents">Given that the arguments are coming from both developing countries and developed countries within Europe, surely a higher sustained price with a managed reduction is the better course of action. Could you comment on that specific point, Commissioner? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You must surely also be aware, though, that there are numerous reasons why the current price level is quite simply unsustainable. We really should not be deluding ourselves where our own sugar beet farmers or the developing world’s exporters are concerned. The current price on our internal market is something like three times higher than that on the international market and, whatever happens, we will, in the current WTO round, be obliged to reduce our external protection for sugar. That alone will be enough to bring the price down on the internal market; there is no other way of doing it. That is the problem facing us.</p>
<p class="contents">To that we have to add other issues, such as how we can compensate for additional imports from the least developed countries merely by cutting back our own production, for sugar consumption in Europe is not going to increase. Nor must it be forgotten that sugar faces ever-tougher direct competition from other sweetening agents. No longer is there any sugar in Coca-Cola today – it contains isoglucose and nothing else. These sweeteners are also in direct competition with sugar. If, as the USA did a long time ago, we create a free market for them, quantities will increase accordingly. The result of all that is that, in the European Union, production will not decrease in the same way in every Member State; on the contrary, the simple fact of the matter will be that, in some of them, sugar production will quite simply no longer pay and so they will stop growing sugar beet. That is what we have to reckon with. I do not think it makes sense to arouse expectations that we can never satisfy.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also the problem of having to consider how we help those developing countries that have traditionally been our sugar suppliers – Mauritius is one example – if they begin to see exporting sugar to Europe as a less attractive prospect than it was in the past. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have said all along that we intend to present them before the summer and that is still our intention. The only thing that could create problems is something I have not previously mentioned, namely that the EU is facing a panel in Geneva over the so-called C-quotas issue, and we need to know what can be expected from it. It follows that another factor we have to take into account is the timetable of the authorities in Geneva.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to Mrs Schierhuber’s other question, Europe is of course an attractive market and it follows that many states would be happy to export to it, but our view is that we need to have clear priorities in this area, and what these boil down to is that only the least developed states should have free access to the European market. As you will be aware, we have also devised special rules for the Balkan states. The ACP states are to have limited priority access with a clear preferential tariff, as will the other countries in so far as we have treaties with them. If we were to allow everyone to export sugar to Europe, we would not need an organised sugar market, but its wholesale liberalisation, which would, however, mean that at least two-thirds of European sugar production would have to be abandoned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Human and financial costs of pollution in the enlarged EU</span></p>
<p class="contents">A WHO study published in September 2000 established that, in France alone, atmospheric pollution is the cause each year of 31 700 deaths, 500 000 asthma attacks and 25 000 cases of bronchitis, and has an economic impact equal to 1.7% of GDP.</p>

<p class="contents">Do such vital threats to societies in an enlarged EU not make it an utmost and priority duty to conduct epidemiological research, disseminate the results of this on a scale commensurate with the issues at stake, raise awareness with regard to these issues and incorporate them as a background theme in all Community policies? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The link between human health and the quality of our environment is indeed a top priority and we need to understand this link better in order to assess the effectiveness of existing policies and ensure that we address the problem adequately.</p>
<p class="contents">In a global sense the links between environment and health are addressed in the communication on a European environmental and health strategy adopted by the Commission last year. In this communication we announced the establishment of a European environment and health monitoring and response system to link information on health effects, exposure to environmental contamination and the emissions responsible for contamination.</p>
<p class="contents">Different parts of Europe are facing different problems. The environment and health strategy is therefore being developed for an enlarged Union, fully involving the new Member States from the outset. The Commission will now work on presenting an action plan setting out the programme for a first phase, focusing on selected priority diseases and pollutants at the Ministerial Conference on Environment and Health in Budapest on 23-25 June.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also following the epidemiological work being carried out in the scientific community, and in particular working with the World Health Organisation and other experts to understand the results of research and promote further action. For example, under the quality of life and management of living resources programme, which is part of the Fifth Framework Programme for Research, a specific key action on environment and health provided support for 16 multidisciplinary multinational research projects devoted to air pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">Such studies foster the development of protective measures and feed into the process of regulating pollutant emissions by revealing the causal links between pollutants and health effects and providing tools for measuring exposure and effects. The Commission's Joint Research Centre is also contributing to increasing our understanding of the link between environment and health in various ways.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as air pollution is concerned, the framework for doing this will be the thematic strategy on air pollution, due to be adopted next year, which is currently in preparation through the Commission's Clean Air for Europe programme – 'CAFE'. This programme includes a very broad survey on the health effects of air pollution, the expected evolution of air quality between now and 2020, the effectiveness of existing policy and the potential for taking further cost-effective measures to reduce emissions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is one of the issues to which I give highest priority as Commissioner. I have to admit that it is also one of the most difficult issues of all, because it cuts through the divisions we normally see, in both the Commission and the Member States, into different subject areas and spheres of responsibility. It is necessary to work across all frontiers in order to link cause with effect, and that is not easy.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor is it easy to put a price on the health problems consequent upon environmental pollution. I think that the World Health Organisation has nonetheless embarked upon a very important piece of work with a view to doing precisely that and to showing that society pays a very high price both for pollution and for health problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, we must also tackle this issue together with the new Member States. Several of the conferences we have had in order to prepare our action plan have taken place in the new Member States. We are mobilising their experts so that there shall be no doubt that this is a pan-European way of working on these issues. We take these matters extremely seriously. We shall continue to maintain that the cost advantages are so great that it is, in actual fact, profitable for both companies and society to invest in environmental measures that also lead to our having fewer health problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Air contamination is indeed a crucial issue as far as people’s health is concerned, and an epidemiological investigation such as this is definitely needed. This would also lend much support to giving priority to science’s Sixth Framework Programme and improving the standard, quality and coverage of environmental research. In your reply you mentioned the Clean Air for Europe programme: CAFE. Will this programme concentrate just on the quality of the air outdoors and pollution, or could the investigation at the same time include a survey of the quality of the air indoors and especially passive smoking? I am very worried that the investigation will restrict itself to the quality of the air outdoors and rather narrowly to the contamination of this type of air. Might one consider it applying to clean air in all its forms, including that to be found indoors? Could passive smoking in particular come within the scope of the survey in this programme? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission considers that the project for the Lada-Velilla power line, to cross the Redes national park and biosphere reserve, will not be carried out in its current form. Will the Commission ensure compulsory examination of a complete route for this power line which would go round the protected nature reserves forming part of the Natura 2000 network, safeguard the areas where bears live and hence respect Community legislation?</p>
<p class="contents">Has the Commission already received the environmental impact study which the Spanish authorities, at the meeting of 4 December, promised to forward before the end of January?</p>
<p class="contents">If not, does not the Commission consider that the matter should be referred to the Court of Justice (a reasoned opinion was issued in April 2003) so that central government and the Community of Castille and Leon, who are already confronting each other about this project in the Spanish courts, may finally reach agreement on finding a route for the power line which ensures respect for the environment? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In 2001, following a complaint filed in August 2000, the Commission initiated an infringement procedure pursuant to Article 226 of the EC Treaty. This procedure, based upon obligations under Directive 79/409/EEC on the protection of wild birds and Directive 92/43/EEC on the protection of natural habitats and wild fauna and flora, reached the stage of reasoned opinion – the last step before bringing the case before the European Court of Justice – in April 2003. Currently, the procedure is aimed at modifying the non-implemented part of the project in the autonomous community of Castille and Leon.</p>
<p class="contents">In their answer to the above-mentioned reasoned opinion issued by the Commission, the Spanish authorities undertook to examine alternatives for the remaining part of the project – Puerto de Tarna to Velilla – and confirmed in February 2004 that the necessary studies to comply with the requirements of Article 6(3) of Directive 92/43/EEC will start soon. These include a full environmental assessment in order properly to identify the effects of the projects on the conservation values of the affected site; if these are considered significant, alternatives will have to be examined. If no alternative can be identified that is not damaging to the site, the project can only proceed if it can be justified on the grounds of overriding public interest and if provision is made for adequate compensation measures.</p>
<p class="contents">In the event of significant effects on priority species identified under the directive, such as the brown bear, an opinion from the Commission may be needed pursuant to Article 6(4) of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spanish authorities explain that the necessary nature assessments will not be ready for ten months and that the resulting modified project will be subject to a full impact assessment procedure, in compliance with the provisions of Directive 85/337/EEC on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment. The authorities submitted to the Commission, as supplementary information, a complete set of documents and studies concerning the original project and its likely effects on natural values. An examination of the details of the above-mentioned Spanish answers is currently underway, which will permit the Commission to decide what course of action it should take in regard to this case.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the last part of your question, the Commission would welcome and encourage a fruitful dialogue between the interested parties in order to reach an agreed solution, but it cannot interfere in the constitutional competences of the various administrations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am just going to focus on three questions: will the Commission continue the infringement procedure rather than closing the case, as the Spanish authorities hope with its promise to modify just 30 km of the 90 km route planned, arguing that it is a new project? Will the Commission consult the Court of Justice of the European Communities at the next infringement meeting without further delay, if there are no new elements a year after the notification of the reasoned opinion and after four years of investigation of this infringement case? If the regions of Asturias and Castilla y León present it with a new project which respects all natural areas and which conform to Community legislation, would the Commission be prepared to cofinance such a project, in order to prevent the economic losses which the region of Asturias could face by dismantling the existing pylons? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Of particular concern to environmental groups in Ireland are the many cases where the Commission has determined in its reasoned opinion that directives have been infringed but has not taken any subsequent legal action. The details of the infringements are in these cases no longer part of a potential judicial process, wherefore they are not in need of confidential treatment. By releasing reasoned opinions, in particular when no subsequent legal action is taken, the Commission would ensure that citizens know that European law has been infringed, which in turn would help to reduce infringements in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the recent past the Irish authorities were willing to provide the public with copies of reasoned opinions on request, but the Commission understands that they are no longer willing to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention that, as far as possible, the Commission strives to be transparent with regard to its infringement procedures. That is why it issues regular press releases on them in order to provide citizens with information on the main issues involved.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to public access to the actual texts of letters of formal notice and reasoned opinions, certain rules agreed by the Council and Parliament need to be respected. These are set out in Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents.</p>
<p class="contents">One of these rules provides that the institutions shall refuse access to documents where disclosure would undermine the protection of the purpose of inspections, investigations and audits, unless there is an overriding public interest in disclosure. Indeed, the Court has held in the Petrie judgment that, in the investigation of infringements, sincere cooperation and a climate of mutual confidence between the Commission and the Member State concerned are required in order to allow both parties to engage in a process of negotiation in the search for a settlement of a dispute. The safeguarding of this objective justifies refusing access to detailed arguments and representations. That is why the Commission itself usually cannot give public access to its letters of formal notice and reasoned opinions when the infringement procedure is ongoing. However, when none of the exceptions to the regulation apply, the Commission may provide copies of letters of formal notice and reasoned opinions. This can be the case in particular where the infringement has been resolved, the infringement procedure has been closed and there is no longer any likelihood that an investigation would be undermined. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is my interpretation of what you have said, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to ongoing legal action, I cannot understand who the Commission is trying to protect. If the Commission is taking legal action against Member States it would seem that the interests or the protection of Member States are given priority by the Commission and that we basically end up with a situation where citizens throughout the European Union are going to be accusing the Commission of being extremely secretive and protecting the interests of the Member States. If you have taken legal action against a Member State, surely the only thing you should be concerned about is any kind of information that would prejudice your case against the Member State?</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to access to documents, you are making an extremely restrictive interpretation of the regulation. In relation to the public interest, surely in many of these cases the public interest should take priority? I do not understand why the Commission is playing into the hands of the Member States. By doing this, the Commission is encouraging a culture of secrecy where Member States are not providing the information. This is going to have a knock-on effect, even in countries such as Sweden which have a tradition of much more openness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rules in question have also been agreed so that we have decision-making processes through which we can solve problems, and which allow us to deal with cases in a dignified way for both parties.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission may disclose copies of the letters of formal notice and recent opinions when none of the exceptions to the regulations I mentioned apply – i.e. when the infringement procedure has been closed and there is no longer any likelihood that the investigation could be undermined. Many of the details are exchanged between the Commission and the Member State, but there is a fear that if these were in the public domain they could be used or misused in such a way that would undermine the whole procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, I agree that we should strive for maximum transparency in these processes. It helps when Member States and the Commission are able to agree. The Commission also tries, when opening an infringement case, to disclose or give the reasons why it has opened that case against a Member State.

The Commission can support the general recommendations and conclusions of this World Health Organization report on climate change and human health because, for instance, it focuses on the precautionary principle and the principle of sustainable development. Within the Commission we are taking this carefully into consideration in the formulation of our policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The largest benefits of climate policies for human health can be expected from the reduction in the concentrations of ozone and particles. As climate policies in general reduce fossil fuel use, they also reduce related particulate emissions. Additional health benefits can be gained by reducing urban concentrations of NO2 and SO2. Thus, emissions-control strategies that simultaneously address air pollutants and greenhouse gases lead to a more efficient use of resources at all scales, also addressing human health concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">The World Health Organization report confirms earlier statements that there are still many knowledge gaps involving likely future patterns of exposure to climatic environmental changes and the vulnerability and adaptability of physical, ecological and social systems as regards such climate change. Therefore, we need better information to establish further the links between the pollutants and health effects, with a view to improving our climate change and health policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The action plan on which we are presently working as a follow-up to the environment and health strategy is designed to integrate this information. While the action plan focuses on a set of defined exposures and diseases in its first phase, broader issues, including those related to the health impacts of climate change, can be taken up in future phases. Moreover, the forthcoming thematic strategic on the urban environment, to be adopted by June 2005, and for which an interim communication is presently under discussion within the Commission, should also help local authorities and Member States to improve the environmental performance of cities. This in turn would also contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and make cities healthier places to live.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also considering some projects under the Sixth Research Framework Programme. Within the activities of scientific support to policies of the Sixth Framework Programme, research is also funded on the physical and chemical processes of air pollutants, in particular on particulate matter at the urban to regional scales, in view of their impact on human health. Under the last Research Framework Programme, the cCASHh project – Climate Change and Adaptation Strategies for Human Health in Europe – was funded to assess the health impacts of climate change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> The European Community regulates hunting trophy imports through Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97 on the protection of species of wild fauna and flora by regulating trade therein, and the associated Commission Regulation (EC) No 1808/2001, which sets out more detailed rules.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of these regulations is to protect species of wild fauna and flora and to guarantee their conservation by regulating trade therein. In line with this objective, they have strict criteria for accepting hunting trophy imports. To begin with, import permits are required for any species listed in Annex A of the Council regulation and these include all species listed on Appendix 1 of CITES - (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), such as leopard, cheetah and elephant, and a number of other popular trophy species such as brown bear, lynx and wolf.</p>
<p class="contents">Before granting these permits the authorities in the relevant Member State must obtain scientific advice that the management of the trophy hunt in the country concerned is based on sound biological data, that harvest levels are sustainable and that illegal activities are under control.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one further requirement to which I shall especially draw your attention. Trophy hunting of these species must generate significant and tangible conservation benefits for the species and for the local people who share the area with or suffer as a result of the species concerned. Trophy hunting programmes that meet this criterion can play a vital role in conserving rare species, especially in developing countries and in encouraging local communities to value them as a resource that needs protection from other more damaging uses.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware that in a number of countries, including Namibia, South Africa, Botswana and Tanzania, carefully managed trophy hunting provides a major contribution to their relatively successful conservation efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">While many people find the concept of hunting trophies distasteful under any circumstances, the Commission considers that a general ban on the import on any CITES-listed species would not be in the best interest of species conservation and the sustainable use of resources. However, in cases where the criteria for accepting hunting trophies are not met, the Commission has always taken, and will continue to take, the appropriate measures to suspend such trade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

(PSE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> I am alarmed to hear the Commissioner's conclusions because it certainly does not seem that the trophy hunting to which I referred is being done with the aim of conservation at all. I logged on to a website this afternoon, which would have given me the opportunity to go to Tanzania. It offers the 'discerning sportsman' the ultimate hunting experience: large buffalo, lion, water buck, very rare East African sitatunga, leopards, antelopes, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">My information is that in the last six years British people have been abroad and shot at least 40 African elephants, 32 leopards, 18 polar bears, six hippos – I could go on. Worldwide, this is something like over 3 800 African elephants, over 2 600 rare leopards and 9 000 bears. These are not being slaughtered in the interests of conservation, or with any reference to conversation in the areas. It is trophy hunting: people who go out and shoot big game and come home proudly but sickeningly with a trophy of the head of a rare animal.</p>
<p class="contents">Would the Commissioner think again, and would she agree to meet me to go through some of these statistics, to see some of the evidence and to put in place a ban on the import of CITES-listed animals into the European Union? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Evans about CITES-listed species. There should be a ban on them. It is not acceptable. Apart from that, it is clear that there are illegal imports of trophies into the European Union; surely there must be some way of ensuring that this does not happen. The European Union puts huge resources and effort into keeping out so-called illegal immigrants, yet it cannot stop the illegal import of trophies. We should get our priorities right.
