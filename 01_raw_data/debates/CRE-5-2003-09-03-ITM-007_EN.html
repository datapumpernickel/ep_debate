We are, after all, a community of values and a major economic power, but we are unfortunately leaving something to be desired. The European Union is not lacking in good intentions or policy resolutions. There is, however, a yawning gap between rhetoric and reality. The criticism is mainly aimed at the Member States and concerns incoherence and a lack of decisiveness. The Council recognises the shortcomings and has expressly promised improvements, so far with little noticeable result. Political dialogue with third countries is still optional. As long as economic or strategic interests are paramount to human rights for us, one can continue to enter into dialogue until the cows come home, but obviously little will change. Specific goals must be developed and the governments involved must be called to account. Not only sanctions, but also positive incentives, in particular, can help progress on its way. What are the options for improving the dialogues according to the Council and the Commission? The Council is required to consult Parliament and take its opinions on foreign policy into consideration. Unfortunately, though, this is hardly ever done in practice, something that we in this House, of course, find unacceptable. The European Union's role in the world concerns the European citizens and therefore their representatives. Success or failure outside of the European Union has repercussions for many sectors within the EU. According to my research, there was only one single occasion last year when the Council discussed a human rights resolution from this House. Of all our written questions, not one was answered in time. I welcome the fact that the Council is present in this debate, in the person of Mr Antonione. Let this be the start of a new, constructive and intense relationship. I should like to ask the Commission for a schedule for the long term and a systematic impact assessment of the projects. I should also like to ask the Commission to finalise the internal reforms, intensify staff training and finance in a balanced manner the fight against torture and the rehabilitation of its victims. On our part, we as a parliament may be very active in condemning many human rights violations across the world, but we do not give enough consideration to what comes next. We must organise our work in such a way that we continue to monitor the human rights situations discussed and, if necessary, sound the alarm again. My report also asks for particular attention to be given to freedom of religion and conscience, and to the abuse of religions for political ends. Religions are still being suppressed across the globe. Half of the world's population lives in countries where freedom of religion is restricted. Moreover, it is particularly disturbing that human rights should be violated on a massive scale in the name of religion. Almost half of the violent conflicts in the period under scrutiny have a religious dimension. Over the past decade, religions have been experienced more intensely, but not, unfortunately, only in a peaceful manner. In all major world religions, radicalism is on the rise, something mainly attributable to globalisation. The revolution of global contacts does not immediately lead to more understanding and respect between communities of faith. On the contrary, people feel threatened by what they experience as an encroachment on their own standards and values. Radicalism, too, is the result of dissatisfaction among the masses of young people. Irresponsible leaders exploit these feelings of unrest, sometimes with the help of major financial sources and terrorist networks. Clashes among, and within, religions represent a very serious threat to human rights and world peace, with, moreover, the risk that religious confrontations outside of Europe will have repercussions on our own multi-religious societies. Given the seriousness of the threat, it is of the utmost importance for the European Union to chart the problem and to design a strategy. The President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, has already set the tone for this. What is the opinion of the Commission and the Council? What do they think of the specific recommendations I have made in this respect in my report?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, two topics that are also very close to my heart.</p>
<p class="contents">The objectionable caste system. Worldwide, more than 260 million people suffer discrimination, violence and exploitation on a daily basis, purely by reason of their origin. The European Union should make it policy to promote the abolition of these immoral practices.</p>
<p class="contents">Children. All over the world, children are being exploited, neglected or exposed to violence. More than 300 000 young people are currently taking active part in armed conflicts. Every three seconds, a child dies of malnutrition. In a fully-fledged EU development policy, the child should occupy centre stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, modesty does not become the European Union as a community of values and economic power where human rights are concerned. We in Europe should have the nerve to stick our necks out; the victims are eagerly waiting for this.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Antonione,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome this great opportunity to address you as President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union, and I am particularly happy that it has come in the context of a debate on human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I proceed, I must offer my condolences and the condolences of the Italian Presidency for the death of Sérgio Vieira de Mello, who, in his capacity as United Nations High Commissioner, had already established himself as a valiant champion of the promotion and defence of human rights at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">The protection and promotion of human rights is one of the fundamental pillars of the European Union’s foreign policy and it is a constant reference point for its activities on the world stage. The Union adheres to the fundamental principle of the universal nature of human rights, which cannot be challenged or distorted by any cultural influence. Human rights are one of the key factors in addressing the major challenges of our time: I do not need to mention the close connection between peace, security and stability, on the one hand, and respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms, democracy and the rule of law, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, there is a close connection between the fight against extreme poverty and underdevelopment and measures seeking to secure fundamental human rights, starting with the right of every human being to life, integrity and dignity. In this context, we therefore believe that it is of key importance during this six-month term to set the north-south dialogue on a more constructive basis, for it has deteriorated considerably<span class="bold"> </span>in recent months, particularly as regards the subject of human rights, which must continue to be an essential part of the dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">The Italian Presidency’s human rights programme has been made public and so I do not need to illustrate it at length. I will confine myself to mentioning a few key points. They include mainstreaming human rights into the widest possible external projection of the Union and taking concentrated measures worldwide to promote a moratorium on and the abolition of the death penalty. They also include a range of constructive political initiatives to eliminate the use of torture and to promote an agreement on the human rights of people with disabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">A particular boost needs to be given to the structured dialogue with Iran and China, and a thorough debate needs to be launched on the work of the Commission on Human Rights. Then the Italian Presidency attaches great importance to the tragic phenomenon of child soldiers. I would mention, lastly, the initiatives that the Union is going to take in the General Assembly third committee and the provision of the European Union’s annual report on human rights, as well as the annual meeting with non-governmental organisations, which we want to make more constructive this year.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to congratulate Mr Bob van den Bos on drafting the European Parliament’s annual report, which is full of ideas, analyses, proposals and recommendations. It is a document that warrants extremely thorough analysis, which, of course, is impossible to achieve in this sitting. However, it will be analysed in a careful assessment by the other elements and bodies of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">On this occasion, therefore, I will, if I may, focus on just a few of the report’s ideas which I feel deserve particular attention. I will start with a general point made in the report with which I, personally, agree: despite the prodigious efforts of the Union and other countries, the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the world is, still today, marked by serious abuses and violations. The causes of this can be traced back to a number of factors. The report focuses on some of them, such as the prevailing of political and economic interests over human rights and the need to achieve compromise positions in international fora to the detriment of positions of principle.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, if we are now convinced that the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms lie at the very heart of democracy and civilised coexistence, we cannot, at the same time, fail to be of the opinion that the pursuit of legitimate political and economic goals demands the consolidation of democratic institutions and the principles of freedom and justice. It is well known that dictatorships, which are based on terror and violence, reject the democratic ideal, denying fundamental rights and freedoms, seeking to abuse their power with regard to other peoples and, ultimately, proving to be unreliable consultative partners.</p>
<p class="contents">What strategy should the European Union pursue in relations with these regimes? The report states: ‘The … political … dialogues which the EU undertakes with third countries have so far not led to many results.’ Should we, therefore, see them as an instrument which is not effective, admit that the policy of human rights dialogue with third countries has not, in many cases, led to appreciable results and give up on them?</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Mr van den Bos’s report contains the answers to this question, and I endorse them. We have a duty to condemn publicly the unacceptable practices perpetrated by certain regimes, for, in this way, the perpetrators are placed in a position where they are forced to justify themselves at the very least, to face the judgment of the international community. With regard to the approach of structured human rights dialogue with third countries, the line proposed in the report is precisely that which the Council intended to take on this instrument. In my view, this is not permissive dialogue which is an alternative to forms of political condemnation, but it fully involves civil society, including NGOs and figures from the academic world who are active in the field of human rights, and it is based on the pursuit of precise goals whose implementation is monitored carefully and regularly.</p>
<p class="contents">I also endorse the point contained in the report on the need for political dialogue and condemnation to go hand in hand with proactive programmes and measures in the field of combating poverty, support for institution building and education. Monitoring, resolutions, dialogues, human rights clauses and cooperation and technical assistance programmes in the field are all instruments for achieving a single objective – the unceasing defence of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the world. The Union’s human rights dialogue underway with China and Iran does not mean that it cannot condemn violations and abuse through <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> resolutions too, where it considers that to be necessary, in the United Nations Commission on Human Rights or the UN General Assembly, nor does it mean that it cannot provide them with technical assistance in the field intended to consolidate respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to the part of the report which levels severe criticism at the Council for failing to publicly condemn the regimes responsible for repeated, serious human rights abuses in its work. I would not presume to reject these criticisms point blank, but I do, however, feel that some clarification is necessary. It is certainly limiting to assess the Union’s activity on the basis of the number of resolutions per country that it presents to the Commission on Human Rights or to the General Assembly, or even on the basis of the resolutions which achieve sufficient consensus. In any case, the part played by the European Union in the field of human rights within international fora is fully recognised. In actual fact, as has already been pointed out, the Union’s activity in this field covers a very wide range of different initiatives, from the measures contained in the reports of the Heads of Mission to public statements. This European activity targets a large number of countries.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another aspect I would like to focus on which is dealt with in particular depth in the report: intercultural and inter-faith dialogue. The report specifically highlights the key nature of this issue for the wider framework of the protection of human rights. I represent a country which, because of its location, culture and traditions, has always been particularly sensitive to this issue and which has now acquired influence and importance which it has never known in the past. What might at one time have been considered an opportunity to be seized has now become absolutely vital. Ideological opposition to and political exploitation of human rights and fundamental freedoms are, I am afraid, a fact, however much we might condemn them.</p>
<p class="contents">The atmosphere of antagonism that increasingly marks dialogue in the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, which is also dealt with at length in the report, is an issue on which the Greek Presidency has already launched a debate, which we intend to pursue and develop. The action of the Union and the western countries, in general, in the field of human rights is clearly perceived by part of the international community, particularly the southern hemisphere, it would appear, as a manipulative attempt to pursue political and cultural abuses of power. The very principle of the universality of human rights and the conviction that they cannot be constrained or limited by any social, economic or cultural group are challenged. Fundamentalism, whatever its origin or nature, is, in part, the result of an inability to communicate, to search for common values based on mutual respect and tolerance.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe it is enough, in this regard, for the Union to limit itself to firmly rejecting the accusations of using double standards which are often levelled at it. Rather, there needs to be a discussion on these matters, to which the European Parliament could contribute. In this connection, I would inform you that, at the initiative of Italy, a convention on the universality of human rights and intercultural dialogue is to be held in March 2004 in Milan.</p>
<p class="contents">In drawing up the guidelines for our six-month term of office in the field of human rights, one of the essential points we considered it necessary to highlight, as I said before, is mainstreaming. It must be our objective to integrate, harmoniously and coherently, the issue of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms into all the Union’s policies on third countries. I am therefore particularly pleased to note that this concept is expressed clearly and forcibly by Parliament in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I fully support the idea that the human rights clause contained in association and cooperation agreements should be implemented unfailingly whenever the conditions for its application arise. I also feel that a relationship of cooperation with a country at all levels – political, economic, scientific and cultural – must, of necessity, include open, constructive dialogue on matters of protecting fundamental rights and freedoms. The report contains interesting, practical proposals on which I have already ordered studies and technical analyses to be carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, moreover, like to say that there may be different ways of achieving the same goals and objectives. Experience has taught us that setting up committees or working groups may often be the most immediate, obvious solution but it sometimes proves not to be the most effective way of proceeding in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Another theme of the report which is worthy of mention is transparency. It is right to pay tribute to the Danish Presidency for encouraging and promoting the practice of regular, unfailing consultation with civil society, which has undoubtedly contributed to raising the profile of the European Union’s work. This practice was taken up by the Greek Presidency and will continue to be a firm reference point for the Italian Presidency in its work. I feel that, ultimately, it represents proper, appropriate recognition of the essential, indispensable role played in this field by NGOs, which are and will continue to be the European Union’s necessary, privileged consultative partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to focus on a criticism made in the document, relating to institutional relations between the Council and the European Parliament in the area of human rights. We will analyse in more depth the opinion expressed by the rapporteur to the effect that there needs to be an improvement in relations between the Council and Parliament, and I hereby commit the Italian Presidency to continuing the work started by the Greek Presidency in this area. The invitation extended by the Greek Presidency to the rapporteur to take part in a meeting of the Human Rights Committee is representative of an approach which seeks to involve the European Parliament more closely in the Council’s work.</p>
<p class="contents">The Italian Presidency is fully in favour of this, and I confirm that we intend to continue along the path already marked out, identifying appropriate solutions to the problems and inadequacies highlighted in the report. In this sense, I hope that I will be able to report to the House at the end of the six months on the measures taken by the Council in the area of human rights. The governments of the Member States of the Union now recognise the imperative need to guarantee the European Parliament’s role as a driving force in the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms and to foster forms of closer cooperation. There will therefore have to be a proper debate on the constructive proposals put forward by the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy to end by noting – and this is the point of most political significance – that the Council and Parliament agree on the importance and central nature of the issue of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the Union’s policy and external relations. It is an important fact which reflects our constantly-evolving approach to these issues, which are no longer confined to ethical statements and declarations of principle but are increasingly going to influence political decisions in relations with third countries. The statement that international peace, security and stability are founded on full respect for fundamental rights and freedoms is not just empty rhetoric but reflects the reality that human rights are increasingly going to influence governments’ decisions in the area of foreign policy and the strategies of international organisations at all levels.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I wish to begin by paying tribute to Mr van den Bos for his excellent report. The engagement of the European Parliament on human rights issues serves as a critical stimulus to EU policy, and there is much food for thought in this latest publication. The Commission will, as usual, respond in writing to all the recommendations addressed to it in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">First, some remarks on the principal themes of the report – freedom of thought, conscience and religion. We tried to work on these issues in several different ways. First, through efforts in international fora. With EU support, Ireland tabled the resolution on the Elimination of All Forms of Religious Intolerance at the UN Commission on Human Rights and the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly, which urges states to guarantee freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief, facilitate worship and combat intolerance. The EU’s statement on human rights in the world at the last CHR highlighted concerns relating to religious freedom or freedom of expression in 12 countries, including China and Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, thorough dialogue with third countries. Dedicated human rights dialogues offer a particularly valuable opportunity to address the issue. In evaluating the dialogue with Iran, for example, the General Affairs and External Relations Council of 18 March 2003 underscored its concern at discrimination against religious minorities – particularly Baha’is – and the need for more progress as regards freedom of opinion and expression. Corporal punishment and the abhorrent condemnation to stoning, pronounced in the name of Sharia, have also been the cause of in-depth debates with representatives of the Iranian Government, judiciary and clergy. Thus far, the EU has noted with satisfaction that the de facto moratorium on stoning is still a reality. I hope further results will be achieved with our Iranian partners. Freedom of expression will form the main subject for discussion at the next round-table under the human rights dialogue on 15 and 16 September 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights offers concrete support to projects in this field. It has supported campaigns to promote freedom of expression – for example, a continuing project in the ASEAN countries, – and freedom of expression has been identified as a priority for 11 EIDHR focus countries in 2002 and 2003. The Commission is also making significant efforts to establish a solid basis for effective intercultural dialogue, not least in the Mediterranean – a focus for the new neighbourhood policy – with the imminent report of the High-level Advisory Group and the proposal for a Euro-Mediterranean Foundation.</p>
<p class="contents">I noted the rapporteur's reference to the Cotonou Agreement. This is a good, relevant reference. The Cotonou Agreement shows that a comprehensive system can be negotiated with as many as 77 countries, but it also illustrates that there are some challenges and real problems to be dealt with. However, the system is interesting. I agree with Mr van den Bos.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the human rights clause, I am pleased that Parliament’s report emphasises the potential for the clause to induce positive change in the human rights situation in third countries. That is precisely the goal of recent innovations. Last May saw the launch of the first working group dedicated to governance and human rights in the context of the Cooperation Agreement with Bangladesh, with the inaugural meeting tackling a wide variety of issues, including the death penalty and the judicial system. The Commission communication on Reinvigorating EU actions on Human Rights and democratisation with Mediterranean partners offers the potential for similar initiatives in the framework of the Mediterranean Association Agreements, with a range of initiatives – such as the systematic inclusion of human rights and democracy issues in the meetings of the Association Councils and National Action Plans on human rights – designed to effect change on the basis of the clause.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the UN Commission on Human Rights, the human rights clause not only constitutes a commitment to human rights in a domestic context, it also pledges the EU and third states to the promotion and protection of human rights in the international arena. This leads me to the UN Commission on Human Rights. Mr van den Bos’ report acknowledges the high degree of congruence between the priorities identified by the European Parliament for the 59th session of the CHR and the action undertaken there by the EU. That is heartening, as the EU’s voice is immeasurably strengthened when its institutions speak with one voice. However, I share the concern articulated in the report about the direction of the CHR and the need to make every effort to ensure that it addresses human rights violations effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has its work cut out: only 47 States have issued a standing invitation to the CHR’s thematic procedures – 28 of which are EU Member States, accession states or candidate countries. Moreover, 80 states have not ratified all 6 major international human rights instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has made a good start in efforts to improve the impact of its actions at the CHR; for example, this year’s session saw earlier finalisation of draft EU initiatives allowing more scope for effective lobbying of third countries. EIDHR funding has also played its part, with recent projects bolstering the work of the human rights treaty bodies and that of several UN rapporteurs. These efforts will continue in the knowledge that it is only by marshalling all the resources at the EU’s disposal – political, diplomatic and financial – that we will really be able to effect the necessary change.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would make two remarks. The first is about children in conflicts, an issue which has already been commented on. We are trying to do everything possible to change the situation, but it is extremely difficult in the northern part of Uganda to get into contact with the Lord's Resistance Army. It is almost impossible to do anything meaningful on the ground, because there is no society surrounding the conflict as a basis for action. There is nothing but the conflict. However, in post-conflict cases – for example, Sierra Leone – we have been quite successful in the resocialisation of children and other related work.</p>
<p class="contents">The other point I would make relates to torture. We can support rehabilitation centres. This is also an instrument that keeps the public aware of the issue of torture. The documentation coming from these centres is the most necessary element in our attempt to address the problem we are up against and deal with the terrible regimes that carry out torture. So there is more to it than the primary objective of helping the victims of torture. Establishing facts, which is the secondary output of these activities in rehabilitation centres, is also a powerful instrument which we are pleased to be funding, and we will continue to be an active donor in this area, which definitely strengthens efforts to which we have to give high priority.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank you again for this comprehensive report. We will do everything possible to respond in a very direct manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The degree of consensus in this House also shows that all the political families continue to view the commitment to human rights throughout the world as a core element in achieving democracy, social progress and the peaceful coexistence of nations. I would also like to extend my thanks to the human rights organisations, with which the cooperation is always very good.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats considers that the focus of this year’s report – freedom of thought, conscience and religion – is a good benchmark by which to measure the state of democracy and human rights in every country and in every society. This includes the freedom to practise one’s religion just as much as it includes a religion’s duty to show tolerance towards the other faiths which exist alongside it. The freedom to change one’s religion or religious denomination must also include the right not to profess any faith. Democratic thought and action should also preclude any situation in which it is only the members of a specific religion or denomination who are viewed, in effect, as full or fully accepted citizens of a state.</p>
<p class="contents">I also do not know of any world religion which is fundamentally intolerant or hostile to other religions or, indeed, towards its own believers. Criticism of religious intolerance therefore cannot be directed towards a religion as a whole, but must be directed towards those who practise or interpret their own religions in a truly inhuman way, generally out of a desire to achieve or remain in power. Such criticism of those who are responsible for human rights violations is something which we must also demand, over and over again, from the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Council think that stability in the world is enhanced if the issue of human rights is confined solely to nicely phrased human rights clauses? Why do we find it so difficult to enforce these clauses – such as those contained in the Cotonou Agreement? What are the advantages that some governments think they have wangled for themselves if they delay or circumvent sanctions, for example against Zimbabwe? Do you think we are serving the interests of people in China, or our relations with that country, if we pigeon-hole human rights issues as an element of a dialogue on the rule of law which takes place behind closed doors? This approach gives <span class="italic">carte blanche</span> to anyone visiting the country, be they politicians or businesspeople, to point to this scenario and absolve themselves of any further responsibility for human rights. After all, raising the issue might adversely affect the climate in which business is done. The same applies to relations with Russia and other major countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet we all know that countries which do not respect human rights at home are structurally weak, whereas respect for human rights has a stabilising effect at home and abroad. Pressure from the EU to enforce human rights is ultimately a better method of achieving domestic and external stability than policies which I would describe as a slavish adherence to the status quo, which give preference to short-term superficial stability and only change when conflicts actually spill over to other countries. This Parliament will continue to demand statements on unpleasant issues, and it will continue to demand compliance with the content of our resolutions, for we believe that words and deeds must go hand in hand in human rights as well, and that without a pro-active human rights policy towards the states in question, it will be impossible to reduce the conflict potential in the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must remember that over the centuries and, indeed, even now many atrocities are carried out in the name of religion.</p>
<p class="contents">Fundamentalism and intolerance are growing threats. That is why the role of human rights defenders in the world is vital. We must do all we can to protect them and humanitarian aid workers around the world. That is why we must remind ourselves of the appalling attack in Baghdad on the UN mission, express our deep condolences to the families of those who have been killed and injured and note the appalling, tragic and untimely death of Mr Sergio Vieira de Mello, an outstanding human rights defender.</p>
<p class="contents">We must defend freedom of thought and freedom of conscience. And what of our relations with third countries? We should say yes to dialogue, but action must follow from that dialogue. We have increasing numbers of death sentences in countries with which we have close relations. That is why we need an end to the death sentence. With our association agreements – Egypt and Israel spring to mind – if we do nothing, we condone human rights abuses. What use are our agreements, in particular the human rights clauses, if we do not enforce them? In Egypt homosexuals are being entrapped on the Internet and incarcerated for no other reason but that they are homosexual: this is appalling.</p>
<p class="contents">We must defend freedom of the press, the rights and freedoms of the child, the rights and freedoms of homosexuals, of minorities, the rights of women, ethnic minorities, the rights of refugees, and, yes, unfashionably, those seeking asylum.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make a special reference to Aung San Suu Kyi, now on hunger strike in Burma. We must do all we can to release from detention this brave and honourable woman. We must respect also the human rights of disabled people, included in our report for the first time.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall finish by saying that the Council, Commission and Parliament must speak with one voice. Our message is clear: these are our values. If you support them we will engage with you. If you do not, we will pursue this agenda until human rights are totally and finally respected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I fully subscribe to his appeal for more consistency and coherency in human rights policy. After all, the European Union is at risk of losing all credibility if it does not succeed in speaking with one voice, even if strategically or economically important countries, such as China or Russia, are involved. Mr van den Bos is right in condemning the most important human rights forum, the UN Commission on Human Rights, for becoming highly politicised. I myself have had the opportunity of attending this UN Commission on two occasions and I could never shake off the impression that the governments systematically conspired to exonerate one another. The motto appears to be: if we spare others, we do not run the risk of being condemned ourselves. During the latest sessions in Geneva, it transpired once more that it is the foxes that have to watch the hen's eggs. It is highly worrying that countries such as Libya, Sudan, Zimbabwe and Cuba should play a leading role in the UN Commission on Human Rights and that the European Union, the key sponsor, should hardly have any impact left. It therefore delights me that the rapporteur has adopted my amendments on this matter. On the one hand, conditions should be prescribed for membership of the UN Commission, such as the signing, ratification and observation of human rights conventions and the admission of special UN human rights rapporteurs. On the other hand, the decision-making process must be reviewed and the unanimity rule should make way for a two-thirds majority rule. If these conditions are not met, the European Union should seriously consider withdrawing from the human rights circus. It will otherwise run the risk of legitimising, rather than condemning, human rights violations, and surely that can never be the intention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will mention a few of them: does the report make sense, is it useful, are the points raised given adequate priority, are they always confirmed, what role is played by its main errors, by the choice of press agencies and by the media? Nor can we forget political preferences.</p>
<p class="contents">What can we say to those who assert that the underlying ideology is that of the rich and powerful countries, which judge others according to their interests and their criteria without always applying the same standards at home?</p>
<p class="contents">The attitude of the United States provides us with an illustration that is more than a caricature in this area: treatment of its prisoners, refusal to accept the ICC, preventive war, death penalty, etc. I am stopping there a list that is by no means complete and to which everyone could add.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards overall usefulness and validity, each person must make up their own mind. Personally, in spite of many doubts, I have nevertheless concluded that this report is useful and I congratulate my colleague Mr van den Bos.</p>
<p class="contents">Having stated this, we must then go into more detail to measure and to weigh up the gaps and the excesses that are wrongly included in the report and those, also wrongly, that are missing. My colleague Mrs Pernille Frahm and I tabled nine amendments in committee, seven of which were adopted, and of the 27 amendments in plenary, eight were adopted by the members of my group. This is evidence of our interest and thus our belief that this report is useful.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, you will see that not one of us, and I mean not one of us, will agree with everything that is adopted. I, personally, could list all of the points that bother me and those with which I disagree.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, in spite of everything and without denying the negative, the positive prevails and I am prepared to vote in favour of this report, unless it is distorted as a result of certain votes. I do still have some concerns regarding the desire on the part of some people to replace freedom of conscience with religious freedom and some other fears regarding certain political links. Other colleagues will make different choices, including Members within my own group; that is democracy. The most important thing, and I must emphasise this, is the need to wholeheartedly defend human rights, all human rights, including economic and social rights, throughout the world. Yes, I stress that we must defend them in every country, without exception! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We for our part still want to lay emphasis on the rights of political prisoners and the right to a healthy environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Torture, together with the death penalty, is a violation of the most fundamental of human rights. In a world that is fighting terrorism we have been alarmed to see the unconditional ban on torture become a relative issue and, as it were, go soft round the edges. It is not enough to invest in prevention and especially in the broadest possible ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture. We really also have to support the rehabilitation of victims. We are now getting a promise of that, but it will also require additional resources. We must invest in this, however, and that means the proper budget decisions have to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">When you look at the role of the EU in the report and the parts that deal with how prepared it is to engage in human rights work, you get a feeling of <span class="italic">déjà vu</span>. That is certainly not because the rapporteur has failed in any way but because, year after year, we have been emphasising very similar needs for change. In a world where views on security based on arms and cooperation are in conflict with one another and in which the situation regarding universal human rights and the sovereignty of states is tense – this is a question of the fate of the United Nations – the EU has an opportunity to place human rights at the heart of its external policy. Institutional changes are not enough for this, even if we have our own foreign ministry and the parliamentary committees are reorganised. It can only work if we really want to invest in consistent work and involve ourselves with the utmost sincerity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He is trying to lift Parliament’s efforts above the level of positive testimonies. After all, if we speak our minds, then we will also need to do the follow-up. Too often, we do not take heed of our own criticism and we lack the tools to find out what has become of our indictments. We should finally do something about this follow-up, even though I fully understand the objections – some of them practical – that the Commissioner mentioned. This certainly applies to the support to which the winners of our Sakharov prize are entitled. After all, they are in many cases the heroes of civil liberties. This very week, timely support has once again been shown – and rightly so – to Aung San Suu Kyi, and so it is odd to notice that Mrs Leyla Zana is always receiving so little attention from us. Is it not so convenient politically speaking? If this is the reason, then the criticism levelled by the rapporteur at the Commission and the Council also applies to us. Upholding human rights is not all that simple. Defending people with whom you see eye to eye is not difficult. It is only when the rights of people with whom you do not agree are upheld, that campaigning for human rights becomes an issue. This also holds for freedom of conscience. To my surprise, some of my fellow-MEPs get along better with that concept than with freedom of religion. I find this a bit worrying, to be honest. I should, however, like to ask for attention to be given to my amendment on freedom of conscience, which I tabled immediately, of course. After all, very positive things can be mentioned in this area too. In the amendment, reference is made to the wide range of conscientious objections, with which we do, or do not, agree. After all, in the framework of respect for conscience, the latter is not at all interesting. I therefore hope for wide support from this House. In my view, the rapporteur has handled the topic of religious freedom in his articles very proficiently. It is all the sadder that plain prejudice on the part of the press has often led to only this 1% of the text that deals with violence in religion being given so much attention. I hope that the rapporteur will not give this too much of a hearing and simply continues unstintingly along the path that his report has mapped out.</p>

I feel that there is something we could do, and that is to press on with our practical monitoring and condemnation of human rights abuses, to implement the resolutions adopted in this House without confining our duties to the declarations of principle that we write on our cards, to provide – as the Commissioner, too, has said – funds and practical resources, as well as training and support, for those who work in the field of human rights, starting with the United Nations, and, lastly, to support journalists – many journalists have been killed in the past year, Commissioner – whom I believe are a source of witness and verification which is important, not least for Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Mr van den Bos’ report, it would appear clear that we need to prevent religion becoming a divisive factor once again in the third millennium, as it has been for a long time. We need to avoid fresh forms of intolerance and new forms of discrimination developing in the name of God, not least in some highly civilised countries, in some highly civilised Western democracies: a world divided and traversed by new crusades would be a terminally ill world, and we must prevent it.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, Mr President, I believe that the battle for human rights can no longer be seen as a battle of principles, that it cannot be won by cunning or by taking short cuts. We therefore call upon the Council to make every endeavour to ensure that the human rights clause – we have already heard this in the Council’s speech – is not seen as just a minor addition but represents a firm ideal of legal and democratic civilisation which Parliament will ensure is never diminished. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Memories of the criminal invasions of Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and Iraq are still fresh. The problem, of course, is that the peoples suffering the ‘benevolence’ of the European Union and its imperialist friends insist on resisting their liberators. The same applies to the people of Cuba, who are not convinced of the advantages of the free market.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, which has appointed itself as the global defender of human rights, uses them selectively as a lever for exercising pressure in order to impose its policy. It has in its sights regions and states which are of geostrategic and economic importance and states such as Cuba, Vietnam, China, Belarus etc. with inconvenient social and political systems. Even religious freedom is being used for this purpose, while the Turco resolution reaches the point of proposing an ‘offshore’ law with punishments and sanctions in accordance with the US standard.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the European Union and the report turn a blind eye to the violations of human rights in the USA, with the anti-terrorism legislation allowing secret arrests and special courts martial. They do the same for Israel, Turkey and the candidate countries which prosecute and ban communist parties.</p>

I wish particularly to emphasise issues surrounding the defence of religious freedom, for which Mr van den Bos has provided a sound basis in this document and which I myself have been able to be involved in further strengthening.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament draws attention to bans on missionary activity and threats of punishment in cases where people change faith. We would censure acts of violence based on a misinterpretation of religion or faith. The European Parliament would point to the vulnerability experienced by members of religious minorities around the world. An important observation in the document is that atheistic extremism may undermine people’s ability to co-exist peacefully. We also warn against intolerance based on atheism.</p>
<p class="contents">It is stated that the rights of women and girls are threatened by child marriage. We also indicate the important role of the media in disseminating knowledge of religions and cultures. An important principle emphasised in Mr van den Bos's report is the right to change or renounce one’s faith and to seek one’s own spiritual home in freedom and without encountering legislation that is oppressive or that gives rise to threats of punishment for those who change their faith and religion.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish to remove bans upon, and threats in connection with, converting from one religion to another. We wish to resist punishments and other practices in the name of religion that violate human freedoms and rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this important document contains legitimate repudiations of the choice of Libya as Chair of the UN Commission on Human Rights. Criticism is also directed against Cuba, where 78 human rights activists have been locked up because of their work on human freedoms and rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is the almost excessive emphasis he places on religion. The second is an implicit idea that we can discern by reading between the lines, namely that freedom of conscience would be guaranteed by tolerance of different beliefs.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not dwell on the first point: it is a political choice of the rapporteur and has been explained. However, with regard to the second issue, that is, the pluralism of beliefs as support for human rights in a society, I am a great deal more sceptical. Firstly, this idea relegates atheists and agnostics to the rank of infidels, a sort of status by default. However, more seriously, I am convinced that only the structural secularity of a state or a federation of states can guarantee each person’s freedom of conscience. This structural secularity places beliefs where they are needed, in other words in the private domain. It is of little relevance whether one is in private an atheist, a Catholic, a Jew, a Muslim or a follower of any peaceful sect. With regard to sects, I will refer to the words of Anna Morelli, a Belgian historian of religions: what is a sect, if not a religion that has not received the support of a political power. Yet in the public arena, and particularly in the political arena, all religious interference must be banned, all occultist influence denounced. These are the only genuine guarantees of citizens’ freedom of conscience and quite simply of their freedom. The van den Bos report would have been even more forceful if his conclusions had gone this far. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is a cliché now to state that human rights are indivisible. But I am not convinced that the human rights of mass murdering terrorists or those that aid and abet them in any way deserve the same consideration as those of decent law-abiding citizens. We are reminded that in the fight against terrorism our democracies must take care not to abuse civil liberties and human rights. This is, of course, true, but equally, we must not allow human rights to become a political weapon in the terrorist armoury. It is the terrorists and their apologists that are the biggest abusers of the human rights of our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very easy for us to wring our hands over all the human rights abuses around the world. To my mind, the European Union should focus more precisely on some achievable objectives where it has leverage. It should concentrate action on a few areas where there is the possibility of getting results and then act with consistency and determination.</p>
<p class="contents">I think of Burma – on which I shall speak tomorrow – and Zimbabwe, where millions of people are suffering under Mugabe's tyranny, a situation shamefully tolerated and encouraged by leaders in some African countries in the region. Resolutions of this Parliament have too often been ignored by the Council. Some countries have tried to exploit the situation to their own advantage. Instead there should be a consistent, coherent approach based on a clear strategy to remove Mugabe's boot from the neck of his people. It could be done.</p>
<p class="contents">Corrupt and brutal governments in failed states are usually the main source of human rights abuse of millions of the world's most disadvantaged people. As British Conservatives, we are insistent that, in return for enhanced development assistance, recipient countries should implement their side of the bargain, namely good governance, the rule of law and respect for human rights. Maybe then we would have some progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I congratulate Mr van den Bos on his work, struggling as he was with the large number of competing priorities and demands.</p>
<p class="contents">It remains a problem for Parliament on how far individual countries should be named in this report. Why should, for example, freedom of religion be criticised in Laos, Vietnam and Pakistan, but not in Turkmenistan or Saudi Arabia?</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution identifies some structural changes at EU level which could genuinely improve enforcement of human rights, including better operation of the human rights clause between the EU and third countries, inclusion of the European Parliament in discussion of the operational programme on human rights, and the introduction of benchmarks which enable EU action short of the two often blunt instruments of sanctions policies or suspension of aid. I hope the Commission will consider these in detail.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, just as Parliament voted earlier today in favour of a UN Convention on disability, it is right that the abuse of the human rights of people with disabilities are represented within this comprehensive resolution. This is not just about economic and social rights, but about people all over the world who have lost their lives or who have been subject to abuse simply because they are disabled. For example, abuse occurs in residential institutions where people are deprived of basic human dignity, including the use of caged beds in psychiatric institutions in countries which will next year become full members of the European Union. On this and all the issues identified in this report, human rights are indivisible within Europe as well as elsewhere in the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I sensed quite a lot of frustration in many of the contributions reflecting the lack of clear decisions with binding effect and the lack of effective instruments to enforce respect of human rights in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of it almost had an air of extra-territoriality, even coming close to unilateralist language. We have to take care and stay faithful to other values that are important for our self-esteem and our project. We have to remain multilateralist. And when addressing these difficult issues no short-cut is possible.</p>
<p class="contents">When the poor from the Third World look at us in Europe – even if they do not understand the figures, this illustrates their image of us – they see that every cow in Europe gets two euro per day in subsidy. Over there, 1.2 billion people live on less than one dollar a day. More than half of the population in the world gets less than two dollars per day.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not to move away from the core theme of this debate, but when we talk about perceptions and how this world sees itself, we have to keep it in mind. Everybody talks about the international society. We do not have one. We are trying to create one. This is where we have a good case for being Europeans at this time. We have to combine that with the issues we discuss here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it is unfortunate that the Maghreb countries as well as Israel are strangely absent. Indeed, 2002 marked a worrying, repressive turning point in those countries, particularly with regard to freedom of expression: detention of and judicial proceedings against leaders of the Kabylie citizens’ movement in Algeria and now attacks on the freedom of the press; imprisonment of an Internet journalist in Tunisia; censorship and the charging of journalist Ali Lmrabet in Morocco; and attacks carried out by the Moroccan authorities in Western Sahara. In the West Bank, the building of the wall of shame represents serious infringement of the Palestinian people’s right to move freely and right to land; it poses a threat to human rights and to peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in many countries, the supposed fight against terrorism provides an excuse for security and repressive measures. This must be resisted. Moreover, it is up to us to ensure that the calling into question of international law, which has been dangerously trivialised by the American authorities, does not lead to a world where economic and political interests always take priority over the rights of individuals and peoples. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
