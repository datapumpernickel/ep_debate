<p class="contents">As a Liberal and Hungarian I should like to underline that on 1 May the legacy of the dreadful Yalta Pact was deservedly consigned to the dustbin of history. This is the most important thing, and I should like to express my thanks to you all for this. Please permit me to give my special thanks to the ELDR and the Liberal family, because the Liberals were already firm supporters of the enlargement at a time when others were perhaps still hesitating. I was pleased and proud of the fact that the Liberal group was the only one that voted unanimously for the enlargement, and they considered us to be full members of the group from the very first day.</p>
<p class="contents"> Now, when some governments have made a last minute decision to prevent the free movement of labour, once again it is only the Liberals who have unanimously rejected these unfair restrictions. Yalta is over, but Europe has not yet been fully united. I send you a message from here, that the Liberals want to remain the driving force of enlargement in the future, until Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, even Turkey, and at some point in time, the entire Balkans unite with Europe. We Hungarians and Liberals will do everything we can to help them comply with the Copenhagen criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, has the political transformation been a success? Of course it has, since today we are all here together with you. However, you must also be aware that the transformation was far, far longer and more painful than we once hoped. The time has come for people to enjoy the advantages offered by the enlarged Union. Our people hope to have a life where their hard work bears fruit. We need to talk a lot about the opportunities offered by the Union. I am talking about money, but I should like you to know that this is not just about money. The Union has triumphantly united not only countries but also nations that had previously been at war with each other. This is why I believe that the Union will provide a splendid resolution of the Trianon trauma. Borders that have separated people until now will disappear, we will all become valued nations and citizens of Europe with equal standing.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Union will change our political culture, hatred will be replaced by fair competition and there will be opportunities for cooperation. I believe that respect for citizens in the Union will continue to increase, because not just in the countries that are joining now, but in also in the existing members there is a lot to be done in the area of human rights. We will be able to meet the most important challenges – terrorism for example – in such a way that we do not have to sacrifice our freedom just to protect our lives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In my capacity as the Liberal leader of 92 Members from 46 European countries in our sister organisation, the Council of Europe, here in Strasbourg, I also express my thanks to the Council of Europe. Its contribution in developing our liberal values has been essential and now in this Chamber I reiterate that the role of the Council of Europe, with its 800 million European citizens, continues to be essential in assisting a more democratic, safer and more stable Europe. These two organisations together can ensure that one day we can really say that Europe, after centuries of division, is now reunited again.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by saying that Europe is already strong and successful but we can make it much stronger and much more successful. The potential in European citizens is ready to be released. What else could our task ahead be, other than the freeing of this European potential?</p>

Today we are expressing our hope for a Europe of unity, solidarity and peace. With a view to the many common battles we have before us in order to make this lovely dream into a reality, we warmly welcome the people from the ten new States of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">For several years our group has made visits to those countries to promote dialogue and build partnerships with the forces of progress and with many social actors. I thought of their hopes and expectations on seeing the moving images of the events in the various capitals marking the enlargement from the Europe of Fifteen to the Europe of Twenty-Five. The conclusion I draw from this is that, if we want to succeed in this wonderful project, we must have the courage to open up the in-depth debate with all our citizens that we should have launched a long time ago. It must deal with a fundamental question, which I have often raised here and which is in all our hearts: what do we want to do together and what means should we create in order to achieve it?</p>
<p class="contents">So, is not the main <span class="italic">raison d'être</span> of this enlarged Union, for many of our compatriots, to be stronger in order to defend a progressive model of solidarity within globalisation? If that is the case, we cannot, for example, accept companies in this part of Europe indulging in the blackmail of relocation and, in the other part, seeking the least social and fiscal obligations. We must reverse this Malthusian approach with no future and accept that the real driving force for our common development is social progress and the promotion of the human capacities of all the peoples of the Union. All the instruments available to us must be employed in order to achieve this ambition. In order for enlargement to succeed, it is not sufficient to unite Europe, we must unite the Europeans!</p>
<p class="contents">Is not another reason for building this enlarged Union together to recover, for the citizens, the powers that have gradually been handed to market forces? A document produced by the Commission’s forward studies unit stated in 1998, and I quote: ‘the Europeans are less and less willing to accept being presented with the <span class="italic">fait accompli</span>. We must allow greater participation by the actors and stake holders. That is the challenge facing Europe today’.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement increases the urgency of this demand tenfold. The more we remove borders, the more we must increase the new rights of the citizens. Otherwise, the law of the jungle will prevail. We must create new rights for employees, for the general public, we must promote a genuine participative European democracy, from the places where we live and work to the heart of the institutions. We should set ourselves the objective of uniting the Europeans by means of common projects, with which they identify themselves and which they have crafted.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, what view of the world should the enlarged Europe promote by means of these initiatives? In a recent article, Mr Cimoszewicz, the Polish Foreign Affairs Minister, wrote, and I quote: ‘It is life itself that settles the controversies not resolved by politicians’. That is true. I am convinced that, in recent times, life has in fact resolved many points which are controversial, particularly on the part to be played by the united Europe in the debate on how the world’s affairs should be managed. I believe that those are the challenges we now have to deal with together. It is in that spirit that I say – without hesitation – ’yes, I welcome the people from the new countries of the Union!’</p>

It is a great privilege for which we should be proud of and grateful to all the men and women who have made this day a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has not been reunited today: it has been united for the first time, and it is united today as never before, because it has never been united on the basis of democracy and the free will of the peoples. Over the past few days, when watching the television or personally taking part in the enlargement celebrations, I have found myself thinking often about my grandfather, Roberto, who was born in 1899 in a small town near Mantua, in Italy. He was part of the final conscription of young men sent to the front during the First World War. It is also to him and people like him that we should dedicate this day.</p>
<p class="contents">Only three generations later and we are celebrating an unimaginable event, one which for a long time we did not even imagine. How many of us today have the same memories and have suffered the same anguish, but until today it was all characterised by different coloured flags? Today our joy is painted in the same colours and plays to the same marvellous music.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, this unification – and this is something which we should all know and tell ourselves – is unfinished; it is also pointless to deny that the happiness that we feel today – here, we, perhaps, to a certain extent the initiated – is less intense and more superficial in the streets of our cities, among the people. This is our challenge, the challenge of our generation: awareness of the path we have travelled must guide us in order to achieve the great dream, as yet incomplete, of a great united and democratic Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the next few months, before the end of the year, we have three significant opportunities to address together, not least to win over those who still have not gauged or do not believe in the importance of this day. The first – as has already been mentioned – is the Constitution. We still do not have a Constitution and negotiations may have recommenced, but certainly those who are still digging their heels in are very determined. We still do not have one, and we are not sure that we will have the Constitution that we want. Today we have to repeat unequivocally: the Constitution we are calling for is the one adopted by the Convention and not the one put forward in part during recent summits and intergovernmental conferences. The Europe, the Constitution that we want are still in danger, and have not yet been obtained. Therefore, we must all take action.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue which we must address – and if possible conclude by the end of the year – together in this Chamber, but also in the Commission and the Council, is the Cyprus question. Here again there is no point being hypocritical: it is a fact that enlargement will not be complete and real until the last wall in Europe has fallen. This, I repeat, concerns us all, because unfortunately this wall is still standing.</p>
<p class="contents">The third and final issue which we must tackle before the end of the year, and which is undoubtedly urgent, is the war in Iraq. The European Union, both old and new, was unable to stop it and we must acknowledge this too. Preparing and having peace in that country, in that region, is a responsibility shared by us all, one which we must assume quickly and urgently, otherwise also this day, like certain others, will merely be a collection of rhetoric.</p>

<p class="contents">Polish is the language of over 40 million Europeans. Before our eyes, ladies and gentlemen, the division of Europe is coming to an end, a division whose sources date back to the Second World War. In these days of joy and emotion, it is fitting, therefore, to remember all those to whom the New Europe is indebted for its reunification. I would like to pay homage to the millions of my countrymen, soldiers and civilians, who were victims of the Second World War. Unfortunately, their blood, spilled on the fields of battle, only secured peace and prosperity for one part of Europe. I would like to pay homage to all those in Poland and Central Europe who, in the Stalinist era, sustained the flame of freedom on the other side of the Iron Curtain. Their inspiration was varied: from democratic socialism through liberalism to Christian-democracy and conservatism. Today we must also pay homage to the political prisoners and victims of the Stalinist terror, although many of them did not live to see a united Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As a Pole, I take particular pride in pointing out to the House that today’s celebrations would not be taking place were it not for the spiritual inspiration of our great fellow countryman, His Holiness John Paul II. He inspired <span class="italic">Solidarity</span>, the powerful social movement that led to the fall of Communism. President Lech Walesa, the leader of this movement became a symbol of the struggle for democracy and human rights for the world. He is our guest today in this Chamber. I also want to recall with pride that the leaders of my party, <span class="italic">Prawo i Sprawiedliwosc</span> [Law and Justice], as well as many of its members, were active participants in the movement for political independence that was <span class="italic">Solidarity</span>. At this time I would also like to express gratitude to two great leaders of the Western world whose steadfast attitude in the eighties helped break the fetters that bound the nations of Eastern and Central Europe. I would like to thank Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and President Ronald Reagan. The great task now before us is to make certain that the fruits of the reunification of the continent are fairly divided among all the nations of the New Europe. Our Union for Europe of the Nations Group will do everything to ensure that the New Europe gives new meaning to the word solidarity.</p>

Welcome; now, what belongs together is being united. You are arriving in the nick of time and, with your hard-earned experience, you can help rescue our democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Democracy means bearing with each other on a daily basis and the right to get involved in elections. It is characterised by our being able to go to the polls and obtain a new majority and, subsequently, new laws and a new government. We get something in return for our vote. It can effect change and perform a monitoring function, and it can reward and punish. It counts. As a voter, I have some significance. I help to wield influence. This simple idea unites us, but it is unfortunately well hidden and not at all up front in the draft Constitution. We can still take part in national elections and change our vote in the Council of Ministers, but we cannot vote ourselves new laws in those areas in which the EU decides. We can take part in EU elections every five years but, here too, we cannot vote ourselves new laws or a new government.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU President, the Foreign Minister and the Prime Minister are all to be appointed by an alliance of 17 out of 25 prime ministers. The most important posts will presumably go to those who can no longer get elected in their own countries. Taken to its logical conclusion, this means you can be appointed if you can no longer be elected. The EU Prime Minister and the President of the Commission are to constitute their government through talks with the prime ministers. The indirectly appointed President is to decide who he wants from each country on the sole body able to table proposals. We shall never again be able to table proposals ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">This democratic deficit could be remedied by converting the EU into a democratic federation, but there is no common EU people that is ready for a common democracy. The only realistic democratic solution is to construct the EU from below as a Europe of democracies.</p>
<p class="contents">Every country must have the right to elect its own Commissioner and send him or her to Brussels as our voters’ representative. Our Commissioner must come home every Friday and say what he has done in the past week and how he will vote during the following week. We should then have 25 elected representatives in Brussels, answerable to the voters in our countries.</p>
<p class="contents">One fine day, we shall be able to unite the whole of Europe in equal cooperation between free nations gathered together to carry out the tasks we cannot successfully discharge in our own democracies. If we focus upon what we cannot deal with ourselves, we have nothing to lose. In that way, we should gain a share of influence when, otherwise, we should be without influence.</p>
<p class="contents">Welcome to the work for openness, democracy and proximity to the people. Welcome to the fight for a Europe of democracies and diversity. To our Polish friends, we would say, moreover: congratulations on your national day. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have learnt, over a much longer period of time and much more harshly than many of us, what independence and freedom mean. They have felt it in their flesh and blood, and I believe that, in this House, they will be able to maintain the true meaning of these words, rather than merely going through a rhetorical ritual.</p>
<p class="contents">Today Europe is breathing with both of its lungs, the Pope has said. It is doing so for the first time since the end of the sixteenth century, when the Europe of the Roman Church had exactly the same borders, apart from Greece, as the Europe of 2004. History does not develop by chance. This Europe is going to breathe, and that is a good thing. Please allow me, however, to stress that this breathing is not without its worries. Europe is asking itself what its nature is and what future it has. It is asking this question, and the problem of borders, which is currently arising, highlights the point very clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this concern stems from an initial decision. Europe would like to be political. The European Union was created by men, by the founding fathers, who did not want it to be political: they wanted to create an area of peace through law and economics. But must I remind you that although peace on our continent has been ensured by means of law and economics, it was born out of balances of power and acts of faith?</p>
<p class="contents">It was the balance of power at the end of the war which brought peace, or at least ended the war. It was the balance of power in 1989 which brought down the Berlin Wall. There have been innumerable acts of faith such as those by de Gaulle and Adenauer, by Walesa, by Prague, by the countries of the East, by Chancellor Kohl reunifying Germany under the very noses of the Soviets. These are political acts of faith.</p>
<p class="contents">If Europe wants to be a power, a real one, if it wants to map out its own destiny, its future, and if it wants to be able to defend, to sustain, to communicate its values, I believe we should return to reality and the reality is that Europe will not be built without the States. What are the true pillars of reality? They are the States: it is they who can convince and lead their people not just to agreement on the superficial, but to agreement on the fundamentals. Not merely agreement on the good things, but also agreement on the difficult things, on crises, on hardships, on those which will inevitably come, since history is always littered with crises and pitfalls.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless Europe is constructed with the States, it will be weak, it will be a sort of club founded upon the consumer – it is very interesting to note that we speak more often in this House of the consumer than of the citizen – it may or may not be comfortable, it may or may not be peaceful, it may or may not be rich, but either way it will be weak. And when one cannot communicate the values one defends, when one is, shall we say, a market, one’s future depends on predators. Protectors are often also predators, and I believe we should remember that from time to time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On 1 May, we saw the final defeat of Hitler and Stalin, and the victory of Walesa, Havel, Delors and Kohl. There are many, though, both in the acceding countries and in the original European Union, and in this House, who have played their part in bringing us to this moment. I would therefore ask you, Mr President, to cause to be recorded in today’s Minutes the names of the ten rapporteurs for the ten countries. I will read their names in the order of the countries’ accession: Schröder, Poos, Gahler, Queiró, Elisabeth Schroedter, Souladakis, Stenzel, Gawronski, Volcic, and Wiersma; also the three rapporteurs who have passed on their brief to others: Mrs Hoff, Mrs Carlsson and Mr Matella. I ask you to honour them by having their names recorded.</p>
