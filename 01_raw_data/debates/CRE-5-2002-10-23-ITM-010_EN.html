<p class="contents">In 1998, this Parliament and the Council approved a programme designed to improve the operation of taxation systems within the internal market. Just one year ago, in 2001, an assessment was made of the three first years of operation of this system. I am happy to say that the development was satisfactory, and also that this programme was, in itself, subject to that assessment. This year we have been presented with a Commission proposal to extend the programme – which will expire on New Year’s Eve of this year – for a further five years, in other words, until 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe there are two innovative elements to the programme which is going to be in force for the next five years (Fiscalis 2007) in comparison with the previous one: it is being extended to include direct taxation – which is good news – and to include the needs of the candidate countries, which is even better news.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Fiscalis 2007 programme which we are now studying has three broad objectives. Firstly, it is proposed that the taxation systems of the Member States should function properly; secondly, that better operation should be achieved by means of cooperation between the tax administrations responsible for applying it, and thirdly, that the better operation resulting from cooperation should serve to eradicate fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the first idea, that is, that the taxation systems should function properly, with this programme it is not a question of taking a step further in terms of tax harmonisation – as the Commission and, explicitly, the Council have stated – although I would have liked to have seen a little more ambition, a more decisive step in the process of Community harmonisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, cooperation is an idea that is repeated in all the Commission’s documents. Administrative cooperation was mentioned in the 1987 proposals to move towards VAT at source and the 1996 programme, the new 2000 VAT strategy, the Monti code for reform of direct taxes etc all have the same objective. ‘Cooperation’ is a magic word, a mantra which is repeated, and I would like to see it become more of a reality than it is at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">I could not agree more with these three objectives, but I must make a few comments on the specific objectives in relation to VAT and direct taxes.</p>
<p class="contents">At first reading we presented certain amendments that we have not wanted to reproduce at second reading, in honour of the Commissioner. At the moment the urgent thing is that this programme be approved so that it is in force on 1 January 2003 – otherwise it would expire – and we have had to sacrifice certain legitimate aspirations that, nevertheless, I would like to mention now, since we will reproduce them at a later date.</p>
<p class="contents">The Fiscalis 2007 programme, in relation to VAT, states that it is good to know how VAT works, and this enthusiasm for knowledge, cooperation and coordination sits well with the four objectives set in the VAT strategy for 2003: to simplify, modernise and apply the tax in the most uniform possible way and to increase cooperation between the different administrations.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, Commissioner, I regret that this programme has not been used to take a further step forward in the process of transition towards VAT at source. All the Commission’s documents repeat ad nauseam that the internal market will only function well – or function better, if you prefer – with VAT at source. We are told that if we are not making progress towards VAT at source it is because the Member States do not have faith in the compensation system and the system for reallocating resources, which was initially based on the declarations of taxpayers and then on statistical data, but which has never satisfied the Member States. We should have moved forward with this programme in order to become aware of the information and the framework which, as well as making compensation possible, would also have made the desired transition to VAT at source possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor in the field of direct taxes has the opportunity been taken – as the amendment we have not wanted to repeat says – to strengthen the relationship between taxation policy and other Community policies. It is well known that taxation policy is instrumental in terms of these other policies. I will give just three examples: the Commissioner is well aware that, in the financial services action plan, it was said that there had to be parallel progress in the liberalisation of the sector, in the monitoring and control rules – which are so well known now following the Enron case – and in the harmonisation of indirect taxes, so that the liberalisation should not lead to a centralisation of financial activities in climates and countries which are most favourable from a tax point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to competition rules, there is a clear relationship – above all in relation to State aid – with taxation policy. The code of good conduct, which forms part of the Monti package, referred to the fiscal distortions that could alter the functioning of the internal market. Sustainable development – and we have held a debate on this issue – is closely linked to energy taxes. Our amendment therefore recommended that this programme of exchange of information, knowledge and training be used to make better knowledge between taxation policy and other Union policies possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has not taken advantage of this journey to make progress on knowledge of the information which would have made the transition to VAT at source possible, which continues to be a paradise lost which we all want to reach, and has not taken the opportunity to promote knowledge and the interrelationship between taxation policy and other Community policies which it intends to serve.</p>
<p class="contents">I would insist, however, that the broad objectives of the programme seem to me to be good ones: to understand the operation of the taxation systems and to cooperate between administrations in order to eradicate fraud. I think it is right that this programme should be implemented as soon as possible and therefore, Commissioner, we are giving you a vote of confidence by not reproducing the amendments we presented at first reading, in order to prevent a conciliation procedure and so that this programme – which I am sure the Commissioner will administrate very well – can be implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I reserve the right to raise other objectives on other occasions, but I believe that at this time prudence and urgency are more important than the value and the improvement of the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I wish you good luck in implementing it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to express our appreciation of the fact that Mr García—Margallo y Marfil has decided not to retable the amendments which played a role in the first reading of this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I have listened with great interest to what Mr García—Margallo y Marfil has just said. Many of the matters that he discussed are important but, at the present time, the Fiscalis programme is more restricted than he would have liked. However, it is important that the programme should be adopted before the expiry of the current Fiscalis programme, which ends on the 31 December of this year. I am therefore very pleased that this proposal has secured the support of the European Parliament at second reading. I would therefore like to welcome, in particular, the positive contribution of the rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mr García—Margallo y Marfil.</p>
<p class="contents">As you may be aware from the Commission's communication to Parliament on the Council's common position, the Commission has expressed its satisfaction that the Council endorsed the general approach adopted in its original proposal. The Commission has noted that the Council has supported the continuation of the actions currently carried out under the existing Fiscalis programme. In particular, the Commission has welcomed the Council's support for extending these actions to the area of direct taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the communication regretted the reduction in budget from the Commission's original proposal of EUR 56 million to EUR 44 million. I am satisfied that an agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission has been possible, so that the new programme may be adopted shortly. For that support, I would like to thank Members of Parliament and, in particular, as I said, Mr García—Margallo y Marfil. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would particularly like to welcome and draw attention to the statement in the common position. As the rapporteur has already mentioned, it points out that this is not a political programme, but one designed to enhance administrative cooperation between Member States' tax officials. It is important that we are clear about this objective. We are talking here about improving administration, and not in any way about tax harmonisation.</p>
<p class="contents">When it was first proposed that the extension of the programme was going to be aimed at direct taxation, there was a lot of concern, particularly in the UK, that this might lead to measures to introduce harmonisation of direct taxes. We therefore welcome the fact that the common position clearly states this will not happen.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may speak on behalf of the UK once again, we particularly welcome this because we have been among the most active users of the Fiscalis programme over the last few years. We think it is very valuable, so I would certainly be concerned if anything happened to detract from the programme and make it more difficult for certain Member States to take part in it.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme has much to offer. It has introduced exchanges of officials; it has introduced seminars on tax issues of common interest; it has provided multilateral control exercises, it has developed professional training, such as audit skills; it has improved language training and it has maintained and developed communication and information exchange systems. That is all very good stuff and to be welcomed, continued and improved upon. What we are always trying to do in these sort of situations is improve the way that the systems work and get things to work better. Certainly, that has been one of the achievements of the Fiscalis programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, it is to be regretted, as the Commissioner said, that we are seeing a cut in the budget. All we can hope is that the budget, as it now stands, will be adequate to take the programme forward. So, on the whole, I welcome the common position and the fact that it looks as if we are going to be able to achieve an agreement and get the programme extended. I also welcome the fact that we are very clear now that this is not about tax harmonisation in any way, but about administrative systems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Santos (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, the absence of an institutional agreement would lead to a delicate situation as the rapporteur has already acknowledged, given the urgency of adopting a new Fiscalis framework that is operational on 1 January 2003. It is a shame, however, that the Council’s agreement with the positions adopted by Parliament has been established only for a minimum period. It is significant, incidentally, that whilst acknowledging that the aim of the Fiscalis programme is not to harmonise tax legislation, the Commission has welcomed the fact that a statement to this effect has been included in the minutes. Even though it may be acceptable to classify the Fiscalis programme as a mere tool for strengthening administrative cooperation, the European Parliament will nevertheless have to concern itself with the political effects of implementing this type of programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it is true that tax evasion and fraud have a national dimension specific to each country, they also and increasingly have a supranational dimension rooted in the use of sophisticated techniques and schemes. At a particularly delicate time for the Union’s public finances, these factors cannot be ignored and much less can we fail to take advantage of the opportunities arising in order to change and improve the tax situation. It should be added that the EU is on the threshold of an historic round of enlargement, which means that, with the entry of new countries and different tax policies, new and hitherto unseen problems will also arise.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the new programme extends the scope of the programme to cover not only direct taxation, but also the candidate countries. Improving the functioning of tax systems in the internal market is, in itself, a praiseworthy objective, but combating tax fraud and evasion as well as launching bases with a minimum degree of harmonisation are also opportunities that should not be wasted. I therefore regret the fact that the Commission has invoked Article 95 of the Treaty with regard to this matter, and has not dared to invoke Article 93. With the reserves that have been created and bearing in mind the need for the new programme to get off the ground, I support the rapporteur’s recommendation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
