<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gallagher (UEN), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – The protocol of the fisheries agreement between the Union and Equatorial Guinea expired at the end of last June. It was therefore decided to extend the protocol by one year and a new protocol was initialled by both parties on 16 June 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">This new protocol fixes the technical and financial conditions governing the fishing activities of Community vessels in the waters of Equatorial Guinea during the period 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001. The protocol concerns tuna only. It is important as it will ensure the continuity of Community tuna activities in the Gulf of Guinea. There has been an uptake of licences by French, Spanish, Portuguese and one Italian vessel.</p>
<p class="contents">The current proposal is a result of problems which transpired during the negotiations for the conclusion of a new protocol. The delegation from Equatorial Guinea encountered several difficulties in attending meetings with the Commission. Although these problems have now been resolved, there was not sufficient time for substantial negotiations to be undertaken. The current proposal, which I support, will ensure continuity while negotiations for a new protocol are carried out in the course of this year. The current agreement provides little in the way of serious targeted measures and contains no provisions to ensure their transparent implementation or any assessment of the result. A project aimed at setting up a proper system for fisheries management in Guinea must be embarked upon, so as to ensure that Atlantic yellow fin tuna and big-eye tuna stocks are not increasingly over-exploited.</p>
<p class="contents">An explicit reference to the application of ICAT rules should be included in the text of the next protocol. I support the Commission’s approach that in future negotiations with third countries, there should be a high percentage of special measures. This should also be the case with Equatorial Guinea. As rapporteur, I can support the proposed extension of the protocol for one year. I would stress the need for greater efforts to ensure that any new protocol is subject to a proper control system and that there is adequate transparency in the operation of the agreement. I would urge the Commission to bear this in mind during the forthcoming negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">The three amendments which I have tabled are consistent with the points I have just raised and they are also consistent with the traditional approach of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like in conclusion to point out that the Council had already adopted this proposal last Monday. Of course, this is nothing new. It happens on a regular basis and we all have an opportunity to make it very clear to the Commission in this debate that we do not accept this. Of course, it has happened time and time again and we must do something to try and control this. This is something that all of us on the Fisheries Committee regret. It poses the question as to whether the work carried out in the committee and today’s debate have been a total waste of time. I would hope not but I would sincerely hope that the Commission and the Council will take on-board the recommendations contained in my report before adopting a more permanent protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I would like to take the opportunity to pay tribute and thank the secretariat of the Fisheries Committee for their assistance and also the secretariat in my own group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This protocol guarantees three things of enormous importance: the continuation of the supply of fish and Community employment; the safeguard which is always offered to a fishing region by the presence of fleets which, like the European fleet, are subject to regulations and responsibilities in relation to the control and management of activities, and, naturally, the Community contributions to improving the local fishing sector, contributions which are specifically laid out here.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore ask that you support the three amendments which have been presented by the rapporteur and the Committee on Fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we do not feel able to vote in favour of Amendment No 4, which insists that the whole cost of the agreement be financed by the shipowners. Although this is a traditional demand by a political group in this House which has always been rejected, to propose it when another more than controversial protocol has just been concluded, in which the shipowners involved not only do not pay the 25% which is paid in this case, but pay absolutely nothing, is particularly offensive.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in view of the agreements concluded with the countries of the North, it is incomprehensible to read in the explanatory statement that there is a lack of transparency in the agreement with Equatorial Guinea. To begin with, in this protocol, all the items, including those on cooperation with local fishing, are not only itemised, but are set out to the last penny, something which does not happen in other agreements, where any differentiation between what is financial compensation and what is development aid is non-existent. We must put an end then to attempts to create more obstacles for certain agreements, which, compared to others, are exemplary in terms of transparency and details, something which the Council agrees with, having called for greater equality of treatment since 1997.</p>
<p class="contents">While we are on the subject of agreements, I would like to end by mentioning the Commission’s working programme for this year, whose timetable for the renewal of protocols is incomprehensible. By way of example, the negotiation with Cape Verde, which has been pending since November of last year, does not even appear in the Commission’s timetable. And in the majority of cases, the mandates for negotiation that have been planned are contingent on the agreement being concluded, as in the flagrant example of Gabon, an agreement which expires on 30 March and whose mandate for negotiation is planned for the fourth quarter of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I am sorry to say that the least the Commission can do is keep its agenda up to date. Anything less is shameful. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are also pleased that, according to news reports from two weeks ago, an agreement has been reached to renew the aforementioned agreement between the Community and Equatorial Guinea for three years. This is a modest agreement, both in terms of fishing opportunities and in terms of financial compensation – since 1994 it has been restricted to tuna-fishing ships – but it is no less important for that.</p>
<p class="contents">The previous protocol contained a financial contribution for grants and aid for units for monitoring fishing grounds and for non-industrial fishing. However, we agree with Mr Gallagher and we share his concern that little or nothing has been done on these inspection and monitoring tasks, so much so that what concerns us most about fishing relations with Equatorial Guinea is that the country may become a flag of convenience as a result of this lack of control, which has already led to sanctions from the ICCAT.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must call on the Government of Equatorial Guinea to act in accordance with the Convention on Maritime Law and with international law. We call on the Commission to provide more information on these aspects and to act more diligently in dealing with the authorities of that country so that it may adapt its practices to international law and to the recommendations of the ICCAT. The Member States should also apply these principles in their relations with that country as well as within ACP fora.</p>
<p class="contents">The sector too often feels abandoned as a result of the lack of a joint policy. Ladies and gentlemen, a single musician cannot perform a symphony. As well as a whole orchestra reading the same score, a conductor is required, and the Commission must show that it has the will to act as the conductor.</p>
<p class="contents">And while the Commissioner is present and given that six months after the expiry of the agreement, negotiations with Cape Verde have ground to a halt, could he tell me if this deadlock is caused, as the press says, by differences on fishing opportunities and financial compensation, or by the Government of Cape Verde’s unwillingness to allow the Community to tell it what to do with that funding? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have one specific question for Commissioner Fischler. The agreement with Equatorial Guinea concerns tuna, but Equatorial Guinea is a well-known flag of convenience country. Members of ICAT, including the EU, have agreed to prohibit the importation of big-eye and blue fin tuna from Equatorial Guinea. I presume that negotiations are already proceeding for the next agreement, as this one expires in June. Could the EU not use its influence to encourage Equatorial Guinea to cease allowing vessels to use its flag to fish illegally. The EU is concerned about the growing use of flags of convenience. This would seem to be a very good opportunity to get one state at least to be more cooperative with international legal norms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To speak of tuna in the North Atlantic, however, necessarily requires us also to take account of the situation in other regions, such as the autonomous region of the Azores, for example, where in 2000, we have just experienced a second year with almost no tuna catches at all. Our fishing fleet, which comprises around fifty vessels, has been all but grounded for the last two years.</p>
<p class="contents">Given these circumstances, we must wonder whether some types of fishing, such as purse seining, may be threatening the sustainability of tuna stocks in the North Atlantic. On this issue, I would like to know whether the Commission has already conducted any research into offsetting the consequences of this type of fishing. Secondly, we would also like to know whether the Commission is aware of the crisis spreading throughout the tuna fishing industry in the Azores and Madeira and whether he intends to adopt any measures to combat this. To conclude, I should also like to highlight the fact that there are tuna fishing methods, such as those using lines and poles, as practised in all of the Micronesian islands, that pose no threat to dolphins and turtles as other, more aggressive methods and techniques do. I should therefore like to know whether the Commission would be prepared to take this fact into consideration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fischler,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Gallagher, for his report and for the support which he has given our proposal. Everyone who referred to the excellent fisheries relations which we have with Equatorial Guinea was quite right. These relations go back to 1984, when we concluded a framework agreement which is, in fact, a very important agreement for the Community because it opens up tuna fishing to our fleet in the Gulf of Guinea. The previous protocol to this agreement expired on 30 June last year. However, negotiations on a new protocol initially broke down, which is why we agreed with Equatorial Guinea that the old protocol should be extended by a year.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1 July last year, the provisions of the protocol have applied provisionally, as it were, without any change to fishing possibilities or financial compensation. In the meantime, thank God, we have managed – at the beginning of this month – to sign a new protocol for the next three years. The text of the protocol is currently going through Commission channels and will then be submitted to Parliament and the Council for approval.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the proposed amendments are concerned, I can accept the first two in principle. Nonetheless, I feel that they do not belong in the text of the regulation, as the forwarding of the required reports and information to Parliament is already regulated under the framework agreement signed by our two institutions on 5 July 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission is unable to accept Amendment No 3 because it would contradict the principle applied hitherto, that fisheries protocols are annexes to the framework agreement and that no special authorisation is therefore needed from the Council in order to negotiate an extension. It goes without saying that the Commission always abides by the Council's guidelines during negotiations as, of course, it did in the present case.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the question raised in connection with Cape Verde. I do not share the view that there should be any special problem here, because our side and, more importantly, the main Member State affected, rejected what was on offer. What Cape Verde had in mind was for us to have to land all catches on the Cape Verde Islands. However as, for various reasons, there is no possibility for exporting from Cape Verde to the Union, it would have made little sense, because then we would have had no access whatsoever to this fish.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot agree with the amendment by Mrs Attwooll and Mr Busk proposing that the shipowners rather than the Community should bear the cost of the agreement with Equatorial Guinea. If for no other reason than because this is not in keeping with the negotiating guidelines adopted by the Council back in 1980. The guidelines stipulate that the cost must be borne by the Community and the shipowners jointly, with the shipowners' contribution taking the form of licence fees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Greens are voting against this agreement, as we do with all third-country agreements. We are not happy, as you said in your introduction, in relation to the agreement with Equatorial Guinea.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is in relation to flags of convenience. Equatorial Guinea is notorious in relation to that and you did not address the question. Maybe it is too late tonight, but we would like an answer because you are negotiating, despite the fact that there is an agreement to ban tuna imports and this agreement is very much related to that. We need a reply. Maybe it is too late tonight, but it is important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
