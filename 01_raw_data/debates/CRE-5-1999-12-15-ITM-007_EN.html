The six words are: muren [der faldt i Berlin] (the Wall which came down in Berlin), markedet (the market), mainstreaming (mainstreaming), magt (power), mæslinger (measles) and menneskerettigheder (human rights). These words are used in the following question: did the fact that the Wall came down, that the market took over and that we, as a result, seriously accepted the word mainstreaming in Beijing, mean that men stepped – if not a little into the background – then at least a bit to the side, so surrendering a little power and being willing to take care of the children when they have the measles? Does it also therefore mean that human rights are respected so that women, like everyone else, are not discriminated against and exposed to violence? The answer is no. </p>
<p class="contents">I would call attention to this situation because women such as ourselves in the rich countries of the world, that is to say also in the EU, should always remember that those who make the decisions and so who also decide the fate of our sisters in the developing countries, in Kosovo, in the Balkans etc., continue to be men and that there is therefore a risk of the results of our work and of the programmes as a whole not representing women’s wishes and needs in a balanced way. We still need a discussion about equality and change in the EU but, above all, there must be active efforts in respect of the developing countries and in connection with aid to Kosovo, the Balkans etc. to ensure that women are part of the process and are also involved in development and reconstruction. The stability pact, which has a shortage of women in its leadership and in which women generally are not involved, shows that there is still a lot to be done. There is a great need for the men and women in the European Parliament to support their fellow Members of the European Parliament, together with the NGOs, in their endeavours to become involved at all levels of the societies concerned. </p>
<p class="contents">I would end by thanking both the Commissioner, for a speech which demonstrated her commitment, and the President-in-Office of the Council.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The "Beijing plus five" Conference is of major importance and the European Union has to be very well prepared to take part in the most effective way possible if it is going to have the impact that we want. As a Parliament, we owe that to all women in the European Union and beyond – in fact throughout the world – in view of all the commitments that were made before Beijing and following it.</p>
<p class="contents">We need very clear guarantees that we, as Members of Parliament, will be fully involved and be taken seriously in the planning of the pre-conference before the New York meeting. As Members of Parliament we are the direct democratic link with the people of the European Union, and the Committee on Women's Rights itself is a direct link with many women's organisations and representatives. As was said earlier, the preparations for Seattle were a good example of the way this could be done, and I hope we will achieve this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In view of this fact, this Beijing Action Platform was created. Here in the European Community too, it has been said that the overarching goal is to promote equality between the sexes in all political programmes and areas of policy. </p>
<p class="contents">Scarcely a year ago, we were discussing a report monitoring how the concept of gender mainstreaming had been implemented specifically in the institutions of the EU. We noted on that occasion that the Beijing Action Platform says that a series of measures must be taken which ought to lead to fundamental changes. We ascertained in February that this had not happened. It was noted that there must be clearly defined goals and mechanisms of accountability, but we do not have those either. It was noted that women ought to be actively engaged in applying and following up the Action Platform. Nor is that happening, either. It was observed that a proper application of the Platform would also demand changes to the inner dynamics of institutions and organisations, including to such values, forms of behaviour, rules and routines of theirs which damage the position of women. </p>
<p class="contents">When we in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities then looked at this issue, we saw that a lot of small steps forward had been taken in all the institutions of the European Union and that none of these had changed anything overall. Now we are to see how the Beijing Action Platform has been implemented. Unfortunately, the European Union is not going to be able to demonstrate any major positive successes, not even if we were to send a delegation of Members of the European Parliament. What we are going to do is to go to the conference and affirm what was already affirmed in 1995 in Beijing. I think that is incredibly sad. We from this Chamber urged the Commission at that time to give priority to overhauling all its advisory and decision-making structures, so as to obtain a proper balance between women and men, and to encourage the Member States to implement fully the Council’s recommendation of 2 December 1996 to the effect that there should be a proper balance between women and men in the decision-making process. Obviously, this exhortation still stands. </p>
<p class="contents">We also urge the Commission to pursue, and to work more intensively on, its strategy aimed at achieving a proper balance between women and men on the staff. Obviously, this exhortation too still stands. We urged the EU’s institutions to submit plans for achieving a situation in which equality was practised and pursued in their own particular activities. This is also a demand from this Chamber which still holds. </p>
<p class="contents">To put it briefly, we have not taken more than the tiniest step forward. This is something we regret but, if we are now to go to New York, we hope that we shall be able to obtain good advice from people there – that is to say, sisters from other countries – and see if anything positive has happened anywhere else.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The four themes were violence, economics, decision making and institutional mechanisms, and this means that one of the most important themes, namely health, will only be discussed at the EU’s Conference. I therefore hope that, in its preparations for the conference, the Commission will focus strongly upon this subject, and especially upon the issue of reproductive health. </p>
<p class="contents">In the Beijing Action Platform, women’s health was singled out as an area in which there is cause for critical concern. Reproductive health was linked with human rights, while it was stated clearly that, for women, human rights include their right to have control over, and freely and responsibly make decisions about matters related to their sexuality, that is to say to their sexual and reproductive health, too. The statement from Beijing goes further than that which was employed in Cairo in connection with reproductive rights. There is a risk, moreover, that this hard-won victory may be jeopardised in the course of the “Beijing plus five” process, even if the pre-conference planning committee has given an assurance that the Beijing Action Platform is not open to renegotiation. We in the EU ought to be involved in ensuring that this is in fact the case. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament’s representative group concerned with reproductive health has repeatedly called attention to the connections that exist between the fight against poverty, women’s equality and reproductive health. We have emphasised that reproductive health is in fact a prerequisite for the fight against poverty and is to be conceived holistically. It is also necessary to tackle the question of HIV/Aids. The proportion of HIV-infected women and, therefore, of the number of cases of the virus being passed from mother to child are steadily increasing. </p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that the Commission can today assure me that reproductive health will be given a prominent place at the EU’s Conference and that, in one way or another, the European Parliament will be able to participate in the New York Conference, just as it did in the arrangements for the WTO negotiations where we were in fact represented.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Never before did so many countries, NGOs and journalists take part in a UN Conference. The Beijing Declaration and the Beijing Action Platform were adopted by 192 government delegations. The Beijing Action Platform serves as a major catalyst worldwide and in all areas policies have been tightened up, reviewed and renewed. Despite this, the problems have not yet been solved and the emancipation policy has not reached completion. </p>
<p class="contents">In the ’70s, the European Community and the United Nations placed the topic of ‘women’ on the map for national governments. Attention has now waned. It is therefore up to Europe to generate renewed interest. I hope that we can accelerate implementation with the same energy and power which typified Beijing at the Beijing plus five Conference in June 2000 in New York. I strongly urge the EU to maintain the momentum and keep the interests of women at heart internationally. </p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I would like to raise the following questions, Madam President. Firstly, the PPE deems the importance of NGOs and of women’s movements extremely high. They carry a special significance and strength by their activities at grass-roots level. Decisions do not take effect automatically. There are always inspectors required to ensure that decisions are transposed into policy and that policy is adopted. NGOs play a key role in the mobilisation of the political will to transpose policy. In most countries, the national emancipation support networks are also formed by the government. Hence my question: how does the Commission see the role of NGOs, including women’s movements, and the concerted action between these and the national government networks? </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, a European preparatory meeting had been planned for December 1999. This has now been postponed to February 2000. There is a great deal of confusion about this at the moment. The confusion which pervaded the previous preparatory conference should be avoided. Hence my second question: could the Commission indicate which NGOs will be invited and what will be expected from them? </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is an ECE Conference in Geneva in January. The results of Beijing will once again be tabled there. Could the Commission give an indication as to what the EU’s input will be in this ECE Conference in relation to the Commission’s opinion of how much we have achieved, what hurdles still need to be overcome and what action is required? </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, my fourth question concerns one of the results of Beijing that agreements have been reached regarding <span class="italic">gender mainstreaming</span>. This means the inclusion of emancipation objectives and the implementation thereof in regular policy. My question is: can the Commission indicate what it intends to do to ‘mainstream’ the results of Beijing and those of New York in the fullness of time, in European policy? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Five years on, we need to take stock, evaluate any progress or reversals which have been made in the twelve areas of action, take any corrective action needed and lay down policies which will allow us to achieve the objectives established in Beijing.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, or rather the European Parliament, must not just be present during this procedure; it must make a decisive contribution, both to the evaluation of the five years of action and to future plans. It is a fact that, in comparison with other parts of the world, such as Afghanistan and Kuwait, where millions of women are still deprived of fundamental human rights, women in Europe lead a privileged existence. It is true that a great deal of progress has been made in all areas in the Union and, if we look back at our achievements during the 20th century, we should perhaps be celebrating the huge victories which women have achieved. To mention just one of the many victories: education, where women surpass men, both in numbers and in achievement, at almost every university in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament and the Union have made a decisive contribution in promoting equal opportunities. The application of the Amsterdam Treaty, action programmes and mainstreaming have strengthened European policy significantly. However, despite the progress made, serious problems of inequality and discrimination against women still need to be resolved: higher unemployment, violence, sexual exploitation and, above all, the exclusion of women from the centres of policy and decision making.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the forthcoming UN Conference in New York, we need to speed up the European Union’s preparations if we really want to make a fundamental contribution to pre-conference planning and to the conference itself which is commensurate with the prestige of the Union. I was pleased to hear the Commissioner and the Presidency representative this morning express their intention and commitment with regard to the organisation of the European conference and participation in the pre-conference planning for the Beijing plus five Conference in New York. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not think that this accords at all with the good image we had of the conference on equality held in Finland under Finland’s Presidency and under the leadership of my party colleague, Eva Biaudet. What has happened to the good mood that was created then?</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">It sounds, rather, as if, in the course of this discussion, we ought to use the image of a bicycle. The EU is like a bicycle which has to be kept moving all the time. If it is not moving, it does not go forwards. I have the feeling that this image could also be used for the work following the Beijing Conference. Not much has happened, and it is important that we should not be satisfied with the situation but instead establish goals for the future. What do we want to have achieved by the year 2005? What do we want our goal to be now? We are not satisfied with what has happened in our Member States. We are not satisfied with what has happened at EU level. We are not satisfied with what has happened within the UN. We must also infuse other UN organisations and other UN conferences with significantly more in the way of a perspective of equality. I was very pleased indeed that the applicant countries have also been invited to the conference which the Commissioner was talking about. </p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we are also dissatisfied with how our own Parliament looks from the perspective of equality. Look, for example, at the numbers of Vice-Presidents<span class="italic"> </span>and Presidents. The representation of women is not at all adequate.</p>
<p class="contents">Where the applicant countries are concerned, there is an incredible amount to be done. Communism betrayed equality, and women in the applicant countries do not believe empty words about working towards equality. In many ways, the process has to be completely restarted in those countries. Poverty has especially affected women in the applicant countries. One frightening statistic we have heard is that, before the fall of communism, there were 13 million people in Eastern and Central Europe living below the poverty line. Today there are 120 million.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She joins the protests made by Mrs Theorin this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the European Commission feels responsible for following up the Beijing Conference. Yet we need precision in order to ensure effectiveness. The same applies to the situation of women today, as much in terms of equality – education, citizenship and employment – as freedom – habeas corpus, the fight against violence and the trading of women.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore be precise. In order for this European meeting to be successful and not just the scene of some fine words, the following conditions must be met. A European conference may be held in parallel with a UN meeting if, and only if, this works to produce an internal European policy and demonstrates a common determination within the UN dynamic.</p>
<p class="contents">The Finnish Presidency must be thanked for having identified nine indicators for assessing the access of women to decision making. Would it not be judicious to generalise these quantitative methods? Gender-based statistics must be provided in all areas. Additional indicators must also be identified to measure the situations of inequality in fields other than politics.</p>
<p class="contents">Could we not also comprehensively assess the means which Europe, as such, has had for several decades to develop equal opportunities, particularly in terms of compatibility between family and professional life, and to combat all violence against women? Without any common indicators, no serious assessment can be made of the measures taken by the Member States. The conference in February 2000 could have this specific and formative policy as its objective.</p>
<p class="contents">The future enlargement of Europe, confirmed by the Helsinki conclusions, poses the problem of the applicant States respecting the requirements of developing equal opportunities and promoting women’s freedom. In these countries as elsewhere, the role of the NGOs, particularly since Beijing, has become indisputable. The Commission must be a capable participant in the work undertaken by these associations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to briefly outline three milestones. </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the right to sexual self-determination has been recognised as an inherent component of the human rights of women. Secondly, it has been established that the argument of cultural identity cannot justify the on-going suppression of women. Thirdly, it has been stated that women’s policy is not about fancy things for women and a place in the sun, rather the gender dimension should be added to all policy-making decisions. </p>
<p class="contents">These achievements, most of which I have listed, must be translated into concrete action. National governments carry most responsibility here and their commitment must be assessed. But hang on. What about the European Union? How is the common position on the follow-up to the World Conference on Women determined? How can the European Parliament carry out its task in this respect? </p>
<p class="contents">The conference which the European Commission will organise next February can only help form opinion, it cannot determine policy. Under the rules of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, under which, indeed, the Member States coordinate their action in international organisations, initiative and power of decision lie entirely with the Council, in practice a small group of specialist officials who have the natural tendency to focus on their own mutual problems. I dare say this because I belonged to such a set-up myself for years, namely during the Beijing period. </p>
<p class="contents">Such bodies move in the twilight zone of secret diplomacy. Openness and political responsibility, however, should be top of the agenda. This is why I ask the Presidency, by referring to Article 32 of the Treaty on European Union, to brief Parliament as fully as possible, but mainly also to consult Parliament in time. “In time” in this case means in any event before the so-called “preparatory conference”, to be held between 3 and 17 March in New York, because we are probably too late already for the ECE Conference in January. The Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities of this Parliament has the explicit responsibility to monitor the follow-up and implementation of international agreements, such as the Beijing Action Platform. This Committee cannot wait to give its input. It would preferably do this on the basis of tangible, current information and in a constructive dialogue with the Council and the Commission. Talking to a brick wall is, after all, not very productive. This is why I somewhat regret that, because of the strange set-up of this debate, we are having to make do without the Finnish Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been clear-sighted, and we have shown where the problems lie. There is a clear consensus between the Commissioner, who is dealing with these questions, and Parliament’s Committee on Equality. The Commissioner has emphasised Parliament’s position and Parliament’s important role and said that the action plans are inadequate, that these must be developed further and that a clear political stance is required. I believe we should see this as being very important indeed. </p>
<p class="contents">May I just warn against the Commission and the Council confining themselves to just four areas when they now produce the concrete programme following the Beijing Conference. I say this after 20 years’ experience of the United Nations. As soon as you begin to unpick any of the twelve points we laid down in Beijing, you have also begun to dismember the whole of the Beijing document. It is therefore incredibly important that the EU should have a very clear policy and that all twelve areas of policy carry due weight. It is all twelve areas which have to be established and for which action plans have to be prepared, and not merely three of these. Otherwise, the whole of our Beijing document might be forfeited. </p>
<p class="contents">I want to say as well that we have also quite rightly demanded that it should be possible for the Committee on Equality and the women in Parliament to also be present at the conference which is to take place in New York in June. Just as representatives from Parliament participated in the WTO Conference, the women in Parliament ought also to be involved in this one. </p>
<p class="contents">Allow me finally to turn to the men here. Do not see this as being something especially for the women. Do not look askance and with irritation at the fact that women are raising those problems which, right around the world, are problems faced by women. See it as an important task for you, as our male colleagues here in Parliament and as our male colleagues in the Commission, to accept your responsibility and ensure that these questions are raised to such a high level that they also become real issues in the national parliaments and the national governments and in the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no doubt that the Beijing Conference continues to have a widespread effect, as we see every year. I think that, when we make our first evaluation in June, apart from the negative conclusions which we will draw on the basis of statistics, numbers and data on the situation of women at worldwide level, we shall also draw some positive conclusions on several developments worldwide.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall try to reply specifically to all the questions which have been asked. Following the Beijing platform and the commitment of the 189 countries to the platform, there have been three levels of action as far as our region, the European Union, is concerned: first, at Member State level, secondly, in the form of political strategy at European Union level and, thirdly, at the level of European Union policy vis-à-vis developing countries. Conclusions have already been drawn at all three levels and the planning will shortly be presented. All three are particularly important. However, I wish to stress, as certain speakers have said, that the commitments to the Beijing platform are mainly binding on the Member States, they are mainly binding on governments, with the European Union coming in at a second level with a horizontal strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">What are we doing and what procedures have been programmed? We have three events on the agenda before the conference in June: the Economic Commission for Europe, which will meet in January, the European conference on the Beijing issues, which will be held in February, and the meeting of the Women’s Committee of the UN, which will be held in March. We must combine these events in the best possible way if we are to have an efficient presence in June.</p>
<p class="contents">First, as far as the regional conference is concerned, it is most important that we arrive at specific, unanimously accepted results which will be discussed and taken into account at the February meeting of the European conference. Who is attending the European conference in February? First, the European Parliament, of course, then the non-governmental organisations and, as the question was asked, allow me to say here that the women’s movement and non-governmental organisations have played, and continue to play, an exceptionally important role and have acted as a real driving force behind the policies formulated at European level, together of course with various services from the Commission, the Member States and the Presidency. During the preparations – you already know about the committee to which I referred – the twelve areas of interest selected at Beijing will be discussed. As Mrs Theorin pointed out, we are not able at this stage to select four or five areas, given that we are required by the Beijing platform to give equal priority to the twelve areas but we could, of course, focus our attention on the fifth action programme when we discuss the selection of priorities at European level. These twelve individual areas of interest will be examined in the following groups under the general heading of “mainstreaming”: gender issues in development policy, in other words, how sexual equality intervenes in all cooperation agreements between the European Union and developing countries, the involvement of women and human rights. There will be a horizontal and vertical link between these groups and the twelve Beijing areas of interest. The results and the extent to which we agree and take a common European Union position at the June conference is vitally important.</p>
<p class="contents">Since certain parallels have been drawn with Seattle, I should like to remind the House that the institutional framework is not the same, nor does the Commission have the same institutional role in New York and at the Beijing Conference as it did in Seattle. However, provided that the political will is there, nothing prevents the Presidency, the Commission and the European Parliament from collaborating and joining forces during the six months up to June. I, of course, give my word that the Commission will not only collaborate continuously and provide a continuous flow of information but will also accept proposals and studies from the European Parliament up to the very last day. I believe that by June we will be able to find the final formula which, as you know, is not based on a Commission decision or even really on a Council decision, because it is a matter which comes under the auspices of the United Nations Organisation and participation is at national level. However, I repeat that there is the political will and the political conditions are in place for us to proceed jointly, given that we have totally concurring views on numerous matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to make one last comment: movements, political initiatives and campaigns can often play an extremely important role. I would like to single out the last initiative of the Women’s Committee on the strategy against violence. It is interesting how a simple movement, a simple idea can take on huge proportions and catch the public imagination. I think that the European Parliament could act in this area and the Commission is ready and waiting to support such campaigns or initiatives at worldwide level, provided that they relate to the matters to which you have already referred. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
