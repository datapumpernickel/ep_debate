<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Korhola (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FI)</span> Mr President, the European Union’s environmental policy is ambitious and good in several areas. Implementing it successfully is, however, almost impossible without the support of our own citizens. A precondition for obtaining the support of our citizens is that our environmental work is transparent. This is the aim of the proposed directive under discussion today.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Wallström said when the proposal first underwent its first reading over a year ago that if we are to achieve the conditions required for sustainable development, we have to start by making our national environmental policy the centre of attention. Thus Commissioner Wallström is quite correctly linking this directive to the long and vitally, in the literal sense, important process which began in Rio in 1992, ten years ago next week.</p>
<p class="contents">Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development concerns the participation of citizens and the Aarhus Convention is a significant step towards putting that principle into practice. As well as being signed by the Community, the Aarhus Convention has been signed by all fifteen Member States, but the Community has not yet managed to progress to ratification as the existing legislation does not yet comply with the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive being proposed is the first pillar in ratifying the Aarhus Convention. The second pillar concerns public participation and Parliament will be able to start the second reading in the near future, as at the start of tomorrow’s session it will be announced that the Council’s common position has finally been received. This being the case, today I submitted a draft recommendation concerning the second reading of the second pillar to the secretariat of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. The third pillar aiming at ratifying the Aarhus Convention concerns access to justice and a proposal regarding this is currently being prepared by the Commission. In addition, the rules of the Union’s institutions must also be checked to ensure they conform to the Aarhus Convention. The Commission has promised that during June it will provide information on actions that are still required and a more precise timetable for these. It is hoped that the Commission will be able to confirm this today.</p>
<p class="contents">When I was drafting the recommendation for a second reading to be discussed today, I took into account the fact that in the first reading Parliament was exceptionally unanimous and accepted all the amendments proposed. Thus the recommendation for second reading will in practice repeat everything that Parliament accepted on the first reading which has not yet been included in the Council’s common position.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has also made a number of important proposals worthy of support, among which I would especially mention the Council’s definition of a public authority, which is an improved adaptation of the wording proposed by Parliament, as well as the Council’s adaptation of the point concerning access to justice. The Council also proposes that historical documents, in other words documents received or created before the directive has entered into force be made electronically available, for example on the Internet at the discretion of the authority in question. I also recommend that this should be approved.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has not, however, taken into account Parliament’s proposal on reducing the time-limit within which authorities must respond from one month to two weeks. The recommendation includes a compromise proposal, which has been copied from an act based on Article 255 of the Treaty of Rome, on access to information held by the Union’s institutions, which was accepted after the first reading of this directive proposal. As such, the compromise proposes that a response should be given within 15 working days, that is, at least three weeks, which can be doubled where there is a justification.</p>
<p class="contents">After the first reading, our British colleagues in the main put forward a concern about the fate of the sale of commercial information by authorities. I am convinced that weather services and map information do not even fall within the scope of this directive and even if they did, they would be protected in a carefully considered list of exceptions. However, having heard about this concern, the committee decided to remove part of item 2 of the article that deals with charging. In my opinion this was a rushed gesture, and I did not see it as the best way of resolving the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">To rectify this situation, the Greens, the Liberals and the Left Group have jointly tabled Amendment No 48 to emphasise the general principle that the information should be free of charge. There is nothing wrong with the amendment in itself. I support it, but in my view the original amendment rejected by the committee was better, as this new version is unlikely to delight the British either.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive on public access to environmental information is intended to be implemented before the end of the current year. The second reading of the second pillar of the Aarhus Convention will probably be ready before Parliament’s summer recess and it is likely that we will receive information from the Commission on the timetable for the third pillar and other necessary action within the same time frame. The Aarhus Convention has thus progressed many steps towards ratification and implementation in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is very important to emphasise that this directive does not grant a concession. It lays down practical arrangements for the exercise of a right which belongs to the citizens. So amendments, such as Nos 1, 5 and 10 which stress the existence of this right, are very important.</p>
<p class="contents">Another aspect of the Committee's second reading report which should be stressed is the need to make sure that the dissemination of environmental information keeps up with modern means of communication technology. That is an important aspect that we would like to persuade the Council to take on board. The stress that is put on improving the quality of the information made available so that it is comprehensible, accurate and comparable is also very valuable. There is no point in having access to information if it is too complex or too opaque to be comprehensible to the layman – it renders such access meaningless.</p>
<p class="contents">We also very much welcome the fact that the rapporteur seeks to ensure that any restriction on the right of information should only be allowed in specific, clearly-defined and exceptional cases. Also that there should be a 'harm' test, so that the harm must outweigh the benefits of disclosure if disclosure is to be denied. All these are very important. I welcome Mrs Korhola's acceptance of Amendment No 48 and, although she does not think it is perfect, I am very glad she can accept it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Free access to and the transparency and dissemination of environmental information are a fundamental right of every citizen with an interest in the quality of his or her living and working environment. Accessibility to the environmental statistics kept by public agencies is of crucial importance, not just in improving public awareness but also in safeguarding the trust and democratic involvement of our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">As we saw after the first reading, the Council adopted very few of the amendments to the common position approved by plenary. So we have no choice but to re-table all the amendments on important matters such as exceptions at second reading. We really must, I think, keep exceptions to a minimum, so as to ensure that any interested party can access a broad range of information. Similarly, the fifteen-day deadline by which the administration must respond to a request for environmental information does, I think, give government agencies time enough, while ensuring that interested parties are able to use information promptly and efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point is the charge for supplying information. I think it should be capped at the real cost of reproducing the information, in order to make it as easy as possible for the public to access information and to ensure that no one is discouraged from acquiring environmental information because of the cost. I trust that the European Commission will respond positively to these comments and that we can proceed and ratify the Aarhus Convention as quickly as possible</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I should like on behalf of my political group to give my full backing to the report by our rapporteur, Mrs Korhola, and to congratulate her on a job well done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also think that the rapporteur, Mrs Korhola, is entirely correct in reinstating the majority of amendments from the first reading, as they were adopted unanimously by Parliament. They are also excellent in helping to improve the Commission’s proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Article 7a, on the quality of environmental information, is one of the most important amendments. As has already been said, the person requesting information must be able to rely on the information’s being relevant, up-to-date and exact, as well as on the methods which have been used to produce it and on the forms of analysis employed.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not, however, happy about the decision by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy concerning the cost of what the authority can take out.

This important principle came directly from Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration, which places the citizens at the centre of environmental policy. Without access to environmental information, it is difficult for them to participate, which is why this proposal is so important.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1998, the European Community’s Member States signed the UN/ECE Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters, known as the Århus Convention. This convention is a major step forwards in terms of implementing Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration and continuing the process of openness initiated by Council Directive 90/313/EEC on the freedom of access to information on the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally consider that it is very important that the Community ratify the convention as quickly as possible. Before this can be done, however, Community law must be adapted to the provisions of the convention, and that is also one of the main purposes of this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to the work carried out by the rapporteur – and I should here like to thank Mrs Korhola – and by the European Parliament and the Council, the proposal has been greatly improved in recent months. Most of the European Parliament’s amendments reinstate the amendments not accepted by the Commission at the first reading and designed to strengthen the Commission’s proposal. Although I can understand and respect your desire to maximise the benefit to the public from the proposal, I consider that some of the amendments place Member States under obligations which are unnecessarily heavy and exceed what is required by the Arabs Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">The second amendment lays down in great detail the practical provisions for providing information, while the aim of the proposed directive is to provide a framework for the Member States within which they can adapt the provisions to the circumstances in the respective countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider the Commission’s proposal to be well balanced. It covers the most important commitments under the Århus Convention, and others besides, and gives the Member States sufficient flexibility to be able to implement the legislation effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can accept Amendments Nos 22, 28, 30, 32, 33, 42, 45 and 46 in their entirety. The Commission can partially accept Amendments Nos 1 part 3, 9 part 1, 27 part 3 and 48 part 2. The Commission can accept in principle Amendments Nos 9 part 2, 19 and 27 part 2 following rewording or restructuring. The remaining amendments cannot be accepted by the Commission, namely Amendments Nos 1–6, 7 part 1 and part 2, 8, 10–18, 20, 21, 23–26, 27 part 1, 29, 31, 34–41, 43, 44, 47 and 48 with the exception of part 2. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
