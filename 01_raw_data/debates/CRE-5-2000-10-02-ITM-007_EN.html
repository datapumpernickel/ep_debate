<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solbes,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, the third meeting of the ASEM process will take place in Seoul in three weeks. It is a fortunate coincidence that the meeting is taking place in Korea soon after the historic Korean summit, which opened the way to reconciliation and future reunification. This will clearly have significant positive effects for security, not only regionally but also globally. This meeting will mark the maturing of a process which began four years ago in Bangkok. This process complements our bilateral relations with our ten Asian partners, as well as our relations with ASEAN, and contributes to the process of integration in Asia and in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The ASEM process is built on three pillars: the political, the economic and the cultural. The ASEM process has aided the ASEAN + 3 process, bringing North and South-East Asia even closer together. Its structure of meetings between Ministers for Finance, Economics and Foreign Affairs, as well as the summits, follow the ASEM model. In the Union we also had to, and still have to, learn how to efficiently manage a process which seeks to promote political dialogue in order to deepen the economic relationship between the two regions and increase personal and cultural contacts.</p>
<p class="contents">The process is based on a relationship of equality. By stressing the original idea that this process of dialogue should be developed as a process between equal partners and kept as informal as possible, without an institutionalised secretariat, we have managed, despite certain difficulties, to convince our Asian partners that we wish to have equal relations with them, going beyond any donor-receiver relationship with them or any post-colonial standpoint.</p>
<p class="contents">This approach is especially important in terms of our efforts to consolidate, deepen and broaden the political dialogue. While our Asian partners prefer to deal with questions which unite us, excluding all others, we have argued for a broader agenda, excluding nothing. Our partners have accepted this principle in return for a guarantee that wisdom and common sense will prevail when it comes to selecting the issues for discussion. Human rights are most problematic, of course, together with the rejection of intervention in internal affairs and other arguments which are familiar to us. Nevertheless, the statement by the presidency of the meeting and the framework for cooperation between Asia and Europe will clearly mention this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to add that, within the broader framework of the ASEM process, we are holding a constructive series of seminars on human rights organised jointly with the Asia-Europe Foundation. Security problems, which are of particular importance in the region, will play a considerable role in the process, and it is worth mentioning the publication of a separate declaration on the Korean peninsular as an example of this.</p>
<p class="contents">The leaders will also deal with the fight against cross-border crime, especially in the light of the recent Dover tragedy. The exploitation of illegal immigrants, women and children, particularly in the virulent sex industry, will not only be a subject for debate, but also initiatives will be taken to combat this scourge of our times, which is linked to poverty and insecurity.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of the economy, 1993 was a significant year, since it was the critical moment when our exports to Asia exceeded our exports to the United States. The second ASEM meeting, which took place in London in 1998, successfully overcame the crisis. We supported our Asian partners and we adopted concrete measures, such as the significant commitment on trade and investments which reversed the earlier trend and led to a considerable commercial deficit with our partners. The creation of a trust fund, the establishment of a European financial network of experts and the adoption of two action plans to assist trade and promote investments are other concrete measures which show that Europe is concerned about Asia, not only in the good times but also in times of crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The coming meeting will allow us to assess the results of our efforts and confirm that we have made progress in the pursuit of greater operability and efficiency. Furthermore, the leaders will discuss the implications of the new economy, globalisation, the lessons learnt from the crisis, the creation of a trans-European-Asian superhighway to improve contacts between research institutes, and discuss the influence of the new technologies on economic life, including the measures to deal with the ever-greater knowledge gap.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of the current global situation, the availability of energy supply, including oil, has been added to the agenda. The need for a general, multilateral legal framework for the commercial system, such as the World Trade Organisation, and the need to keep it functioning in the era of globalisation, will also be a key issue in the leaders’ discussions. This is part of our strategy to make progress on the consensus in favour of an immediate start to a new global round.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to fill the cultural vacuum between our two regions. The need to increase awareness, to spread knowledge with a view to stimulating understanding, and eliminating false ideas have been important objectives of the ASEM process since its beginnings. The Asia-Europe Foundation has contributed considerably to this objective. The leaders will therefore decide on other initiatives to increase the exchange of students between the regions, to modernise educational structures, to intensify cooperation in the development of human resources and exchange points of view on recent socio-political events.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, we regret that our Asian partners are still not prepared to consider the creation of a social forum, within the ASEM process, which represents civil society in the same way that the Asia-Europe business forum represents the business community. This proposal originates from the organisers of the forum of the peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">From an organisational and logistical point of view, the Korean Presidency will publish a Presidency statement which will address – together with the problems discussed by the leaders – issues such as the reform of the United Nations, disarmament, arms control, the fight against AIDS etc.</p>
<p class="contents">The final text will reflect the discussions between the leaders, but good work has already been carried out. Therefore, the presidency will update it in accordance with its responsibilities during the meeting. The Seoul declaration on the Korean Peninsula, which I mentioned before, recognises the importance of recent progress and approves the policy of introducing North Korea into the international community with a view to the peaceful unification of the two Koreas.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the 2000 framework for cooperation between Europe and Asia, an updated version of the first one, adopted at the last meeting in London, outlines the objectives and procedures which will govern the ASEM process over the next decade. In contrast to the last version, the importance of human rights and cooperation in safeguarding the environment have been added, to give just two examples. The only outstanding problem is the question of qualification for membership, with regard to which the European partners have so far been opposed to attempts to introduce certain limits which could be interpreted as excluding certain partners from future participation.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, please allow me to stress that the most important characteristic of the ASEM process – in my opinion – is the establishment of a regular dialogue at the highest level by means of six-monthly summits prepared at the periodic meetings of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs, Economics and Finance, not to mention the numerous meetings of high-level officials and experts which also accompany them.</p>
<p class="contents">Dialogue with our Asian partners has become a normal event, which does not depend on economic euphoria or pessimism resulting from a crisis. The ASEM process is a clear expression of the Union’s absolute commitment to our Asian partners, on an equal footing, and does not only deal with economic matters but also with the important political and personal dimension. Given Asia’s importance to Europe, and vice versa, mutual learning and the dissemination of knowledge, the establishment of a network between leaders and peoples will help to put into practice the theme chosen for ASEM III, that is to say, working together for prosperity and stability in the new millennium. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not intended as a reproach, it is simply a statement of fact. This becomes apparent if you go to that part of the world as an EU representative, when you will find, for example, that no one is satisfied with a statement that you are representing the European Union – you will always be asked which Member State you come from. It is a way of judging how important you are. And where the European Union has not achieved its full potential it is also possible that it has not assumed its full responsibility either. That is why the ASEM process is so enormously important.</p>
<p class="contents">I think I can say that the Commission largely has Parliament's support in promoting this process. The Commission can, to a very large extent, count on Parliament's support for its overall approach and for the agenda it has drawn up. So one of the most important things today is to make the European public aware of the ASEM process.</p>
<p class="contents">However, our partners in Asia do not understand that, in practice, we are very inward-looking. The issues that most concern us are the Intergovernmental Conference, enlargement and, when the occasion arises, problems on our political doorstep, such as the Middle East. But they do not understand the fact that we are not fulfilling our potential when it comes to all those issues that are important for global welfare and peace.</p>
<p class="contents">People's expectations of the European Union are enormous. They envisage a strategic European presence in Asia, yet we are certainly not in a position to provide that in the foreseeable future. It is obvious what lies behind this: an awareness of the constant presence of the United States of America and of the growing importance of China. They would like to see Europe providing a counterbalance. We must seize this opportunity and in fact this is a chance for us to win support for our principles there. This is something else that can be achieved through the ASEM process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So it is right that the European and Asian Heads of Government should continue to meet through their informal multiple-theme dialogue, and it is particularly important for them to do that in Seoul this year against the historical new background of the possibility of reunification.</p>
<p class="contents">There is still insufficient interest in mutual understanding between these two regions of the world, although economic and trade policy, and a shared interest in a security partnership, do exist. But these two major regions need to understand each other better and coordinate their affairs so that they can successfully focus on their shared priorities and make some real progress with regard to the reform of the United Nations and the WTO in relation to monetary and financial stability, and also concerning other important issues on the agenda of the International Labour Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The successes of the last two summits in Bangkok and London cannot disguise the fact that the ASEM process is not sufficiently dynamic. Bangkok was all innovation and smiling faces, whereas London provided an initial response to the Asian crisis. Normality in EU-Asian relations is now needed, so that we can finally see some concrete cooperation meaningful to the public. Cooperation should range from the fight against money laundering to environmental commitment and confidence-building measures in security policy and to commitment to food and water supply safety. It should also embrace our successes in the fight against organised crime, and – you are quite right about this, Commissioner – in combating trafficking in human beings, sexual exploitation of women and abuse of children. The exchanges between schools, universities and business people are most promising, and the Asia-Europe Foundation is doing sterling work.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what is at stake now, in 2000, is what ASEM can really achieve and should be able to achieve, and what is best organised at ASEM level. The Vision Group has produced an excellent model here, and one that should be put into more concrete terms.</p>
<p class="contents">ASEM has certainly done the right thing in focusing on the three pillars of political, economic and cultural cooperation. But we need more than that if we are to make progress in security policy under the OSCE process in Europe and also as regards territorial issues in Asia or human rights and democratic issues in Burma and elsewhere, with a view to stabilising the region. It is also vital for the increasingly important issues of company delocalisations, employment standards and other social issues to be discussed in a social forum which meets at a level comparable with the Business Forum and which facilitates the dialogue between politicians and the social partners on industrial relations and social standards. We really must create a forum of this kind. But we as Members of the European Parliament are also interested in reviving the Europe-Asia parliamentary dialogue. We have organised the first meeting between European and Asian Members of Parliament here in Strasbourg. Now that Europe has taken the first initiative, the ball is in our Asian colleagues' court. Why should Japan or China not run with this ball? It is a pity that in Europe interest in developing closer links with Asia is not as strong as interest in cooperation with other regions of the world. So a parliamentary dialogue also means the public at large becoming involved in cooperation in civil society. We all need to see this as a task for the future, because both these regions of the world have a great deal to say and do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It also covers different dimensions and embraces politics, economic affairs and culture. </p>
<p class="contents">How can we marry all of this together? This is not straightforward, and we believe that the ideal starting point would be Commissioner Patten’s excellent speech on this subject back in July in Korea.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to outline three points at this stage. Firstly, we Liberals attach great importance to economic cooperation, an often undervalued factor, not only over there, but also here.</p>
<p class="contents">If we learnt anything from the economic crisis in Asia, it is that liberalisation, with a greater level of economic transparency and sound protection of foreign investments, is effective. If there can now be joint initiatives within the WTO, then that is an extra bonus.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is cultural cooperation. The exchange of scientists and politicians, as Mrs Randzio-Plath mentioned a moment ago, is extremely important in our view. This Parliament should play a role in this, too. In addition, I should like to underline the role of the Asian-Europe Foundation in Singapore. I am in favour of renewing their mandate provided this is attended by the necessary financial resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is political dialogue: ASEM is the ideal forum for raising issues, including disturbing ones. We will be at the negotiating table with the People’s Republic of China and discussing its ban on the Falun Gong, and its system of arbitrary administrative detention and imprisonment for political reasons which is still in existence. All matters of this kind should very definitely be raised.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ASEM’s enlargement to include India, among other countries, is under discussion. In any event, Burma cannot be considered for this enlargement scheme. The treatment of Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi, since we have just talked about the British human rights activist James Maudsley, is more than enough evidence that we cannot enter into a dialogue with this regime at this stage. We would rather go into partnership with Taiwan, and it would be nice if the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of China could take a leaf out of the book of North and South Korea in their attempts at conciliation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Collins (UEN).</span></span>   – Mr President, the forthcoming Europe – Asia Summit in Seoul offers a valuable framework for dialogue and the strengthening of political, economic and cultural cooperation between the two participating regions. There are several countries in East Asia which would like to see Europe step up its presence in the region. This in itself offers a very favourable basis for the gradual development of cooperation between the two regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, urge all participants to reach a consensus on incorporating clear commitments in the principal documents in Seoul to respect human rights in the region. Greater attention must also be paid to child labour to guarantee that this practice can be eliminated as soon as possible both within Asia and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe and Asia must work together to intensify the battle against drug trafficking, money laundering, international crime, terrorism and the sexual exploitation of minors. It is very important that an agreement is struck during the next round of World Trade Organisation talks between our two collective regions. On this latter point, I would like to state that Asia's fragile economic recovery is complicated by the region's delicate political situation. It is sometimes forgotten that the unprecedented period of economic growth over a quarter of a century in Asia was predicated on a sustained period of political and strategic stability. Much of this stability does not exist in the region at this time.</p>
<p class="contents">The Korean peninsula is a source of continuing strategic instability. The rebuilding of East Timor is still an ongoing process. More Asian countries could play a role in providing additional aid for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of East Timor as a matter or urgency. Certainly much discussion is going to be needed to stabilise relations between the new Taiwanese government and the People's Republic of China.</p>
<p class="contents">All interested parties should note that political stability must be in place before key economic developments can take place, and I wish all the participants in the conference in Seoul this month every success.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Randzio-Plath suggested that there should be greater focus and emphasis on the European-Asian parliamentary dialogue. As Chairman of this Parliament's delegation for relations with the countries of South Asia I would very much welcome that. It is not sufficient that we only meet once every five or six years for a Parliamentary dialogue between the representatives of this Parliament and the representatives of India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Butan – these are just countries covered by the particular delegation that I happen to be Chairman of. I would appeal to Mrs Randzio-Plath, who has a strong input in the Budgetary Committee, to help provide the finances to enable this delegation – and others where such a step would be meaningful – to increase the frequency of these meetings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dupuis (TDI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, first of all I should like to tell Mr Nassauer that while we must regret the fact that the European Union has a low profile in the countries of Asia, we must also admit our own responsibility to a certain extent and acknowledge our missed opportunities. For example, a month ago we voted on Mr Galeote Quecedo’s report on diplomacy and foreign policy. This report does not in fact deal with diplomacy and foreign policy but instead confines itself to tackling the question of the postgraduate training, if you will, of European diplomats, or future diplomats. Another missed opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">On the matter of ASEAN, we ought to ask ourselves what type of relations the European Union has or ought to have with ASEAN. Firstly, we cannot ignore the very different concepts of integration in the European Union and within ASEAN. There is no political integration, not even the prospect of political integration, between the ASEAN countries, nor should we forget, as I feel some previous speakers seem to have done, that the governments within ASEAN are all very different: we have totalitarian or dictatorial regimes, even hardline dictatorships like China, alongside democratic countries. It is not, therefore, surprising that there is, in this context, no real integration or genuine political dialogue. The European Union should perhaps look into the problem and return to good, sound bilateral relations which could be appreciably different according to whether they involved a democracy or a dictatorial or totalitarian regime.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that the optimism shown regarding the Korean reunification process is somewhat excessive. The one swallow that you might see in the summit between the President of the Korean Republic and the leader of the dictatorial regime of North Korea does not definitely mean that winter is over for the citizens of North Korea. Let me remind you, ladies and gentlemen, that in the course of the last five years, somewhere between two and four million people have died of starvation under this idyllic regime.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, I find it intolerable that the European Union, in its dialogue with Asia, should avoid the question of India, which is a democracy, with a population in the order of that of its neighbour on the other side, China, but not the same type of government, and which does not have the same special relationship with the European Union. Like Mr Maaten, I feel we cannot carry on ignoring the question of Taiwan for much longer, not just in the process underway between Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China, but also within international cooperation schemes, even though I am not one of those people who think that these are very effective.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore feel that we cannot continue to disregard this Chinese monster, which is slowly changing into a Communist dictatorship, a new, national Communist dictatorship. We have had a forty-year Cold War between the Soviet Union and the democratic world, and I think there is an urgent need to avoid wasting opportunities like these summits to lift the lid on this major problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mrs Randzio-Plath, I should like to say that if we wish to step up parliamentary cooperation, we can only do so with the democratic countries in this region, i.e. with countries that actually have parliaments. If there is to be any parliamentary cooperation at all, then it must be with such countries and not with the officials of the Communist Party of China or other countries in the region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I very much back the idea of strengthening economic, cultural and political ties with ASEAN and ASEM. I also believe in involving the NGOs, mainstream society and the citizens of those countries. However, I would like to focus on the political contacts and comment on two countries in that area, namely Burma and Indonesia.</p>
<p class="contents">Burma is without a doubt ruled by one of the world’s cruellest dictatorships. Ten years ago, a military regime pushed the elected President, Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi, out of office, dissolved parliament, drove out, imprisoned and even killed numerous members of parliament, and subsequently applied extreme terror in its treatment of the population and minorities. The European Union has taken a number of measures with regard to Burma, but to no avail. Not so long ago, Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi was once again restricted in her freedom, a number of key fellow party members were rounded up and Western human rights representatives found themselves in hot water in Burma. Nothing appears to be working. This is why, in line with previous EP resolutions, I should once again like to argue in favour of adopting a harder line in conjunction with the ASEAN and ASEM countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn my attention to Indonesia, which is having difficulty moving back towards being a democratic constitutional state. Wahid’s government is of good will and is genuinely trying to undo old-style practices in the short term. But there are hardened opponents. These include corrupt members of the old Suharto clique and disloyal sections of the army, as well as paramilitary militia and aggressive Muslim fundamentalists. Meanwhile, Indonesia is dealing with a total of one million refugees internally, 130 000 of whom are in Timor and 300 000 on the Moluccan Islands. Especially in the Moluccas, where aggressive Muslim groups are spreading death and destruction, the situation is plainly disastrous. With more than 5 000 killed, tens of thousands wounded and more than 300 000 refugees, the large Moluccan community in the Netherlands – 50 000 EU citizens – is worried out of its mind.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must support the democratic forces in Indonesia but at the same time fathom out how it can help Indonesia to defy the negative forces in Indonesia – certainly in the Moluccas, because so many Moluccan European citizens are so terribly worried. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I sometimes feel that Asia, ASEAN and ASEM are the Cinderellas of Europe's foreign relations, receiving far less attention than they deserve on issues of industrial economic, financial, political and security matters. I welcome the promise that we have here to change that situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not sure about the proposal for exchanging politicians – who would we get in exchange for Mr Haider and Mr Le Pen?</p>
<p class="contents">There are three main points I would like to make.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, events in Seattle and Prague show that it is no longer possible for many of the key global issues to be negotiated behind closed doors by small groups isolated from daily life. I welcome the parallel ASEM People's Summit 2000 and the proposal in the compromise text that this should be institutionalised for future ASEM meetings.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the proposal for the re-establishment of the joint parliamentary meetings of MPs from the ASEM member countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, like Mrs Maij-Weggen, I want to talk about Burma. I am very pleased that, while Burma is a member of ASEAN, it is not a member of ASEM and in the past ASEM has called for the restoration of democracy in that sad country.</p>
<p class="contents">We continue to hope that the military regime in Burma will eventually recognise that the only way forward is by dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi rather than by confrontation. We hope that the Member States will continue to monitor that.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, this summit is being held on the Korean peninsula in Seoul. We have seen a historic breakthrough as vital as the ones we have seen in the past in Northern Ireland and in the Middle East, with Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong-il having the political courage to hold the first summit in this sadly divided peninsula. Yet we have seen recently in both Northern Ireland and the Middle East how fragile these peace initiatives can be. We urge the Commission, the Council and the ASEM member states, both from Asia and from Europe, to do what they can economically and politically to aid and assist this process further. Europe can play an important role as honest broker. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sure that we all remember the tribute paid here almost a year ago to Xanana Gusmão, who received the Sakharov Prize in this House. We have an ongoing responsibility to Xanana Gusmão, to what he stands for and to the people of Timor. Recently, the situation there has grown worse and, therefore, the tough message that I wish to convey to the Commission, and which I would like to see conveyed most forcefully to the Indonesian authorities, is that any positive developments in our relations with their country are dependent on Indonesia being able to provide effective guarantees for peace and freedom in Timor. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, a proposal for political dialogue. We have already spoken about Indonesia, East Timor and Burma. I would like to mention the situation between the People's Republic of China and Taiwan. I believe we should make it clear that the election of the new Taiwanese President is a historical opportunity to overcome the differences on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, and we should do this. As Europeans we should also, at long last, have the courage to open the EU liaison office in Taipei, because Taiwan is a major economic force with which we have very close relations. But there is the matter of political dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that we should be economically open, and we also have to tackle difficult topics sometimes. We should take the opportunity of being in Seoul to stress once again that the subsidies Korea grants to its shipyards are unacceptable. They put jobs throughout the EU at risk. It is not acceptable that we assisted Korea during the ASEAN crisis by means of IMF loans and suchlike, only for Korea still to be subsidising its shipyards, which is creating unjustifiable problems for our own shipyards.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point is one that affects not only us but also the countries of Asia. As has already been mentioned, we need an interparliamentary dialogue, a dialogue between the European Parliament and the parliaments of the 10 Asian states. You quite rightly mentioned that one of the key points at the Asia-Europe Summit will be the wide-ranging dialogue, that is to say the expression of various different interests on the part of Europe and Asia. It is not acceptable for these interests only to be the subject of exchanges between governments and officials, with academics and journalists generously being allowed to participate. Members of Parliament also need to take part in this process – this is no longer a question of pure foreign policy. These are all political issues which significantly affect the situation in individual countries, and so Members of Parliament must be involved in this. When the Japanese Members of Parliament come to see us in Strasbourg in November, Mr President, we will ask them to see if the next meeting between Members of the European Parliament and Members of Parliament from the Asian countries can, if at all possible, be organised in Japan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the economic field, I must remind you that we have two action plans in place, one to aid commerce and the other to promote investments, both of which are very active.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the social aspects, we proposed a new body at the time – the social forum – which would represent civil society. As I pointed out earlier in my presentation, the countries of Asia have not unfortunately been in favour of that proposal, which is something we regret.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to parliamentary cooperation, I would like to remind you that there have been two meetings: one in the Philippines and the other in Portugal, on cooperation between young parliamentarians, in which European parliamentarians have also taken part. We will consider any additional interparliamentary relations to be enormously positive.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the comments on certain specific countries, I would like to point out the following: first, with regard to Myanmar, it is clear that it is not a participating nation in the ASEM process and nor is there any intention to admit it into that process. This situation is discussed every time there is political dialogue, and the circumstances are clearly not conducive to moving in that direction.</p>
<p class="contents">As for India, I would like to remind you that there was a first summit between India and the European Union last July, outside the framework of the ASEM.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Indonesia, which has also been an issue of special interest, there is regular dialogue, within the ASEM, in which we always insist on the need to promote the democratic process and, to this end, President Prodi has already sent a message to the Indonesian President so that progress may be made on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Our political support for Timor is clear and we provide what we consider to be significant humanitarian assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, with regard to the very topical problem of our relations with Korea and, in particular, in relation to the shipyards and subsidies for ship building, I would like to remind you that this is an issue which is outside the framework of the ASEM but which, nevertheless, is not a forgotten question in our relations with Korea. It is the subject of constant and tough discussion. These debates continued last week and I agree that the subsidies currently being granted are completely unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
