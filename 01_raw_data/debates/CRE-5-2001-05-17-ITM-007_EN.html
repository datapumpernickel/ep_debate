Islamic fundamentalists and state authorities threaten, and are determined, to extinguish the flame of the freedom of the press in Algeria. Nevertheless, it is still burning, despite the numerous killings and detentions among independent Algerian journalists. However, a tightening up of the clause on defamation in the Code of Criminal Procedure forms a fresh attempt on the part of the Algerian government to kill that flame. As a result, it is possible to lock up Algerian journalists more quickly and for longer.</p>
<p class="contents">The extent to which the freedom of the press is at stake in Algeria is also patently obvious from the official resistance which the newspaper publisher, Omar Belhouchet, has experienced over the past couple of months when he imported a new printing press from Germany. His statement speaks volumes: ‘To Algeria, that piece of equipment represents a technological, but mainly a political, revolution. At long last, the state printing office can no longer prevent our publications. We have taken a portion of the power from those in power.’</p>
<p class="contents">How exactly? By not succumbing to the contempt of the citizens and their rights by the current regime, by openly defying the arbitrariness of political authorities, police and justice, which act in the interest of the ruling clans. The Algerians sum up this abhorrent government attitude in a single word: ‘hogra’. It is precisely this ‘hogra’, according to critical Algerian minds, that drove their own young people into the terrorist tentacles of the fundamentalists. ‘Hogra’ is, in other words, the key word in Algeria’s tragedy today.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of healing social antidote to ‘hogra’, the Algerian independent press – referred to as ‘the incorruptibles’ at home – deserves the support of the European institutions. As and when possible, they must provide the vital oxygen for this pilot light of the Algerian freedom of press, not least during the negotiations involving the country’s authorities. For in the final analysis, only the independent press in Algeria raises the issues which are really preoccupying the minds of the citizens. And what does this country, weighed down by so much violence, need more than an honest, public, political debate? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to the official figures 100 000 people have died during that period, which represents around 1 200 deaths per month, and the figures that the non-official organisations are giving are even worse.</p>
<p class="contents">In April 1999 the new President, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, ordered a partial amnesty, a law of civil concord, and promised fundamental reforms in order to put an end to the ongoing crisis in the country. So far, however, this policy has had a very limited effect. It does not seem to have been accepted as a true policy of total democratisation and reconciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">The terrorist activity of the violent fundamentalists has continued, and the situation has been aggravated by the violence of the last few weeks in Kabylia, where demonstrations by hundreds of young people, following the violent death of one of them in a police station, were very violently suppressed in a real bloodbath, which left more than 60 young people dead from police bullets.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is really very critical. It is, of course, an Algerian problem, which can only be resolved by Algerians and between Algerians, through a process that democratically restructures and gives greater legitimacy to the institutions and the State, through the agreement of all the political and social sectors who reject violence, from whatever source, and which can, in the face of the violent fundamentalists and also the sectors of the current ruling power that are resistant to change, achieve greater transparency and the participation of all the peaceful forces in the reconstruction of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a very complicated and difficult task, and the European Union should not miss the target in its support for those in positions of responsibility in the country, supporting all those who are coming from the point of view of peace and democracy. We should act without seeking to interfere, but with firmness and a positive spirit to promote human rights and the democratic process.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow, a delegation from this Parliament will travel to Algeria. I hope this debate will help to clarify our attitude, which is an entirely positive one, supporting the whole democratic political field in the country, in the institutions and in society, in finding a way out of this violent situation when there does not seem to be one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Instead of worrying if this sort of social explosion might happen, we should have been forecasting when it would happen.</p>
<p class="contents">The region of Kabylia is a microcosm of all the ills which beset Algeria, with its unfortunate colonial parentage, a microcosm of the national cohesion which has never quite made it and is based on democratic and legal institutions and a rule of law which have never been credibly founded. And, centre stage on this Algerian social scene, masses of young people, the life force of the nation, crammed into a few urban centres facing nothing but mass unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">What choice did they have other than to rebel and bemoan their fate? Are they supposed to keep quiet as well? And what policy can the Algerian government engage in other than to establish proper rule of law, starting today with committees of inquiry.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the government supposed to turn a blind eye as well? Surely – and this is vital – it should at long last offer Algerians a real future by introducing economic reform.

Colonial rule, which destroyed the country's traditional structures, was followed by a brutal war. After this brutal war, a socialist one-party system was established which finally collapsed as a result of corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the country of Algeria – this large and important country – faces two major challenges. Firstly, there is a youth revolt in progress, for Algeria is a young country, and its young people are rebelling because they feel that no one cares about them and they have no future. When social exclusion is combined with national sentiment, the result is powerful and explosive.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the danger of Islamism, which is systematically fomented by certain groups. We must therefore give the country our support, but we must proceed very sensitively. President Bouteflika has taken steps towards opening up Algeria. He has moved towards reform. A few weeks ago, he held a landmark ceremony to honour St Augustine. We might regard this as gesture politics, but he wanted to show that St Augustine's origins lie in what is now Algeria. In doing so, he also wanted to tell his people that as Algerians in an Islamic country, they have cultural links with Europe and therefore also with the Christian world. These are signs of openness, and they are important. This kind of gesture politics, however, is not enough. Real and substantive reforms are required. They must include press freedom, the rule of law, but also tolerance towards different nationalities and ethnic groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Traditionally, Berbers have cultivated their own culture and identity and have maintained a substantial measure of independence in Kabylie. This third major revolt among the Kabyle people sends out an alarm signal, for it is a revolt by young people who feel marginalised by the Algerian state. What is required, therefore, are sensitive reforms, respect for diversity, respect for freedom, and strengthening the rule of law. However, we must also ensure that measures are taken which we must support through dialogue based on equality and an absence of tutelage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Once again, our courageous foreign affairs ministers have decided to put their heads in the sand. The entire world is being condemned, except for Algeria. However, neither the oil interests, nor the current negotiations are enough to keep the gross human rights violations under wraps. The MEDA agreements demand respect for diversity. One third of the Algerian population are Berbers. Pluriformity should form part of the state fabric. Cultural, linguistic, but mainly social rights must be recognised if Algeria wishes to become a Treaty partner. It is questionable whether we should enter into an agreement with Algeria where human rights are being violated on such a massive scale, even by government officials. In my view, this can only be done if the government assures us that it will make every attempt to prevent the wrong-doings, and to prosecute and bring to justice those responsible, from whatever quarter. An agreement on judicial cooperation is only meaningful if this is given substance by the Algerians. At this moment in time, I still have grave doubts as to whether that is the case. If I look back on ten years of oppression and extreme violence, I am shocked by the statistics. One hundred and fifty thousand killed and on top of that, 10 000 people who have disappeared without a trace, and Europe remains silent. President Bouteflika constantly promises to contain the violence. He pledges to investigate the recent tragedy in Kabylia, but will the guilty be punished? I should like to reiterate it: the State’s most fundamental task is to protect its population. It is shameful that the Algerian authorities should not be able to put an end to the abhorrent reality in their country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following the death, on 18 April, of the young high school student, Guermah Massinissa in the police station at Beni Douala, impressive peaceful demonstrations were held at several locations, demanding that the persons responsible for this ‘mistake’ be brought to justice. In addition, thousands of demonstrators, often very young, turned out to demand important social measures in this region, which has been hard hit by unemployment, poverty and even a housing shortage. Without doubt, the roots of this discontent lie in the serious social crisis which has affected the whole of Algeria. One rightly wonders if speeding up the process of liberalisation and privatisation already under way risks exacerbating the situation. There is also a strong cultural demand in this region for the Amazigh language and culture to be respected, especially since the Berber Spring in 1980. Provocation and other abuses of authority by the police with respect to the population also seem to be at the root of this positive outburst of anger. So these were peaceful demonstrations calling for more social progress and greater freedom and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The marches turned into clashes which were put down by the security forces with a great deal of violence over a period of several days, leaving dozens dead and hundreds wounded. Numerous eye witness accounts printed in the newspapers talk of outright brutality. President Bouteflika and the national assembly announced that committees of inquiry would be set up. We can only hope that they will be set up as quickly as possible and will have the means needed to work efficiently – and, more importantly, transparently – so that sanctions can be imposed on those responsible for the repression. In another indication of the seriousness of the situation, the Rally for Culture and Democracy Party said that it was ‘impossible for it to stay in a government which fires on young people’ and withdrew from the coalition.</p>
<p class="contents">I am positive that the future of Algeria, whose people have courageously resisted barbaric pressure from Muslim fundamentalist terrorist groups, lies not in repression but in heeding the people's social demands and the often very courageous action of the various associations acting to defend women's rights, secure the repeal of the family code, care for traumatised children, keep solidarity alive in the face of serious social difficulties or defend human rights. Nor does the future reside in the worrying restrictions on the freedom of the press which will result if the planned amendments to the penal code are adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament delegation travelling to Algiers tomorrow will certainly help us to gain an insight into the Algerian situation from our various contacts and listen in return to their expectations of the European Union. In the same spirit, it will inspire the Commission to continue negotiations with a view to an Association Agreement, while taking better account of the opinion of political, trades union and community organisations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was a member of the parliamentary delegation which attempted to break the ice in the relations between the European Union and Algeria. Yet many of our hopes have not been fulfilled. Even our hopes of the new President Bouteflika, who has undoubtedly shown some signs of courage, and of the RCD's inclusion in the Algerian government have been disappointed.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the basic problem in Algeria is that the powers-that-be – <span class="italic">le pouvoir,</span> as the Algerians say – have failed to make genuine efforts to reach a consensus between the social groups in the country. Contrary to the frequent accusations made against us, I do not mean a consensus with terrorists and murderers. There can be no consensus here. I mean a consensus with all the groups which do not wish to witness the victory of the radical Islamist terrorist forces. However, the powers-that-be – or at least some sections of the military – have no interest in achieving this consensus. They want to maintain the status quo, and unfortunately, they are heavily implicated in corruption. This is why there are so many incidents like the recent events in Kabylie, with their shocking death-toll and the resulting alienation between the country's young people and its ruling class.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the delegation which will be visiting Algeria in the next few days will be able to foster at least some understanding of what is required to give the young people of Algeria fresh opportunities and restore their sense of hope.</p>

The many dead and hundreds of injured bear witness to the fact that the reform process in Algeria has still not achieved the desired results. Yet it is also clear that there is no alternative to the policy of calling for and consistently supporting this reform process.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union regularly addresses the issues of human rights violations, arbitrary arrests and torture in its political dialogue with Algeria. At the 57th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva in March 2001, the EU called upon Algeria to take substantive measures in this area and allow the UN Special Rapporteurs on the question of torture and on extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary executions to visit the country.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of the disappearances of individuals is of particular concern to us. During the troika's most recent visit to Algiers on 24 April 2001, the Algerian authorities were presented with a consolidated list of thirty old and new cases. The Commission will continue to pursue this issue vigorously in future. The Association Agreement currently being negotiated with Algeria contains a clause on democratic principles and human rights. The speedy conclusion of this Agreement will equip the European Union with an effective instrument with which to engage in more intensive dialogue with Algeria at institutional level.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1996, the Commission has committed EUR 300 million from its MEDA budget lines and under the financial protocols to support economic and social reform in Algeria. In 2001, our aim is to promote balanced social and economic development, and we are therefore preparing two comprehensive projects for local development in rural areas and for rehabilitation measures in the regions affected by terrorism. Human rights projects are also being funded through separate dedicated budget lines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
