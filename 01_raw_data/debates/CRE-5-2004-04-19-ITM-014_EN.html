The problem we face is that total pollution in society, especially due to our habits of consumption, is increasing all the time. The European Environmental Agency has recently shown that the volume of waste in the fifteen Member States has increased by 15% since 1990. In spite of the fact that we have reduced pollution and are using energy and materials more efficiently, the gains are quickly being eroded by increased growth. Because the world’s gross domestic product is expected to increase by three or four times in the next 30 to 40 years, we must do something radical if we are not literally to be buried beneath an ever higher mountain of waste and pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">The Integrated Product Policy we are debating in this House today offers excellent opportunities for creating a framework of incentives to get us to move away from production and consumption models characterised by a consumerist approach to linear resource flows and, instead, to embrace resource efficiency, waste minimisation, controlled use of hazardous substances and expansion of the stocks of natural capital. If this is to happen, the Integrated Product Policy must, however, be based upon a long-term vision of how we are to change our industrial production model.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that what we have learned is that it is not sufficient to pollute a little less. We must strive to achieve patterns of production and consumption that are clean in themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The advantage of an Integrated Product Policy is that it involves a comprehensive approach, that is to say it tackles the whole product chain from the extraction of natural resources via product design and the production phase itself to the stage at which the product’s useful life is over. The Commission’s proposal has a number of good features, but is still not sufficiently proactive. It seems as if the Commission has partly rejected the Integrated Product Policy in favour of the thematic strategies. I see it not as an either/or but as a both/and. We need the thematic strategies, but we also need a framework for the Integrated Product Policy in order to hold the policy together and to be a driving force in its actual implementation. In general, environmental policy and also energy policy must become far more coherent and consistent. We now have an abundance of directives and regulations, but too little attention is given to the bigger picture.</p>
<p class="contents">In its proposal, the Commission talks about using voluntary methods as far as possible. EMAS and ISO are obviously constructive, but research shows that they are not enough. On the Commission’s model, voluntariness is also linked to market forces, that is to say to working with the market. Because it is extremely rare for environmental costs to be factored into the prices, the market does not, however, operate satisfactorily. Companies must be given direct incentives, that is to say be able to earn money from developing environmentally adapted products. That is rarely the case at present, in which case how is the market supposed to be able to help?</p>
<p class="contents">In its communication, the Commission talks about improving information for consumers. That is good, but it is naïve to believe that better labelling and better environmental information will solve this problem. I myself have been involved in developing environmental labelling in Scandinavia, and I know how difficult it is to implement it on a broad front.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, we need to place the Integrated Product Policy within a dynamic framework that supplies guidelines for policy in general and provides support for the thematic strategies. This framework should be characterised by a clear vision, based partly on the following principles.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, a systems-based approach, of which life-cycle thinking is the very core. Secondly, an enhanced understanding of how natural systems and the eco-system work so that companies’ product and business models might be adapted along biological lines. Thirdly, the optimisation of the product design process by the selection of materials that have as little environmental impact as possible. Fourthly, the principle that products whose useful life is over must be broken down into their component parts and either re-used or, if they consist of biologically degradable materials, progressively integrated into natural cycles. Finally, much more thorough use must be made of the increase in information in order to promote greater efficiency when it comes to the use of energy, materials and dematerialisation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is especially important to note the opportunities presented through learning from, and copying, nature. I do not have time to go into this now, but there are a number of examples where companies now make use of these principles, bring about perfectly clean solutions and, moreover, earn money from doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, during the discussion in the committee, the Commission’s representative pointed out that sights are not set primarily upon a framework directive. I regret that. I am convinced that a framework directive is needed, and I hope that, under Commissioner Wallström’s leadership, the Commission will think the matter over and realise that it is important in the long term to bring about a horizontal, political framework that is of help in environmental work overall. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have put a lot of effort into finding a better name that will tell the uninitiated something of what this is about, if only that it is an important task. I really do appreciate the efforts that have gone into this report, particularly the work done by the rapporteur, Mr Wijkman.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission communication, we emphasise that it was necessary to show how the Integrated Product Policy can operate in practice, and we have also said that we wish to use two methods to do this. Firstly, we wish to carry out a couple of pilot projects that bring together different actors to discuss, and preferably also to implement, measures that reduce these special products’ environmental effects. Secondly, we are in the process of drawing up a European inventory of those products that have the greatest potential for improving the environment. Such an inventory can help us direct our efforts at the most important products.</p>
<p class="contents">The report contains many interesting insights. Allow me to comment on a couple of important ones that show the link between the thematic strategies and this proposal, also mentioned by the rapporteur. I should also like to describe how I see the link between the Integrated Product Policy and other initiatives mentioned in the report, particularly the two thematic strategies: the strategy on the sustainable use of natural resources and the strategy for waste prevention and recycling.</p>
<p class="contents">My long-term vision for these three areas is really quite uncomplicated. I believe that the strategy on natural resources should include the general problems linked to the issue of how we are to break the link between economic growth and environmental damage. The strategy must state what is to be done to break this link and establish general objectives concerning the way in which natural resources are to be protected against over-exploitation and pollution. The Integrated Product Policy must then transform these resource-focused objectives – do not forget that natural resources provide us with minerals, food, water and clean air – into practical measures for reducing products’ and services’ effects upon the environment, at the same time as creating business opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">It is of no consequence that we are beginning to prepare an Integrated Product Policy even before the resource strategy is ready. As we said in our proposal, we can do a lot right now. I also believe that the strategy on waste and recycling should be more clearly focused upon the environmental and market problems that arise in that part of the life-cycle. This does not mean ignoring the products’ whole life-cycles. On the contrary, the measures taken here must take account of environmental effects throughout the life-cycle, with the Integrated Product Policy being applied.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor, therefore, do I think that the Integrated Product Policy should embrace resource-based objectives. I think that these are better placed within the resource strategy. Nor do I believe that the Integrated Product Policy should advocate the use of certain materials, irrespective of whether they are bio-based materials, composite materials or other materials, because there is then a danger of ignoring the life-cycle dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I wish to emphasise that I do not believe that this is the right moment to prepare a framework directive on the Integrated Product Policy. Alongside the issue of what, realistically, can be part of such a directive – it should cover a very large number of tools and concepts, as well as its being possible to monitor compliance – I believe quite simply that it is too early to decide whether such a framework directive is necessary. However impatient we may be, I believe that we must wait a little and see how different actors apply the Integrated Product Policy in practice. That applies to industry, governments and consumers. If they do not make use of the opportunities it offers, we can consider a strategy with less of a voluntary basis, but I believe it is too early to draw conclusions about this at present.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2007, the Commission will review the two points I have mentioned, as well as the whole of the Integrated Product Policy. If it appears necessary, we shall make changes. For example, we might place greater emphasis upon services, recommend a framework directive or change the Integrated Product Policy as a result of the discussions concerning the thematic strategies. Moreover, I believe that the rapporteur’s contribution contains many important points which should definitely do more to direct our overall thinking as we face the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we really want to enforce sustainable production, we must think in life cycles and not in individual products. That is why, Commissioner Wallström, we also need a structural framework for the building site. If you look at it now, what we have is a building site with the various building blocks scattered on the ground. We have EMAS, we have eco-labels, and for batteries we have decided on eco-labels again. Then we have limits, then for cars we have enhanced environment-friendly vehicles. We have the public procurement system, but nothing dovetails. Consequently, businessmen and consumers are of course not exactly clear how this integrated production is supposed to benefit them; that is why I can only strongly support Mr Wijkman. We need a framework for the building site so that these building blocks will fit together and a sensible structure will result. Only then, I believe, will we be able to persuade manufacturers to change their production methods and finally have environmentally friendly, sustainable production. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
