<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mariann Fischer Boel, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I am glad to have the opportunity to address here the question of the European Union-United States Wine Agreement, which was initialled in Washington on 14 September. It will be submitted to Council for final approval in the coming weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">This is only a first phase agreement. It is the result of many years of bilateral negotiations, during which the United States was granted and renewed specific authorisations on wine-making practices, certification and labelling rules, completely 'for free'.</p>
<p class="contents">These never-ending negotiations affected the trading environment in a negative way. The United States left the International Wine Organisation in 2001 and created the World Wine Trade Group. Besides that, since the Community revised its labelling rules in 2002 with the adoption of Commission Regulation (EC) No 753/2002, the United States has been one of the most critical WTO members, questioning the WTO-compatibility of all these rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Another example of negative trade relations was the adoption by Congress in November 2004 of certification requirements for imported wines, except for countries with which the United States had a wine agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Community exports to the United States amounted to almost EUR 2 billion in 2004, which is about 40% of our wine exports. The United States only exports EUR 415 million to the European Union. Considering, therefore, the importance of the United States market for the European Union, the evolution of our trade relations over recent years and the situation in the Community wine sector, it is my view that this first phase agreement is a very positive one for our wine sector. This deal will secure what is our biggest export market in terms of both value and volume.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the agreement, since it will help consolidate and improve our trading relations with the United States. It may also facilitate a non-polemical and substantial dialogue with the members of the New World Wine Group. In addition, this first phase agreement contains some provisions that clearly benefit the Community. There is now official recognition by the United States of our wine geographical indications, which will be protected under their labelling rules.</p>
<p class="contents">There are the 17 European wine names, such as port, sherry and champagne, which are currently considered as semi-generic in the United States. We have agreed that their use will be limited in the United States and that they will change their legal status to restrict them to wines originating in the Community in future.</p>
<p class="contents">The present situation will be frozen, but there will be no further negative impact from the agreement. We cannot underestimate the fact that the explicit recognition of these names as Community wines will benefit Community wine-makers and traders.</p>
<p class="contents">We will also be exempted from the 2004 United States certification requirements. Not only for wines covered by the agreement, but also for wines which contain less than 7% alcohol, which was an issue of interest to many of the wine-producing Member States. And let us not forget that, without the present agreement, we would have faced heavy certification requirements for our 2005 vintage. I can assure you that all these requirements would have been very costly for our export sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to highlight two other very important points. Under this agreement, the United States and the European Union agree to resolve bilateral issues through informal bilateral consultations, rather than through formal dispute settlement mechanisms. This is an important declaration, as it represents a peace clause and will allow further constructive discussions to be held.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that this is only a first phase agreement, it was key to have some clear perspectives for the second and more ambitious phase. We have obtained a clear commitment to start the negotiations for the second phase not later than 90 days after the entry into force of the first phase.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States ultimately agreed to spell out more clearly in a joint declaration the issues that should be part of these second phase negotiations. These include important issues for us, such as the future of the 'ex' semi-generics, geographical indications, the use of traditional expressions, wines not covered by the agreement, wine-making practices, certification and the creation of a joint committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I have heard some criticism to the effect that the Commission has granted the United States mutual recognition of its wine-making practices. This is not at all the case. We will continue to accept United States wine-making practices currently covered by Community authorisations. We will also accept existing United States wine-making practices not covered by the present Community derogations. However, it will only be possible for the United States to export those wines after the status of the 17 semi-generic United States names has been changed. New wine-making practices will be analysed and only accepted in the Community if no objections are raised. This is not mutual recognition.</p>
<p class="contents">Because the United States is our most important trade partner in the wine sector, I consider this first phase agreement a very important one for European wine-makers and exporters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our group has two points of view on this subject, and I do not propose to mince my words in setting them out.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that the Commission has acted – to say the least – shamelessly and unacceptably in making these concessions in the EU-US Wine Agreement, and that I say, as a Member for one of the oldest vine-growing regions in Germany, also on behalf of the vine-growers of the Moselle. You yourself stressed the obvious need for a trade agreement with unambiguous rules, and the negotiations have also been going on too long already, but what we need is an agreement with fair conditions for both parties. This document, with its long and vague deadlines and, worst of all, the concession of unconditional mutual recognition of oenological processes in wine-making, is a slap in the face for all the efforts the European Union and its Members have put in to legislation on vine products.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner said that there is a need for further discussions, yet we have negotiated for so long that I have to ask why we are putting off such important decisions. The production and manufacturing of wine in Europe is subject to clearly defined conditions. Adding water to it is something we see is unthinkable and which the consumer would not stand for. Are we now to accept that the Americans may add water to wine up to 7%? Modern methods involving the breaking-down of wine into its individual components are a workable proposition these days, but are we, by way of mutual recognition, to accept that it can be put together industrially and any old how?</p>
<p class="contents">We have no need of synthetic wine! Wine is diverse, its diversity a manifestation of nature itself, owing its character to climate and vintage. Is the Commission not aware of the likely effect of such a concession, which affects future agreements, on negotiations within the WTO? The ‘most favoured nation’ principle laid down by the WTO means that, later on, the same concessions will have to be made to other states. The International Wine Institute is endeavouring to find a globally valid definition of wine, and this is being taken <span class="italic">ad absurdum</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Fischer Boel also mentioned another organisation. The USA has left the OIV. Does that mean that the OIV has in some sense gone bust? Yet what we insist we need – the protection of geographical indications of origin without the specification of a date – is simply being put off for ever and a day. Champagne comes from Champagne, Rhine wine is grown on the Rhine, and Moselle on the Moselle – not somewhere in America. If we want fair trade, then such descriptions must be banned now rather than at some unspecified date. Even maintaining the current status quo strikes me as going too far. What I want the Commission to tell me is in what sense the negotiations around this agreement can be described as a success; as I see it, all we have done is to make concessions, and too many of them at that.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel – and let me say on behalf of the many winemaking families at present bringing their harvest home from the vineyards, we feel – that a deal has been done to sell us down the river. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is a difficult agreement which, I think, was fairly complex, meaning that we all need more clarification. On the other hand, you too need to take account of our proposals and concerns in connection with this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">This agreement might indeed be considered as one of the most long-winded international sectoral trade agreements, given that issues have been pending since 1983. Over the last 20 years, the European Union, as you quite rightly said, has constantly granted the USA derogations relating to wine-making practices and the labelling of American wines imported into the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">This agreement will, first of all, smooth trade relations between the USA and the European Union: the USA exempt the European Union from their new certification requirements and undertake to endeavour to resolve possible differences through bilateral consultations rather than, as was previously the case, through dispute settlement mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we should not forget that, for the time being, this is only a first phase agreement, what we might call an emergency solution, and that important trade matters are pending which the Commissioner must take into account in the ruthless negotiations now beginning.</p>
<p class="contents">First, protected names are not adequately safeguarded, it would appear, in the agreement, while the recognition given to the wine-making practices of the USA, allowing 7% water to be added or for wines to be matured with wood shavings in the barrel, which are not of course a health hazard, jeopardises the reputation of wine as a quality product.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this recognition of the lax wine-making practices of the USA will act as a precedent for imports from other countries. Consequently, in the second phase, the question of wine-making and maturing practices will need to be addressed responsibly, in order to create a stable reference framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, traditional names are being threatened and the role of the International Wine Organisation is being questioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the procedure to safeguard recognition of the 17 names in Annex 2 needs to be speeded up, so that all protected European names are strictly protected by the American authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, the creation of an international register of protected geographical indications needs to be promoted within the framework of WTO negotiations and this objective needs to be integrated into the top priorities of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, one major cycle is closing but another is beginning and perhaps now the Commission's efforts should be stepped up within the framework of the second round of negotiations with the USA and the forthcoming review of the common organisation of the market for wine, so as to create the best possible conditions with respect to the production and quality of and the trade in the product. You are in the eye of the storm and I wish you <span class="italic">bon courage</span>. Parliament and its comments will, I think, help in this direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an important trade project, accounting for EUR 2.3 billion, but the trading relationship involves two different systems, with different approaches to production and marketing, and so cooperation is not easy. It is for that reason that this agreement can be regarded as no more than a first step, a first phase agreement, and I am glad that you have described it in those terms.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past, we accepted many derogations for the Americans; the trading relationship made that necessary. What matters now, though, is that our rules on labelling should be enforced, and we also see it as significant that the USA is ready and willing to resolve all bilateral issues through consultation rather than through the WTO’s dispute settlement procedures, but what is surely most important to us Europeans is that geographical indications of origin should enjoy in the United States the protection that they deserve, in return for which we – for the time being – are prepared to accept the Americans’ winemaking practices. That may be a bitter pill, but we have to swallow it; its effect will be only temporary and the labelling rules – which will result in greater freedom for what we hope are emancipated consumers – will help it go down.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, in the second stage of negotiations, the Commission must go further and press for the improved protection of intellectual property in winemaking, an area in which we Europeans have led the world in establishing worldwide standards, and so we should not relax our efforts on this point; we also suggest that the Commission should push for a WTO-wide register of geographical descriptions of origin, something that both the speakers before me mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, this agreement may not be brilliant, but it is a first, and an important step, and you, Commissioner, have done the right thing. The next step must now be taken hand in hand with the reform of the market organisation for wine, to which we all look forward eagerly.</p>
<p class="contents">We can take pride in our European wine. It is esteemed and enjoyed the world over. We enjoy a global advantage in wine production, and we need to maintain it by further improving the protection of intellectual property. We wish you, Commissioner, much success in doing this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like first of all to emphasise a procedural issue. This debate has been hurriedly organised, following the signing of an agreement – even if it is a first phase – by the Commission. Furthermore, the Council is not here, although it is the institution that ultimately has the agreement in its hands. I believe, therefore, that we are not working in a serious fashion and that the opinion of MEPs is not being taken into consideration, as it ought to be.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the content, while this agreement works in the favour of the traders and merchants who exert a great deal of pressure to get ahead, it clearly does not, in any way, serve the interests of either the producers of registered designation of origin wines or of consumers. Today, the situation is extremely confused. What you have set out, Commissioner, does not correspond to the information we have from another source. A state of deep concern is emerging on the ground. How much confidence will European consumers have in the labelling, in the labels that are in danger of being considerably undermined by this type of agreement? Furthermore, you are considerably weakening the principles that the European Union has always upheld with regard to geographical indications.</p>
<p class="contents">What is currently taking place with regard to wine, and which is, in our view, unacceptable, is in danger of subsequently taking place with regard to a whole host of other products. For our part, we want two things to happen. On the one hand, that the Council does its job and clearly states what remit has been given to the Commission regarding this issue. On the other hand, that the European Union takes a far greater stand on ensuring that the registered designations of origin are observed, on wine-making practices and on protecting sectors that are genuinely vital to the existence of our territories and to a great number of rural territories throughout the European Union, and that it fights to protect this quality and these designated origins. Otherwise, if we embark on the WTO negotiations by giving up from the outset, I very much fear that we will lose ground time and time again in the weeks to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This situation is exacerbated by the increase in third-country imports, which has had a highly detrimental effect on farmers and wine-growing regions.</p>
<p class="contents">This first wine agreement with the United States, the fruit of 20 years of bilateral negotiations, is an important one and yet it also raises concerns. In light of the massive concessions given to the United States, this agreement appears to have been brokered more because of the ongoing negotiations with the World Trade Organisation, than for the purpose of defending the interests of EU wine producers.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe that the scope of the negotiations must be broadened internationally. Furthermore, as regards the United States, Mrs Fischer-Boel must explain fully how she intends to guarantee the interests of wine producers from regions of Europe in which wine production is crucial to economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to both labelled designations of origin and traditional wine-making practices in Europe, this is what must be done if the quality of wine is to be maintained and consumers are to be protected. When we checked the detail and listened to your explanations, we became very concerned as regards the guarantees that must be given to our farmers and to the regions concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was time to change course after the harmful effects of the infamous Regulation (EC) No 316/2004, which effectively authorised producers in non-EU countries to make improper use of protected traditional names, thus causing enormous damage to quality wine production, both in Italy and, of course, in Europe as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Fischer Boel also stated in this Chamber that the agreement protects European names and will safeguard the European Union’s largest export market. There is no doubt that those are the aims to be achieved; doubt remains, however, as to whether the agreement is the right basis on which to achieve such aims.</p>
<p class="contents">It is indeed true that the US Administration will put a bill before Congress to change the status and limit the use of 17 European names currently considered semi-generic in the United States, but it is also true that the United States will still be able to use 14 Community traditional names, although subject to certain conditions and for a limited period of time. In fact, the hoary question of the ongoing misuse of names has still not been settled once and for all.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the United States has undertaken to accept the basic principles of the Community’s labelling rules and will seek to resolve any bilateral issues relating to the wine trade through informal bilateral consultations rather than through dispute settlement mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the most worrying concession made by the European Union? Well, under the agreement, the European Union recognises the wine-making practices of US wine producers. Substantially, what that means is that the EU can import wine diluted with 7% of added water or flavoured with wood chips, practices that our producers, of course, are absolutely forbidden to use. That will result in a serious threat to wines of excellence and a major upset in the wine market.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we have succeeded in providing a certain stability for wine exports to the United States, not least through the easing of procedures, we have at all events gone too far on wine-making practices and we do not yet have sufficient guarantees regarding the misuse of protected names.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the agreement includes the commitment that negotiations for an even more thorough agreement will start 90 days after it enters into force. In this regard, we ask that the talks focus on the effective protection of traditional names. We believe that, during the talks, the Commission should above all try to obtain a final commitment from the US authorities to put an end to the illicit use in the United States of geographical indications protected by Community legislation within two years at most.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude by pointing out that the agreement and the extraordinary derogation for US imports could be used by other WTO member states to claim similar treatment, thus opening the floodgates to imports of dubious origin and composition. Faced with this situation, the European Union must take action with more vigorous measures in order to defend its production of traditional quality wines. We should make a fresh start by actually repealing Regulation (EC) No 316/2004, which liberalised the use of protected traditional names, thus creating unfair competition and misleading consumers as to the origin and quality of products. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, on behalf of the wine growers from the Languedoc-Roussillon region who have been making wine for 2 000 years – since the days of the Roman Empire and not for a century like California – and who make wine like people make love, like people cultivate love for what is handsome and what is beautiful. I also speak on behalf of all the wine growers from France, Spain, Rioja, Hungary, Tokay – the wine of kings, the king of wines – Italy, Greece and the entire Mediterranean area, where wine is part of civilisation, an art of the gods.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet you, with your agreement, you are reducing the wine that is the product of civilisation to an industrial product for marketing. Your Munich Agreement of the wine industry changes the definition of wine and the nature of wine. It is no longer a natural creation that is the fruit of the fermentation process, but a chemical product. You accept the United States’ chemical – and not wine-making – practices. You accept a Coca Cola-type of wine made with water plus ingredients, sugar, colourings and wood. It is like the United States wanting to change Mrs Fischer Boel into an inauthentic, 7%-dilutable commissioner. You can understand, therefore, why the United States does not want labels: because it obviously does not want the chemical substances to be included on them. Soon, the REACH Directive will be applied to wine.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, you are allowing the theft of 17 designations, on the pretext that they are semi-generic. Champagne, why, that is insignificant; Chablis, that is not at all significant; Sauternes, even less so! You are giving the rubber stamp to fraud and counterfeiting. For five years, the United States will be able to use bogus châteaux and bogus Clos wines in exchange for the peace clause. It is like what happened with the Uruguay Round negotiations, it is like what happened with oleaginous fruits: the thief agrees not to drag the cheated wine growers under the nose of the WTO policeman. This had already been done before for the agreement with South Africa and, at the WTO, of course, the producers of Chilean, Australian and California wine, and of all the wines from the Pacific, are going to revolt and claim this precedent for themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I come from a region that invented the great revolts in the 1950s. Well, the wine growers from the Languedoc region will say ‘no’ to you. They will revolt and they may, for that matter, come to the Commission in Brussels. They have been able to rouse the whole of southern France, and they will have no difficulty in saying ‘no’ to you as violently as is necessary, because you are attacking them and you are attacking a civilisation.</p>

One of those bottles would contain wine, and the other olive oil. And since I am from La Rioja, the wine would naturally be a Rioja, which has an international reputation and whose renown and prestige are due to an ancient wine-making culture.</p>
<p class="contents">Since before the Roman invasion, vines were being cultivated in La Rioja and wine was being produced. Our wine is therefore produced by means of extremely ancient production methods which guarantee the high quality of the product.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the Agreement reached with the United States could lead to a profound change to our wine-making culture, which would not always work to our advantage, because, fortunately or unfortunately, the commercial success of our wines has always been linked to a production method that conforms rigorously to the most purist definitions of the wine.</p>
<p class="contents">The definitive authorisation of the import of wines treated by means of dubious wine-making practices that are very different to ours could jeopardise our own wine-making culture, upon which – I would insist – the commercial success of our products has always been based.</p>
<p class="contents">How long can the European Union go on prohibiting the use of flakes in the maturing of wine or the addition of water, if we are allowing wines produced by means of these practices to be imported?</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the chapter on wine-making processes will be one of the sticking points to which particular attention will be paid in the forthcoming reform of the COM in wine, because the agreement that the European Commission has just reached with the United States will, I fear, have repercussions which will go beyond trade with that country.</p>
<p class="contents">My region, La Rioja, is lucky enough to benefit from good protection in the United States’ market, but the same cannot be said for other Community designations such as Burgundy, Port and Sherry and Málaga wine, which are still considered by that country to be ‘semi-generic’. The agreement reached does not contain a firm commitment from the United States to cease misappropriating these descriptions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like us to call upon the Commission to include the creation of an international register of geographical indications and designations of origin amongst the main priorities of the negotiations in the World Trade Organisation. The current negotiations in the World Trade Organisation offer a golden opportunity which we must not waste.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should also urge the United States, on a bilateral basis, to stop using names protected in the European Union within the maximum period of two years mentioned in the recent wine Agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But we see this just as a starting point and not something with which we should be content. I agree with the majority of what has been said in this Parliament and, above all, I hope that the Commission will take good note because I have not heard a single person say that they are satisfied with this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">These first agreements do not guarantee effective protection for European designations of origin. However, they do leave the Community market open to United States wines produced according to wine-making practices not authorised in the European Union, such as watering. It is going to be difficult for our wines, produced according to traditional methods and high-quality criteria, to compete with others produced by means of much cheaper industrial processes.</p>
<p class="contents">My country, Spain, is disappointed by this first agreement and we hope that the second phase will be far more convincing. Amongst many other things, we are particularly worried about the issue of semi-generic designations; we believe that it is they who have lost out most. It is true that the United States have committed themselves to not using typical European designations, but only for wine that they export to third countries. They can therefore continue to use the same descriptions that they have been using to date in their own territory, with the added complication that United States legislation views descriptions from my region, such as ‘Sherry’ and ‘Málaga’, as semi-generic and not designations of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">The second phase of the negotiations will begin shortly; we call on this Parliament to defend the geographical indications more firmly in those negotiations, to which end we must open up a debate on the future of semi-generic terms. We need to hold a dialogue on traditional terminology, certifications and wine-making practices and, in particular, it is necessary to create a joint committee for wine-making issues.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to work better in the future than we have until now, this Parliament is prepared to work with the Commission; we are going to adopt a resolution which we must take into account so that what has been happening to us until now does not continue. It would also be desirable for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to produce an initiative report so that what has happened does not happen again and so that this Parliament’s opinion is taken into account in order to try to save the European wine-making sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The United States remains a key market for the European Union with 60 million wine drinkers and an average level of consumption that has grown from 8 to 13 litres per inhabitant per year over the last ten years. Last year, the volume of the US market increased by 5.6%. France is ranked third among exporters to the United States, behind Italy and Australia.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, we must welcome the agreement on wines which has been made between the European Union and the United States and which concludes the first phase of negotiations that were begun 20 years ago. Using blackmail, the United States threatened to subject European exporters to an onerous certification procedure. This autumn’s <span class="italic">Beaujolais nouveau, </span>therefore, would have been first in line. It would have been subjected to additional analysis and certification checks.</p>
<p class="contents">This agreement has also enabled progress to be made in the area of wine-making practices. European producers, however, consider these control standards to be insufficient. They oppose practices such as flavouring, which is aimed at infusing wine with the taste of fruits. The changing way in which we define wine is at stake. They also emphasise the protection of geographical designations.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, it is necessary, therefore, in the second phase of negotiation, to ensure that the commitments undertaken by the US authorities are observed: to cease using semi-generic terms, such as Burgundy, Chablis, Champagne and Port, and to improve the level of protection of geographical indications, as well as improving labelling. In this global wine market, which is often controlled by the large US wine traders, the type of vine has become a brand name. I am not against the globalisation of the wine market, but I am against copies. I am against the standardisation of flavour: I do not want a McDonalds-style Chardonnay wine.</p>
<p class="contents">Wine goes hand-in-hand with cuisine; it is the mark of the region where it was produced, it carries the flavour of the cultivated soil and it is the symbol of festivity and of living together. The diversity of the designations reflects the diversity of the wines, our cultural diversity. Mutual recognition of the geographical indications, that is to say the designation of the soil from which the wine is produced, will contribute to preserving our respective cultural identities, to boosting our trade with the United States but, above all, to encouraging European wine growers who, for years, have constantly improved the quality of their production in order to satisfy our demands, and serve our enjoyment, as consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Astrid Lulling (PPE-DE). – </span></span>  <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, the agreement between the European Union and the United States on trade in wines, which was initialled by the European Commission on 14 September following 20 years of negotiations, divides opinions. There are the European operators for whom this agreement will safeguard their exports to the United States, which is their most important market, with exports valued at EUR 1.6 billion. They believe that this agreement will also enable a climate of confidence to be restored in the sector and trade to flow smoothly, provided, of course, that a prompt start is made to negotiations for a second phase of the bilateral agreement and for defining common positions in the multilateral negotiations, particularly in Hong Kong with regard to aspects related to intellectual property.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet there are the other operators too, in particular the European wine growers, including my colleague, Mrs Klass, to whom, moreover, we owe the initiative behind this debate, and for that I offer her my thanks. She has expressed very competently the concerns which, as chairman of this Parliament’s ‘Wine, tradition, quality’ intergroup, I share to a very large extent. According to these concerns, this agreement is in danger of further aggravating the crisis that is currently hitting the wine-producing sector and, in the long term, of destroying once and for all the individual nature of European wines, which are characterised by their traditional roots in the soil and by natural and quite specific wine-making practices.</p>
<p class="contents">As political men and women, we know that we often have to water down our wine, but please, not the wine that we drink. Mutual recognition of the wine-making practices on both sides of the Atlantic poses a problem – my fellow Members have spoken at great length about it – all the more so because some of these practices used by European wine growers are also banned by the WTO. I hope that you are not going to propose that we change that state of affairs when you make proposals for reforming the common organisation of the wine market.</p>
<p class="contents">Being traditionally attached to production models in keeping with their environment and subject to an arsenal of stringent Community regulations, European wine growers, who are anxious to deliver quality products, are in danger of ending up in a situation of unfair competition if the United States’s practices are accepted, so much so that, in the long run, they will find themselves forced to abandon their ancestral practices which have, over hundreds of years, created the individual nature of Europe’s wine-making sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Commissioner, it would be wise to pull out all the stops in order to protect this sector, which is undoubtedly fragile from being subjected to a large number of varying factors such as the climate but which has always been at the centre of European culture. It is therefore a question of continuing to defend and promote our wine-making practices; it is a question of supporting the quality-focused efforts of our producers, in particular at the WTO, and, finally, of agreeing on a definition that restricts the production models that are unacceptable and that give rise, as I have already said, to a kind of competition that is detrimental to our quality products.</p>
<p class="contents">The use of geographical indications is a further issue that unquestionably creates a problem. This subject has been provoking controversy around the negotiating table for a long time now. I took part in a seminar in Washington on this matter. We maintain good relations, in fact, with our colleagues from the US Congress, whom we are trying to convince about the validity of our arguments. Yet they wanted us to buy back – to pay in order to buy back – our designations of origin. I held the view that the reasoning was, nonetheless, slightly odd. I come from Luxembourg, where the Moselle river flows, and the wine from the Moselle valley, while it can be produced in Germany, Luxembourg or France, is emphatically not, as far as I am aware, produced in California.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, therefore, that there should be an end to the costs and, Commissioner, that it is crucial to protect our designations and to implement, once and for all, a system for registering geographical indications within the WTO. We hope that you will vigorously defend this point of view in Hong Kong, because it is a question of the future of quality products and of Europe’s wine-making culture. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As earlier speakers have said, winemaking culture and wine production are an integral part of the cultural heritage of a number of European regions and have been part of their history stretching back centuries.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to refer to just one example, which you will appreciate is very close to my heart, namely that of Port wine. This wine is produced in the world’s oldest specified region, created and regulated long before the American colonies had even thought of coming together to form sovereign states. On the steep slopes of the River Douro in Northern Portugal, successive generations have for centuries sculpted the mountains with their bare hands and miraculously transformed the stones of a desolate landscape into a scene of extraordinary beauty, which is now classified as a world heritage site.</p>
<p class="contents">This does not hide the fact that I am well aware of the importance of concluding the agreement with the United States. I am aware of the profound impact that European exports have had on that country and of the delicate negotiating framework within which this problem has dragged on for many years. Pragmatism at the negotiating table must not be allowed to undermine the need to enshrine basic rules for protecting our designations of origin and geographical indications. Under no circumstances must the Commission neglect the issue of protecting semi-generic names in the US internal market. A specific date must be set for the signing of a final commitment. The next phase of the negotiations must get underway without delay so that the 17 designations of origin in Annex II can be accorded recognition.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely hope that the disappointing outcome of this first phase of negotiations can be offset by the second round, which we hope to see concluded swiftly. A fair and balanced agreement with the United States could be the positive sign that European winemaking, currently facing a number of tricky challenges, is urgently looking for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have a duty, as an MEP who is, indeed, from the Champagne region, to inform you of the following observations, since the essence of today’s debate is the start of the agreement you spoke of, Commissioner, and which you obviously wish to finalise. While we too wish for it to be finalised, it is for the reasons that I am going to expand on.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an economic necessity underpinning all of this. The US market, as has been pointed out several times since it was mentioned earlier, is extremely important for Europeans. In this age of globalisation, however, I would like to focus my remarks on issues related to quality. At international level, UNESCO regularly acknowledges a number of our sites of interest and buildings among the world heritage sites. Well, European wines, particularly those produced around the Mediterranean, as was pointed out earlier, have established their pedigree throughout the centuries and millennia.</p>
<p class="contents">In an age when, at every important moment, when a peace agreement is signed, when a family party is celebrated, etc., it is wine and, moreover, quality wine that is consumed, quality must be recognised. Yet, what has been taking place for some decades now? We have been witnessing the spread of plantations throughout the world – in Chile, in Australia, in New Zealand – and, above all, and this is what is fuelling the debate this morning, an explosion of ‘Canada Dry’. People are reproducing wines left, right and centre throughout the world, quoting denominations on the labels that allude to the vine and the region in which the wines were produced – Champagne, Bordeaux, Porto, etc. – and they are trying to make consumers believe that, in the bottle they are buying, they have a wine whose origin and quality matches what the labelling would suggest.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, this agreement that you are going to finalise in the weeks and months to come must prevent consumers throughout the world from feeling cheated and deceived. We live in an age where the volume of counterfeit products is multiplying; we can see this taking place in the case of clothing items, with Lacoste, in the case of watches, with Rolex, and also, unfortunately, in the case of medicines. It is quite normal, natural and necessary that consumers throughout the world should be certain that a bottle of wine bearing the words ‘wine of Alsace’, ‘Burgundy’ ‘Champagne’ or ‘Port’ does indeed contain the wine in question. The quality of our world heritage is at stake, as are the interests of all our European wine producers. Long live European wine! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have talked about a first phase agreement on the issue, and you have talked about a second phase that will take into due consideration a number of factors that we wish to emphasise, regarding quality, wholesomeness, protection and tradition.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the European Union has always pursued a policy of quality in the wine sector by means of very specific and very selective rules on wine content and wine-making procedures. How can we now ask our producers to comply with Community rules and the Community’s quality policy if we then give third countries the chance to export to our market products that the Community itself forbids its own producers to make? How can we ask our producers to compete on price with imports that benefit from production costs that are held down through the use of production practices that appreciably impair quality? Quality above all means guaranteeing a wholesome product for the consumer: food safety is for us a priority that we have vigorously pursued and have regulated more than once; I refer to Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 and the special Food Safety Authority.</p>
<p class="contents">The positive effects of wine on human health are now well known: they depend not just on its organoleptic properties but on its hygienic and sanitary status as well. The lack of any indication of origin of the wine, moreover, means that the consumer cannot identify it, and it also leads to difficulties for producers who incur extra costs in order to make a superior quality product. It is our job to ensure that the wine on our tables – on the tables of European consumers – is both wholesome and good quality.</p>
<p class="contents">Our wine-making traditions, Commissioner, are no less important. This morning we have invoked our ancient culture, our specialities and our territorial diversity. In a word, it means ensuring that the geographical indications for our wines are respected and that our production in this sector thereby remains competitive. I do not see sufficient protection for our geographical indications in this agreement; I do not find it consistent with the position that the European Union is advancing in the WTO negotiations; and I do not find in it that same firmness of resolve that you yourself, Commissioner, reaffirmed last week in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to protect our indications in the Doha Round, we must do so, particularly through bilateral negotiations, without making any concessions. The agreement does not respect our producers; it does not respect our consumers; it does not respect our market; and it does not respect the European Union’s identity on the international stage. It is not a case of closing the market – far from it – but of ensuring fair, undistorted competition, in which both product quality and consumer protection really can prevail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some 265 million hectolitres of wine are produced every year, two-thirds of them in Europe. The Wine Agreement between the EU and the USA is first to be concluded with the object of securing this important market for sales from the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The intention is that this agreement should dispel the legal uncertainty that has marked this trading relationship for many years, and it was designed to benefit producers on both sides of the Atlantic. The conclusion of this first agreement is meant to create the conditions for future close cooperation with the USA in the wine sector and protect designations of origin in the EU. The Commissioner herself described this agreement as an important first step, and said that it is still not without faults. Like the other Members, I am much obliged to her for this statement.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is doing something it has never done before by agreeing to the principle of the unconditional recognition of oenological processes. The Member States had hitherto always argued that there should be what they termed an international code of definitions for wine and the processes involved in its manufacture. It is for that reason that I believe doing this puts a question mark against the continued existence of the international organisation, the OIV.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the protection of European designations of geographical origin is concerned, the concessions made in this agreement go too far. They affect all those regions that base their quality systems on designations of origin or traditional terminology.</p>
<p class="contents">While there is no doubt that we need a trade agreement with the USA, what we need is an agreement with unambiguous legal provisions that do not undermine existing European law and requirements and offer a secure future to our European high-quality wines.</p>
<p class="contents">There is to be another round of negotiations once the first agreement has been in force for ninety days. I believe that this approach is absolutely right, proper and necessary, and I hope that the decisions taken then will make it possible for us to withdraw the criticisms we have expressed today. All the best, Commissioner! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Wine is one of the products that is facing increased international competition as a result of the globalisation and liberalisation of the markets. Wine is one of the few success stories that we can enjoy in Europe. Our designations of origin are the fruit of centuries of tradition and form part of a culture for which wine is one of the major flag-bearers. At this point, it is worth mentioning the Doha Declaration and the WTO General Council statement of 31 July 2004 in Geneva, which introduced the concept of ‘non-trade concerns’. These aspects, which one might call non-quantitative, must be taken on board in any agreement, including this agreement with the United States, a country that imports 40% of our wine exports. If so, they should guarantee that when the negotiations are over we can rest assured that the door will not be left ajar for future restrictions in other negotiations with third countries, either on a bilateral basis, or with the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">For there to be a fair agreement, it is not enough simply to liberalise. Rules on quality must be put in place, because our designations of wine origin represent what is referred to as intellectual property, something that requires protection in the same way as copyright. This first agreement was concluded, in my view, with little transparency and with Parliament somewhat pushed aside. We therefore need to know what the United States actually accepts in terms of our wines with designation of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, from what I have read in the newspapers, we do not know whether or not Madeira wine and Port wine are included among those that the United States accepts as designations of origin. We are prepared to make some concessions and adjustments to winemaking practices, but we cannot accept the idea that our designations of origin, which are genuine intellectual property and which characterise our culture even more than trade, are not respected in full.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I therefore feel that if an agreement is necessary – and I accept the need for one – then such an agreement must not be at any cost, and especially not at the cost of our traditions and our culture when it comes to designations of origin. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, Commissioner, in the first phase, the United States have achieved 100% of their wishes and we have left Europe’s interests for the second phase. Our adversary in the negotiation has once again been paid in advance.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, Commissioner, we have lost our main weapon in this contest. The main weapon available to us if we were not to accept the wine-making practices of the United States was, precisely, that our designations of origin should be recognised, and we have lost that weapon. We have paid and we have ended up without the weapon which could have provided us with ammunition with which to defend our interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we are running the risk that, from now on, certain Community producers may also call for greater flexibility in the Community rules on wine-making practices, which could lead to unwanted changes and put an end to our ancient wine-making culture for good.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I am also thinking of certain designations that are so emblematic in my country, such as Sherry or Málaga. What will happen to them? What is going to happen during the second phase of the negotiation?</p>
<p class="contents">For all of these reasons, I believe that it is rather shameful that the European Union should surrender to the United States’ wishes as a result of threats. They have threatened us with closing our markets and we have given in. And we have not achieved what we really wanted: to defend our designations of origin once and for all.</p>

I have been a Member of this House for some time, and rarely have I experienced such an interesting and committed debate, but it is one that I also regard as an example of Europeanisation and globalisation. Only a few years ago, when we spoke in terms of ‘us’, each of us meant his or her own nation, and, even so, we had exactly the same problems with mutual recognition, designations of origin, certification, and mandatory labelling. All these things we once fought long and hard to secure for Europe, and now it seems that we have to do the same again for a global market that has shrunk. The American Professor Jeremy Rifkin is quite right to say that Europeans are best equipped, by reason of these laborious experiences of things that the world is now having to get to grips with, to deal with these problems, for we have been through them already and know how they need to be addressed. Now, Commissioner, we are all agog to learn how you propose to sort out the problems with wine. Everyone present – including the spectators – knows how important wine is to their own winegrowers. How, then, Commissioner, are we to solve these problems? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mariann Fischer Boel, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I am very encouraged by all the contributions made on this very important issue. As I mentioned in my statement, I welcome the conclusion of the first phase agreement on trade in wine between the European Community and the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the conclusion of this agreement on trade between the European Community – which, as many of you have mentioned, is the birthplace of wine – and one of the leading countries in the New World Wine Trade Group. I am convinced this development is positive not only for the Community and the United States, but also for the world at large. I am also convinced that the conclusion of this first phase agreement will pave the way for further discussions and cooperation with the United States in the wine sector, which is in the clear interest of the Community, and in particular its wine sector.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I have taken note of all your remarks, which I will not underestimate. The negotiations for the second phase, which as I mentioned previously will begin within 90 days of the entry into force of the agreement, will allow us to act on many of the remarks made today. However, I also believe that most of your remarks go far beyond the conclusion of this first phase agreement and in a sense confirm that it is the right moment to start the analysis and discussions on reform of the wine sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to reply to some specific questions. Some of you seem to be of the opinion that this agreement is unbalanced and skewed in favour of United States stakeholders. Considering the economic pattern of the EC-US wine trade and the political and legal background, this first-phase agreement is not unbalanced. It improves our relations with our leading customer considerably and establishes a good basis for future discussions and negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides, several provisions of key interest to the United States, such as the approval of their existing wine-making practices not covered by current Community authorisations and much simplified certification requirements, will only kick in once the United States has notified the Community it has changed the status of the 17 famous European wine names that are semi-generics in the US.</p>
<p class="contents">There is the question of the protection afforded to European wine names being insufficient. The protection under this agreement is afforded through US labelling rules and guarantees that European wine names will only be used for European wines, notwithstanding a grandfathering clause on existing brand names. In addition, this agreement is without prejudice to our rights under TRIPs and does not affect our legislative framework for GIs.</p>
<p class="contents">On the most-favoured nation risks mentioned by several of you, I can state that the Commission's aim in these negotiations and those with other new wine-producing countries, is to improve the dialogue between us and our negotiating partners and avoid the trade conflicts and WTO panels that would be extremely costly for European producers.</p>
<p class="contents">The most favoured nation clause is well-known with regard to tariffs, but the situation is completely different when it comes to its application in relation to procedures for recognising wine-making practices. In order for the same concessions to be granted to another third country, that third country would have to be in a similar situation as regards acceptable wine-making practices and monitoring of those practices and of the wine. However, the United States system of administration for wine labels is unique. It is not used in other third countries and the most favoured nation risk therefore seems to be very small. That is an important point.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the possibility of adding water, let me recall that this is permitted today in the European Union for reasons of technical necessity. We have no defined limits for the addition of water to wine, but, for example, a limit of 7% has been defined in respect of adding water to concentrated grapes, as it is impossible to detect the addition of water below that threshold. But make no mistake, we will not accept any undermining of the quality of EU products.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of mutual recognition, as I said in my introductory statement this agreement does not grant the United States mutual recognition of its wine-making practices. This was one of the key US objectives, just as the phasing-out of semi-generics was for us. However, since the US did not agree to phase out the use of the 17 EU semi-generic wine names used in the US, we did not agree to grant them mutual recognition of their wine-making practices.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, we will only maintain the existing Community authorisations on United States wine-making practices. We will accept the other existing US wine-making practices only when the United States has changed the status of our semi-generics. That link has to be taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">We will have the possibility, for new wine-making practices, to raise objections and hence not to accept new US wine-making practices. We will not simply accept all the practices used by the United States. However, various myths seem to abound. To take the example of oak chips, which have often been referred to, such chips are already permitted in the European Union on an experimental basis. Clearly, however, under the agreement, a wine will have to be aged in oak barrels before the term 'barrel-aged' could be used on the label. That goes without saying.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is very important that discussions be opened on the reform of the common market organisation in wine. The impact assessment work has already started and consists amongst other things of an economic analysis of the sector, which should be completed by the end of the year. Later, the impact assessment report will cover several options and the effects of those options.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will involve all stakeholders within the sector in a public debate that will hopefully be held in February, before presenting a proposal. The Commission communication could be submitted by June next year, with a Commission legislative proposal being presented before the end of next year.</p>
<p class="contents">I should inform Mr Freitas that both madeira and port are on the list of the 17 wine names considered as semi-generic, and that the use of those names will therefore be restricted. He can be quite sure about that.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the whole issue of geographical indications is of huge importance to the Community and I have constantly made this clear to our trading partners in the WTO negotiations. Our intention has been to obtain a multilateral register, the extension of the existing higher level of protection afforded to wines and spirits to other products, and a clawing-back of certain names, the use of which has been abused world-wide. Some of our trading partners even consider that GIs are not an issue for negotiation. Something on GIs must come out of our final discussions in Hong Kong. It is such a vital issue for the agricultural sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At the close of this debate I have received six motions for a resolution<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> submitted pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.</p>

<p class="contents">The vote will take place on Thursday, 29 September, at 12 noon.</p>
<p class="contents">The sitting will now be suspended until the beginning of the vote. To those who may be asking why we are doing this rather earlier than usual, I will say that the Bureau has discussed how we might avoid the situation that always occurs at 12.00, 12.05 or 12.10 p.m., with the representatives of the Council of Ministers or the Commission having to talk rather over the noise of all the Members pouring into the Chamber for the vote. We have therefore agreed to experiment with closing the debate at 11.50 a.m., so that the debate can proceed without disturbance. It is for that reason that we now have a bit more time than usual.</p>
