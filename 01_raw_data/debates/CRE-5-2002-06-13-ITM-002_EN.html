I thought that it would also be helpful for the report to cover the implementation of the European Charter for small enterprises. I wanted to present a simple and specific report to you based on the work done by the Commission and the Member States over the last two years.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the Commission’s concern about the slow pace of progress and about the downturn in the economic situation, which is not necessarily favourable to long-term reforms. However, it is these structural reforms which we are being slow to implement, particularly as regards opening markets and reducing the tax burden. One of the reasons for the slow pace of reform is the failure to comply with the method decided in Lisbon, which presupposes cooperation between the Member States and coordination by the Commission, with exchanges of information and an assessment of the measures adopted. This is still lacking, and that is detracting from the coherence of enterprise policy.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am suggesting that the Commission should publish an enterprise policy scoreboard, just as it has done for employment policy, which should both prioritise actions to be taken and set out a timetable. I am also calling on the Commission to provide us with better information on progress with structural reforms in the Member States. Furthermore, I am asking the Commission to assess the effectiveness of initiatives taken by the Member States and effectively to disseminate best practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Small enterprises are a pillar of Europe's economy and a breeding ground for jobs that we should support and develop. The regulatory and administrative environment in which our companies have to operate also has an impact on their competitiveness. We need to bear in mind that small enterprises employing fewer than 50 people provide jobs for 65 million people in the European Union. They account for 99% of all businesses and provide 53% of jobs. In other words, it is better to legislate, taking account of small enterprises, which means serving 65 million people more effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am calling on the Commission to step up consultation with bodies representing small enterprises and to help them to set themselves up as a network. It is also the reason why I am stressing the need to differentiate more clearly between different types of company in legislative proposals. And it is also why we should not make life difficult for our entrepreneurs by overburdening them with legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the measures I am proposing is to support initiatives taken by the Commission and the Member States in favour of companies. I wanted to emphasise the methodological problems that are impeding the Lisbon strategy while advancing some specific proposals likely to meet the expectations of entrepreneurs and applicable in the context of small enterprise. I hope that this House will support this approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Lisbon agenda is an important one for the economy and future of Europe and the European Union. A great deal of promise was held out at that time and there is a lot of very positive rhetoric about the process and the things that we want to do. But there is a lot of talk and spin, rather than substance. Many of the projects of substance in the process are a continuation of those schemes, such as liberalising the energy markets, which were in hand before. I note with keen interest comments such as in paragraph 14, which calls on the Member States to reduce the tax burden on employment. I wish that my own Member State had followed that advice instead of putting up the tax on employment in the last budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I support warmly the comments about stressing the importance for small businesses of a genuine opening of the markets in telecommunications, energy, postal services and transport. This is a worthy aspiration. We are working hard to do it but we are not making fast enough or satisfactory enough progress. I also welcome the call from the Commission for a study on the impact on various kinds of enterprises for each legislative proposal. The Commissioner knows well of my concern about business impact costs and the proposals. That is why I am also concerned about Parliament and our propensity to put down amendments which add costs. That is why my amendment is about examining the costs of our amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ford (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I add my congratulations to Mrs Vlasto for her report, which was adopted unanimously in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. It deals with the issue of the Lisbon European Council which had the objective of making the European Union the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world and link that to the Feira Council which endorsed a European charter for small enterprises. Clearly, as Mrs Vlasto said, small enterprises are one of the keys to success in the European economies.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make three points. Firstly, the report details the very low levels of investment in research and development – 1.19% of GDP inside the European Union. This is particularly acute in industrial sectors dominated by SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like us to look at the idea, at a European level, of research institutes paid for by a levy on the relevant industries, which the Japanese have used so successfully in getting innovation in research and development in such industrial sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need to look at the issue of better regulation to simplify and streamline our regulations. I have no problem with imposing burdens on business to improve, for example, the environment, but we need value for money. One of the recent studies in the United Kingdom suggested that the end of vehicle life directive, for example, cost GBP 400 million a year and benefits the environment only to the tune of GBP 100 million a year. If that is correct, that is something that should not have been adopted into law in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">So we need to be aware of the impact of our legislation on business and jobs. Therefore we support the Chichester amendment in principle and will be voting in favour of it.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must look more widely at whether SMEs that serve local markets only should have the same burdens imposed on them as large companies exporting around the European Union and outside. In many cases local knowledge can suffice to protect consumers. Regulations are needed when the goods and services from anonymous companies are remote from the consumer both geographically and in terms of local knowledge. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Lisbon method was the opening up of markets and only one way to act was proposed. It is the coordination of economic and social policy by placing special emphasis on the role of the private sector.</p>
<p class="contents">We might agree with the rapporteur that only an inadequate analysis of whether the same method suits all has been carried out. Different countries have different public services and operate on different principles regarding social welfare. In the Nordic welfare states public services are understood broadly to include pensions, healthcare, schools and childcare. The Catholic countries, with their traditions of care within the family, should not come and tell us in the Nordic countries that our taxes are too high. The privatisation method expounded at Lisbon is not going to provide better services in our part of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">EU declarations do not create socially secure life. For that reason in the eyes of the rightist hegemony the free Member States might lack the desire – and, in fact, it is only right that they do – to act on declarations that would pulverise people’s basic social security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that, instead of imposing and proposing grand objectives, it would be better to try to do some of the necessary, useful things that need doing, and this report rightly specifies some of the issues that need to be tackled such as market liberalisation, achieving a more integrated securities market and opening up the export markets for European businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that more could have been said, rapporteur, Mr President, Commissioner, about the tax and administrative burdens imposed as a result of employment regulation, which particularly affect small and medium-sized businesses in Europe and which are one of the reasons why a substantial part of European enterprise and microenterprise – and this is especially true of Italy although not confined to that country alone – is effectively a submerged economy, an economy which evades regulation, which evades legal constraints because of the excessive burdens imposed on it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by saying that it is right that we should concern ourselves with small and medium-sized businesses in Europe: in Italy, small and medium-sized businesses are the backbone of the economy. However, alongside this, we must bear two things in mind: firstly, Europe needs large competitive internationalised businesses; secondly, it needs small and medium-sized businesses to grow, to grow and expand continuously, first and foremost in Europe but then, if possible, to internationalise their operations. Therefore, the phrase ‘small is beautiful’ is all very well, but we must not create the conditions for small-scale enterprise which we do not need. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is certainly clear that we all need to be aware that SMEs and SMIs play an important role not only in the economy, but also in society, by promoting economic and social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the scope for modernising an economy and stabilising a society is very much dependent on institutional conditions and on having a clear, accessible and above all appropriate legal framework. The single market and the total achievement of economic and monetary union, the enlargement of the European Union and the forthcoming establishment of a Euro-Mediterranean area will increase the size of this market and thus change the rules. This globalisation of markets has a marked impact on the competitiveness of Europe’s companies, which need to adapt their strategy by incorporating into their analytical data the strategic advances made by their competitors in third countries and competition from markets in third countries which they want access.</p>
<p class="contents">We have found that Europe’s companies are not sufficiently internationalised, neither within the single market nor outside the European Union. That is why companies need more favourable and above all more appropriate regulatory conditions to be put in place as soon as possible. In particular, these conditions need to improve market access and provide for additional measures for enterprise partnerships at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">SMEs also need to come up with new forms of work organisation, but these changes should in no case be at the expense of workers’ needs in terms of security. It is essential to encourage workers to adapt their skills to the needs of the company and to consider training as an investment for companies and an added value for employees.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, SMEs make a contribution to Europe’s cultural values and to increasing skill levels. They are the section of our economy that we need to promote, as stated at the Lisbon Summit, but we need to act quickly, because our slowness is suffocating them. When confronted with economic reality, our companies need deeds more than words. We need to be as efficient as they are. This is already clear in the Sixth Framework Programme on Research. We now need to pursue that coherence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I congratulate the Commission on its proposals, particularly its recommendations on economic impact assessments. The Commission's proposals will only be effective if the other two institutions – the Council and Parliament – follow suit.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Chichester's amendment seeks to alter paragraph 25, which was my original amendment in committee, calling upon Parliament in essence to carry out its own economic impact assessments. I believe that we should do this at second reading, once we have received the common position from the Council and we know what Parliament's amendments were at first reading. We should have an independent unit seeking to assess exactly what the impact of the legislation is, with a rigorous cost-benefit analysis, as Mr Ford has said, albeit not to substitute for decision-making, but to ensure that all decisions taken by Parliament are informed.</p>
<p class="contents">It may well be that even if we recognise there are costs involved, we feel the legislation is very important. But Parliament has to follow the example of the Commission on that, otherwise it will not work. Indeed, so should the Council. The Council is very good at adding amendments to legislation without actually working out how much they are going to cost. That is a vital challenge to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Lisbon agenda will only work if we focus on the skills issue. Lifelong learning has to be meaningful, not just a slogan. We have to make sure our workforce has the proper skills to be able to develop our economy, because our competitive advantage is largely skills-based and that is where the future of the European economy lies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission. – (FI)</span> – Mr President, the European Council that convened in Lisbon in March 2000 made entrepreneurship the key issue in the achievement of the EU’s strategic objectives. Entrepreneurship can help to exploit economic opportunities, so creating a prosperity that makes it possible to achieve social objectives. One result of the Lisbon meeting was that the European Charter for Small Enterprises was born. The basic principle at work here was that small enterprises are an important source of dynamism, innovation and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p class="contents">We were worried last winter that the major importance that entrepreneurship had would be forgotten about. It was not, however. In March the European Council at Barcelona said again how important entrepreneurship was, reconfirmed the special status it had been accorded, and urged Member States to expedite the implementation of the charter on small enterprises. At the same time the Commission published its report on competitiveness for 2002. It shows what a long way EU productivity is from that in the United States of America. For this reason, per capita GNP in the EU is only 65% of that in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">There are various reasons for Europe’s poor levels of competitiveness, but the report highlights the poor levels of investment in information technology and communications technology and poor levels of utilisation of investment. The results of this are visible in industry, but also in services. Utilisation of investment in information and communications technology furthermore helps prevent a situation where there is a shortage of skilled labour in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The worrying conclusion of the report on competitiveness for 2002 is also that, unless the EU removes all the barriers, it will not be able to achieve the Lisbon objectives. Dominique Vlasto draws attention in her report to various courses of action to improve EU performance and avoid any such eventual situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I would like to lay emphasis on five matters. Firstly, the Internal Market is the basis of competitiveness for EU companies. There is still much to be done to establish the internal market in services. Liberalisation of the finance markets would help to make funding available to business. Secondly, the Charter for Small Enterprises must be implemented with a measure of determination. There are signs of progress, but Member States should not waste time. Thirdly, better regulation means that the effects of every legislative proposal must be examined. Last week the Commission submitted a proposal on this and I am very pleased with the speeches the honourable Members Mr Chichester and Mr Titley have made here on this issue. Fourthly, we must do everything possible to exploit information and communications technology properly. It is not enough that information or communications technology is showing signs of speeding up the US economy; the necessary action has to be taken also. Finally, we must first and foremost create a favourable climate for entrepreneurship. We have to take risks and society must be encouraged to do so. We shall return to this in the Green Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">These are all political measures. We must concentrate on getting political action on the right track. That way the EU will be able to achieve the right kind of operational environment for companies – not so much by attaching too much importance to small-scale projects, as lucrative as they too may be in themselves. As significant levels of funding are needed at EU level we already have the necessary tools at our disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank Mrs Dominique Vlasto for having indicated the very important areas of policy in which progress is needed. In the final analysis we have to improve political action. That way we can bring the Lisbon objectives within achievable range. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
