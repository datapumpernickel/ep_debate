The courts are looking into the financing of the list he headed in the elections to the European Parliament and the ‘Demain la France’ movement, which appear to contain sums of unknown origin exceeding the legal ceiling. Amongst his fellow candidates was a ‘housewife’ residing in Gabon and also an African Elf oil emirate, at the heart of the African casino and gaming networks, who appear to have provided a ‘contribution’ of FRF 7.5 million. It is not the place of Members of Parliament to stand in for the courts, nor to pass judgment on the substance of the case. However, it is their responsibility to waive an immunity that would prevent the courts from carrying out their investigation independently and from finding out the truth of the matter, all the more so since this is a matter which deals with the election to the European Parliament. Do we want to add, to a Berlusconi mixed up in a multitude of scandals and a Chirac taking advantage of his presidential status to escape the law, a Pasqua who is ‘immune’ from any suspicion of illegal financing from African business deals? Italian judges are calling for a new ‘clean hands’ operation; European judges are calling for a European power of investigation and a coordination of their resources to fight against money laundering and financial crimes.

Messrs Falcone, Attali, Mitterrand, Sulitzer, and others who have been indicted in the same scandal, have either been held for questioning, are being investigated or on bail. The judges cannot use these measures in this case due to the immunity of Marchiani and Pasqua, who are taking advantage of this fact to hold up the investigation. It is not the place of Members of Parliament to stand in for the courts, nor to pass judgment on the substance of the case, nor the investigation. However, it is their task to waive an immunity that would prevent the courts from carrying out their investigation. To refuse them the freedom to do this would reveal the true nature of this so-called ‘desire for transparency’, meaning that an MEP is above the laws that apply to all citizens in his country. If a majority of so-called ‘committed European’ MEPs protect these so-called ‘separatists’, so often implicated in Franco-African scandals, from the law, it is because, in fact, despite all the speeches they may make, they all share a certain idea of Europe: one where tax havens, arms dealers and oil companies reign supreme, a political world that is poisoned by money, and a contempt for justice and for the sovereignty of the African peoples, the front-line victims of this ‘arms for oil’ trafficking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, the representatives from the Member States have succeeded in putting together a complicated arrangement, when it could have been much simpler; secondly, this complexity will backfire on them; and thirdly, it will be so much harder to implement because essential expenditure has visibly not been included.</p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost, the interests of simplicity and logic dictate that, to finance the Convention, Member States should have created a fund financed directly from their own contributions and controlled by themselves: the Convention is, in effect, a unique body, set up outside the Treaties as part of an intergovernmental process in preparation for an Intergovernmental Conference. Instead of this, they have formulated a complicated procedure, under the terms of which funds are partly financed by the Community institutions, Parliament, the Council and the Commission, pursuant to an ‘interinstitutional agreement’ that gives the aforementioned the right to examine Convention expenditure. For example, Article No 20 of the basic decision states that discharge of the Fund’s expenditure can only be granted by the Member States after the three institutions have given their assent; Article No 6 of the agreement states that these institutions should be regularly informed of the implementation of expenditure; Article No 4 states that any increase must be authorised by them.</p>
<p class="contents">This complicated arrangement gives the institutions a means of influencing the Convention’s expenditure, and therefore the way in which it functions and, lastly, its decisions, There is no doubt at all that this power, if used effectively, will be used against the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there will be plenty of opportunities for conflict, for it already seems that the total budget for the Convention (EUR 10.5 million for the first ten months), has been underestimated. In fact, the working conditions of the various parliamentary representatives – the European Parliament, the national parliaments of the Member States and the national parliaments of the candidate countries, are quite unequal, and this three-speed system, in which the European Parliament is disproportionately privileged, will, in all fairness, prove untenable. We therefore need to provide additional resources to the other two categories, or at least to the third. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In particular, as we look to move forward and create a new environment for the creation of new jobs and new opportunities for people within the European Union, we believe that going back over old policies which have failed and rejuvenating them under a new name will not work. Paragraph 29 was the main reason why we had to vote against this report. Paragraph 29 calls for coordination or harmonisation of taxes in the European Union, in particular with regard to the business environment. There has been empirical evidence to prove that reducing business taxation, reducing the cost of labour, increases employment opportunities, increases real jobs with real incomes and also can lead to greater social benefits because of increased taxation delivery. That is why we believe this is the wrong method to move forward and one that should be ignored. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That said, I wonder what the Commission will do with the future data and what its actual significance will be. In particular, I have reservations regarding one part of the Commission’s text, which states that labour costs are a potential source of inflation. The rapporteur himself raises this concern too, for if there is any question to be posed in that regard it is whether a mere four categories are sufficient to provide all the elements necessary to achieve the complex figure we want.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware of the significance, within a production category, of the labour cost per product unit, linked as it is to the extent to which machines are used and, therefore, of the importance of geographical location. Again: we need to be able to ascertain whether any areas that might be penalised by higher labour costs per product unit benefit from State aid or the Structural Funds, and then monitor this data to verify whether it increases over time or remains the same.</p>
<p class="contents">This would make it possible to assess the effects of cohesion policies, in some cases, and the effects merely of choices taken freely by entrepreneurs in response to opportunities, in others.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we need to consider, in addition to trade tariffs and external inflation factors, the effects of the taxation and related policies of each country. This is because – and we share the rapporteur’s view – we believe that there is no country in the Union whose wage negotiation mechanisms appear, at first glance, to generate a labour cost whose index causes the cost of living to rise.</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is that wage negotiation mechanisms ceased some years ago to serve the purpose of furthering the distribution of wealth and, in some cases, do not even succeed in fully offsetting the effects of inflation retrospectively.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, these are the analyses to be made if, as the Commission advocates, indeed, we want to provide social partners with more refined tools for negotiating wage agreements. However, it is some consolation to think that social partners already have the results of the aforementioned analyses available for their practical studies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The second strategy is about producing full employment, social integration and lifelong education for all.

Today, the Bullmann report once again proposes to accelerate this process with the Barcelona Council in mind. At a time when the British railway network is on the brink of collapse and Enron has gone bankrupt, pursuing this approach does not correspond to a rational argument but rather to purely ideological motives; in other words the quest for short-term profits for a minority of shareholders and parasites. The Barcelona European Council, under pressure from Blair and Berlusconi, will be one further stage in this move towards greater flexibility in the labour market and the liberalisation of the public services, notably in the energy and gas sectors. We would like to respond to an offensive against the market by meeting our citizens’ needs. And there can be no middle way here.

<p class="contents">We are basically well-disposed towards the European Union. Through European integration, cross-border problems can be solved more effectively than they would be if they were only to be tackled within each Member State. Such problems may relate, for example, to the environment, trade, movement across borders, human rights and conflict management. As Liberals, we also believe, however, in the subsidiarity principle. Every political decision should be made as close to those affected by the decision as is possible and appropriate. Those issues which are not clearly of a cross-border nature, or those cases in which there are clear differences between different countries or regions should therefore be dealt with at local, regional or national level. The EU should concern itself with those issues it is best qualified to deal with.</p>
<p class="contents">Social and employment policies are areas we believe are best addressed within each country, region or municipality. The EU should only have limited competence within these areas. Each Member State should have full responsibility for its social security systems and the right to make its own decisions about them. To quote examples, neither child care nor employment policy is harmonised at EU level. These issues are not of a directly cross-border nature. Moreover, there are major differences between national and local opinions on what may be considered the best policy. Nor are all these issues best dealt with through political decisions. For example, high growth and sound competition are more important for employment than political measures. That would not, however, prevent the EU’s Member States from cooperating and exchanging ideas in the social sphere.</p>
<p class="contents">Closely linked to social and employment policy is, of course, the tax burden. We are therefore also voting against European coordination in the area of tax. Taxes should be decided upon as close to the people as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Social issues, equality, sustainable development and increased employment are important issues. We wholeheartedly support many of the ideas – though far from all of them – presented in Mr Bullmann’s report, but at national or local level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The justified ambition to achieve social security for everyone was not translated into a fairer distribution of existing work by means of a general cut in working hours, early retirement and an increase in public services, but into a desire to achieve yet more economic growth for private businesses instead. This growth and the competition with the two other economic superpowers means that existing public services in the field of public transport, energy supply, postal services and telecommunications, again have to be taken over by large international concerns. This is a disastrous route because it makes our people dependent on competition, and as soon as Europe loses this competitive battle, it will plunge our continent into a deep economic crisis. Moreover, privatisation leads to our democratically elected parliamentarians having less say and to pressure being exerted to save on labour costs. This is why the idea of a ‘social Europe’, as backed by some advocates of the Lisbon decisions, will not get off the ground; a ‘Europe of capital’ will emerge instead. Unfortunately, the Bullman report continues on this wrong path of confusing ‘social’ with ‘capital’ but, according to the Right, this is not yet taking things far enough. This is, for me, a reason to vote against. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Why is this matter the subject of so much debate, particularly in this important Chamber where it is usual for a great many people to listen to me, as you can see, including Mr Dell’Utri and Mr Fiori, who, as always, are among those who are listening most carefully to my explanations of vote? I am sure they will agree with me that it would have been better not to have talked about the economic consequences of the terrorist attacks at all. It would be better never to talk about the consequences of terrorist acts, for in discussing them we increase their effect and unwittingly further the designs of the perpetrators of the acts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In practice, we have ignored the issues that affect European citizens’ living standards and quality of life, such as investment in production, particularly public investment, the maintenance of wage increases that are in line with and boost productivity, the profound inequalities in income distribution, high unemployment and poverty. These objectives have suffered as a result of the inflexibility of the monetary policy underpinning the euro and which will, in the long term, lead to greater difficulties or an unwanted increase in flexibility in other areas, specifically in employment contracts and labour in general.</p>
<p class="contents">It should therefore come as no surprise that a report which is supposed to address the ways in which we can support the sectors directly affected by the attacks of 11 September ultimately turns out to be a reaffirmation of the prevailing dogma. It states that, in Barcelona, we need to step up the liberalisations and reforms of the labour market and blindly comply with the objectives outlined in the Stability Pact without taking account of the problems of the stage in the cycle that we have now reached.</p>
<p class="contents">The report does, however, raise two positive issues: it states that companies must not use 11 September as an excuse to make employees redundant and insists that the European Central Bank should reduce its key interest rate. Nevertheless, in view of its initial ideas, we can only vote against this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The impunity enjoyed by all of the aforementioned should cease and we support the struggle being led by the democratic and progressive movements on this issue. We should be able to judge the crimes of the past and provide the tools to be able to judge those of the future. It is important that the peoples of the world take up this issue. However, within the current framework, which is hostage to the post-11 September attack on freedom, this court risks becoming, at best, an instrument without power or resources, and, at worst, an institution manipulated by the powerful few, being able to take action against all those who question the established order.

An international judicial body which prosecutes crimes against humanity must be totally independent, of which there is no guarantee in the case of the ICC, because it is closely tied to the United Nations Security Council. This means that we cannot discount the risk of its being used as a political instrument by the ‘winners’ against the ‘losers’, an instrument of the law of the ‘strongest’. Let us remember the unacceptable example of the ‘ad hoc’ Court established for the former Yugoslavia.</p>

This is essentially the American position as well. Their principal problem (and it affects us as well since we contribute more UN peacemakers than any other country) is that the provisions regarding what is known as "command responsibility" are so loosely drawn that the crimes of individual soldiers or groups of soldiers could result in military and political leaders up the chain being indicted for actions which they did not plan, participate in or even have foreknowledge of. The Americans have constantly referred to the risk of malicious prosecution and we support their concerns. That is one reason why Conservatives voted against it in April of last year, and that remains our position.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, therefore, not a question of being 'Little Englanders' but of countries with real international responsibilities being careful of what they sign. Clinton signed at the last moment but made a (public) declaration recommending that his successor should not present the treaty to the Senate for ratification. Bush has said he will not do that and there is virtually zero support for it in the Senate anyway.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also the problem of Paragraph a) in the composite resolution which suggests that terrorists who commit war crimes and crimes against humanity can be tried under the Court's provisions. This is vigorously disputed by many legal experts (including the House of Commons Library) and governments, some of whom made sure at Rome that terrorist acts were not specifically included in the Statute. I would refer you to the ratification declaration by the French government which states that "The Government of the French Republic considers that the term '"armed conflict" in Article 8 paragraphs 2 (b) and (c), in and of itself and in its context refers to a situation of a kind which does not include the commission of ordinary crimes, including acts of terrorism, whether collective or isolated."</p>
<p class="contents">The British government made a similar declaration in June 1999 hoping that a way could be found to get agreement on the inclusion of terrorist acts in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">After September 11, it is obviously more difficult to say that everyone except terrorists should be covered by its provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">To say that they can be covered is one way of trying to square the circle, but it is a contested interpretation to say the least.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also the problem raised by Tories like Douglas Hurd in the Lords regarding the problems it might pose for the settlement of international disputes, although that concern is mitigated to some extent by the residual power of the UN Security Council to prevent a prosecution in the interests of international peace and security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Obviously, one of the reasons it is being prosecuted and will probably be outlawed is because there is every likelihood of its winning a large number of seats in parliament at the next elections.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, in principle, a good thing that the European Parliament intends to call on the Turkish government to stop persecuting this party. But we should not forget that it is not the only political party being persecuted. Other parties have been banned or are in the process of being banned.</p>
<p class="contents">According to Article 96 of the law on political parties in Turkey, any party with the word 'Communist' in its name is banned. That is why the newly-founded Communist Party of Greece was warned by the Turkish judicial authorities that it would be banned unless it changed its name, with party members subsequently being arrested during the course of their political activities and attacks on their offices.</p>
<p class="contents">There are still thousands of political prisoners being held in wretched conditions, mainly in F-type solitary confinement cells. It was because of this that political prisoners went on hunger strike and many of them and many of the relatives and partners supporting them have since died. And the hunger strike to the death which started on 20 October 2000 still continues, with dozens already dead.</p>
<p class="contents">We demand that the European Parliament join with the Turkish democrats in calling for political parties to be allowed to go about their business, for freedom of expression to be introduced and, more generally, for democratic rights and freedoms to be respected and that it call for political prisoners to be released and for the so-called F-type cells to be abolished or for the proposal made by Turkish law societies and other social bodies for three cells to be joined together, now referred to as the 'three doors, three locks' proposal, to be accepted</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously a lot of people, including in this Chamber, deliberately talk of progress in Turkey, knowing that, to all intents and purposes, there is no progress or that, in certain sectors, things have got worse. They want no change to the status quo, so that it is easier for them to exploit Turkey's market, its cheap labour and its geopolitical position. Nor do they explain why there are still insurmountable obstacles to the Kurdish culture and language, why more than 10 000 political prisoners are languishing in gaol in what we know to be wretched conditions, why political parties which oppose the policies of the Turkish regime are being banned or are threatened with being banned, why democratic freedom fighters are being arrested and murdered on a daily basis and why the 'democratic' Republic of Turkey is still being run by its army.</p>
<p class="contents">We stand by the people of Turkey in their struggle to establish democracy and progress. We denounce the efforts being made to muzzle them and the support being given to the regime by those looking to their own imperialist interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is still not the case in Turkey. Everyone has to bow to the dominant language and culture and to the majority view concerning the lack of rights of ethnic minorities in that country. Anyone who talks a different language, hoists a different flag or forms a party which achieves particularly good results in a specific part of the country is accused of separatism, and residents of regions where a minority forms the majority have suffered much destruction and repression. An ethnic massacre in the past, the one targeted at Armenians in 1915, is still being denied, maybe because the Turkish authorities want to retain the option of doing something similar in the future. The Turkish state does recognise other new states in Europe, including Bosnia-Herzegovina, Lithuania or Slovakia, but is extremely anxious about the modest requests for self-government and cultural rights of a very large minority people in its own country. For many years, systematic attempts have been made to keep Kurdish parliamentarians outside the Turkish parliament by introducing a 10% election threshold and a ban on political parties. It is therefore important for a European Parliament majority to make it clear to Turkey that it will never acquire a place within the European Union as long as ethnic inequality and repression continue to exist. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is with great satisfaction that I note that Amendment No 12 was rejected. The result of the vote was 391 against, 96 in favour and 15 abstentions. It was aimed at removing the clear and insistent exhortation in paragraph 15, in which the European Parliament ‘reiterates in this respect the position in its resolution of 18 June 1987 recognising the genocide upon Armenians in 1915 and calls upon Turkey to create a basis for reconciliation’.</p>
<p class="contents">From having been a core Armenian area up until 1915, the north-eastern part of Turkey has now been almost emptied of all its Armenian population. In the interests of its own future, there is no other way for Turkey to proceed than to acknowledge the genocide and to seek reconciliation with, and provide compensation to, the Armenian population and those in the vicinity of Armenia. Only in that way can Turkey as a country and the Turks as a people avoid being haunted by their own history.</p>
<p class="contents">The politicians and people of Turkey have a lot to learn from the way in which Germany and the German people acted following the extermination of the Jews in the Holocaust of the Second World War. I would like to believe that the Turks are prepared to embark upon that path. It is definitely in Turkey’s own interests to endeavour to become a European state based on human rights with full respect for religious freedom and the rights of minorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have to say that we are assisted in this by many of our town mayors, for they ensure that the buses are always full of people during the rush hour and thus discourage the citizens from using buses and encourage them to travel by bicycle instead, for the cost of public transport is always exorbitant. Thus, the citizens and workers prefer bicycles, which cost nothing to ride, to public transport.

It was good for individual freedom and good for the economy. Attention was devoted only to promoting traffic safety, so as to restrict the number of fatal accidents. These accidents were considered to be the only drawback. We now know that air pollution and noise also adversely affect many who do not drive very often, that professional drivers suffer from a lack of normal physical activity and that many pedestrians and cyclists become the victims of the increase in motorised traffic. The rapporteur is right to draw attention to this issue, and seeks the solution in the form of a ‘health assessment’ for all transport projects and transport measures. I have backed her in this right from the word go. I regret the fact that she is not being taken entirely seriously, particularly by representatives of the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats, and that this group has claimed that the European Union does not really have a role to play in this area. It is time we did away with the misconception that only the promotion of economic growth and large-scale projects is important. In order to survive in a society that has undergone massive change, mainly due to technical progress, human beings and the environment need more protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
