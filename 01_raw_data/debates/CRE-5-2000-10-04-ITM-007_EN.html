From reading his report it is clear that if three conditions are met, there is every reason to be optimistic that we can make a success of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">These three conditions are firstly that the Commission makes a success of its own pre-accession strategy, particularly in the areas of regional policy, agricultural policy and environmental policy. Secondly, that the candidate countries continue to make the good progress that they are making towards meeting the Copenhagen criteria and towards the full and complete enforcement of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> in advance of accession. Thirdly, perhaps the most difficult, that the Council agrees new institutional arrangements that allow the Community to function efficiently, effectively and democratically after enlargement.

The rapporteurs choose to ignore the fact that all of these countries are riddled with social inequality, that the standard of living of the majority of the population is very low and that unemployment is rife in all of these areas. They underestimate the ethnic minority problem. They say nothing about the resurgence of nationalist tendencies, and do not even bother to name the large Turkic-speaking minorities in the Balkans, and the ethnic Russians in the Baltic States, in order to avoid having to comment on the ordeal imposed on such people as a result, for example, of their being denied the right to citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if these countries, in particular those in Eastern Europe, are integrated, this will occur in line with the balance of power. By this I mean they will have a subordinate role in relation to the three great powers: Germany France and the United Kingdom, either individually or all together. The economies of these countries are already at the mercy of the law laid down by the great European trusts. Integrating these countries into the Union will do nothing to change the nature of these relationships in any way.</p>
<p class="contents">So, whether we limit the European Union to 15 countries or enlarge it to 27, it will always be a creation designed to serve the interests of capital, and the workers of Europe have no hope of improving their situation. That is why we voted the way we did. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Admittedly, this report has the merit of providing an insight into the immensity of the task that awaits us if we wish, not even to bring the candidate countries of Eastern Europe up to the level of development of the West, but simply to establish conditions for peaceful coexistence and a gradual rapprochement between the two areas that would not be too destabilising for either side.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the report’s technical amendments deserve our wholehearted support, for example, those on food safety, the dismantling of first generation nuclear power stations, environmental protection, the fight against social dumping and the crucial code of conduct for Western businesses operating in the East, etc. The task is huge and also a matter of the utmost priority. If we had to give reasons for the existence of the European Union today, top of the list would be the huge task of closing the gulf that Communism created between the two halves of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, from the institutional point of view, the Brok report falls in completely with the standard Brussels ready-made way of thinking: it takes the view that enlargement consists of bringing Greater Europe into the institutions of Little Europe. The problem is that these institutions were not designed for that purpose, and their capacity is far too limited.</p>
<p class="contents">The statements that we find most unacceptable are to be found in the combination of several paragraphs of the resolution for which the European Parliament voted: firstly, paragraph 27 and those that follow, which imply that full participation in the single currency, even if not immediately, must be a condition for membership. Then there is paragraph 19, which “emphasises that acceptance of the provisions laid down regarding Economic and Monetary Union rules out any possibility of opting out and represents a commitment to a global, irreversible political project.”</p>
<p class="contents">It is unacceptable that participation in the euro should be a condition for accession, since several Members already benefit from exemptions. It is even more unacceptable to seek to turn this participation into a commitment to a global and irreversible political project. This paragraph alone justifies all the fears that our Danish friends have expressed in recent weeks during the referendum campaign, and which, quite rightly, were the reason for their “no” vote. If they had been able to read this report beforehand, the amount of people voting “no” would probably have been 80% rather than 53%.</p>
<p class="contents">Many other passages in the European Parliament’s resolution are equally unacceptable. Paragraph 45, for example, requires candidate countries to grant the freedom to purchase land to nationals of Member States. This provision raises a very serious issue, given the disparity between levels of purchasing power. Furthermore, this is the type of problem that was taken into account in 1992, in Protocol No 1 of the Maastricht Treaty, in order to grant an exemption allowing the Danes to maintain their restrictions on the purchase of second homes by non-residents. Here too, we do not see why exemptions that already exist in the Union could not be granted to candidate countries, in order to help them.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 65 is another example of Brussels’s desire to dominate and unify, stating that the non-discrimination clause provided for in Article 13 of the EC Treaty is part of the ‘<span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>’ and insisting that “legislation derived from this article be fully implemented in the CEECs”. Even if one approves of the principles of Article 13, it is quite clear that derived legislation that the European Union may draw from it sometimes goes too far, and that there are no grounds for refusing candidate countries the right to cultural diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, the Brok report gives a completely mistaken and even dangerous vision of enlargement, which consists of unilaterally imposing every last aspect of the legislation and the institutions of the European Union on the countries of Eastern Europe. What we should be doing instead is creating institutions for a Greater Europe, which, whilst stimulating development in Eastern Europe, will allow sovereignties and differences to be expressed. This excellent principle should, moreover, be applied within the European Union as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We find much to criticise in the fact that the EU is going in and setting the agenda for internal factors, as well as linking participation in Economic and Monetary Union with the coordination of social policies. I refer in particular to paragraph 19 of the report’s draft resolution in which it is stated that the European Parliament ‘emphasises that acceptance of the provisions laid down regarding Economic and Monetary Union rules out any possibility of opting out and represents a commitment to a global, irreversible political project … which does not mean mere membership of a currency area but which greatly entails coordination of economic and social policies’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Enlargement towards the countries of Eastern and Central Europe (CEEC), Cyprus and Malta has been called an ‘historic task’ for the European Union. This phrase gives us an idea of the scale of the issues that have been grafted onto the process. Extending the European Union, at least in the first stage, to more than 100 million new citizens, will provide new impetus for the development and integration of the European economy as a whole. The accession of new Member States will provide the Union with further weight and influence on the international stage.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, there are still considerable difficulties to overcome, particularly in terms of budgets. The first wave of new Member States could increase Europe’s population by more than a quarter, taking it to almost 500 million people, whilst the total GDP of the European Union would increase by only 5% at the most. Despite the enormous efforts that these countries have made, integrating them into existing structures and programmes will be a particularly tricky task.</p>
<p class="contents">The report we have been debating today seeks to provide an update on the progress that has been made in accession negotiations with all the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The report urges the Commission and the Council to ensure that the principle of differentiation, as defined in Helsinki, is implemented to the letter, so that each country is judged on its own merits. The candidate countries themselves must continue their efforts to strengthen their administrative capacities for the implementation and enforcement of the Community <span class="italic">aquis</span>. They are also asked to build up effective financial control and audit procedures in order to effectively control the use of the pre-accession funds. Furthermore, they would under no circumstances be able to demand an opt-out clause in the context of the EMU.</p>
<p class="contents">We are making many demands of the candidate countries, but at the same time, the European Union too has its duties: it is obliged to implement the reforms necessary for enlargement. The forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference is due to look at improving the European Union’s institutional framework.</p>
<p class="contents">To return to the budgetary aspect, I think it is crucial that we study the budgetary consequences of such a large number of new Member States joining before the end of the current financial cycle in 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I wish to stress the fact that the enlargement process must be a gradual one, following the pace at which the candidate countries are making the necessary changes. That is why I, like several of my fellow Members, do not feel it would be wise to set deadlines.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to remind you that this process must not cause us to neglect the cooperation with the countries on all sides of the Mediterranean to which we are committed! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">His report clearly sets out the issues and the objectives of enlargement in the field of regional policy and he does so in both political as well as financial terms.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say that this is both a forward-looking and realistic report.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement with the addition of thirteen countries changes not only the geopolitical framework of the European Union, but also its structure, because the total population will increase (by 28%), but so will the number of ‘disadvantaged’ regions. We must be aware of this! The rapporteur tells us that out of the 50 regions in the candidate countries, 48 have a per capita GDP that is less than 75% of the average in the Europe of Fifteen for the period 1995-1997. The only regions to have higher levels are Prague (119%) and Bratislava (96%).</p>
<p class="contents">This shows us once again that the disparities between rich and poor regions are also enormous in these countries, and that these disparities will not cease to exist after these countries have joined the Union. We must therefore try to ensure that the administrative structures of these countries are able effectively to absorb Structural Fund appropriations. In order for this to happen, candidate countries need aid, particularly through the PHARE programme. They must have a sound and responsible administration, staffed by men and women who are trained in Community procedures and in budgetary rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the report reminds us of the need to devise new criteria for regional policy for the period 2006-2013, because once enlargement has taken place, the approach to a regional policy for 25 countries will not be the same as it was for 15! We need to devise a new strategy based on the European Spatial Development Perspective (ESDP). A global vision of Community territory would therefore seem essential for better regional development.</p>

This date must be based upon negotiations with the country concerned, in which account is taken of the major difficulties the candidate country has in making the required adjustments. If the country so wishes, it should be possible to extend the the transition period.</p>
<p class="contents">2. Enlargement will demand significant outlay on the part of the EU which must be offset by savings in the agricultural and military fields and in the area of the structural funds.</p>
<p class="contents">3. When the candidate countries accede to the EU, they must be treated in the same way as all the other EU Member States. Under no circumstances can we accept a situation in which new Member States are treated as second class members.</p>
<p class="contents">4. It is unfortunate that the report has taken no account at all of the position and conditions of women in the adjustment process.</p>
<p class="contents">5. Contrary to normal practice, the rapporteur has chosen to include various appendices as a second part of the report itself.

That is why I have voted in favour of the Brok report. This is an excellent report which, as well as analysing the progress made and the difficulties still facing the countries with which negotiations have begun, also serves as a reminder to the public of the political and ethical commitment which the European Union, this Parliament, has made, not only to the candidate countries which wish to share our European history, and have the right to do so, but also to the political project of European integration itself. I believe that enlargement will not only favour the prosperity and economic growth of the candidate countries and, by extension, that of the current Member States of the Union, but will, above all, also provide a guarantee of peace and stability in Europe and thereby offer the European Union the opportunity to finish the task of ensuring peace in Europe, which began fifty years ago. We must remind those people who have no sense of solidarity and are concerned about the economic cost of enlargement, that the prize of peace fully justifies this cost. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Each enlargement has required long-term preparatory measures as well as transitional and special arrangements, often lasting for several years. I believe that we are right to expect the applicant States of Central and Eastern Europe to implement similar special and transitional measures. We should also do well to remember that, because of the great economic and social significance of farming and its output, a competitive agricultural and food-supply structure will be a vitally important factor in the success of these countries' transformation and restructuring processes.</p>
<p class="contents">Agriculture is a domain which is largely regulated on the basis of uniform binding European rules and regulations. National powers are greatly restricted. Whether we like it or not, almost 50% of the EU budget has to be spent on the maintenance of this agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It was decided in Berlin to allocate approximately EUR 3.1 billion a year to the gradual integration of the applicant countries for the period from 2000 to 2006, which amounts to a total of about EUR 21.8 billion, and to earmark a further EUR 58.1 billion for enlargement from the year 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">From where we stand at present, this financial framework will not suffice in resolving the complicated processes involved in the forthcoming round of integrations, especially from the point of view of ensuring that they are socially acceptable. The financial framework for the enlargement of the Union, however, can only be facilitated through a rise in the current Member States' contributions and not through constant cuts in planned expenditure on the various Community policies. This is a truth that has to be told. The opposite approach would drive a wedge through the farming community and endanger the social development of rural areas throughout Europe. According to an old German saying, if the farmers are thriving the state will thrive. There is a great deal of wisdom in that saying, and it is still applicable today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although it may be difficult to have the various sensitivities, histories and, sometimes, contradictions live side by side, enlargement must adhere to this concept of peace and take part in the creation of a community that transcends ancient geographical and ideological borders, guided by common values and rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, in order to prevent Europe becoming nothing more than a free trade area, the European Union must provide clear answers to the institutional, social and economic questions that enlargement is bound to raise.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, as of now, adopt a pragmatic approach to the implications of a Europe not of 15, but of 25 or 30. We must respond in an appropriate way to this enlargement which will considerably increase the number of poorer regions, and think carefully together about the risk of accentuating imbalances in Europe, in order to ensure that Europe does not become one huge heterogeneous mass.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we must show imagination in reformulating the criteria for granting structural aid, in order to guarantee appropriate support for the poorest regions of the candidate countries, as well as those in the current Member States. For this reason, I hope that the outermost regions, six out of seven of which always feature amongst the ten poorest in the EU, benefit from the Structural Funds, no longer just according to the sole criterion of GDP but also according to geographical, demographic and, especially, social indicators. Enlargement must not be financed by the poorest regions.</p>
<p class="contents">This concept must guide institutional, economic and financial reforms throughout the accession process. Only on these terms will it be understood and accepted that the principle of solidarity, which aims to improve economic and social cohesion within the EU, will become a reality.</p>

<p class="contents">Consequently, in most Member States, neither the citizens not the parliaments have deliberated on the principle and conditions of enlargement. The issue of time limits is crucial both for the citizens of the countries of the East and for the European Union. A number of major preliminary conditions must be lifted.</p>
<p class="contents">Until the definition of a political and social Europe is made clear, not only in order to overcome the obstacle of the proper technical operation of the decision to be taken at 23 months but also in order to define the framework of the values, common social and citizenship models, enlargement will entail running more risks than it creates opportunities. There is a risk of the European Union being watered down politically and of social dumping, and, lastly, that the project of European integration will be reduced to the creation of one large marketplace, an area of free competition. That particular plan is one that the public rejects. It is a dangerous route.</p>
<p class="contents">A headlong rush into enlargement, under such conditions, would be liable to aggravate the sidelong shifts towards the populist and fascistic which are appearing here and there.</p>
<p class="contents">As a matter of urgency, we must unambiguously consult the national parliaments and the citizens. As a matter of urgency, we must review the time schedule. As a matter of urgency, we must set a framework for social convergence, harmonising social standards upwards.

I abstained in the vote on this never-ending resolution on enlargement because I believe that Parliament would be doing a disservice to the politically important and worthy cause of eastward and southward enlargement of the European Union to the south and east with this semi-digestible screed of paper.</p>
<p class="contents">I even fear that this collection of country reports and comparative reports will prove counterproductive, particularly in the countries that have applied for membership of the European Union, and more especially in the applicant countries of Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The impact of this long-winded resolution of 127 paragraphs, indeed, is liable to be in inverse proportion to its length. We should have made do with the country reports, adding at most a short, yet succinct resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Our purpose, after all, should be to send the right signal from here, saying that we want these countries’ accession and that it should not be delayed, but also making it clear that enlargement must be economically, socially and financially manageable, both for the applicant countries and for the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">A realistic approach to manageability is not procrastination – it is quite the opposite.</p>
<p class="contents">For many good reasons, not least among which is the desire to safeguard a lasting peace, we want the unification of the whole of Europe, which is the only way to exclude the wars that my parents and I have experienced. That, in a few words, should have been our message today.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot and should not expect the applicant countries to go further than we ourselves have been able to go in implementing the established body of Community law and practice – the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">Reading the section of the resolution entitled ‘Enlargement and Equal Opportunities’, which states that the adoption of the Community <span class="italic">acquis </span>in the area of equality is a <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> for accession and makes other demands of the applicant countries, I have the impression that all this could be interpreted by those countries as the ultimate bid to block their accession. They should know that in this domain, to which I attach great importance, the Community has not actually come very far. On paper, a great deal <span class="italic">has</span> been achieved in the area of equality of treatment and equal opportunities for men and women, but how do things stand in practice? It so happens that we have a report on equal opportunities for men and women on the agenda for this very sitting, a report which once more illustrates how stunted the body of Community practice still is in this particular area.</p>
<p class="contents">So it would be nothing less than arrogance on our part to expect more of the applicant countries in this domain than we ourselves have been able to achieve in the 25 years since the adoption of the first directives relating to equal opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">This is my view, and the purpose of my abstention was to emphasise that this Parliament would have done better to produce less paper but more substance. I also wanted to send a signal that would be properly understood in the applicant countries, to convey the message that we are in favour of accession but that we, like they, must first be in a position to create the necessary conditions for their membership.</p>
<p class="contents">When I look at what has been done so far to that end at the Intergovernmental Conference, I feel that we have little cause for pride and that we should put our own house in order before imposing prior conditions on the applicant countries, especially when we ourselves have been unable to satisfy these conditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU’s Member States have an historic task which consists in welcoming the countries of Eastern and Central Europe into European cooperation. Enlargement ought not, however, to be regarded as a problem, but must be seen as an opportunity for deepening cooperation on cross-border issues which the States cannot solve on their own. The governments of the EU countries, like the European Parliament, have a significant responsibility for ensuring that the necessary reforms are carried out without delay so that enlargement becomes a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Preparations for enlargement are going slowly. Europe’s leaders must therefore begin to show the political will to accept the challenge posed by enlargement. Clear dates ought to be established for when the negotiations should be completed. Stopping the enlargement process now would be like turning the clock back ten years. That would be fatal for European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most important reforms which must be implemented is a thorough reorganisation of the common agricultural policy. The current system of subsidies, grants and quotas must be replaced by free trade and adaptation to the market. Reform of agricultural policy is necessary not only for economic reasons, but also so that European agriculture might be characterised by efficiency and good quality.</p>
<p class="contents">An extended EU must not create A and B teams in Europe. If Europe is to become whole, the objective must be for all Member States to participate in all areas of cooperation. Obviously, freedom of movement must also apply to the countries of Eastern and Central Europe from their first day of membership. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">1. because I regard this process as a political necessity, and</p>
<p class="contents">2. because I wanted to send the applicant countries a positive signal, since they have made considerable progress on the charted course towards accession.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the problems which undoubtedly exist and which actually affect the present EU Member States more than the applicant countries, I believe that these are outweighed by the opportunities which this enlargement process offers.</p>

<p class="contents">We, for our part, have always stood by the logic of truth, however hard it may be to accept.

<p class="contents">We say this because we have never ignored the fact that obstacles to its implementation would arise at all sorts of levels, and it is true and inevitable that to overcome them will require strong political willpower, new financial means, and above all a thorough analysis of its effects both on the current Member States and on the candidate countries, particularly at the institutional, economic, financial and social levels.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of example, let me repeat that it will not be acceptable to us if it takes place at the expense of the less highly-developed Member States – as suggested by the failure to review the financial perspective – or if it entails an institutional change such as the one that some people are advocating. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In addition to this, I would like to stress three points. Firstly, enlargement cannot be separated from a coherent policy of openness and attentiveness on the part of the European Union towards the east and the south. Cooperation and friendship with the former USSR nations and the Mediterranean must progress alongside the enlargement process.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, enlargement inevitably involves revision of the European Union's financial perspectives, which were conceived and established before the prospect of enlargement was even on the horizon. A larger Europe with more tasks and responsibilities will require fresh, increased financial resources. The urgent need therefore arises to revise the financial perspectives and to increase the financial allocations for pre-accession operations.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the implications of enlargement for the Union's regional policy cannot be overlooked. The policy of cohesion is, at present, necessary and will continue to be so with regard to a large number of regions which are currently classified as Objective 1 areas and which are to be removed from this category after enlargement.</p>

<p class="contents">For me, enlargement is not a question of whether to endorse the entry of certain countries into Europe. Europe and the European Union are two different things: the European Union is a political entity conceived 50 years ago whereas Europe is a geographical, historical, political, cultural and social entity whose origins lie in the mists of time. To become part of the European Union one needs to apply, whereas one becomes part of Europe by birth, through a blood tie which unites all the people of this wonderful continent.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget this when we discuss enlargement. We are here – and this is right and proper – to assess economic, political and social criteria, but we must be careful not to empty of all significance an act which is in many respects inevitable and preordained. Take Poland, Hungary or the Czech Republic, to mention but a few of the 'candidate' countries: how could we deny that they share our history, our culture and our origins?</p>
<p class="contents">This is not, of course, an invitation to shirk our responsibilities: we cannot forgo evaluating the transposal of the Community <span class="italic">acquis</span>, just as it is necessary for the Union to make good the commitments it has made to these States under the pre-accession strategy. We must not underestimate the need for healthy pragmatism in our handling of this extremely delicate transition stage, to avoid unnecessary clashes of principles. In general, we are all in favour of enlargement, but this will only fully come about when the candidate countries have carried out the necessary structural reforms, when the European Union's institutions and decision-making processes are capable of handling such a situation and, most importantly, when we at last realise that Europe is not a question of political status but, more than anything else, a story of roots and common history, blood, sweat and tears, dreams and visions, which unite us above and beyond political and economic issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would stress, in particular that, as Mrs Carlsson's report states, 99% of all Estonian companies are small and medium-sized businesses. This is certainly positive and we should congratulate the Republic of Estonia on this and its other merits. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore very positive that accession negotiations with all applicant countries have made progress. The applicant countries must be able to join the European Union according to the headway they have made. In the talks, therefore, the principle of differentiation must be applied. Bunching the applicant countries geographically and staggering their accession dates according to regional criteria are unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement will also benefit the present members of the European Union. Its political and macro-economic benefits will be greater than the additional costs the Member States will incur. The EU already benefits from the growing surplus in trade with the applicant countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is to be hoped that the governments of the applicant countries will continue strengthening their administrative capacity so that the EU’s <span class="italic">acquis communautaire </span>can be implemented in these countries prior to accession.</p>
<p class="contents">Estonia’s rapid progress in preparing for membership is especially positive for Finland. Our neighbouring country has struggled with determination over the last decade to meet the criteria of membership. With respect to the question of Estonia’s minorities, the important language law, which was passed in June 2000, is in accordance with all international norms. Furthermore, the economic transition process has been a positive one. A speedy solution to the questions that remain is to be hoped for from the point of view of all parties. The government of Estonia should pay added attention to the fight against corruption and drug trafficking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Even though this good report masks an occasionally disparate real situation – Mrs Schroedter’s report highlights the difficult situation of rural areas or again the slowness of the necessary adaptation of public administration – the fact remains that Latvia has, nonetheless, reoriented its policy in such a way as to become, unquestionably, a member of the European family in the way this is usually understood in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">And it is this feeling – or lack thereof – much more than meticulous analyses of the accounts, which should, when the time comes, govern our choices regarding enlargement as European integration ceases to have any meaning if it is no longer primarily political.</p>
<p class="contents">The pettifoggery intended to alter the frame of reference used to view events when they run counter to the slightly too rigid technocratic and monetary dogma – this House’s astounding indifference in the fact of the outcome of the Danish referendum is a splendid, worrying example of this – should not be used as a benchmark for a debate of this importance.</p>
<p class="contents">Latvia is entitled to its place in this forum, not only because, on the whole, the progress it has made has earned it the right to this ‘allocation of confidence’ that is essential in order to successfully concluded negotiations of this type, but more especially, and above all, because Latvia is at home in Europe as a European country.</p>
<p class="contents">And so, in agreement with the observations and comments made by the rapporteur, I therefore welcome this dialogue and the prospects it gives rise to. I hope that Latvia will have the opportunity to add the wealth of its own special characteristics to a European Union which I too hope will, in the meantime, have opted to reorganise itself into a coherent political body that respects nations and their sovereignty, rather than a muddled board of shareholders of unequal standing that have lost sight of their primary objective, which is to build a strong, independent Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let me remind you that the agreement between Europe and Poland was signed in December 1991 and came into force in February 1994. On 5 April 1994, the Polish Government made its official request for membership of the European Union and, on 31 March 1998, negotiations were officially opened.</p>
<p class="contents">Poland is today, in terms of the extent of its territory and population numbers, the country which has the most ‘specific gravity’ of all the candidate countries. By dint of its geographical position it represents an extremely important factor in the stability of the future geopolitical position of the European Union. Furthermore, Poland is an economic partner of substance, given that it represents the European Union’s fourth export market after the United States, Switzerland and Japan.</p>
<p class="contents">Accession negotiations with Poland have entered a crucial phase with the opening of all the chapters, including the very important chapter of agriculture. The European Commission has published the second report on Poland's progress along the path to accession. It notes that a great deal of progress has been made thanks to the efforts made by this country, particularly in terms of adopting the Community acquis. Moreover, Poland fully respects human rights and fundamental freedoms. Progress is also evident in the field of the environment, where the ‘National Fund for Protection of the Environment’ has been implemented and the ‘polluter pays’ principle applied. In terms of its foreign relations, the Polish Government has paid special attention to the matter of its borders with the region of Kaliningrad, Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine by stepping up institutional and administrative resources, particularly border police.</p>
<p class="contents">Problems still remain. According to the Commission, Poland has not yet achieved satisfactory results in terms of increasing the efficiency of its legal system. The country should, moreover, make greater efforts to combat corruption. In economic terms, the Commission document points out that Poland’s principal challenge is to increase the rate of reform and privatisation, especially in the agricultural sector. Restructuring of the agricultural sector would appear to be necessary in a country where the rural population represents 38 % of the total population and accounts for 4.9 % of the GDP, and where agricultural employment is estimated at 27.4 % compared with 5 % within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I am fully aware that the Polish authorities consider that Poland will be ready for accession by 31 December 2002. This is not perhaps quite so obvious to the Polish population which is still generally very Euro-sceptical. That is why, although I think it premature to set a precise date at the present moment, it is certain that this candidate country will be among the first to join the European Union!</p>
<p class="contents">We have given certain undertakings. Poland is making considerable efforts. The date and precise arrangements for accession must be set by common agreement and not in an antagonistic way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The historic, cultural and even emotional links which my country has maintained for centuries with Poland make us French perhaps more sensitive than others to the nature of the welcome which should be reserved for a nation which, almost single-handedly, sums up all the glories and all the tragedies in the experience of this continent of ours.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarded for far too long as the prime battleground for neighbouring aggressors, who always saw the annexation of Poland as the first stop on their expansionist itinerary, the unwilling arena for one of the most abhorrent tragedies in history, and subsequently left for decades to oppression by a totalitarian regime which, encouraged by our culpable silence, thought that it could finally quash Poland’s legendary spirit of resistance, Poland has never ceased to demonstrate forcefully the values of freedom, courage and independence, all those shared values that form the foundation stone on which our construction of a political Europe is supposed to stand.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore have a duty to embrace Poland as a Member as soon as possible and treat the country as it deserves, as one of our Members for all time. Spare us the doubtful audits and requirements for standardisation that are so inopportune. Blinkered application of these would exacerbate rather than improve the situation in this country. With 25% of the population employed in agriculture, Poland is not Luxembourg, and the debates on the candidate countries’ adoption of the Community acquis<span class="italic"> </span>sometimes take on a surrealist tone, unless we accept the outrageous idea of a multi-speed Europe where, of all the disparities between peoples, only economic disparities actually counted.</p>
<p class="contents">No, Poland deserves better than a conditional welcome. Its past is its best passport, and its dignity its best argument. Most of all, this country, which has ceaselessly fought against all hegemony, will bring us a new but, at the same time, experienced insight enabling us to parry the risks of any new imperialism, even that apparently inoffensive one – which may yet be a harbinger of the worst perils – of noble sentiments and a quiet conscience on the cheap.</p>
<p class="contents">In welcoming Poland to our common home, the European Union will be doing justice to a newcomer, justice that has been denied to it for far too long. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The House has done this in a way which allows the Czech Republic to distance itself by its own efforts from these decrees that are incompatible with human rights. I call on Prague to respond to this signal, this challenge, this plea for dialogue, to grant our request and to ensure, together with our House, that this legacy of a nationalist era can be consigned to the past.</p>

The Czech Government’s attitude is unacceptable. At a time when there was mounting concern about the safety of putting Temelin into operation, it had declared that henceforth it intended deeds to speak louder than words.</p>
<p class="contents">The German environment minister put his finger on the problem in a recent interview. He asked whether the Czechs want to join the EU in a community spirit or a spirit of defiance. At present, all the signs seem to indicate that defiance rather than reason is the mainspring for the Czech Government’s actions. If the Czech Republic joins the Union without the considerable safety risks of Temelin being resolved, it may well prove difficult in future to persuade other candidates for accession to take the nuclear safety requirement seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I think it is quite crucial to check whether the Beneš decrees and AVNOJ provisions, which were used to justify persecution, robbery and murder, are compatible with European Union law. We would welcome their repeal as signalling an active process of coming to terms with the past and as a step towards creating a new basis of understanding between peoples. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It correctly underlines the fact that improving the conditions of the Roma, reforming the legal system, cracking down on corruption and upgrading environmental policies will help to ensure that the accession negotiations move forward. Of special importance is Paragraph 13 on the widespread support across the European Union for Bulgaria’s removal from the list of countries requiring a visa for travel into EU Member States. There continues to be a lack of movement in the Council on this, as there is in the case of Bulgaria. Finally, the European Union must openly address the difficulties faced by Bulgaria, which are due to the political and economical destabilisation of the Balkans, the increase in the price of oil, and the international devaluation of the euro, to which the Bulgarian currency is linked by law. Finally, concern must be shown for whole swathes of society in Bulgaria, who are being particularly oppressed because of the austere public policy the country is pursuing as part of its accession strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fourth round of Cyprus proximity talks took place in New York from 12-26 September. The parties have agreed to meet next in Geneva on 1-10 November. The UN settlement process has now lasted since December 1999 without a break, longer than any of the previous attempts to solve the Cyprus problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The UN Secretary-General's Special Adviser on Cyprus, Alvaro de Soto, said at his press briefing on 26 September that a "qualitative step forward" had taken place in the fourth round of talks. He emphasised that, while there is still a long way to go, the two sides had engaged in substance during the talks in a way that they had not done before. He observed that new ground was being broken, which might cause nervousness in some quarters. But he looked forward in the coming months to building on the progress that has already been made. He also noted that the UN was already in contact with the EU in order to ensure that there was no clash with the goals of the United Nations process.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr de Soto noted, we do not expect progress to be easy, and the success of the UN process is far from assured. The UK position is that it is vital for us to do everything we can to show our support for the Secretary-General's efforts. Unfortunately some of the comments made in the draft report on the application by Cyprus for membership of the European Union by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy are not helpful. The use of polemical language and the one-sided impression given of MEPs' views risks undermining the process.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that MEPs will do all they can to encourage the European Parliament to express its support for progress in the UN settlement process, based on the continuing goodwill of all parties in that process and that they will ensure that the European Parliament does not produce statements or take positions which might cut across that process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Commission’s assessment is very positive. Cyprus meets all the Copenhagen political and economic criteria. To date, 16 out of 31 chapters have been closed and the efforts of the Republic of Cyprus to meet all the criteria are ongoing. Cyprus may therefore look forward to becoming a member of the European Union in the near future, and any objection to this membership on the grounds of the special situation of the island would not be defensible either politically or morally. This is, moreover, made clear by the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council, which affirm, in the final analysis, that solution of the ‘Cyprus question’ is not a necessary precondition for accession. In this connection, I would hope that the talks conducted under the auspices of the United Nations will be able to come to a successful conclusion enabling the Greek and Turkish Cypriot populations to enjoy the advantages of membership of the European Union in the context of a reunified republic.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to urge that the European Union, through its High Representative for the CFSP, should get involved to a greater extent in seeking a negotiated solution in order to put an end to the partition of the island, in application of the United Nations Security Council resolutions. The European Union does have the capacity to make a key contribution to the security of the Cypriot communities in the context of a peace settlement. It can help resolve the problem of the controlled return of refugees and the repatriation of colonists, and can make a considerable contribution to the development of the northern part of Cyprus, after reunification and after the withdrawal of the Turkish army. It is essential to initiate projects involving both communities and to encourage dialogue between both parts in a new spirit of trust.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must convince the Turkish Cypriot community, which comprises approximately 89 000 members, that they should get involved unconditionally in the accession talks. It is in their direct interest. Indeed, Cyprus’ accession should benefit both communities and should enable the Turkish Cypriots to make good their economic backwardness. Their per capita income is three times less than that of Greek Cypriots. It is therefore essential for Turkish Cypriots to express their point of view on the accession negotiations. It is not going to be an easy task, given the lack of good will on the part of the Turkish Cypriot side and of Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if recent events in the region do not encourage optimism, the European Union must continue to bring its weight to bear in the talks seeking an overall settlement of the Cyprus question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs Paulsen’s report grasps the extremely serious nature of the situation but does not go far enough in view of the stakes involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The outrages – one no longer dares to speak of mere infringements or minor abuses – in the industrial agro-food processing chain in the context of liberalism, competition and the frenzied thirst for profits, have actually proved lethal, even criminal, it must be said. Deliberate violations of health, criminal and even moral codes by doctoring the laws of nature and tampering with animal species and animal physiology are conducted without being subject to any surveillance or appropriate regulations or any justified penalties.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet we consumers are the last stage in the food chain, and hence the final recipients of the abuses and counterfeits in the food industry. Should we be surprised, then, to find ourselves the victims of these, and even, unfortunately, to yield to them? It is irresponsible and fraudulent to disregard the infinite complexity of the workings and relationships within the industrial agro-food chain in order to admit that it is no longer possible to monitor and separate out exactly what is going on in order to apply appropriate penalties.</p>
<p class="contents">Every link in the chain must be responsible for what it produces and for its precisely identifiable role. The safety bolt guaranteeing this discipline lies in the Commission’s determination to ensure that consumers are provided with consistent quality, at all levels, in the products available on the market. So, in refusing to accept the inclusion of genetically modified foodstuffs as undesirable products, the European Parliament has taken the responsibility of being completely out of step with the public and the people that elected its Members, as consumers are proving to be more and more reluctant on the matter of GMOs, going so far as to reject them outright when they do have the opportunity to identify them in food.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor should we be surprised if the agro-food industry leaps headlong into this breach and banks totally on animal feedingstuffs to consume their GMOs. The ball is now in the Commission’s court. It must make good its omissions by proposing and implementing urgent measures in response to the perfectly justified concerns of consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We must effectively be vigilant in this area as animal feedingstuffs are the first link in the food chain. We are particularly keen to implement in a practical manner at European level this concept of food safety from the stable to the table, or from the pitchfork to the fork.</p>
<p class="contents">The three reports adopted today make it possible to progress in the right direction. The prohibition of undesirable substances in animal feedingstuffs is therefore a basic element in our food safety policy.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, because it is important to set acceptable health limits, and secondly, because it is necessary to prohibit the possibility of diluting contaminated foods in healthy foods in order to make them of a quality fit for consumption. We have the example of the thousands of litres of dioxin-contaminated milk which could be legally watered down with quantities of healthy milk. The principle of this exceptional practice is quite scandalous. Until now, poisoning has been legal provided that it is carried out in infinitesimal doses. Furthermore, the practice of watering down contaminants leaves the way clear for fraud throughout the territory of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The destruction of contaminated foods or food compounds provides a twofold guarantee making it possible to limit the trafficking in this type of food. Firstly, it is guarantee of safety for the consumers who will, naturally, be the first beneficiaries of this measure, and secondly, it is a guarantee for the crop farmers and animal farmers that only health food is available on the market.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons I voted in favour of the ban on dilution proposed by the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">It was, moreover, essential to step up harmonisation of the conditions of performing checks and inspections in the field of animal feedingstuffs. That has now been done. I should now like to see the Council of Ministers moving ahead rapidly and supporting the amendments we have adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the vote by this Parliament deploring the flagrant violations of James' rights under UN international law.</p>
<p class="contents">Mark Rowland of Jubilee Campaign will be absolutely delighted that the European Parliament has joined the UN in condemning his treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">We must continue to condemn human rights abuses in Burma. We, as elected Members, are outraged that 51 democratically elected members of the NLD are in prison, victims like James, of inhuman and cruel abuse. James' only crime was to speak up for and campaign for human rights and democracy in Burma. He should be commended for his efforts, which have caused him and his family such torment.</p>
<p class="contents">We must urge the ASEM countries in this resolution to pressurise the military regime in Burma to restore democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
