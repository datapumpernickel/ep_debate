<p>European foreign policy and European energy security policy are becoming increasingly inseparable. In its report on a common foreign policy on energy, the European Parliament calls for institutional reforms and the creation of an EU solidarity mechanism. This mechanism would, among other things, ensure that Member States’ energy companies have the same access to energy reserves in the event of a disruption to energy supply. This is a complex undertaking. It requires tripartite agreement between the Commission, national governments and energy companies.</p>
<p>Does the Council support Parliament’s proposals? How does the Council envisage the creation of a joint approach by the Member States to foreign policy on energy?</p>
<p>How can links between the European neighbourhood policy, the Central Asia strategy, the Baku initiative and the ‘Black Sea Synergy’ initiative be improved with a view to reinforcing energy cooperation with producer countries?</p>

<p>(PT) This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on the Member States, was not given orally during questions to the Council at the October 2007 session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The development of a common approach to external energy policy is a priority and must be accelerated.</p>
<p>The priorities approved by the European Council in March 2007 for an international energy policy, especially relationships with producer countries, include intensifying the EU’s relationship with Central Asia, the Caspian and the Black Sea regions with a view to further diversifying sources and routes, and intensifying energy relationships with Algeria, Egypt and other producing countries in the Mashreq/Maghreb region.</p>
<p>The guiding principles of this external energy policy, the functioning of the markets and diversification are defined in detail in the joint paper from the Commission/Secretary General/High Representative entitled ‘An External Policy to Serve Europe’s Energy Interests’, endorsed by the European Council in June 2006.</p>
<p>European energy security is another area of priority actions, such as those approved by the European Council in March 2007: the security of supply must be enhanced on the one hand by measures falling within the framework of the internal market, such as the facilitated integration of new power plants into the electricity grid of all Member States, improved regional cross-border exchange and measures to accelerate the development of regional energy cooperation, for example, while addressing the challenges of peripheral energy markets and facilitating the integration of regional ones into the EU internal market.</p>
<p>The European Council also stressed the need to underpin the security of supply in a spirit of solidarity between Member States by developing more effective crisis response mechanisms, on the basis of mutual cooperation and building on existing mechanisms. These mechanisms, which are already in operation, were created in particular by the Council Directive concerning measures to safeguard security of natural gas supply</p>

<p>The Council has not discussed changes in exchange rates either in relation to the euro or in relation to the currencies of Member States that did not adopt the euro as their currency.</p>
<p>What the Euro Group did discuss at its session of 8 October were exchange rate developments in third countries, an issue in relation to which the Euro Group has made its position known:</p>
<p>Emerging economies with current account surpluses should allow their effective exchange rates to adjust –mainly in China;</p>
<p>It was noted that the US authorities have reaffirmed that a strong dollar is in their interest;</p>
<p>As regards the recovery of the Japanese economy, which appears to be sustainable, it is hoped that the markets bear that fact in mind.</p>
<p>In summary, the Euro Group reaffirmed that excessive volatility in foreign exchange markets is undesirable for economic growth, and that exchange rates should reflect the economic fundamentals.</p>
<p>In this respect it should also be remembered that in the same Communication the Euro Group once again stressed its appreciation at how the Euro Area has played its role in gradually reducing global imbalances.</p>
<p>In the recent meeting of the Ministers of Finance of the G7, we informed our partners in the G7 of the Euro Group’s position – including the view that China must allow an accelerated appreciation of its effective exchange rate.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0728"></a>

<p>(PT) This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on the Member States, was not given orally during questions to the Council at the October 2007 session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council was pleased with the signature, by 82 political parties in Chad, both majority and opposition, of the Global Political Agreement of 13 August seeking to reinforce the democratic process in Chad. The agreement is an important step towards consolidating the democratic process in the country. The EU, which signed the agreement with observer status, gave its support to the negotiations without intervening in the process, and participates as a facilitator in the ‘Support and Vigilance Committee’, which was set up through the agreement to ensure that the provisions it established are implemented. The EU will continue to support the reform of the electoral process in Chad with a view to the holding of free and fair elections by the end of 2009. The situation in Chad was also addressed in the conclusions of the Council of 15 and 16 October 2007.</p>
<p>The unanimous approval of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1778 (07) on 25 September made it possible to create a multidimensional United Nations presence in eastern Chad and north-eastern Central African Republic, including an EU military operation. On 15 October 2007 the Council approved a common action relating to the European Union military operation in the Republic of Chad and in the Central African Republic, under the name EUFOR Chad/CAF. This operation will be carried out within the framework of European Security and Defence Policy with a view to helping to protect civilians in danger, particularly refugees and displaced persons, to facilitate humanitarian aid, to contribute to the creation of conditions for displaced people to return voluntarily to their places of origin, and to help to guarantee the security and freedom of movement of UN and associated personnel. It must be stressed that the deployment of this mission falls within the broader framework of EU involvement in resolving the regional implications of the crisis in Sudan.</p>
<p>Various EU countries have informally indicated that they intend to contribute troops to the operation, i.e. France, Ireland, Poland, Sweden, Austria, Belgium, Spain, Greece and Finland. The normal process of establishing the force will be initiated in due course.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0730"></a>

<p>(PT) This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on the Member States, was not given orally during questions to the Council at the October 2007 session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council of 18 June 2007 reiterated its view that the comprehensive proposal of the United Nations Special Envoy, Martti Ahtisaari, provided the basis for the settlement of the Kosovo issue by a new United Nations Security Council resolution. It underlined the necessity of rapidly finding a solution to the Kosovo status issue, which was essential as a basis for a democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo committed to the rule of law, as well as for maintaining and reinforcing regional stability. The Council also underlined that the EU stood ready to play a significant role in the implementation of the definition of the status.</p>
<p>Due to an impasse on the issue in the United Nations Security Council, talks are currently suspended. In a statement on 1 August the United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, welcomed the Contact Group’s initiative to hold fresh talks between Pristina and Belgrade, led by a Troika representing the EU, the Russian Federation and the United States. The United Nations Secretary General asked the Contact Group to report to him by 10 December. On 29 July Secretary General/High Representative Javier Solana appointed Ambassador Wolfgang Ischinger as the EU's representative on the Troika.</p>
<p>The Troika began work in August and has met the parties several times since, in a constructive atmosphere. The first round of direct talks between the Pristina and Belgrade delegations took place in New York on 28 September. On 14 and 22 October, two more rounds of direct and indirect talks took place. The parties have so far maintained their diametrically opposed positions on the Kosovo status issue. Further rounds of negotiations with the parties will be held in November.</p>
<p>The Council of 15 October 2007 expressed its full support to the Troika process and to the EU’s representative, Ambassador Ischinger. It welcomed the intense pace and constructive atmosphere of the first rounds of talks. Noting that the Troika process will be concluded with submission of the Contact Group’s report to the UNSG by 10 December, the Council urged the two parties to engage fully in the remaining rounds of talks and to respond constructively, courageously and with a spirit of compromise, and to make every effort to secure a negotiated settlement of the status of Kosovo.</p>
<p>After concluding the Troika process, the United Nations Secretary General will present a report on its results to the United Nations Security Council.</p>
<p>At present it would be premature to anticipate the results of these processes.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0736"></a>

<p>(PT) This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on the Member States, was not given orally during questions to the Council at the October 2007 session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council shares the honourable Member’s concern regarding the constant decline in biodiversity and ecosystem services in the EU and at global level, and agrees that efforts to halt this tendency must be coordinated and intensified as a matter of urgency, given in particular the short time-span that remains to comply with the 2010 commitments. As the honourable Member knows, in 2001 the Gothenburg European Council established the objective of halting the loss of biodiversity in the EU by 2010. The EU also adopted the global objective of reducing the percentage loss of biodiversity by 2010.</p>
<p>At Community level, legislation on the protection of nature has traditionally remained at the centre of environmental policy, with the Habitats Directive (Directive 92/43/EEC of the Council<a href="#defann_8_1" name="refann_8_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>) and the Birds Directive (Directive 79/409/EEC of the Council<a href="#defann_8_2" name="refann_8_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>), together with the CITES Regulation (EC) No 338/97 of the Council<a href="#defann_8_3" name="refann_8_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>) relating to the protection of species of wild fauna and flora. As the honourable Member will certainly be aware, environmental questions are currently subject to the procedure laid down under Article 251 of the EC Treaty, which means that the European Parliament is co-legislator. At the same time, protected natural areas cannot survive and develop in isolation. The Council therefore urged the Commission and Member States to further strengthen the integration of biodiversity and ecosystem services considerations into policies and programmes in other policy areas, and to use the opportunities provided for in agricultural, rural development, forestry and fisheries policies.</p>
<p>The protection of biodiversity occupies a primary role in the Council’s political agenda. Last December the Council called for the Commission’s EU Action Plan to 2010 and Beyond to be implemented urgently. This Action Plan defines policy areas and the corresponding goals and supporting measures, which are reflected in specific targets and concrete measures.</p>
<p>The Council has continuously highlighted the need to safeguard the most important habitats and species and has called upon the Commission to begin a scientific analysis of species and subsequently of the habitats listed in the annexes to the Habitats Directive. The examination of Member States’ reports under the Habitats Directive may also indicate whether the protection status of particular species needs to be revised. The honourable Member is advised to consult the Commission directly for further information on this process.</p>
<p>At global level the EU is a driving force in the protection of biodiversity and is doing its utmost to apply multilateral environment agreements (MEAs), such as the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and the Convention on Migrating Species (CMS). EU countries adopted a primary role at the 14th Conference of the Parties to CITES (CoP 14), in June 2007, organised by the Netherlands in the Hague. The Council has now initiated the preparatory work for the 9th meeting of the Conference of Parties (CdP 9) to the CBD, to be held in Bonn in May 2008, to ensure that the EU plays an active and constructive role. In addition to this, through the CMS, EU countries are also taking part in a meeting in Scotland with representatives of Africa, Europe and Asia (from 22 to 25 October 2007) to promote the creation of a new potential agreement for the conservation of migrating birds of prey.</p>
<p>Finally, Portugal is to host an important conference of interested parties on business and biodiversity in Lisbon on 12-13 November 2007, in cooperation with the World Conservation Union (IUCN). The objective is to establish partnerships with businesses to preserve biodiversity, which is also important for mobilising new and innovative sources of funding.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(PT) This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on the Member States, was not given orally during questions to the Council at the October 2007 session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council noted with concern the Croatian Parliament’s decision to begin to apply the Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone on 1 January 2008. This decision runs counter to the Conclusions of the European Council of 17 and 18 June 2004, in which the Council noted the Croatian decision not to apply to EU Member States any aspect of the Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone, and welcomed the agreement reached by Italy, Slovenia and Croatia at the Trilateral meeting in Brussels on 4 June 2004. The Negotiating Framework also requires Croatia to take full account of the Conclusions of 17 and 18 June 2004.</p>
<p>Meetings between the interested parties to reach a satisfactory solution have not been fruitful. The EU has repeatedly stressed to Croatia, such as in the most recent meeting of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on 1 and 2 October 2007 in Brussels, for example, the potential consequences for the accession negotiations of its unilateral application of the Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone.</p>

<p>As the honourable Member must be aware, in its session of 1/2 October 2007 the Council held an exchange of views on the European satellite navigation programmes (Galileo and EGNOS) and took note of the submission by the Commission of its Communication of 19 September 2007 entitled ‘Progressing Galileo: Reprofiling the European GNSS Programmes’ and the respective supporting documents, which include an amended proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on the further implementation of the European GNSS programmes and a proposal for a decision of the Budgetary Authority on the revision of the multiannual financial framework.

<p>Following the request of the European Council, which on 21/22 June 2007 reaffirmed the value of Galileo as a key project of the European Union, on 1/2 October 2007 the Council adopted conclusions in which it undertakes to reach an integrated decision on the implementation of the European GNSS programmes before the end of the year.

<p>The Council never discusses allegations in the press.</p>
<p>The Council's position on most of these issues was set out in the conclusions of the Council of December 2006: ‘The EU remains firmly committed to the absolute prohibition of torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and punishment.

In this context, the Council reiterates that human rights, refugee law and international humanitarian law have to be respected and maintained when combating terrorism. The Council will continue to follow closely developments with regard to human rights in combating terrorism and take adequate measures for their protection. The existence of secret detention facilities where detained persons are kept in a legal vacuum is not in conformity with international humanitarian and human rights law.’</p>
<p>In addition to this, EU guidelines on torture establish that the EU shall urge third countries to take the following measures in particular:</p>
<p>– ‘ensure that statements obtained through torture and ill-treatment shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made; (…)</p>
<p>– ensure that no exceptional circumstances whatsoever, including a state of war or a threat of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture or ill-treatment;</p>

<p>The American 'Blackwater' company has set up a private mercenary army, together with special operational units deployed in Iraq, Afghanistan and 56 other countries where they gun down unarmed citizens and terrorise working people in violation of international law.

<p>(PT) This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on the Member States, was not given orally during questions to the Council at the October 2007 session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council maintains that the primary goal of European policy towards Burma /Myanmar involves a peaceful transition to a legitimate civilian government. The EU continues to maintain a balanced policy, reinforcing restrictive measures on the one hand, and increasing assistance to the people of Burma/Myanmar on the other.</p>
<p>As regards the democratic process in the country, the Council refers principally to political and diplomatic instruments to accelerate that change. The EU Heads of Mission recently took two initiatives with the Burmese Government. The Presidency, the High Representative and the Foreign Affairs Commissioner issued a series of declarations urging the authorities to exercise restraint, to release political prisoners and to begin an inclusive dialogue with the parties involved. The Council also expressed its readiness to assist Burma/Myanmar in its process of transition, should the Government in fact decide to follow that route.</p>
<p>At ambassadorial level the EU troika has taken initiatives in various capitals in the region. The Council remains in close and regular contact with its partners in the region, i.e. India, China and ASEAN member countries.</p>
<p>In the ministerial session of 15 October, the Council unequivocally supported the good offices mission of the UN special envoy, Ibrahim Gambari, and backed other UN initiatives, including by the Security Council.</p>
<p>The Council also agreed to reinforce a series of restrictive measures against the Burma/Myanmar regime without harming the population, which is already a victim of pressure. The EU stands ready to review, amend or reinforce such measures in the light of developments on the ground and the results of the mission of Ibrahim Gambari.</p>
<p>As regards humanitarian aid, the EU is among the largest providers of aid to Burma/Myanmar. The European Commission and Member States remain unanimous in their intention to continue to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Burma/Myanmar, and to Burmese refugees in neighbouring countries. The Commission is currently working towards reinforcing that assistance.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0772"></a>

The withdrawal of trade privileges is a welcome move, but the EU has still been one of Burma’s biggest investors and trading partners. Given that discussions regarding the extension of restrictive EU measures against Burma are presently under way, can the Council commit to banning all European companies and citizens from investing in Burma? Can the Council adopt a ban on the import of goods and services from enterprises owned by the military, military personnel and their associates? Can the Council commit to banning the import of strategically important goods such as gems and timber? Can the Council commit to banning international financial transactions from the EU?</p>
<p>Can the Council push for UN Security Council mandatory sanctions against Burma? Together with the UN, can the Council agree to the imposition of targeted sanctions, including a mandatory arms embargo, an investment ban and a ban on Burmese exports of strategically important goods, including gas, oil, gems and timber, until there is irreversible progress toward political transition, or until a democratically elected government in Burma requests that they be lifted?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(PT) This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on the Member States, was not given orally during questions to the Council at the October 2007 session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The EU has maintained an arms embargo against Burma/Myanmar since 1990 and a comprehensive range of independent sanctions since 1996. The restrictive measures have gradually been reinforced and periodically updated since then. The sanctions are aimed at the military regime, people who benefit most from its poor governance and all those who actively frustrate the process of national reconciliation, respect for human rights and democracy.</p>
<p>The restrictive measures now include visa restrictions, a freezing of assets and economic resources covering some 386 people: SPDC (State Peace and Development Council), Regional Commanders and Deputy Regional Commanders, ministers, general military officers (from Brigadier), officials responsible for managing prisons and the police, people who benefit from the Government's economic policy and managers of companies belonging to members of the armed forces and their families; prohibition of the award of loans/credits and of participation in Burmese public companies, covering 41 companies or organisations, an arms embargo and ban on exports of equipment for internal repression; the suspension of non-humanitarian aid programmes (with exceptions in key areas such as health, education and poverty reduction); diplomatic measures, which include the suspension of high-level visits to Burma/Myanmar and the withdrawal of military attachés from the embassies of EU Member States.</p>
<p>Following on from the strong condemnation of the brutal crackdown on demonstrators in Burma/Myanmar at the end of September and the repression plaguing the country, on 15 October the Council decided to increase direct pressure on the regime through stronger measures and additional restrictive measures on exports, imports and investments in the sectors of logs and timber and mining of metals, minerals and precious and semi-precious stones. The EU also backs further active UN engagement, including by the Security Council.</p>
<p>The Council recalls that it has used a wide range of tools to help to improve the situation in Burma/Myanmar, which included full support to the good offices mission of United Nations Special Envoy Ibrahim Gambari and political dialogue with Burma’s neighbouring countries. Expressing solidarity with the people of Burma/Myanmar, substantial humanitarian aid has also been provided to the most vulnerable populations of Burma/Myanmar and to Burmese refugees in neighbouring countries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0765"></a>

<p>My attention has recently been drawn to a problem affecting workers form a Member State, namely Spain, and more precisely individuals from my own region, Galicia, which shares a frontier with Portugal.

As a result, the authorities take action against these citizens, imposing fines, confiscating the vehicle documents and impounding the car, leaving the citizen with two options: either to register the car or to deport it.</p>
<p>We have been told that the Spanish and Portuguese authorities are looking at this issue, thanks to protests made by some of those who have been affected.

<p>Those most affected are Galician workers employed in northern Portugal, especially in the health services. Under Portuguese law, 'crossborder workers' are exempted from the general rules concerning the movement of foreign-registered vehicles in national territory; however, this concept has not been properly defined, and, as a result, Spanish citizens employed in Portugal have been penalised in checks by the Portuguese police for being unable to prove that they meet the legal definition of 'crossborder workers'.</p>
<p>In the absence of a rigorous definition, the risk exists that the lack of clarity in applying these rules will lead to faulty interpretations liable to damage the good relations which we all wish to see between Portugal and Spain in the European context.</p>

The Council’s preparatory bodies are discussing the proposal in detail, and its technical, legal and political implications. Despite the results of the 36th General Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the Council is determined to move forward with a comprehensive approach to the reduction of aviation emissions which is consistent with EU policies and goals and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which includes intensive work on the Commission proposal to include aviation in the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community.</p>

The EU believes that one of the key elements of the post-2012 negotiations is to correct emissions from international aviation in a more economical way, namely by widening and expanding the carbon market. The Council recognises the importance of involving third countries, particularly developing countries, and will continue to pursue efforts at diplomatic level to make it clear to the developing countries how the participation of airlines in the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community can effectively bring net benefits.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0686"></a>

<p>An increasing amount of fraud is being reported and investigated in relation to the use of structural funds intended for southern Italy and in particular the Basilicata region.</p>

<p>Does the Commission not consider there to be a problem concerning the entire institutional and business set-up, especially in the Basilicata region?</p>
<p>Although audits carried by the Commission are performed only as a second line of defence and as part of the annual strategy, will the Commission say whether it intends to take action of any kind in order to check that structural funds are being used properly and to prevent fraud in the Basilicata region?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The total of the Structural Funds allocated to the Basilicata region for the programming period 2000 to 2006 was 848 035 000 €. 433 885 000 was assigned to the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) (51.16%), 220 900 000 to the European Social Fund (ESF) (26.05%) and 193 250 000 (22.79%) to the European Agriculture Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) - Guidance Section. The region of Basilicata is thus allocated about 2.5% of the Community financing to Italy for the programming period 2000-2006.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member is correct in pointing at the increasing number of irregularities reported. There were 80 irregularities from Basilicata in the year 2006 alone. Furthermore, 79 of these 80 irregularities were classified as suspected frauds by the Italian authorities and they involve a sum of about € 3.7 million. They represent about 11% of the number of irregularities reported by Italy. In terms of amounts, the proportion is much lower (1.6%).</p>
<p>Most of the cases reported concern the EAGGF - Guidance section.</p>
<p>However, even though it appears from the statistics that there has been a significant increase in suspected frauds against this very specific fund, the Commission is re-assured by the fact that the control authorities have detected and reported all these cases of irregularities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission has been informed by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) that it has only one case in the follow-up stage relating to the Basilicata Region and no active investigations.</p>
<p>No requests were received from the Italian authorities for OLAF’s assistance in the carrying out of investigations in the Basilicata region in relation to the Structural Funds.</p>
<p>Moreover, with regard to the programming period 2000-2006, the Basilicata Region reported to OLAF, via the central coordination point of the Presidenza del Consiglio dei Ministri – Dipartimento politiche comunitarie, a total of 93 irregularities.</p>
<p>The correct use of the Structural Funds is ensured by several actors at national and Community level. Audits on the use of Structural Funds are carried out both by national authorities and by the competent services of the Commission dealing with Structural Funds (Directorate-General for Regional Policy, Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development and Directorate-General for Fisheries and Maritime Affairs). Each year the Commission receives a report from Italy (in accordance with Article 13 of Regulation 438/2001) related to their management and control systems for assistance granted under the Structural Funds. The report is discussed at the annual bilateral coordination meeting between the Italian authorities and the Commission. This year’s meeting will take place in December.</p>
<p>With regard to the EAGGF - Guidance Section, the Basilicata region was audited in 2004 in the framework of the 2000-2006 programming period. A further audit is planned for December 2007. Following the audit carried out by Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development in 2004 a financial corrections procedure is under way (in accordance with article 39 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999).</p>
<p>With regard to the ERDF, the Basilicata region has not to date been audited in the framework of the programming period 2000-2006. The error rate detected by the national audit authorities is relatively low (0.18%).</p>
<p>In the framework of their annual strategy and audits planned, the audit departments of Directorate-General for Regional Policy (DG REGIO) will soon carry out a risk analysis (whose parameters are defined in advance).</p>
<p>As DG REGIO has moreover not received any information on possible irregularities, it is not possible at present to state whether the Operational Programme of the Basilicata region will be the subject of an audit in the near future.</p>
<p>In relation to the ESF, the Commission would refer the Honourable Member to the response given to his written question <a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2007-4158_EN.html">E-4158/07</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, it is also worthy of mention that the Italian authorities have earlier this month signed an agreement, which harmonises their procedures with those of other Member States in relation to the reporting of frauds and irregularities against the Community budget. This demonstrates the seriousness which the Italian authorities accord to the fight against fraud against the Community budget.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0747"></a>

<p>1. Business activities of Mr. Boomer:</p>
<p>Mr. Richard Boomer has been appointed as a Special Advisor to Vice-President Kallas with the general mandate of advising him in the area of buildings policy, of improving the relationships with the responsible authorities in Brussels and Luxembourg and of optimising the efficiency of the Commission's investments in this area.</p>
<p>Upon his appointment as Special Advisor to Commissioner Kallas for the period from 1 April 2007 to 31 March 2008 and on the basis of the arrangements put in place by the Commission for the recruitment of such Advisors, Mr Boomer has informed the Commission about the other professional activities he continues to exert in addition to his mandate as Special Advisor to the Commissioner. He has given assurance to the Commission that these activities would in no way result in a conflict of interest with his tasks as special advisor.</p>
<p>The Commission is not aware of any shares owned by Mr. Boomer or partnerships he might be involved in which might entail a conflict of interest with his current functions as Special Advisor.</p>
<p>2. Contradiction between the professional activities of Mr. Boomer and the declaration made by Vice-President Kallas at the CoCoBu meeting of 2 May 2007:</p>
<p>The Honourable Member is invited to refer to the information provided under point 1.</p>
<p>3. Access to confidential and relevant information by Mr. Boomer:</p>
<p>First of all, the Commission would like to underline that in developing its plans for the future concerning its real estate activities in Brussels it does rely on various sources of information and analysis. In this context the Special Advisor, taking into account his expertise in that field, is also invited to provide his opinion, which is one among others in a large forum. In his capacity, Mr. Boomer has been providing expertise in outlining the recently adopted Communication on buildings policy, which contains broad guidelines aimed to increase market transparency and strengthen competition among the various real estate operators. To the best of its knowledge, the Commission is not aware of any file whereby Mr. Boomer might have made use or abused of information given to him in his capacity as Special Advisor to Vice-President Kallas.</p>

<p>The Commission is closely following and analysing the situation. It fully understands public concern about the trade deficit of the EU. However, it needs to be put in perspective. The EU's trade deficit is mainly explained by the oil price, because regarding manufactured products, the EU trade balance is in surplus and, is continuously increasing reaching € 154 billion in 2006. Moreover, the available data for this year show that, cumulated over the first eight months of the year, the EU's total trade deficit (including oil) improved compared to 2006. However, the trade deficit with China is rapidly widening. As regards the euro area, the trade balance has even moved from deficit to surplus over the same period relative to 2006. Of course these are aggregate figures and the positions of individual member states may differ from one another, with some of them posting large surplus such as Germany, while others being in deficit such as Spain and France.</p>
<p>The EU remains a very successful trading block internationally for trade in manufactured goods with a stable world market share despite the rise of big emerging economies such as China, India or Brazil. In this respect, the EU clearly outperforms the United States (US) and Japan which are steadily loosing ground in terms of market shares.</p>
<p>However, this is an unstable equilibrium and the EU position may be at risk: the EU is already losing ground in high technology products while countries such as China are rapidly catching up. The geographic destination of European exports is also very important, and in this respect the EU has to focus its trade efforts on countries where demand is rapidly growing. Otherwise the EU would risk missing market opportunities in dynamic areas which account already for half of world import growth.</p>
<p>The right strategy is not protectionism but to keep markets open and seek actively further market opening from our partners. This is exactly the spirit of the Global Europe agenda designed to boost the EU's competitive performance at home and abroad. It implies a series of linked strategies on market access, trade defence instruments, protection of intellectual property rights, EU policy on China and a new generation of bilateral trade agreements to complement the EU’s commitment to the World Trade Organisation (WTO). As such, it represents the external side of the Lisbon Agenda.</p>
<p>The Commission is concerned about the size of global current account imbalances and the risks they imply for global financial instability. The euro area took an active part in the discussions of the International Monetary Fund's multilateral consultation framework, where all participants supported a comprehensive strategy to reduce imbalances through policies that are in each individual country's own interest as well as desirable from a multilateral perspective. These policy plans include, inter alia, promoting national saving in the US and a gradual increase in China's exchange rate flexibility.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0709"></a>

<p>The EU is the first trading partner of the Western Balkans. Trade plays a fundamental role in the EU’s wider policy towards this region – the Stabilisation and Association process. Indeed, deeper trade relations with the EU, and within the region, are key for economic development and, in turn, political stability.</p>
<p>EU bilateral trade in goods with the Western Balkans has increased steadily since 2002. Total EU imports have grown by 7.2% annually and total EU exports by 1.8%.</p>
<p>In the first six months of 2007, EU trade with the Balkans increased more rapidly than with the rest of the world (+12.6% faster growth for imports and +5.2% faster growth for exports).</p>
<p>Turning to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, trade relations are conducted in the framework of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA), that entered into force on 1st April 2004 and took over the provisions of the Interim Agreement which entered into force on 1st June 2001.</p>
<p>Since the entry into force of the Interim Agreement, bilateral trade with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has increased steadily, with our imports having almost doubled and our exports having increased by some 20%.</p>

<p>The Commission still believes a Doha Development Agenda (DDA) deal is feasible. Negotiating texts tabled by Committee Chairs last July are pointing to a potential landing zone.</p>
<p>Negotiations are continuing in Geneva in view of issuing revised negotiating texts on agriculture and industrial products by November 2007, together with texts on services, rules and trade facilitation. On this basis, further negotiations should take place, including at Ministerial level in view of concluding a deal on modalities before the end of2007. But whether this will be the case, whether there will be a breakthrough, depends entirely on the negotiating engagement of the different players.</p>
<p>In economic terms, the remaining gaps are minimal; the problem is rather one of political will to do the heavy lifting and accept a compromise.</p>
<p>The challenge in the next few weeks is for negotiators to get to the specifics of the negotiations –rather than playing tactical games- and sign up to a deal.</p>
<p>We are now reaching a moment of truth on industrial goods negotiations, as we did previously on agriculture. Emerging economies are currently refusing to deliver their side of the bargain and make at best a modest contribution to the Round by opening, to some extent, their markets for industrial products, and are trying to turn the negotiations into a North/South showdown.</p>
<p>However, what is being asked from the about 30 emerging economies that would have to make a contribution to this Round can be considered as modest : to consolidate duties to the levels that are actually being applied; and for some countries and some sectors, make limited adjustments of 1 or 2% to the tariffs presently applied – over a period of ten years.</p>
<p>Rightly, the EU has said that it is ready to improve its agriculture offer if the other World Trade Organisation (WTO) Members also show flexibility and deliver their side of the bargain. Recently, the United States (US) announced it accepts the terms and ranges of figures contained in the text of the chair of the agriculture group, but this should by no means affect our stance.</p>
<p>For emerging economies now to refuse to make any contribution and ask for more flexibilities would do terrible injury to the current negotiating process, and drain the negotiations of their remaining momentum.</p>
<p>Moreover, such refusal would fly in the face of what we understand by Doha being "a development Round", as the consequences for developing countries would be a sharp reduction in new opportunities for them to trade amongst themselves.</p>
<p>With respect to the issue of domestic subsidies in agriculture, the US move to negotiate in the ranges of the Falconer modalities paper is an encouraging sign, although we have always been clear that at some point the US would have to become realistic on domestic support. While we already reformed our agricultural policy in 2003, the US is still lagging behind. Therefore, the US move is no reason for us to change course.</p>
<p>The EU will stand firm on this line, while continuing to reaching out to negotiating partners in a constructive manner, so as to create the necessary momentum for a broad deal on modalities by the end of this year. This deal should, in our view, not be limited to agriculture and industrial goods, but should provide a broad platform for the last stretch of negotiations on the overall agenda of the Round, including services, rules, geographical indications and trade facilitation.</p>

<p>The EU and Brazil enjoy good trade relations, with increasing trade flows in both directions. Brazilian exports are becoming more diversified with the share of manufactured goods increasing. Furthermore, Brazil is a key player in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Doha Development Agenda (DDA), playing a crucial role as the leader of the G-20 group. Brazil is also a member of Mercosur, with whom the EU is negotiating an Association Agreement on a region-to-region basis since the year 2000.</p>
<p>Brazil is a key partner and interlocutor for the EU pursuing some of the important challenges ahead of us; successfully concluding the DDA, managing globalisation, tackling climate change and reducing poverty.</p>
<p>The European Union is Brazil's first trading partner, accounting for 24 % of its exports and 21% of its imports. However, despite its economic size, Brazil only accounts for 1,8% of total EU trade, ranking only eleventh among EU trading partners.</p>
<p>The EU is the first investor in Brazil, with a European investment stock reaching € 80 billion. EU investments in Brazil alone exceed EU investments in Russia, India and China taken together. Brazilian foreign investments - although still at a low level - are increasing, the EU market being the first receiver.</p>
<p>The Commission strives to ensure that products in the EC market (imported or produced in the Community) comply with strict EU requirements and for this relies heavily on its inspection service.</p>
<p>The EU is the largest importer of agriculture products from Brazil. For this reason the Commission is monitoring very closely the sanitary conditions of the agri-products we import from Brazil. This monitoring includes an intensive programme of inspections carried out by the commission services on the spot, controls at imports and also random tests on the internal market at destination.</p>
<p>The results of these inspections indicate some shortcomings, in particular in the beef sector.</p>
<p>The latest inspection of the beef sector took place last March, and following its conclusion, the Commission informed the Brazilian authorities that we may have to reconsider the authorization of imports of beef if they have not provided, by the end of this year, auditable evidence of the rectification of all remaining deficiencies.</p>
<p>A further inspection by the Commission Inspection service (Directorate General for Health and Consumer Protection (SANCO) Food and Veterinary Office (FVO)) will take place in November.</p>
<p>The Commissioner in charge of Health and the Commission services responsible for Sanitary and PhytoSanitary (SPS) issues have provided to the Parliament comprehensive information of the sanitary situation of the Brazilian beef. The Commissioner was also present last 9 October in the Parliament's Committee of Agriculture and Rural Development where this issue was the subject of an intensive debate.</p>
<p>The Commission can assure the Honourable Member that it will take appropriate action if serious risk factors could put EU consumers, animal or plants at risk.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0760"></a>

<p>Replying to an earlier Question (<a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2007-0671_EN.html">H-0671/07</a>)<a href="#defann_30_1" name="refann_30_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Council said that the External Management Committee was analysing various possibilities with a view to responding to 'the concerns which are being voiced by a large number of Member States' with regard to the expiry of the so-called 'Memorandum of Understanding' on exports of certain textile and clothing products from China to the countries of the EU, on 31 December 2007.</p>
<p>As has been announced, the Commission is apparently going to propose introducing a 'double control' mechanism of imports from China - by both the customs authorities of the Member States and the Chinese authorities - for only eight of the ten categories covered in the 'Memorandum' and only to the end of 2008.</p>
<p>How does the Commission intend to avoid 2008 seeing a repetition of the situation that occurred in 2005 - an exponential increase in textile imports - and why is it not instead choosing to extend the restrictions in force and apply them to fresh categories, which would moreover resemble what is provided for in the agreements signed between China and the USA?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>After the expiry of the Agreement on Textile and Clothing (ATC) in 2005, in response to surging levels of textile imports from China, the Commission negotiated with China the Shanghai Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). This MoU introduced agreed growth levels for imports from China into the EU of ten product categories until the end of 2007. The MoU itself remains, however, valid until the end of 2008.</p>
<p>That was a once and for all deal with China based on the provisions of their WTO entry and gave an extra breathing space to the EU industry to adapt to the new challenges posed by China as a major world player in the textile sector.</p>
<p>In the last months, the Commission and the Chinese Ministry of Commerce discussed ways and means to ensure a smooth transition in 2008. In separate meetings with the EU industry and with the EU traders, the Commissioner responsible for Trade has conveyed the same message for a smooth transition in 2008. It is believed that a smooth transition is a matter of co-responsibility among all parties concerned and it is also in everybody's interest. Nobody wants a rerun of 2005.</p>
<p>Discussions with China were concluded in September 2007 and China is willing to co-operate with the Commission to put into place a joint monitoring mechanism for trade in eight textiles product categories for 2008 (cat 4 T-shirts, cat 5 pullovers, cat 6 trousers, cat 7 blouses, cat 20 bed linen, cat 26 dresses, cat 31 brassieres and cat 115 flax and ramie yarn). At the same time the Commission would not implement our internal rules in the form of single-checking surveillance on the remaining two categories (categories 2 cotton fabrics and 39 table and kitchen linen) under the MoU. By this joint surveillance, China has de facto accepted that it shares with us the responsibility to ensure a smooth transition after the expiry at the end of this year of the MoU agreed levels. The Commission will cooperate with its Chinese counterpart to this end.</p>
<p>The deal covers the economically important categories and those with particular sensitivities. The two categories not covered are those where the utilization of the agreed levels has been and remains lowest in the period 2005 to 2007.</p>
<p>Since early summer 2007, the Commission has also been in touch with Member States in meetings at different levels and with Parliament particularly via the numerous written and oral questions tabled by several MEPs. Some suggested that agreed levels should be extended; others that trade should now be fully liberalized; others still suggested putting a trade monitoring mechanism in place.</p>
<p>Between extension of the present system and full liberalization, which were both a non-starter, the road of double-checking surveillance was the EU choice. Particularly in view of the fact that other countries have reached different agreements with China in 2005, with different lifetime and with different coverage.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that the deal of 2005 has proven useful and successful and it is now time to take the next step forward, the one to full liberalisation. In taking this step, experience suggests that it would be wise to monitor trade flows in the most sensitive categories at the same time. The double checking surveillance system described above just does that and it is part of the Commission's action to avoid a repeat of 2005. The co-responsibility of all parties concerned both in EU and in China is another aspect of the same effort.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that this is a good solution and notes Member States' broad support and favourable opinion. It is at the top end of what could be expected from the Chinese to agree to, and a double-checking system is both technically and politically preferable to unilateral EU action. Industry players – manufacturers and importers and retailers – have welcomed it.</p>
<p>As the next step, the Commission has published the corresponding regulation on 19 October 2007.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The Commission considers that the transition from education to a first job is crucial in promoting the inclusion of young people with disabilities in the world of work and in society generally. The Commission supports, and is closely following, implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding between the European Disability Forum and the European Youth Forum, which was signed on the European Day of People with Disabilities.</p>
<p>The European Action Plan on the situation of people with disabilities stresses how important it is that employment policy should integrate the issue of disability.</p>
<p>In pursuit of the European Employment Strategy, the Commission works in close cooperation with the Member States, whose task it is to implement the measures necessary for promoting employment of young people with disabilities. The Member States also have the option of setting national targets for employment of disabled people. The Commission has produced a guide based on its new Integrated Guidelines<a href="#defann_31_1" name="refann_31_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> to help the Member States address disability-related issues more effectively in their National Reform Programmes.</p>
<p>The European Social Fund supports Member States’ efforts to promote active social and vocational integration of people with disabilities. As of this year, accessibility for disabled people will be one of the main criteria in the selection of operations to be financed. At the same time, the Commission is preparing a new regulation on state aid in order to simplify the rules on employment and training for people with disabilities.</p>
<p>Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000, establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation,<a href="#defann_31_2" name="refann_31_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> has been transposed into law in all the Member States. Its provisions on observance of the principle of equal treatment for people with disabilities stipulate that all employers have a duty to provide reasonable accommodation for disabled people. Article 7 of the Directive further stipulates that Member States may maintain or adopt specific measures to prevent or compensate for disadvantages linked to disability.</p>
<p>The Commission welcomes the conclusions of the 2006 Spring European Council identifying youth employment and the employment of disabled people as priorities. Lastly, the Commission Communication on ‘flexicurity’<a href="#defann_31_3" name="refann_31_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> offers new prospects for more effectively supporting the employment of young people with disabilities when they finish their studies (through part-time and temporary work, training placements and practical work experience, for example).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In January 2007, the Commission published its final report on the retail banking sector inquiry (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2007&amp;nu_doc=0033">COM(2007)0033</a>). The section dealing with fees for credit transfers points out that banks in Greece are charging higher fees than those in other eurozone Member States for 'on-us' credit transfers. Furthermore, the weighted average fee for an 'off-us' credit transfer in Greece was five times higher than the average for the eurozone. Lastly, Greece is also among the Member States where interchange fees for credit transfers are highest. What are the Commission's views on this? Why are fees for bank transfers so high in Greece? What does the Commission think of the way the banking sector operates in Greece?

<p>Wide differences in prices of payment services in Europe and the potential lack of competition in some markets are causes of concern for the Commission. For that reason, the Commission performed a sectoral inquiry regarding retail banking in Europe<a href="#defann_35_1" name="refann_35_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, in the wider context of aiming at ensuring that full benefits of the internal market are delivered to the European consumers. In the final report of this sector inquiry, the Commission recommends a range of measures, including competition law enforcement and regulatory/self-regulatory measures in order to strengthen competition in retail banking. The identified weaknesses of the EU payments market are also addressed in the Payment Services Directive, adopted in April 2007 by the Parliament.</p>
<p>In general, markets for payment services in the EU Member States are still predominantly national. Furthermore, consumer behaviour and preferences strongly influence the strategies of banks, e.g. in Greece, the number of non-cash payment transactions per capita is by far the lowest in the EU. For these reasons, the Commission strongly supports the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) project, a banking industry initiative to create an integrated and more competitive market for euro payments which is planned to become fully operational by the end of 2010. At the same time the Payment Services Directive, due to be implemented by November 2009, is expected to generate more competition by removing market entry barriers and guaranteeing fair market access. It will also harmonise rules on information requirements and the rights and obligations of consumers in relation to payment services.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue its work in the retail financial services area. As stated in the Green Paper on retail financial services, the Commission's objective is to bring concrete benefits to European consumers in terms of price and choice. Policy initiatives will be undertaken provided there is a strong economic case supporting them and consumer confidence and empowerment is improved as a result.</p>
<p>Since the publication of the results of the Commission's sector inquiry in the field of retail banking, the Commission is following up the issues identified in close cooperation with national competition authorities, within the European Competition Network (ECN). In particular, the Commission and the Greek competition authority are examining how to address the findings of the sector inquiry concerning Greece.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is aware of the fact that due to the increasing levels of alcohol consumption by young women, there is a considerable risk of neurological damage to foetuses. The Commission has addressed this issue in its Communication of 24 October 2006, which places the protection of the unborn child amongst the priority themes for action. As an example of good practice, the Communication refers to the fact that some Member States have introduced, or are planning to introduce, labelling on alcoholic drinks to protect pregnant women and the unborn child. With regard to such warning labels, the Commission will explore, in co-operation with Member States and stakeholders, the potential for developing efficient common approaches throughout the Community to provide adequate information.</p>
<p>Warning labels are however only one – albeit important – element within a range of measures that can improve information and raise awareness, and should therefore be part of a broader strategy. The Commission will therefore support Member States and stakeholders in their efforts to develop information and education programmes with regard to alcohol consumption and pregnancy. This will be done by combining the following two approaches:</p>
<p>- together with the relevant stakeholders the Commission will develop, within the framework of the European Alcohol and Health Forum, concrete actions aimed at protecting European citizens from the harmful use of alcohol. Parliament has been invited to participate as an observer in the Forum and can therefore follow its progress;</p>
<p>- within the new Committee on National Policy and Action (which is composed of Member States representatives), the Commission will explore the scope for the formulation of European objectives for curbing the incidence of Foetal Alcohol Syndrome and Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders.</p>
<p>This corresponds to a specific request made in Parliament's Resolution of 5 September 2007.</p>
<p>In summary, the Commission will therefore not just use the Alcohol Forum in order to make sure that women receive information on the risks associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy, but will also actively work with Member States to this end.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0704"></a>

<p>The EU market is being penetrated to an ever-increasing extent by imported textile products dyed with azocolourants which pose a health risk and which do not meet the criteria laid down in Directive 2002/61/EC<a href="#defann_38_1" name="refann_38_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on azocolourants.

<p>Directive 2002/61/EC<a href="#defann_38_2" name="refann_38_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> sets an upper limit of 30 parts per million for aromatic amines released by azodyes in textile or leather articles which may come into direct and prolonged contact with the skin. The three types of article mentioned by the Honourable Member, i.e. nightwear, bed linen and work gloves are all subject to that limit and if it is exceeded, the textiles concerned must not be placed on the market in the EU. The limit was set as low as possible consistent with reliable measurement using the most sensitive techniques available. The restriction applies to those azodyes that are capable of releasing, by the chemical process of reductive cleavage, any of the 22 carinogenic aromatic amines listed in the Appendix given in Directive 2003/3/EC<a href="#defann_38_3" name="refann_38_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Since 31 December 2004, Member State competent authorities when enforcing the limit use the CEN<a href="#defann_38_4" name="refann_38_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> test methods given in Directive 2004/21/EC<a href="#defann_38_5" name="refann_38_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>. The test method requires a chemical treatment of the textile to release aromatic amines from azodyes by reductive cleavage before their quantitative measurement by chromatography. The test requires about 1-2 man-days of work in a laboratory capable of performing this specific test. The commercial market for a portable device capable of carrying out sample extraction combined with accurate analysis in a quick and easy way extends far beyond the field of azodyes. Even if development of an instrument for such on-the-spot measurements was feasible, the financial incentive to develop such a device is already so large that additional Commission support to develop a device only for the detection of azodyes would seem to be superfluous.</p>
<p>By far the largest proportion of the average time from product sampling to the validation and publication of a notification on the RAPEX<a href="#defann_38_6" name="refann_38_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a> system linking enforcement authorities in the Member States is due to the time taken by Member States to test, evaluate and report on sample products. This is the case in particular for chemical risks, where a visual analysis of a sample is not sufficient.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning, moreover, that RAPEX notifications concern restrictive measures taken by authorities or economic operators in relation to products posing risks for the health and safety of consumers. Therefore, the time for the adoption, publication and notification of these measures should also be factored in the calculation. Of course, in cases which present aspects of particular urgency (e.g. due to the level of risk, the scale, geographical size and political sensitivity of a recall), the time between sampling and publication in the RAPEX system, accompanied by information to authorities, the media and citizens, is compressed to a few days or even hours.</p>
<p>The Commission is regularly calling upon Member States to help improve the speed with which the RAPEX system operates, and working constantly with authorities to this end. In addition, at the next meeting of the Working Group responsible for Directive 2002/61/EC on azodyes, which is scheduled for 3 December 2007, the Commission will ask Member States to report on their level of market surveillance and on any difficulties experienced in enforcing the legislation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

This directive is applicable only to employment and training.

<p>The Commission is committed to ensuring that everyone in the European Union can fulfil their potential, without prejudice, racism or stereotypes being applied to them. The Commission welcomes the fact that a number of Member States have gone beyond the existing EU Directives based on Article 13 of the Treaty to provide protection against discrimination. However a study carried out for the Commission in late 2006 showed that, whilst most Member States provided for some form of protection against discrimination on grounds of religion or belief, age, disability and sexual orientation, there was a variety between the Member States as to the degree and the nature of the protection.</p>
<p>In the light of these differences and of calls from the Parliament for action to complete the Community anti-discrimination framework, the Commission announced in its Annual Policy Strategy for 2008 that:</p>
<p>"As a follow-up measure to the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All (2007), the Commission will extend and reinforce its equal opportunities policy. It will, in particular, propose new initiatives designed to prevent and combat discrimination outside the labour market – based on gender, religion, belief, disability, age or sexual orientation".</p>

This Directive has been transposed by all the Member States, and if disabled persons are discriminated against in employment they have a legal remedy at national level. This Directive does not however apply outside the field of employment, occupation and training.</p>
<p>As announced in its Annual Policy Strategy for 2008<a href="#defann_40_5" name="refann_40_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> - and building on a study of existing anti-discrimination legislation in the Member States<a href="#defann_40_6" name="refann_40_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a> - the Commission plans to propose measures designed to prevent and combat discrimination outside the labour market, inter alia on the basis of disability. An impact assessment is being undertaken as well as a public on-line consultation<a href="#defann_40_7" name="refann_40_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a> which ended on 15 October 2007.</p>
<p>For what concerns specifically tourism, due to its limited competences, the Commission can not adopt legislation in this area. The Commission is however raising awareness on challenges such as the need to facilitate travel for seniors and persons with special needs.</p>
<p>For instance, the Commission has carried out a http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/services/tourism/studies_and_publications.htm" \l "INFORMATION_ACCESSIBILITY" . This Guidance describes how tourist facilities, large and small, and destinations as a whole can improve the quality of the service that they offer to disabled people and others who will benefit from better accessibility.</p>
<p>In support of the “European Year of Equal Opportunities for All” the Commission organised the conference http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/services/tourism/accessibility_conference2007.htm" The main objectives of these conferences was to raise the awareness of all stakeholders about the impact and the business opportunities of the forthcoming process of demographic ageing that will simultaneously lead to a growing share of tourists with needs for more accessibility and higher service quality.</p>
<p>In the framework of the forthcoming Communication on an “Agenda for a sustainable and competitive European tourism” the Commission will continue its work to encourage the tourism industry to recognize that tourists with special needs form an important consumer group. It will further organize conferences and support the strengthening or the creation of platforms where lessons drawn by good and bad practices can be exchanged.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The world trade union organisation ITUC has just published its annual report on the situation facing trade union activists around the world. The statistics are depressing, particularly in the case of Colombia. Of the 144 murders of trade union activists around the world, more than half - 78 - occurred in Colombia. Apart from the murders, a very large proportion of threats and other forms of persecution were also directed at trade union activists. Virtually all the murders in Colombia were committed by paramilitary groups close to the government or actually by the government's army.</p>
<p>The EU has previously ceased its trade cooperation with Belarus on account of human rights violations, etc. It recently did likewise in relation to Burma. At this very moment, the EU is negotiating a new free trade agreement with Colombia.</p>
<p>Peter Mandelson has previously, inter alia during a meeting at the European Parliament on 5 June 2007, stated that workers' rights are to be protected and that if any country were to violate ILO conventions, the Commissioner would respond vigorously.</p>
<p>In view of the above, will the Commission suspend the current trade negotiations between the EU and Colombia, or what will the Commission do to prevent human rights violations in that country?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>It should be recognized that the administration of President Uribe has made significant efforts to strengthen the rule of law in the face of violence from drug traffickers, guerrillas and former paramilitaries. These efforts have been partially successful, even if the human rights situation in Colombia continues to be of high concern to the EU. The government of Colombia thus deserves our firm support.</p>
<p>Our support should of course be neither unconditional nor unquestioning. The EU regularly raises its concerns related to human rights in its political dialogue with the government. In this context, we have consistently urged Bogotá to step up its efforts to protect the most vulnerable population groups, such as trade unionists and representatives of victims’ associations. Any involvement of state forces in human rights violations is of particular concern. It is crucial that this be fully investigated, and the perpetrators punished.</p>
<p>Given the intrinsic linkage between drug production, trafficking and human rights violations, the creation of alternative sources for revenue and employment is a central plank of EU policy towards Colombia. This policy will be underpinned by the future association agreement between the EU and the countries of the Andean Community, which through further trade liberalization will create additional outlets for the legal Colombian economy. Moreover, the scope of the agreement will go far beyond free trade. The agreement will also allow for enhanced political dialogue and closer cooperation across the board – and thus create new channels and a reinforced institutional framework for bringing concerns related to human rights to the attention of the government.</p>
<p>Thus, the Commission is convinced that we can make a better contribution to the improvement of the human rights situation and better support those defending human rights by engaging Colombia in an Association Agreement rather than by suspending negotiations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0716"></a>

<p>(FR) The Commission points out that the Member States retain responsibility for child protection, children’s social inclusion and the management of childcare institutions.</p>
<p>However, in its reports prior to Bulgaria’s accession to the European Union, the Commission closely followed the Bulgarian Government’s implementation of its policy of deinstitutionalisation and its efforts to improve institutional living conditions and develop alternative services such as fostering.</p>
<p>Relevant changes in Bulgarian law were introduced in September 2003.</p>
<p>The reforms focused on staff training, decentralisation of services, the introduction of cooperative arrangements involving local authorities and NGOs concerned with child protection, and the social integration of children living in institutions.</p>
<p>The situation of these children has generally improved since the new legislation came into force. For that reason the issue was not addressed in the benchmarking exercise pursuant to the Commission Decision of 13 December 2006 establishing a mechanism for cooperation and verification of progress in Bulgaria to address specific benchmarks in the areas of judicial reform and the fight against corruption and organised crime.</p>
<p>The Commission encourages exchanges of good practice and policy coordination, under the Open Method of Coordination, in the field of social protection and social inclusion. The 2007 joint report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion shows that the Member States have responded to the request from the March 2006 European Council to take steps to eradicate child poverty and provide equal opportunities for all. In its evaluation of the Bulgarian strategic report on social protection and social inclusion, which is included in the 2007 joint report, the Commission has identified ongoing reform of the institutional long-term care system (ie of care delivered in an institutional setting) as a challenge for the Bulgarian authorities. The Commission will continue to follow developments in this field in preparation for the next round of national strategy reports covering the period 2009-2011.</p>
<p>Under the new 2007-2013 Financial Perspective for the Structural Funds, one of the main aims of the European Social Fund (ESF) is to promote social inclusion and equality of opportunity for all. The Bulgarian operational programme entitled ‘Human Resources Development’, being financed by the ESF in 2007-2013 and recently approved by the Commission, includes social inclusion and encouragement of the social economy among its priority themes, with specific aims including improvement of the quality of services delivered in institutions and further deinstitutionalisation.</p>

<p>Under French law, it is possible for municipalities and public establishments for cooperation between local authorities to pool their services in order to achieve economies of scale (Article L. 5211-4-1 II of the General Code governing Local and Regional Authorities). However, the Commission considers that the agreements on pooling services come under public procurement law and, as a result, has launched infringement proceedings against France. This position is contrary to the thinking behind the Stability and Growth Pact adopted by the European Council, which applies to the Member States and their local authorities. The pooling of services complies with the objectives of the Stability and Growth Pact in avoiding the creation of departments with duplicate roles, which results in higher costs and the scattering of resources. In this respect, the pooling of services pursues an aim of general and Community interest: better operational management and careful public spending.</p>
<p>Can the Commission explain why it is taking action that will deprive local authorities in France of a legal instrument that allows them to keep public spending in check and ensures more efficient public services?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In fact, these "agreements" fully comply with the definition of "public contract" in the Public Procurement Directives.

<p>The Public Procurement Directives aim to guarantee the opening-up of public procurement to competition and also to ensure the possibility that contracting authorities obtain the best value for money for their contracts.

<p>In Sweden, VAT has been levied on books at a rate of 6% since 2002. The rate is the same for printed books and audio books. The text of printed books is reproduced identically in audio books.</p>
<p>The market for audio books is growing, and more and more people are using them nowadays. Audio books are of very special importance to the visually impaired and to people with reading and writing difficulties. The Commission now plans to bring infringement proceedings against Sweden to compel it to increase the rate of VAT on audio books.</p>

<p>Under the current rules, Member States are required to apply a standard rate of value added tax (VAT) of at least 15% to all supplies of goods and services.

Annex III constitutes an exception to the general system established by the VAT Directive, according to which taxable operations must be taxed at the standard VAT rate, and must therefore be interpreted strictly.</p>
<p>Category 4 in this Annex concerns equipment for disabled persons and Category 6 concerns books.</p>
<p>While the protection and promotion of culture clearly is of fundamental interest, Member States still have to respect Community Law.</p>
<p>It appears that there are two categories of spoken books in Sweden, talking books (talböcker), which are exclusively for the use of disabled persons, and audio books (ljudböcker), which constitute what are generally considered as mainstream audio books.</p>
<p>In the Commission's view, audio books do not qualify for a reduced VAT rate as they cannot be considered as "books" (category 6) in the strict sense nor as "medical equipment" (category 4) for the exclusive personal use of the disabled.</p>

<p>The Roaming Regulation<a href="#defann_49_1" name="refann_49_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> imposes obligations on providers of international mobile roaming services to cap retail prices for making and receiving calls when roaming in the European Union. The Regulation also requires mobile operators to cap wholesale charges i.e. the prices that they charge each other, and to improve transparency by providing consumers with basic roaming pricing information, as well as more detailed pricing information at the consumer's request. The deadline for compliance with the full range of these obligations was 30 September 2007, although operators were required to comply with interim steps such as the obligation to offer a Eurotariff by the end of July 2007. The Regulation requires national regulatory authorities to monitor and supervise compliance with these obligations. Based on its own enquiries and on results of a further survey carried out by the European Regulators Group (ERG), which brings together the national regulatory authorities of the EU Member States, it appears that all operators have offered a compliant Eurotariff, and that a number of them, in various Member States, are offering Eurotariffs below the maximum levels allowed.</p>
<p>The Commission will report to Parliament and the Council at the end of 2008 on the functioning of the Regulation and will recommend, if appropriate, whether the Regulation should be extended in duration beyond the current expiry date of 30 June 2010, and/or whether it should be amended to include other services such as SMS or data. The Commission will also address other issues such as the impact on smaller operators, if any, of the Regulation, developments in charges for domestic mobile services, involuntary roaming and traffic steering.</p>
<p>More details on the ERG's monitoring and on the Eurotariffs available in Member States can be found on the Commission's roaming website at the following link:</p>

<p>Historically in the EU, methamphetamine use has been very low, mostly concentrated in the Czech Republic (sold as Pervetin) and to some extent in the Slovak Republic. Recent estimates of methamphetamine use problem are reported by these two countries. In the Czech Republic, it is estimated that there are between 18.400-24.000 methamphetamine users (2.5-3.2 cases per 1000 adults aged 15-64 years old). In the Slovak Republic, the estimates are 6.000-14.000 users (1.5-3.7 cases per 1000 adults aged 15-64 years old). Some reports of increased use among subpopulations in Hungary have been received.</p>
<p>Epidemiological data on drug use as well as treatment demand indicators suggest that there is no significant methamphetamine use in other EU countries. Where methamphetamine is used in other EU countries, it mostly concerns a small proportion of overall amphetamine use. In the EU, the use of Amphetamine Type Stimulants including methamphetamine has overall stabilised and is showing decline in an increasing number of countries. Relatively high levels of methamphetamine including Crystal Meth / Ice have been reported for many years already from countries outside the EU, including the United States, the Far East and Australia.</p>
<p>Concerning the effects of this substance, methamphetamine is a central nervous system stimulant that causes hypertension and tachycardia with feelings of increased confidence, sociability and energy. It is closely related to amphetamine.</p>
<p>Crystal Methamphetamine is a crystallised form of methamphetamine and has a higher purity. Crystal Meth can be smoked (e.g. heated on a piece of aluminium paper) but also injected as it is easy soluble in water.</p>
<p>There are no indications that there is an increasing trend in the use or production of (Crystal) methamphetamines in the European Union. Reports from increased availability of Crystal Meth in some Member States have not been substantiated by evidence: the number of seizures of methamphetamine remains a fraction of that of amphetamines and have so for several years.</p>
<p>When methamphetamine is smoked, it reaches the brain much more quickly than when it is snorted or injected. As such it has a serious addiction potential.</p>
<p>Methamphetamine dependence may cause:</p>
<p>Mental health problems (agitation, decreased motivation, depression and anxiety, psychosis, worsening symptoms of schizophrenia, decreased concentration and memory);</p>
<p>Physical health problems (disturbed sleep, weight loss due to poor appetite, palpitations and chest pains and injection related problems such as abscesses);</p>
<p>Injection risk behaviour (Hepatitis C infections and other blood-borne diseases due to sharing of needles, etc.);</p>
<p>Social and financial problems.</p>
<p>Due to the higher purity of methamphetamine in Crystal Meth and 'base' methamphetamine, these types of methamphetamine have a higher potential to develop health and social problems than 'regular' forms of the substance.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0737"></a>

<p>On a concluding note, the Commission would like to stress the crucial importance of cities vis-à-vis the EU's goal of sustainable development, since they are already home to 80% of EU citizens.

<p>Regulation 1922/2006 establishing a European Institute for Gender Equality was adopted on 20 December 2006<a href="#defann_53_1" name="refann_53_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The Commission is committed to having the Institute operational as soon as possible. Since adoption of the Regulation progress can be reported as regards the appointment of the Director, the establishment of the Management Board and the preparation of the seat.</p>
<p>As regard the appointment of the Director, the Commission published on 27 April 2007 the vacancy for the post of the Director. In accordance with the Regulation, the Commission is currently in the process of establishing a shortlist of candidates. The Director will be appointed by the Management Board on the basis of the list proposed by the Commission. Before being appointed, the candidate selected by the Management Board will have to make a declaration before the competent committees of the European Parliament.</p>
<p>As regards the Management Board, the 18 representatives of the Member States have been nominated by a Decision of the Council on 30 May 2007 whilst the Commission nominated its representative and alternate on 30 April 2007.</p>
<p>The inaugural meeting of the Management Board was held in Brussels on 8 October 2007. It elected as Chair: Mrs Eva WELSKOP-DEFFA, Head of the Equal Opportunities Department in the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth (Germany), and as Vice-Chair Mr Michel PASTEEL, Director of the Institute for Equality of Women and Men (Belgium).</p>
<p>The Management Board will take the decisions necessary for the operation of the Institute. In particular, it shall adopt the annual work programme and the medium term work programme, on the basis of a draft drawn up by the Director, after consultation with the Commission. According to the Regulation, the first annual work programme shall be adopted not later than nine months after the appointment of the Director. In the absence of the Director, it is therefore not possible yet for the Institute to supply the work programme referred to by the Honourable Member.</p>
<p>The Commission is cooperating with the Lithuanian authorities in order to find suitable premises for the Institute. The Commission went on a preliminary and technical visit to Vilnius on 4 May 2007. Discussions with the relevant authorities are still on-going. The Commission underlines that it will be up to the Institute, being an independent body, to take the final decision on the premises.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The one guiding principle for all the Commission's actions in this area is that there can be, and will be, no compromise on consumer safety. The law is clear: only safe products can be marketed and unsafe products are banned.</p>
<p>The Commission undertakes various concrete steps, both at the European and international level, to effectively address concerns about the safety of products imported to the EU from China or from any other third country.</p>
<p>The Commission has decided to start cooperation with the Chinese government under a Memorandum of Understanding since 2006.</p>
<p>Within this framework, the Chinese authorities receive detailed information about unsafe Chinese products found on the EU market and they have committed themselves to investigate each and every case and make the necessary interventions and improvements to their system. Detailed reports on prevention and follow-up actions need to be submitted to the Commission on quarterly basis. The latest report is from the end of September 2007 and its detailed analysis is underway.</p>
<p>In this context, still in October 2007, Commission product safety experts are going to Beijing to discuss with their Chinese counterparts this report and, more widely, possible ways of improving market surveillance over dangerous products of Chinese origin.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that the existing consumer product safety regime works well to address the current problems. The conclusions of the current stocktaking will later in 2007 give the answer to the question what further measures might be needed at the Commission or Member States' level.</p>
<p>Customs have a major role to play in the fight against counterfeit and piracy. Seizures of fake goods entering the EU went up dramatically in 2006. To an extent, this reflects increased activity by customs in this area, as well as the success of pursuing a risk management-based policy of customs control.</p>
<p>The Commission is working closely with the Member States' customs administrations to further develop the protection offered by customs against counterfeit and piracy at the external border and to strengthen administrative cooperation with third countries, including China.</p>
<p>The Commission also very closely watches developments on the Chinese side and expects to see concrete measures taken. The EU-China summit at the end of November is the ideal opportunity to take this question up at the highest level.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0746"></a>

<p>(FR) With regard to the Galileo programme, the Commission fully shares the view expressed by the European Parliament in its resolution<a href="#defann_55_1" name="refann_55_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> of 20 June 2007, particularly in relation to full financing of the Galileo programme from the EU budget and the need for a reimbursement mechanism for public financial contributions in the event of public-private partnerships being formed.</p>
<p>On 19 September 2007 the Commission adopted a package of texts including, on the one hand, a Commission communication<a href="#defann_55_2" name="refann_55_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and a more detailed Commission services working document<a href="#defann_55_3" name="refann_55_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and, on the other, an amended proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council,<a href="#defann_55_4" name="refann_55_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> to ensure the continuation of the European GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) programmes, and a proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning revision of the 2007-2013 multiannual financial framework.<a href="#defann_55_5" name="refann_55_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> These proposals reflect a thorough study of all the possible solutions. They aim to secure financing for the Galileo and EGNOS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service) programmes in the period 2007-2013 and they respond to the calls made by Parliament in the above-mentioned resolution of 20 June 2007.</p>
<p>In their role as joint legislators and budgetary authority, Parliament and the Council will now have to examine the texts at the earliest possible opportunity so that a decision on financing the two programmes can be taken before the end of 2007.</p>
<p>Regarding the Quaero programme, this is a French research and innovation project in the area of advanced audiovisual search involving several industrial and research actors, supported by the French Agency for Industrial Innovation. Quaero is not an EU funded project nor is it organised under the aegis of the Commission. It was selected as one of 5 priority Research &amp; Development technology innovation domains by President Jacques Chirac and Chancellor Gerhard Schröder. Originally announced as a Franco–German initiative in 2005, the project subsequently developed into two different projects proposed by two separate research consortiums led by French and German partners, the Quaero and Theseus projects respectively. Quaero involves public funding from the French government and has recently been notified to the Commission for its assessment under state aid legislation. The French consortium is now waiting for the Commission decision. Theseus is supported by the German Authorities and was authorised by the Commission under state aid rules in July 2007.</p>
<p>Investments in new information technologies are an essential element of the Lisbon agenda and will make a significant contribution to economic growth and employment in Europe. The Commission welcomes initiatives such as Quaero as long as state aid rules are respected. The public support must not adversely distort competition to an extent contrary to the common interest. In the case of Theseus, the Commission did find that the positive effects of the programme outweigh the distortive effects on competition. In addition, the Commission is, on its side, supporting directly, in the framework of its research programmes, several projects in the area of audiovisual content search involving many other research teams across the EU. The Commission intends to continue supporting R&amp;D on Multimedia Search Engines in future Calls of the 7th Framework Programme.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Weaker and less populous nations are gradually losing their sovereignty and national identity. One worrying phenomenon is the dying-out of languages, which are the basis of national culture. Of the roughly 7 000 languages currently used around the world, some 3 000 will die out over the next 100 years. Those disappearing the fastest are languages in Australia, the central part of South America, the south-east Pacific and Siberia. As the languages die out, so too does a wealth of knowledge, particularly in the fields of nature and medicine. The extinction of languages is also affecting Europe and the European Union. We should therefore take steps to protect and document languages. It is essential for a report on languages to be drawn up.

<p>This comprehensive approach is also reflected in the 2007-2013 programme for lifelong learning.

<p>The Commission is well aware of the "Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007" signed by President Bush on 3 August 2007. Mandatory scanning of United States (US) -bound maritime containers is indeed a great concern for the European Community: it is unilateral, ineffective and costly and entails serious political and economic consequences. If implemented, this measure would prove extremely trade-disruptive both because of increased costs as well as entailed delays. This must be avoided by all means.</p>
<p>The Commission has expressed strong opposition to this measure in several statements and contacts with US decision makers. The Commission will raise this serious issue at the upcoming meeting of the EU-US Policy Dialogue on Transport and Border Security (1 November 2007), the EC-US Transatlantic Economic Council (9 November 2007), as well as in other high level EC-US events.</p>
<p>The Commission will also address this problem in multilateral fora, including at the World Customs Organisation.</p>
<p>Already in the framework of the International Maritime Organization in the period running from 2005 and 2007 the US tried to favour new provisions in the "Facilitation Convention" and in the "International Ship and Port Facility Security Code" in order to put new security responsibilities on ship and port facility operators when containerised cargo was to be delivered to them from the inland supply chain whereas those operators had no possibilities to control what happens in the said supply chain. This has been successfully countered by the EU Member States and the Commission.</p>
<p>The Commission understands and shares the US security concerns but does not want European ports and companies to have to pay for US national security. It will continue to work with the US Government to find a viable alternative for 100% scanning. The Commission is working closely with the US Customs and Border Protection to develop a joint project on "secure trade", based on mutual recognition of the respective security standards and a multi-layered risk-based approach, which is the right direction to increasing cargo security. The EU and the US have also identified the adoption of a roadmap on mutual recognition of trade partnership programmes (Authorised Economic Operator – EU) and (Customs Trade Partnership against Terrorism – US) as a deliverable for the 9 November Transatlantic Economic Council meeting.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to assure you that it will do its utmost to find a politically and practically viable solution. Active involvement by Parliament will be essential to achieve our objectives in this politically sensitive issue.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0757"></a>

<p>Adverse meteorological conditions have resulted in a disappointing 2007 harvest in the European Union. The EU grain crop is now estimated at about 255-260 million tonnes, which is below the long term average. Greece was particularly affected by heat waves and the crop in this Member State fell to 3,2 million tonnes.</p>
<p>The Commission reacted to the developing tight situation on the cereals markets and the record price levels by proposing to the Agriculture and Fisheries Council to set at 0% the obligatory set-aside rate for autumn 2007 and spring 2008 sowings. After examination by Parliament according to a fast-track procedure, the decision was taken by the Council on 26 September. According to Commission estimates, the extra cereal output in the 2008 harvest coming out from this measure (more than 10 million tonnes) should mitigate the anticipated low level of ending stocks in June 2008.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Commissioner responsible for Agriculture and Rural Development has announced the same day that she would propose to the College of Commissioners that the Commission would send to the Council a proposal for the total suspension of cereal import duties for the current marketing year.</p>
<p>These short-term measures should contribute to the alleviation of the tight feed market and to ease the pressure on livestock farming.</p>

<p>The cost of biofuel production depends on the resource and on the conversion technology to be used. Current biofuels (bioethanol, ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE), hydro-processed vegetable oil and Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME, biodiesel)) are based on traditional agricultural crops which have been grown extensively in the EU and thus there has been no need to carry out dedicated research on their costs and on water consumption as these parameters are well known. Several studies have been undertaken to determine their impact on the environment and climate change. The greenhouse gas savings from these biofuels depends on a number of factors including the processing. The Commission in its biofuels progress report<a href="#defann_63_1" name="refann_63_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, came to the conclusion earlier this year that first-generation biofuels, produced in Europe using the most economically attractive production method, result, on a well-to-wheel basis, in greenhouse gas emissions 35-50% lower than those from the conventional fuels they replace.</p>
<p>"Second generation" biofuels, which are produced from solid biomass, are still in the development phase and are not yet commercially available within the EU. These biofuels are based on either wood or other biomass where the issue of water consumption is not critical. Several studies have been undertaken on the environmental performance of "second generation" biofuels. All have indicated that these will have a significantly better performance than "first generation" biofuels.</p>
<p>However, the production of biofuels based on agricultural crops may result in negative overall effect for the environment if produced in inappropriate ways. Therefore, the forthcoming legislative proposal on renewable energy will include measures to ensure that the biofuels used to fulfil EU targets meet minimum sustainability standards. In this way, the public will be reassured that all biofuels that receive support from Member States, and which count towards EU and national targets, are not harmful to the environment.</p>
<p>The Commission has recently published further factual information on many of these issues in the review of economic and environmental data<a href="#defann_63_2" name="refann_63_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> that accompanied the biofuels progress report mentioned earlier.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Within the scope of the EC Treaty any discrimination based on nationality is incompatible with Community law, in particular with Article 12 of the EC Treaty. The European Court of Justice also held that any differentiation with regards to the access to a service on the basis of the place of residence can be considered discriminatory as non-residents are in the majority of cases foreigners.<a href="#defann_65_1" name="refann_65_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></p>
<p>Additionally, according to the European Court of Justice<a href="#defann_65_2" name="refann_65_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, advantageous rates for admission to tourist sites, granted by local or decentralised State authorities only to nationals and persons resident within the territory of those authorities may constitute a violation of Articles 12 and 49 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>The Court has also consistently held that the freedom to provide services, the right to which is laid down in Article 49 of the Treaty, includes the freedom for the recipients of services to go to another Member State in order to receive a service there.<a href="#defann_65_3" name="refann_65_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a></p>
<p>These general principles are applicable also in the area of sport services. In the particular case under consideration, charging different fees to participants of the Rotterdam marathon whose place of residence is outside the Netherlands, can amount to discriminatory treatment and be incompatible with the Community law. However, until now the European Court of Justice has never had the opportunity to clarify whether private operators, applying different fees for access to sporting events, are also covered by Article 49 of the EC Treaty. According to the information available, the Rotterdam Marathon seems to be organized by private entities. Therefore, the Commission cannot undertake actions envisaged by Article 226 of the Treaty in the framework of the control of the application of the Community law, unless public authorities have been involved in the organization of this marathon.</p>
<p>The Commission would also like to draw the attention of the Honourable Member to the fact that the Services Directive, which should be transposed by Member States by 28 December 2009, will prohibit any discrimination with regards to the access to services, on the basis of nationality or place of residence of the recipient.

<p>A major problem has arisen in a number of industrial areas of Greece (for example Viotia and Evvia) concerning hexavalent chromium concentrations in drinking water as high as 15 µgr/lt.</p>
<p>The Greek Government, referring to Council Directive 98/83/EC<a href="#defann_66_1" name="refann_66_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on the quality of water intended for human consumption (Annex 1, Part B, Chemical Parameters) in which the ceiling value for chromium, irrespective of whether it is trivalent or hexavalent, is set at 50 µg/lt, maintains that the water in question is suitable for human consumption.</p>
<p>According to international reference works, hexavalent chromium and its compounds are far more dangerous than those of trivalent chromium. For example, chromium trioxide (Cr03) or hexavalent chromium is an hydride of the extremely harmful chromic acid and is defined by Directive 67/548/EEC<a href="#defann_66_2" name="refann_66_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, as amended by Directive 92/32/EEC<a href="#defann_66_3" name="refann_66_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, as a carcinogenic, mutagenic, oxidising, extremely toxic, corrosive, toxic for reproduction and dangerous for the environment.</p>

<p>The metal chromium occurs in three valences, of which hexavalent chromium is recognized as the most toxic. It can induce allergies and asthma symptoms, and its inhalation can cause irritations or even perforations of the nasal passages. It is known for its adverse toxicological effects and for its carcinogenicity, affecting in the first place the lungs. It has been classified by the International Agency on Research of Cancer (IARC) in class 1 (human carcinogen). However, this classification is only appropriate for exposure by inhalation.</p>
<p>Regarding oral exposure, by contrast, a long-term carcinogenic study reported in the Guidelines for Drinking Quality<a href="#defann_66_4" name="refann_66_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> of the World Health Organisation (WHO) did not show evidence for carcinogenicity. The available data on hexavalent chromium are limited however. Both the United States (US) Environmental Protection Agency and WHO are awaiting the results of studies on hexavalent chromium within the US National Toxicology Program. These results were due in 2006, but have not been published yet.</p>
<p>The current Drinking Water Directive<a href="#defann_66_5" name="refann_66_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>parameter value for chromium (50 µg/l) is based upon the WHO Guidelines of 1992, and the WHO 2004 Guidelines did not introduce changes in relation to chromium. The available toxicological data do not support the derivation of a new value. In the light of the revision of the Directive, the Commission is however reconsidering the parameter list of the proposal for a new Drinking Water Directive. It is closely following the scientific studies being carried out at present and will consider whether or not to make new proposals depending on the toxicological data that would become available as a result.</p>
<p>Nevertheless and quite apart from the issue of the parameter value for chromium, the Commission is very concerned about the current state of pollution of the Asopos River by hexavalent chromium, which the question of the Honourable Member refers to. For this reason, the Commission has launched an investigation in order to examine whether the obligations arising from EC environmental legislation, i.e. (Directive 2006/11/CE on pollution caused by certain dangerous substances discharged into the aquatic environment; Directive 80/68/CE on the protection of underground water; Directive 91/689/CE on the management of hazardous waste; Directive 98/83/CE on drinking water) have been complied with. The immediate aim of the Commission's action will be to ensure that the pollution of the Asopos River from dangerous substances be stopped so that the quality of drinking water for the neighbouring populations can be restored.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
