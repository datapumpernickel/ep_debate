I am also pleased to be able to report that over the last two days, we have come to an agreement with the national parliaments to establish a standing conference involving the European Parliament and the national parliaments under conditions that bode well for the future. During this conference, I had the impression that all the national parliaments in the European Union are interested in the success of the foreign and security policy and that the cooperation and the focus on the democratic legitimation of this policy will be worthwhile.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that we can do this at a time when we are seeing the first successes since the European External Action Service (EEAS) was set up. This has been a difficult process and is definitely not yet at an end. However, the first stabilising elements are emerging and it became clear during the course of the conference with the EU’s ambassadors from all over the world last week that a team is gradually developing.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a coherent foreign and security policy which puts the emphasis on setting clear priorities and using resources appropriately. Coherence, efficiency and legitimation are important factors. We hope that, because of the opportunities offered by the Treaty of Lisbon and the fact that one person and one service have been given all the responsibility, it will be possible to achieve further synergies which will lead to a uniform foreign policy strategy for the European Union. I believe that there is still potential for improvement at the top, including the leadership at a European level. The principle of unanimity generally still applies and, as a result of the quality of the leadership, this will bring the national states closer to a one-voice policy. I believe that this is important.</p>
<p class="contents">We are critical of some areas, but we have praise for others. I must say, Baroness Ashton, that we took a positive view of your approach to Iran’s nuclear programme and of your policy in Syria and the Middle East, where US foreign policy has largely failed in recent months. However, we are still focusing to a certain extent on synergies and a coherent overall policy. We believe that there are gaps and we hope that the situation will continue to develop in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">The national parliaments can play an important role, not only in terms of democratic legitimation, but also by cooperating, for example, with the parliaments of the Arab Spring as part of the neighbourhood policy. They can also make a contribution to ensuring that the Eastern Neighbourhood Policy leads to more democracy and the rule of law. This could also give us the power to achieve greater legitimation and credibility, so that we can play a more important foreign policy role. These are important tasks that we need to work on.</p>
<p class="contents">We must look after the interests of our citizens. We must ensure that human rights are part of this coherent policy and that we achieve a sensible balance between national interests and human rights in the context of neighbourhood policy, trade policy and other areas. I hope that the appointment of a new Special Representative for human rights will play an important role in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must also be aware that, alongside the need for greater military cooperation, which will help to achieve synergies in these areas, our security policy and foreign policy influence should increasingly be guided by economic policy. Wars are often won nowadays not using tanks, but using financial markets. For this reason, we must also understand that the strength of the European Union is largely dependent on whether it can resolve its internal economic, monetary and fiscal crisis. The fact that other parts of the world are using this instrument to acquire power in the field of foreign policy is an important indication that we as Europeans and as citizens of our Member States have only one chance if this is to lead to a common foreign and security policy, together with a joint economic and monetary policy. This is the only opportunity for the Member States to ensure that they have a future in the world by means of sharing and pooling. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Catherine Ashton, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. </span>– Mr President, I would like to begin by warmly thanking the Chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the rapporteur, Elmar Brok, for his impressive and comprehensive report. It is a really important contribution with a great number of good suggestions that we can certainly use as we build the foundations of the common foreign and security policy and as we build the foundations of the new service.</p>
<p class="contents">I have always believed that this Parliament – and Members of this Parliament – have a critical role in ensuring that we have an effective and democratic EU foreign, security and defence policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe – and have always believed – that, in this increasingly challenging economic environment, it makes even more sense for Member States to work together. That holds true for large Member States as well as small ones. When you look at the important issues that we face – let me take just two or three: Iran and its nuclear programme, the Middle East peace process and the crisis in Syria – we are stronger and more effective when we work together.</p>
<p class="contents">We are seeking to build the best possible service that will meet the needs of Europe and the needs of Europe’s citizens. We are attracting some of the best talent from Member States and, at the same time, we have harnessed the tremendous depth of knowledge and expertise that staff from the institutions bring. I pay tribute to all of them.</p>
<p class="contents">The External Action Service (EEAS) is fast becoming a centre of excellence and a source of ideas, policy and analysis, and our network of delegations across the world is the greatest asset we have. I have been able to open new delegations in Libya and South Sudan and an office in Burma/Myanmar, an office that I would like to upgrade. We need to develop this network. We are, for example, massively under-represented in the Gulf states.</p>
<p class="contents">What makes us different from Member States is that we work in a different way. In fact, I would argue that we work in a way that is unique to the European Union. When you look at all the crises that we face, when you look at all the situations in which we are operating, they are multi-faceted, complex and particular. In none of them is there a simple one-size-fits-all solution – political, military or economic.</p>
<p class="contents">The great strength of the European Union, working with Member States and with our international partners, is the range of diplomatic tools at our disposal. By mobilising them all in an appropriate way, we can be more effective in preventing crisis and conflict and swifter in helping to resolve them.</p>
<p class="contents">To develop that comprehensive approach, we need three things. We need to clearly define our strategy, bearing in mind our own interests; we have to have effective coordination of what we do; and we need swift delivery by the European Union, its Member States and the network that we have overseas.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me consider two brief examples. As Honourable Members know, in August I went to Mogadishu and was also in Mombasa and Nairobi. You know very well the challenges of the region. I am very pleased that we have the new President elected in circumstances of calm. Our team in Mogadishu, our Special Representative, were there throughout the process.</p>
<p class="contents">Just before this debate, I spoke to the former President, Sheikh Sharif, and to the new President, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, to congratulate them on the outcome and to tell them that we would remain with them. They asked me to tell you that they are very grateful for the 22 years that we have worked to try to support the people of Somalia and that they look to us to stay with them.</p>
<p class="contents">When we talk to the politicians in Mogadishu and in the region, we talk about a range of different activities in which we are involved: tackling piracy; enabling the World Food Programme to safely deliver its aid; bringing peace and stability to the region; supporting democracy and human rights; helping trade to flourish; building infrastructure; helping to fight terrorism and engaging in support for the peace processes and mediation.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of the work of Operation Atalanta, supported at this point by 11 Member States working together, with ships, planes, helicopters and logistical support at headquarters, working and linking with other countries operating in the region, successful piracy attacks have dropped from 65 in 2010 to just five so far this year. Those who are involved in Atalanta – and I visited the French flagship Lafayette while I was there – are the first to say that they can tackle the symptoms of the problem at sea but we have to find ways to tackle the issues on the land.</p>
<p class="contents">We have two other missions operating: the training of soldiers to help support the security situation around Mogadishu and beyond – I met the Amazon force commander who talked about the needs he has as he tries to drive forward and bring peace and security – and the operation that will help with maritime security, helping other countries to keep their shoreline and the seas free from piracy, especially important to countries like Kenya who have seen piracy now turn into kidnapping people from the shore.</p>
<p class="contents">I went to this mission with both admirals and the colonel in charge of those missions, but I also went with those involved in development and in the humanitarian exercise to work in a coherent and comprehensive way. When I met with the politicians, who were just about to start the elections for their new government, we talked about the range of different ways in which we are involved and the fundamental needs of development.</p>
<p class="contents">As the AMISOM forces move forward, they need help to dig wells and to provide for the people in communities who have suffered 20 years of war. They need help in supporting the move away from crisis, for peace building and mediation. I recall the very brave woman in charge of the electoral commission who talked about the need to help them build peace and to build that coordination, to engage the women of Somalia in doing that, building a government.</p>
<p class="contents">I raised the European Union flag. It flies in Mogadishu above a very basic place that we have there – no more than a tin roof and tin walls, and yet it provides meeting rooms and beds and places for our delegation to be able to be active every day. This is one example, and it is an important symbol of that comprehensive approach that we work together right across the Commission services – right through to the provision of our military knowledge and expertise.</p>
<p class="contents">Another example is through the task forces that we have built in supporting countries going through transition. As Mr Brok has said, the economic challenges are great and, for those countries facing transition, they are immense. We are helping to support the political process where people are allowed the democracy they yearned for and that they sought and we need to link that with the capacity to help support them economically with the jobs of the future and the security for their families that will make the difference.</p>
<p class="contents">In the task forces, we have brought together people who represent a range of support. Members of this Parliament came with us and have engaged with these new parliamentarians. These are people who, even a few weeks before the elections, were registering their political parties for the first time, people who have never worked out how you build a coalition or indeed how you build a political party that has roots that go deep, and people who need to understand the institutional side of democracy and to work, not just for one election but for all the elections to come. I pay tribute to all the Members of this Parliament who have engaged with people across the world in doing that.</p>
<p class="contents">By bringing together, on the one hand, the resources from the Commission that can support long-term development, the instruments for stability, all of these assets that we have, and, on the other hand, those of our partners – the European Investment Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Africa Bank, the World Bank, all of the institutions who are able to put grants and loans at the disposal of those who need to build sometimes the most basic of infrastructure – and by coordination through our special representatives, our delegation and our services on the ground, we are able to translate that into a day when people come together and have business leaders from across the European Union willing to commit, to engage and invest in those countries. It means we translate and leverage the resources that we have, translate the several hundred million euro we have available into billions of euro – for Jordan EUR 3 billion and for Tunisia EUR 4 billion – over the three years and make a significant difference to the lives of people.</p>
<p class="contents">I think in taking that approach, it is where, as I have said, we offer something unique. It translates into how we support those countries that are trying to deal with real challenges at the present time of transition, not just in our southern neighbourhood, but also the challenges that exist to our east.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, we have been working closely in the Western Balkans, in Bosnia, to try to build this comprehensive approach on the ground. We are working with many countries who are engaged in Bosnia and Herzegovina and with all the leaders who need to try to push forward the government.</p>
<p class="contents">When I recently met the leadership in Serbia and Kosovo, Prime Minister Thaci, President Nikolić and Prime Minister Dačić, I said that I would engage myself in driving forward this dialogue. However, they need to commit to really wanting to find ways through that will help to support the people whose lives are made difficult every day by the ongoing tensions and challenges of that area. I will meet with them again in New York to try to push forward on that subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Supporting the process of change also in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen and other countries in the Middle East and North Africa requires our continued support and our continued willingness to address the different challenges. On Thursday, President Morsi will arrive in Brussels for his first visit. The new President of Egypt was invited by me when I went to see him in July. He will meet with me and the Presidents to discuss the developments in his country and his role and work in the wider region. We will prepare for him the same kind of injection of economic and political support for the future but we do not just wait for those moments.</p>
<p class="contents">In Egypt, in July, we provided two million rural Egyptian women with identity cards because without an identity card, you cannot get health care or open a bank account and you are not recognised as an individual. For those women, something that is very simple and very straightforward was beyond their capacity to be able to do. We have to be in action all the time and to be in support of the people of the country – and, I would argue, in the countries in transition, to be especially aware of the role of women.</p>
<p class="contents">We will talk more about Syria later but I, of course, remain appalled by the violence and human rights violations which have occurred there. When I spoke with Mr Brahimi, the new representative, I offered him the full support of the European Union, including from the delegation we still have on the ground. In my discussions with countries immediately affected surrounding Syria, we have also offered them additional support. You will have seen an additional EUR 50 million being given this weekend.</p>
<p class="contents">We also remain committed on the Middle East peace process. The goal is a just and lasting two-state solution. We need to make sure that we continue to move forward and recognise the additional challenges that are faced at the moment by Prime Minister Fayed and the Palestinian Authority in financial terms. I spoke with him yesterday and we will work together, along with the AHLC and the Norwegian Foreign Minister, to secure additional support in New York to try to make sure that the work that has been done, and which is well recognised by Israel as well as by the World Bank and countries of the region and beyond, is not allowed to fail.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we also need to understand the needs of Israel – its deep concern for its security and its worries at the present time. So we have to continue to try and find a way through that will bring security for both, but, in my view, it is increasingly urgent.</p>
<p class="contents">I also mention, in the spirit of that region, the work that we do on Iran. I am very grateful for what Mr Brok said about my role as leader of the negotiations. I have spent 48 hours in direct negotiation and I spent an additional 18 hours in bilateral negotiations. I spoke with Dr Jalili, my counterpart, a couple of weeks ago to urge on him the need to make progress and to keep moving on the diplomatic track.</p>
<p class="contents">The E3+3 will meet during the General Assembly and we are having further contacts. But, at the same time, as the report reminds us, we must not neglect the broader agenda, including human rights and regional security.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look to our east again – and I have mentioned Serbia, Kosovo and what is happening in Bosnia and Herzegovina – we have to continue to monitor the situation in Belarus, where the situation on human rights and democracy worries me a great deal. We have a policy of critical engagement and, with our measures, we continue to target those responsible for the crackdown and those associated with it. At the same time, we continue to engage with the people, with civil society and opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">In Ukraine, where Helga Schmid, the political director, is meeting today with the opposition parties, we want to see progress on three issues: selective justice, the conduct of free and fair parliamentary elections on 28 October, and the resumption of the delayed reforms in the joint EU-Ukraine Association Agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">When I look at that part of the world, I am pleased to see what is happening in Moldova. Moving dynamically within our broader Eastern partnership, we will also remain actively engaged in the 5+2 talks on the question of resolving the issues in Transnistria.</p>
<p class="contents">But we, of course, look at the region and consider too the issues of elections that are moving towards us, especially in Georgia. I met recently with President Saakashvili and we have sent messages to the opposition. We are very clear that we need a good election process and we need to make sure that it is run well. We will have observers there and we will have political support to ensure that the future of Georgia is assured.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also always continuing in our efforts in our relationships with Armenia and Azerbaijan. I visited both in the last few months and I have to say that I deeply regretted the recent decision to pardon Safarov, which went against commitments made by Azerbaijan and which has fuelled tensions in the region. I have expressed, together with Commissioner Füle, our concern. We have been following up on this and our special representative is currently in the region. I know Parliament will debate this on Thursday.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have indicated to you, much of what we do is in partnership. We work in close consultation and cooperation with the United States in our areas of common interest, especially the Western Balkans, the southern neighbourhood, and in the Asia-Pacific, where we met recently with the ASEAN countries and where Secretary Clinton and I held a bilateral meeting on the issues of that region. We remain in touch with the State Department on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also going to speak later on about Russia, so I will not say anything further about Russia in this debate in order that we can have a bigger debate later and save time. But, of course, it is critically important that we engage with the people of Russia and that we ensure that we have strong relationships.</p>
<p class="contents">When I went to China recently, we moved forward in trying to develop the dialogue that we have on global and regional issues. We have agreed a regular dialogue on defence and security policies and we have agreed to strengthen our cooperation on combating piracy. I have already said that, on the work that we do on Iran, we work closely with the E3+3 and China is a key partner in this, as it is also – as I have indicated – in the fight against piracy.</p>
<p class="contents">But as our relationship with China strengthens, we need to emphasise the importance of universal values and freedoms. During my nine hours of discussion with State Councillor Dai Bingguo, my counterpart, we had a very long discussion and debate on human rights. I brought that into the dialogue that I had with him as well as the dialogue that we had on human rights as a separate discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">Also with India, we have agreed to hold annual foreign policy consultations where we have a security dialogue, we work together in a Joint Working Group on Counter-Terrorism and where we cooperate on anti-piracy and cybersecurity issues. We have strengthened that relationship dramatically in the last year but, of course, I continue to try to support a solution, working with the Italian Government, for the two marines on trial in India.</p>
<p class="contents">Our cooperation with our other strategic partners goes on – Canada, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, Japan and South Korea. Countries like Mexico and Brazil play an important role in promoting open markets in their region and following the political crisis in Paraguay. In my visits to Brazil, India and South Africa, I have promoted the idea of working together on development and international issues, using the common interests and values that we share, but I have to say that we have more to do on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the three, I most recently visited South Africa, and I want to say a word on the recent events. While I was in Pretoria, I was able to offer condolences on behalf of the European Union for the loss of life at the Marikana mine. Our thoughts are with the families affected at this terrible time.</p>
<p class="contents">I had the opportunity to discuss this in great detail with both the Foreign Minister and the Defence Minister. I think the South African authorities have taken the necessary steps now to establish the circumstances that led to these tragic events, through a full judicial Commission of inquiry and an inter-ministerial committee to provide assistance and support to the families of those who were killed.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be wrong to speculate and try to anticipate the findings of the Commission, but it is important to examine the root causes as well as the circumstances of these events and, as Mr Brok’s report says, not to neglect the broader issues in our discussions with South Africa and the region.</p>
<p class="contents">There is much more that we can do to work closely with regional organisations – organisations like the Arab League, the African Union, ASEAN, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation – and, of course, with the United Nations, both in its broader role and its role in the regions.</p>
<p class="contents">We have worked together closely on the future of Libya with the United Nations, the African Union, the Arab League, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation – an idea that came from me to the Secretary-General – and we worked very closely with organisations, especially the Arab League, on Syria. We have done very practical things to foster this cooperation with the Arab League. For example, we have equipped their crisis room at their headquarters in Cairo which I will be proud to visit and open in November.</p>
<p class="contents">When we look at all the different geographical areas of the world, we also have to remember that many of the challenges of the world are what we call horizontal – the potential for crisis and conflict because of energy or climate change or water are very real. Last week at the Gymnich, I took the opportunity to talk again with Foreign Ministers about some of these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">We specifically focused on water and education. It was because I recognised that, when we think about the Middle East peace process, water is a final status issue. When we think about what is happening in central Asia, there are real difficulties concerning water. The Sahel, the Nile basin and the Arabian Peninsula are all areas where water plays an incredibly vital role in the potential for conflict and we need to be engaged with that.</p>
<p class="contents">I have said a lot about what we try to do and how we try to do it, but, of course, what really matters is why. We do this to promote and protect human rights and democracy as the guiding principle of our foreign policy. We exist to serve our citizens, to help them be more secure, more able to pursue the lives they want, to give them the right environment and hopefully prosperity, and to help others obtain what we have. I have reported many times the young man in Libya who said, ‘We want what you have every day. You have democracy and freedom’.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me end with a quick word on our interinstitutional relations. I think we have strengthened the relationships between this Parliament, the institutions, our senior EEAS officials, myself and others, and that we have tried to respond as quickly and as positively as we can to all requests. I think our information to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and to the Committee on Development is better. The reports and resolutions that are in the Parliament are taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for the idea of the EUSR on human rights. I was very pleased to appoint Stavros Lambrinidis to that role. Thank you for the role that you play in electoral observation missions which are held up across the world as true examples of a way to work with countries and to help support those looking to the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that we can do more and, as we build towards the 2013 review of the decision, I hope that we will be able to show, not only what we have achieved, but also to give some pointers for what more we need to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you to the European Parliament for the support that you have given the service and to me over this last year. I would like to say a special thank you to Mr Brok for his excellent report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Union genuinely needs priorities and strategic directions to develop its foreign policy. As foreign policy expenditure is often cut for the benefit of expenditure on internal EU policies, it is clear that we must achieve more with less money and look for ways to spend it as expediently and efficiently as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">My personal experience shows that this can be accomplished in several ways. Firstly, by finding synergies between the European civilian, diplomatic, military and development instruments. Secondly, through better planning of the civilian and military operations under the EU’s umbrella, and thirdly, by targeting the financial flows to guarantee the irreversibility of the positive results achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I am certain that the European Parliament is also of the opinion that a more efficient Europe with regard to the common foreign and security policy can be achieved only if we take credible, joint actions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Baroness Ashton, as a bloc we may be the leading global importer of goods and services, we may be the leading global exporter of goods and services, and we may be the leading donor of humanitarian aid, tripling the aid donated by the United States, but what credibility do we have on the international stage, despite your efforts and our own, if we are not capable of solving internal problems with due care and in an effective manner?</p>
<p class="contents">The new European External Action Service and the new common foreign and security policy have come into being at the most complex time and in the deepest crisis the EU has experienced since it was founded.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that if we want to have a coherent, visible and effective common foreign and security policy, we need to try to answer the questions raised by Mr Brok in his introduction.</p>
<p class="contents">How do we defend human rights in an international community that considers our Charter of Fundamental Rights to be a westernised view of the world? How do we reconcile the principle of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states, laid down in the United Nations Charter, with the principle of the responsibility to protect in order to prevent crises such as that in Syria, which you, Baroness Ashton, said appalled you? How do we identify new partners in line with our world view and how do we work with them, and how do we meet the challenges raised by the Northern and Southern Neighbourhood Policy?</p>
<p class="contents">It is a difficult task, Baroness Ashton, to solve our external problems, and that is not your responsibility alone, as we will see tomorrow in the debate on the state of the Union. We must start by doing our work internally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This year, its author, Elmar Brok, has decided to break the pattern of this report and introduce a newer approach, less conventional and more strategic in nature, setting a relatively high level of ambition for our CFSP.</p>
<p class="contents">A first hurdle to overcome has been that of the current situation which compels the EU to be more inward-looking and parsimonious with its means, in other words, while challenges are accumulating, our willingness and capacity to properly deal with them have objectively diminished. Under the circumstances, one wonders whether the level of ambition stated by the report is reflecting a normal situation unaffected by crisis or is attuned to our current difficulties. This is important because, in the first case, we might become unrealistic and, in the second, we might lack credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">A second hurdle has been the rapid evolution of the international environment, including the one in our direct neighbourhood. The report is inevitably a snapshot of the situation at a certain moment in time, while the international environment is in a state of flux. Therefore, one needs to anticipate and be in front of developments if one wants to stay relevant.</p>
<p class="contents">A third hurdle is our credibility. Indeed, we have to convince the rest of the world that we continue to be an attractive option, that we can both master our own problems and still pay considerable attention to what happens around us and in the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Inevitably, all these hurdles have influenced the outcome reflected in this report. Thus, time is continuously pressing and we have all had to accommodate ourselves to the new tempo and deal with its novelty. Consequently, there were numerous amendments, too short a time to debate them and reach the inevitable compromises, and last minute amendments which sometimes go beyond and outside the compromise amendments reached previously.</p>
<p class="contents">However, paying proper attention to this very important report, for which I salute the rapporteur, is indicative of our mission to continue to address properly international, political, economic and military issues in parallel with the efforts to overcome our internal crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">But we also need to pick our projects with great care, and if CFSP is in search of a big-picture project on which to focus, it should be, in my view, Russia. We missed the chance, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, properly to engage the Russians as a true partner in European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Several false starts and bruised hopes have left our relations fraught and distrustful. Whatever we think of Mr Putin, he is here to stay and Russia is now inside the WTO. So the Union should use its leverage to open up Russia to liberal democracy and to promote fundamental rights there. Gazprom and tourism are not sufficiently broad foundations for building a stable and dynamic relationship which, should we accomplish it, is going to be of great benefit to world politics.</p>

As many have already said, our debate is taking place against the background of the most difficult economic, social and political crisis the European Union has experienced. Another consequence of this is that government offices in Europe have insufficient time and energy remaining to tackle the many pressing foreign policy problems. Europe’s far too sluggish reaction to the terrible events in Syria and our far too rapidly declining interest in the democratic transformation of North Africa are just two examples of this. Another example is the very slow development of our delegation office in Tripoli.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe not only lacks time and awareness; it also quite simply lacks money. The financial crisis is bound to have an impact on the budget of foreign ministries as well as the European Parliament budget. In this situation, we must set clear priorities, as must you, Baroness Ashton. In addition to better use of synergies at the European level, for us this can only mean moving away from the often very expensive reaction to escalating crises and moving towards more conflict prevention. After all, civil conflict prevention is the cheapest and most effective means that we Europeans still have at our disposal. However, we have not used this potential enough up to now and our trade, fisheries, agricultural and development policy must finally become conflict sensitive in order for them to assist in preventing conflicts instead of fuelling them. Effective structures are still lacking for this. At the same time, we must strengthen the structures that have just recently been established in the External Action Service for conflict prevention and conflict mediation and broaden their expertise in EU foreign policy as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Another very promising approach is the idea of a European Institute for Peace. The Committee on Foreign Affairs will discuss this idea next week with the Swedish foreign minister, Carl Bildt. In this regard, I hope for your support and look forward to your answers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That said, we do recognise that the CFSP can play a value added role where Member States’ interests converge, such as over Iran, which is hell-bent on acquiring nuclear weapons and remains probably the greatest threat to global peace.</p>
<p class="contents">The CFSP is also a useful platform engaging China’s emergence as a global power over issues like North Korea and standing up to Russia where necessary, for instance, over Georgia or its support for Syria in the current insurgency, or engaging within the Quartet to further the Middle East peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">I happen to be the rapporteur for the Horn of Africa and again, this is a region with failed states like Somalia and new fragile states like South Sudan and the issue of the emerging role of the African Union.

I hope that developments post-2013 will not disrupt the <span class="italic">status quo</span> at global level to any significant degree and justify the forecasts in the report and by the High Representative. Of course, due to time constraints, I cannot mention all the chapters in the report, but I would like to focus on the question of the Eastern Mediterranean and the southern neighbourhood, which are vital to the European Union. The trend in the West is to focus solely on economic matters and that harbours the risk of ignoring vital geopolitical aspects of the crisis. This has been noted by the important analyst Ian Lesser, who states that Greece is probably going through a crucial economic period and that we should look beyond the numbers. The geostrategic position and significance of Greece are hugely important, given that Greece’s neighbourhood, from the Balkans to the Near East, is entering a very unstable period, with unpredictable consequences in the immediate future. We therefore need to stay on our toes and prevent social tension in Greece. The use of natural gas in the Eastern Mediterranean may, moreover, be a factor for security and stability in the Union and may help to achieve energy diversity. The Union needs to move in that direction and you, Lady Ashton, must demonstrate strong political will and fortitude, so that mining rights are granted within Member States’ exclusive economic zones as stipulated under international law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you are both aware, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left is a critical group that does not agree with the current direction being taken in the area of security and defence policy, because we believe that the time has come to begin a transition towards a model that brings about the demilitarisation of security in order to respond to what is creating insecurity in the world today. Firstly, there is hunger. Seventy thousand people die of hunger every day, while USD 4 billion a day is spent on armaments. Secondly, we have weapons of mass destruction, violence, unemployment and easily curable diseases. That is what we need to respond to in terms of security.</p>
<p class="contents">That response does not mean increasing military spending or obtaining more weapons and military alliances such as NATO, which can intervene outside the mandate of the United Nations Security Council and carry out campaigns of violence, as took place in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to listen to what our delegate said in her last report on the situation in Iraq, in order to understand that this is not the way forward. The way forward is to initiate a different, demilitarised process, in order to establish – through a redesigned United Nations – the true democratic world government, so as to meet that goal of achieving peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He was surrounded by the great and the good, but was never really sure of what was going on.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen the faltering and sometimes painful transition to democracy of the long-suffering peoples in the Arab Spring; the ongoing civil war in Syria; fears over nuclear proliferation; the death of Gaddafi; and the return of Putin. These are challenging times in which we are seeing relationships and dynamics redefined. However, at a recent meeting with an exasperated diplomat from the Middle East, he told me that he regarded the High Representative as being more of a hindrance than a help.</p>
<p class="contents">We all understand that Baroness Ashton drew the short straw. Her role is that of a caretaker of an unformed entity. History is unlikely to remember her in any great detail, but she once found herself elevated to the British House of Lords without ever receiving a single vote in any democratic election.

<p class="contents">In light of current events, I would, however, like to thank you for having raised the subject of Ukraine and its current political situation. You called it selective justice.

Just a few metres away from here, Yulia Tymoshenko and Juri Losenko are fighting for their dignity and their human rights at the European Court of Human Rights. Next weekend, a conference is taking place in Yalta. Commissioner Füle must make very clear here that Europe wants a strong Ukrainian partner. However, the clubs of oligarchs are fearful of politically mature citizens and are afraid of competition and the rules of etiquette and law. The oligarchs’ way leads to exploitation, crime and brutality.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not the European way. Europe has open societies, a social market economy and the rule of law. We already know that Ukraine will not see free elections. Many types of rigging are already taking place all over the country. We have witnessed hundreds of examples. The fact that leaders of the opposition are being held as political prisoners is a tragedy for freedom and democracy in Europe, in Ukraine and in Belarus.

<p class="contents">Ethiopia – an ACP partner, a major recipient of EU aid, the second most populous country in Africa and headquarters of the African Union – has been without a government since the dictator, Meles Zenawi, died in July, much earlier than the totalitarian clique announced to the people of Ethiopia. This delay allowed them to secretly engineer the perpetuation of their oppressive regime.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, yesterday, two Swedish journalists imprisoned by Meles were finally released. But we did not hear the EU pressing for their release, and we did not hear it pressing for the release of all the other thousands of Ethiopian political prisoners, including Eskinder Nega, recipient of PEN America’s ‘Freedom to Write’ award.</p>
<p class="contents">What can you tell us about your endeavours in that regard? Why is the EU so silent or at least so discreet in calling for the liberation of Ethiopians? And can you tell us what the EU is doing to press for an inclusive political dialogue involving all opposition parties, including the armed ones, so that Ethiopia may remain unified and not fall into violence, so that Ethiopia may now find that genuine road to democracy to which its people aspire and not go on oppressed by these totalitarian forces?</p>
<p class="contents">Ethiopia is too important for Africa and for the world for us to continue to turn a blind eye to what is going on there.</p>

Some people have asked you to clearly define your priorities and concentrate on priority actions, while others have asked you questions about everything that is going on around the world and urged you to do everything you can to improve the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, your task is also inspiring and we support you because together – but above all you and your team, who do the lion’s share – we are laying the foundations for an entirely new common policy: the European Union’s common security and defence policy.</p>

Having said that, I had a somewhat miserable experience along with my colleagues who were also in Charlotte, North Carolina last week during the Democratic Convention: the European Union was not mentioned once during either the Convention or the International Leaders Forum. Mr Brok writes in his report that the United States is our main strategic partner – and that is certainly true – but the fact remains that we were not even mentioned once.

The first conclusion, in my opinion, is that the banner of democracy will have some problems in the East this autumn, as elections will be taking place in Georgia and Ukraine. We have a great need for political support, and I have already written to you about this. We also need support for non-governmental organisations and for observer missions. If we want to be involved again in this great historical project in the East and say: ‘yes, it is possible for you to become European Union members’, then we must specify the criteria today that will be used to assess the elections. For this reason, the principal motto is democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue, which is very difficult and which requires your personal involvement, is freedom, particularly in the context of religious freedom. We are very concerned by what is happening in Syria. We cannot allow the events in Syria to be part of a final solution for the issue of Eastern Christians, who have always lived there and where they have their home.

Another emerging power, Turkey, gets similar treatment. No positive engagement, no mention of all the positive changes that have taken place, of the support it needs in dealing with the refugee influx from Syria, or of the potentially key role it plays in the region. We see the old sore of a UN Security Council seat reopened, and now the curious idea is raised of an EU-US transatlantic political council explicitly to run in parallel with NATO.

These are where the priorities should be and, in our dealings with foreign countries, that is where we should put the priority, and by lecturing countries like India when we are trying to arrange a free trade agreement between the European Union and India, all we do is create difficulties and problems over so-called human rights issues and inclusion issues and all these sorts of things, which is decidedly unhelpful.

If we consider the Middle East, for example, we know that violence will not help to put an end to the dispute concerning the Iranian nuclear programme. If Israel were to attack the nuclear installations, the whole of the Middle East could descend into war and chaos.</p>
<p class="contents">If the EU is serious about keeping the peace, it must undeniably act as a mediator between the parties to the dispute. The consequences of a war in the region, where the anticipated refugee flows and the security of oil supply are concerned, for example, would undoubtedly be felt very strongly in Europe. Peace and stability in the region can only be achieved through general disarmament, and Brussels must therefore exert pressure on both sides to this aim. Of course, Israel’s right to exist should be beyond doubt, and Tehran has to lay its cards on the table with regard to its controversial nuclear programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Brok’s report clarifies this in a passage which states that ‘the EU’s ability to influence the international order depends not only on coherence among its policies, but also on a real strategic concept of EU foreign policy, which must unite and coordinate all Member States behind the same set of priorities so that they speak with a single voice’.</p>
<p class="contents">Baroness Ashton, the problem for us is precisely this. What is your strategy for imposing priorities on the Member States? The crisis has taught us that we need to set priorities if we are come out of it, which is what we have done with banking union, fiscal union and monetary union towards a political union.</p>
<p class="contents">What is your strategy with regard to foreign policy issues? How can we make progress towards an EU foreign policy which, while I would not call it federal, will show us that we have set precise priorities to which all the EU Member States will feel subject? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I welcome, too, what the High Representative is doing more than 43 times a year on human rights, her appointment of the new Special Representative, her work, with our support, to end the death penalty for juveniles in Thailand – as was achieved just yesterday – and her bringing forward of the concept of ‘education in a suitcase’ for the world’s seven million refugee children, which shows that children’s rights are human rights. I would ask the Conservatives how human rights can be universal but not for all.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome what the High Representative said at the start of the debate about Europe’s ‘tin hut’ in Mogadishu. Normally, it is dictators who are ‘tin-pot’, but she demonstrates that European diplomacy has the agility, quite literally, of a ‘cat on a hot tin roof’.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and seriously, I ask the High Representative once again what progress is being made towards an EU common position on referring Syrian war crimes to the International Criminal Court? Europe delayed the formal pursuit of justice in the former Yugoslavia, in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in Sudan, and subsequently changed its mind. On Syria, the time for delay is gone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What is somewhat strange is that there is only one paragraph in the document that is devoted to cultural and religious dialogue. After all, foreign policy does not just mean armed intervention, but also an extension of the values on which the European Union is based. The clause about supporting dialogue and understanding between different religions and cultures which, as we read in the report, ‘should be an integral part of our external engagement with third countries’, does not go far enough in the context of mass persecutions of Christians around the world. In her speech, Baroness Ashton also omitted this issue. The European Union grew from Christian roots and should be more ambitious in approaching this issue, and should give it the weight it deserves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, the EU’s external action should be ambitious. I want the European Union to be a major player in a global, complex, increasingly multipolar world, and it is also possible that we shall soon see something of a withdrawal in the external action of the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, size counts in foreign policy; as Europeans, we are stronger together than apart, and this ambitious perspective for Europe is reflected in Mr Brok’s solid report, which we shall adopt tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Treaty of Lisbon provided new tools for this policy. I am referring to the position you hold, Baroness Ashton, as High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and Vice-President of the Commission. As you also chair the Foreign Affairs Council, it will now be easier to achieve unity, continuity and consistency in the Union’s foreign policy. In addition, you have a new instrument, the European External Action Service, into which diplomats from Member States have been incorporated, who will use their experience in foreign policy to enrich a vision that is more focused on issues related to economics, trade and cooperation by officials from the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a true EU foreign policy not only takes time but also needs two basic conditions to be met: the new bodies of the Treaty of Lisbon should be ambitious, working with the purpose of leading the 27 Member States, not just accompanying them or finding lowest common denominators; secondly, the Member States should be aware of the need to work together on foreign policy, acting in a spirit of compromise and taking a constructive approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not therefore think that this is the time for grandiose but empty pronouncements. The Union needs to find its feet again and set realistic targets based on its actual abilities. The fact that this year’s European Parliament report on foreign and security policy calls quite explicitly for the Union to determine such strategic priorities is important. As Parliament’s rapporteur on enlargement, I should like to make a point of thanking the rapporteur, Mr Brok, for his constructive stand on enlargement issues. I should also like to express my satisfaction at the clear statement that the European Parliament unwaveringly supports the European prospects of every European state that respects the values of the Union and is prepared to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria.

At the same time, however, it does not seem to me that we are taking the same approach to the same problems. For example, we cannot advocate territorial integrity and an end to occupation for certain countries, but disregard the same thing in other countries. We must take the same approach with everyone. It is disgraceful that a country that is engaged in partnership with the EU is occupying territories of another country, and it is even worse that a number of resolutions on the withdrawal of the occupying troops are not being respected.</p>
<p class="contents">The other thing that I would like to insist on is clearer leadership with regard to the Balkans. Many of the Balkan states do not have sufficiently strong leadership, and so they rightly expect us to show this strong leadership. We cannot make the same mistake that we made at the beginning of the 1990s. We cannot just mediate; we also need to be able to lead.

The emergence of common threats and challenges have led to a convergence of the interests of the nation states of Europe, whether within or outside the borders of the EU.</p>

However, the roots of piracy – the destruction of the livelihoods of those working in agriculture and fisheries – have not been dealt with. The competitor, China, is happy about this. It secures whole tracts of land for its products and secures, too, the fishing rights, protecting these off the Somali coast. Europe, then, deals with the negative impacts of all of this: mass migration, piracy, humanitarian disasters and the spread of Islamic fundamentalism.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Catherine Ashton, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. </span>– Madam President, it has certainly been an interesting debate, with a complete range of views and thoughts on every aspect of the common foreign and security policy, and indeed a couple on me.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to start with something that was said about the need to ensure economic resurgence and the security of the needs of our people. I agree with that. It is important to recognise that the purpose of trying to collaborate effectively on foreign and security policy is, above everything, to support the needs of our own people.</p>
<p class="contents">Making sure that we bring prosperity is about trade deals and about economic opportunity. It is also about ensuring that others get economic opportunity – to their benefit and to ours. Ensuring that we have a secure and safer planet, especially in our neighbourhood, is also about ensuring that we have safety and security for our own people. Countries that are close to Syria or which are experiencing the challenges of transition in the southern neighbourhood know this only too well, because they saw people trying to flee from terrible tragedy and to come and stay in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">So there are many ways in which that is precisely what this is all about. When people got together and said what we need is a common foreign and security policy, it was because they saw not that Member States were not able to do things individually, but that there were many things they could do better together.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a very simple proposition and nobody should get hysterical about what that means for sovereignty or this, that and the other. It is about what makes sense when you do things together, and indeed a number of honourable Members pointed to good examples.</p>
<p class="contents">I tried to show, in describing this comprehensive approach which is a strategic approach, that actually it is not just about dealing with conflict. Conflict needs to be dealt with, but it is also about what you do before and what you do afterwards.</p>
<p class="contents">So, our engagement with Libya will not just be for this year; it will be for the years to come until we are confident and they are confident that they have built the institutions that they need, that they have got political security. By the way, they are looking at the diversification of their economy and they are worrying about what has happened to weapons that have gone south from Libya into the Sahel.</p>
<p class="contents">I could give you example after example of what we do. What we do is we work on conflict prevention and we work on how to support peace building and we work together, 27 Member States around the Foreign Affairs Council who do things where they agree, and where they agree they give me the mandate to operate on their behalf. Everybody should welcome and celebrate that because that is about recognition by all of them that there is something more to be done where we work together.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree, by the way, with Ms Neynsky about the need to have greater synergy. Absolutely. We look for that all the time. There is something about trying to set up a new service in an economic crisis that means you have to think in cleverer ways about the use of resources and you have to work together. That applies in defence, where we are pooling and sharing and where we are looking at the results of Libya that showed us we needed to do more about refuelling in mid-air and where we are working directly with NATO. We are also looking at the synergy of Member States collaborating in buildings across the world, where sharing common services makes more sense for the diplomatic service or where, by doing things together, we can have more impact and we can support countries more effectively because we are not all trying to do the same thing.</p>
<p class="contents">Countries and Foreign Ministers say to me quite often, please, we do not want to have a procession of different ministers coming. Can we not just talk with the European Union and then you spread out the message of what we need, because every time somebody else comes, it is more time that they cannot spend on the things that matter. So this is about making sense of doing it together – planning better, working together effectively, not taking away but adding value to what Member States do.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree as well that you have to think strategically, and I mean by that not just geographically, but horizontally. Water, energy, education: there are big issues that I have already pointed to and which really do affect not just the lives of other people but ultimately, ours too. Ensuring the quality of water for children and for adults across the world has an impact. It has an impact on us and it has an impact, more importantly, on them.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is ensuring the provision of water, with all the complexity of what is now happening on the Nile and the desire for different countries to use water in different ways. There are enormous challenges in that region. We can help to support them to work out – and they ask us to support them to work out – how to deal with that, being aware of the challenges of water in areas where this can lead to conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">We have got to be clear, as I said, about what we offer and we have got to be clear about what we offer across the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to say specifically to Ms Gomes, about Ethiopia – and I will also be speaking on Eritrea briefly – that we have worked incredibly hard (and I was very grateful to Louis Michel) on trying to resolve the issue not just of the Swedish journalists but of many others. I explained earlier on about the need to engage with countries and with politicians, as well as to be clear about our expectations of them. We have done that and we have sought, and will continue to seek, an inclusive approach to what happens in Ethiopia.</p>
<p class="contents">I will also say, because now I can, that the Swedish Government asked us not to make a lot of noise in our work to try and release the hostages, the journalists. That is also very important. Sometimes I think people forget that when you are trying to get people out, occasionally you have to do it more quietly, because that is what is going to have greatest effect and impact. We will send you a comprehensive list of all the demarches and letters that will show you everything we have done on Ethiopia. Do not leap to the assumption that just because you do not hear about something, it does not mean it is not happening, because every day we are working on a whole raft of issues and it is important that you realise that.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not have any more information, Mr Schmidt, on what is happening with the poor gentlemen who is in Eritrea, David. We have been in touch with them as you know. We have delivered the habeas corpus that you asked us to do and we are still trying to get as much information as possible, but it is incredibly difficult. As you said, and as has been said in Commission meetings, 4 000 days is a horrendous amount of time for him. We will continue the efforts that we are making with others, because the partnership that we have with countries like the United States and others is really important.</p>
<p class="contents">Just two more quick points. Strategically, we work with everyone. It is not about the EU being the greatest thing on earth that only works by itself. Absolutely not. Most of what we do is in partnership with others, with Member States for sure, with the United Nations, with the Arab League, with the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, with the ASEAN countries and with others.</p>
<p class="contents">Think about how one tackles the challenges of a country like Burma/Myanmar. When I met with Aung San Suu Kyi, she talked about the need for us to coordinate because, as a country, they find it very difficult to deal with so many offers and with the many competing opportunities that businesses wish to have in their country, and they need help. They do not have the infrastructure, they do not have the knowledge, they do not have the systems. That is where we can offer support to countries to meet the challenge to move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is about priorities. I agree, I set out three: build a service – bring people from eight buildings into one; develop the delegations – bring the Lisbon Treaty to life in terms of what we do on the ground; and work in our neighbourhoods, where we should be judged and have the strongest strategic partnerships possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Those are my priorities for my mandate. I still believe in them and that is what I do every day.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as has been shown in this debate, every day there are other issues that people believe should be number one on the agenda. In the course of this debate, you have covered every continent and you have covered a huge number of countries into which you individually believe we should put our energy.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with you that it is about trying to be effective across the world, working with others. We will continue to do that. We will not be scatter-gun, but will be effective and efficient in what we do. As things grow, this will get better and better.</p>
<p class="contents">All I would say is: do not be patient for the wrong reasons, but recognise that we are absolutely at the beginning. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need to develop for ourselves a clear strategy on the issue of how Europe will fit into the new world order. If we do not do that – if we do not know where we want to position ourselves – we will only ever act reactively. We often conduct foreign policy like day-to-day politics, barging in unprepared, and often we operate merely reactively with these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">That is also linked to the fact that – in addition to the shortcomings that we still have in the European Union – the Member States are often unwilling to cooperate. Listening to some of our British colleagues here, it appears that they have yet to comprehend the added value of working together and that no European state is able to improve their position in the world single-handedly. This needs to be clear. We want to have a common position not only in terms of consular services, but also with the large strategic tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">How are we in a position to integrate the transatlantic community, also with the inclusion of South America, to point to one strategic concept? What about the relationship with Asian development? We also need to make clear that a preventative approach is the right one to take, Mr Van Orden. We champion our interests together, and only by working together are we in a position to enforce these. It is necessary, however, that we do this while considering human rights, justice and social equilibrium in this world. In North Africa, we have seen all too often that stability alone is not the solution. Stability only exists where it is linked with law, human rights and social justice. Only in this way can we elevate our position in the world order.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to work harder together to carve out this overall strategy. It is not an overall strategy if each of the 27 foreign ministers hurries to Tahrir Square together with a camera team to show that they themselves invented the Arab Spring. That is not an approach which can be used to take Europe forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Currently, in our struggle to achieve democratic stability, we should not forget Latin America, which is facing important challenges, as already mentioned: democratic consolidation, regional integration, economic and social stability, poverty and, of course, security in the region. On the other hand, our Latin American neighbours share our values and principles, and they have a number of emerging countries such as Brazil and Mexico, which are key members of international forums such as the G20; finally, the region has great economic potential, with 10% growth forecast for the coming decade. In view of this, I believe that next autumn, the European External Action Service should focus strongly on the multi-party trade agreement between Peru, Colombia and the EU, the association agreement with Central America, and the negotiation of the development cooperation instrument. This is a key region for the EU, and we cannot gradually withdraw right when it is expanding the most. In conclusion, the EU is, and should become, even more aware and involved in conflict prevention and the struggle to maintain security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the report to be adopted represents another important milestone in the close cooperation between the European Parliament and the European External Action Service in respect of the European Union’s common foreign and security policy. I am pleased to note that as a result of the motions for amendment I submitted, the report reinforced the human rights dimension of the issue, as well as the protection of the rights of minorities. Additionally, a separate paragraph was added to the text, calling attention to the serious violations of human rights in the labour and political prison camps in North Korea. The report thus calls on the competent bodies of the EU to pay increased attention to this region, and to provide appropriate support and assistance to the victims. I have already expressed this in several of my speeches, and I would like to stress it once again: the human rights dimension is inevitable, and must be a decisive factor in EU foreign policy; it must serve as a guiding principle for the External Action Service, the Commission and the Council as well. I believe that Parliament is a leader in putting this principle into practice and this report, too, contributes to this objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to add two minor comments regarding the sections on security policy. Among our strategic and budgetary priorities, more emphasis should be given to the objective that foreign and security policy should promote action against terrorism and organised crime by all means available. This action is an important prerequisite for close and continuous cooperation between external and internal security agencies, which is still wanting in respect of external security. My other comment concerns our relations with Russia. The report is correct in noting that one of the requirements of a good partnership with this country is respect for human rights in Russia. At the same time, I found the report lacking in that it did not demand that the Russian State assist the fight against Russian and Russian-speaking organised crime not just in word, but in deed. One example I could name is Russian cyber crime, which has by now grown into an international mafia. Many analysts believe that Russian or Russian-speaking cyber criminals sometimes receive covert funding from Russian state agencies. I believe that one of the essential conditions of our partnership with Russia should be more sincere and more efficient cooperation on the part of Russia in fighting crime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report provides concrete aspects on how to make the CFSP more efficient, better coordinated and focused and I advise the HR/VP to make full use of these suggestions.</p>
<p class="contents">I underline the importance of EU-US relations as a cornerstone of EU foreign policy and our priority partnership on the global arena. The EU has to step up its efforts in deepening the relations both in rhetoric and also in concrete actions, especially in the light of forthcoming presidential elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Relations with Russia have to be strictly conditional. The EU must demand from Russia to fully respect human rights and the rule of law based on international treaties and its international commitments. The new EU-Russia agreement has to be based on concrete achievements and not hurry into a solely economic agreement forgetting human rights and civil liberties. The EU has to strictly condemn the current politically motivated court cases and demand this practice to stop immediately. I welcome the rapporteur’s amendments calling for stronger EU involvement in finding solutions to ‘frozen’ conflicts, especially the Russian occupied South Ossetia and Abkhazia territories, and calling for Russia to respect the territorial and constitutional integrity of its regional neighbours. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The primacy we currently give to the values does not reflect our attachment to them, but our incapacity to define the geostrategic interests of the EU. Since we do not know our identity, we do not know our interests and we cannot define our long-term objectives. This is why we prefer to fight an illusory crusade that gives us the false impression of being capable of imposing our model around the world, believing that this solves all of our other problems.
