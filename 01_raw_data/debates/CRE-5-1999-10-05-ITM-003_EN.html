<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in recent years, and particularly in recent months, the European citizens you represent have been shocked by a succession of food safety scandals. There have been times when, like today, they were no longer sure of what they were eating, and no longer believed that governments or even scientists could ensure that food was really safe. Our task today is to make every effort to see that this distrust does not occur again. You and I are as personally affected by this problem as any other European consumer is. It is our responsibility to protect the health of our fellow-citizens. It is our specific duty to take the fast, decisive steps that our citizens are demanding. </p>
<p class="contents">Food safety is an integral part of health protection. The issue is also important because of its cultural dimension, which we absolutely must not overlook. Europeans see food as part of their way of life and their identity. For these reasons, the new Commission has made food safety a top priority and I am glad that this is the first subject of debate of my term of office. </p>
<p class="contents">As regards food hygiene and safety, we must be proactive. We must not run around putting out fires as we have done up till now, but must make sure fires cannot start or not let them take hold. To do this, we must put an efficient and credible food safety system in place. As a consumer, I have to know exactly what is in a food product, a packet, or a jar and I have the right to know because this right, amongst others, is enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam. Labels do not always give me understandable information and I often do not realise the health and nutritional implications of my choice. I often do not understand what the environmental and ethical implications are of the way my food is produced. Just suppose the newspapers were talking about a food scare. I, as a consumer, would not know whether there really was cause for concern or if it was only a piece of sensationalist journalism. If I looked it up on the Internet, a lot of the information would be incomprehensible. And I would not know how much of it was trustworthy or had been manipulated for political and economic purposes. </p>
<p class="contents">These are just some aspects of the consumer policy we need to think about. Citizens have to know the absolute truth about what they eat. A starting point could be to give consumers access to a Community rapid alert system, and ensure that it covers not only agricultural products but also animal feedingstuffs. This would create a system to avoid counterproductive alarms and simply crying ‘wolf’.</p>
<p class="contents">However, all too many of the recent scares have been well-founded, so we need to tighten up our food inspection system. The entire food production chain, from the fields to our tables, should be closely and rigorously monitored at every stage and in every Member State. In a single market, all citizens have the right to equal protection. We must therefore update the laws which the food inspection system is based on. </p>
<p class="contents">In 1997, the Commission issued a Green Paper which we must follow-up with the appropriate measures in order to streamline and modernise our food law. At the moment there are, for example, more than 100 basic directives on agricultural products and processed food. What we need is a single body of legislation. Food law must cover the whole food chain, from the countryside to the consumer. It must include the production of animal feedingstuffs, which has been one of the most sensitive issues over recent months. It must be flexible, so that it can easily be kept in line with advancing scientific knowledge and new production techniques. It must be based on information and sound, up-to-date scientific opinion.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission currently consults the highest-level scientists, whose views are transparent and whose interests are publicly declared. But we absolutely must win back public confidence in our food and, therefore, the scientists have to be independent of dubious political pressure. One way to achieve this is to set up an independent European food agency. Several Member States have already gone down this path by setting up independent food safety authorities. A European food agency could, perhaps, be modelled along the lines of the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA). This agency has no decision-making power, but takes action of a mainly technical nature, with notable swiftness and efficiency. If anything goes wrong in connection with a drug, the agency can find the source of the problem within hours. However, in the case of a food scare, this can take weeks and weeks. </p>
<p class="contents">Another potential model – one of many – is the Food and Drugs Administration, which has far-reaching powers of initiative and decision. Such a body would enable action on food safety to be taken very rapidly, independently of politics. The problem, of course, would be how to ensure that decisions were taken democratically. This is why it is so important for this debate to begin in Parliament. This is why we are here today, because it is clear that we are faced with a choice where the issue of democracy is extremely important. Moreover, I am not sure that such an agency could be set up with the guarantees that some people ask for under the Treaty. Here too, we must examine the matter more closely. I do not yet have a ready-made answer, as this is a decision we must make together. Let us remember though, that consumers need a clear, specific and strong choice, and not a choice that allows doubts to linger because, in recent years, we have had far too many of them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also add that food safety has international importance, as trade disputes with the United States and other countries have shown. The body responsible for settling these disputes is the World Trade Organisation, and therefore, in the Millennium Round, the European Union will be pushing for the establishment of credible international food standards, with consumers’ representatives taking part in the process. </p>
<p class="contents">We must also clarify how the precautionary principle is used with regard to food safety. This is another Pillar. The idea behind the precautionary principle is very simple: provisional safety measures must be taken where scientific information is incomplete and when there are still concerns over safety. The problem is that scientific knowledge is always incomplete because we are constantly pushing forward the boundaries of knowledge. So there are questions to be asked about the precautionary principle – how much concern must there be for safety? Whose opinion do we need before restrictive trade measures are introduced on the basis of the precautionary principle? How complete must our scientific knowledge be before these measures are dropped? We need to clarify these points and a parliamentary debate is a positive step. As for any trade negotiations the European Union enters into, I want to stress that our priority will be the protection of consumers’ health. There is no possibility of the Community being party to international agreements where we believe this would jeopardise our citizens’ health, even if this is a highly controversial point. </p>
<p class="contents">I would again like to stress that the Union’s food policy must have food safety as its prime objective and it should be at the service of consumers and their health. Health takes precedence. Having said that, I would add that I firmly believe that a rigorous food safety policy is also in the interests of European farmers and processors. Agricultural and processing firms must be in the front line when it comes to the production of high-quality food. Public confidence is essential here. So what are the initiatives the Commission intends to launch? We want to avoid knee-jerk reactions which would lead to disorganised measures. It is our duty to be cautious, concerned and committed to action. Food safety is a field where we must tread carefully without rushing in headlong, yet we must move swiftly. </p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, before the end of the year, we shall present to the Council and European Parliament a White Paper on Food Safety and a Communication on the precautionary principle, which must be studied thoroughly. The White Paper will include an action plan on food safety, setting out a clear timetable for action over the next three years, including options for a possible European food agency. Our aim is a fundamental reform of food law and we will put forward all Commission proposals for this before the end of 2000. On this basis, we intend to establish an organised and up-to-date body of legislation by 2002, because some time is needed to actually establish it. </p>
<p class="contents">One final remark. Life is not a risk-free zone. No food can ever be guaranteed totally safe. What we must do though, is involve consumers’ representatives much more fully in the decision-making process. They, in turn, must try to educate and guide the public. These are important issues and reactions may be emotional. But it is clear that for a debate to be fruitful, it cannot take place in an atmosphere where passion holds sway. I look forward to a debate characterised not by tension but by clarity. We need to be sure of what we do, and ensure the safety of our citizens. </p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Florenz (PPE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, President Prodi, Commissioner Byrne, sometimes you get the impression that European food policy only moves forward a step when there is a new scandal. BSE and dioxin were good examples of this. President Prodi, on hearing today your very interesting analysis, what is lacking as far as I am concerned is precisely what you referred to at the very end: a bit more passion on this question. For politics consists, to a very large degree, of facts but also of passion. Otherwise, nothing new could be developed. </p>
<p class="contents">I believe, Mr Prodi, that it is not just a question of an agency but of whether we in Europe are going to obtain a European Framework Directive on Foodstuffs such as we have been demanding from you for more than ten years. Unfortunately, it has not been forthcoming. </p>
<p class="contents">I believe we have a host of good individual directives which, however, circle round Europe like satellites. Unfortunately, no-one complies with them. Particularly today, it once again becomes clear with what degree of commitment the Member States of this Union perceive this subject. For, as you have correctly explained, the Council of the European Community did not even consider it necessary to be present here during the first debate.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I regard this as scandalous, for the dioxin debate was a problem for the Member States and not for the Commission. I believe it would only have been good manners for them to be represented here in high numbers. For, again and again, in the sphere of foodstuffs, we have the problem of the Member States not transposing what the Commission and Parliament have quite rightly decided.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I share your view that the agency is something requiring real thought. I would, however, warn you against constructing a satellite of the kind of which we already have many examples in Europe: that is to say, glorified rotary clubs which operate on a very individual basis and over which Parliament has virtually no control at all. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">For years I was rapporteur for the budget in the Committee on the Environment. That is the only real access point. What we need is precisely the opposite. Parliament must have some control over the agency and consistently be able to influence it. When Parliament decides, then things need to start moving in an agency of the kind we are discussing. In this way, the agency will really be working for the citizens of Europe. That is precisely what we want. That is also, in fact, what we have been paid for. </p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you have correctly stated that we require a rapid alert system. We need a precautionary system. There is the concept of ‘company liability’. However, Commissioner, we have been experiencing just the opposite in recent years. All that about the rapid alert agreement was a complete mockery. The Member States have turned the rapid alert system completely on its head. That must be said clearly so that we might obtain the basis for a new environmental and consumer policy. </p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, let me finally broach another matter. There is a European Directive on the placing of plant protection products on the market. In 1991 it was adopted, and in 1993 it came into force. At that time, we solemnly promised one another to place some 700 active substances which are in circulation on a European positive list. More than half of this entire period is now behind us, Commissioner, and just one single active substance is to be found on this positive list after six years. All I can do, then, is to ask you: where are the hundreds of officials whose job it is to conduct the relevant examination? I think it is high time we took action. This is the next scandal in the offing, for which I should not like to be responsible. I should therefore like to ask you, on behalf of my group, to take up these individual points with gusto. We support you. And I must say again that I am in the same position as my priest in church: he too is always speaking to the converted, namely to those who are there. To them, there is no need to say anything. Once again, the Council is not present. That really riles me. </p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Roth-Behrendt (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Mr Prodi, I know that I was not very forbearing with you at the last part-session. I am therefore saying today, quite openly too, that I should like to have heard the speech you made today before now. It was very good. If you also really mean what you just said, then you may yet become a hero of mine. You have not occupied that position in the past, but I am prepared to think again. Until now, I have only wanted to place David Byrne in that position. </p>
<p class="contents">What, then, are we talking about here today, Mr Prodi? You have made it clear. We are talking about the safety of our citizens, about health and about consumer protection in the European Union. Let me, therefore, touch upon three points to which you also referred to some extent in your speech. First of all, what we call the precautionary principle. This must be the dominant goal of the policy of the European Union and of all its institutions. I shall give you an example, Mr Prodi, which you will certainly understand. This principle must be as important for us in the European Union and have as high a priority as, for example, the criterion of price stability for the European Central Bank. Have you understood this? I hope so, Mr Prodi. The Member States have not understood this. The Council has still not understood it. It is also your task to get this message across. We shall do our bit. That you can be certain of. The Council and the Member States are still light years away from this attitude. Therefore, work together with us in this area. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: what does the precautionary principle actually mean? It is about closing the loopholes that still exist in legislation. You therefore referred to a White Paper which David Byrne presented at the hearing in the European Parliament and for which we were very grateful to him. What ought this White Paper to contain? It must be very ambitious, Mr Prodi. I would quote here for you, in summary form only, a number of tasks which must be indispensable component parts of this White Paper. These include safeguard clauses for foodstuffs. At present, the European Commission is still not allowed to issue any safeguard clauses relating to foodstuffs. It only has this right in the veterinary field, and that is a flaw. </p>
<p class="contents">Let us consider the area of supervisory authority. When it comes to supervision in third countries, we may not exercise any supervisory authority in respect, for example, of fruit and vegetables. This is a shortcoming. Consider the so-called rapid alert system, the early warning system. This must be improved. You touched upon this subject, and I am grateful to you for doing so. However, I should also like to tell you how it can be improved. It must be made transparent. At present, the Member States pass on information to the Commission in confidence. This means that you, Mr Prodi, and you, Mr Byrne, have no right at all to inform our citizens about any dangers. This must be changed. This is not the sort of transparency which you and I value. This is not an instance of keeping the public informed. </p>
<p class="contents">It must be possible to improve the ways in which supervision is itself controlled in the Member States. The supervisory office in Dublin must have the ability to exercise supervisory authority in the Member States as soon as there are grounds for suspicion, and it must also have investigative powers. We need legislation in connection with feedingstuffs. You have referred to this subject, and I say again that we need a positive list and we need supervisory controls in the field of feedingstuffs. We do not have any of this. We need the duty of declaration, something which I and my colleagues, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf and Mr Böge, have been demanding since the BSE scandal. </p>
<p class="contents">All this, Mr Prodi, must be achieved by the Commission before the end of 1999. It is on this basis that I shall be assessing whether you really want to achieve your ambitious goals. You have time before the end of the year to complete this White Paper. We in the European Parliament will then have time in the year 2000 to work on this. That is our task. We must change and improve the systems of supervision and monitoring. We have established that they do not work. For example, I am still calling for a dioxin register. I have already done this once before in this Chamber. We need a dioxin register which also includes other sources of dioxin such as incinerating plants and other facilities. In this way, you can see the close, two-way connection between environmental policy and consumer protection and vice versa. The two cannot be separated. The one is crucial to the other. How can it be, Mr Prodi, that fish for human consumption may have higher dioxin levels than meat? You need to change this.</p>
<p class="contents">The reports on residual matter which the Member States have, after a fashion, submitted to the Commission in recent years must be checked more thoroughly and more quickly. On the subject of antibiotics, why has more still not been done, Mr Prodi? We have known for months that a number of antibiotics in animal feed produce forms of resistance in humans. I therefore urge you to do something now, before the end of the year. Mr Florenz has touched on the subject of pesticides. There are more and more reports about the damage done to health and the environment by obsolete pesticides which no longer make sense in scientific terms. We need regulations to ensure that these are harmless. </p>
<p class="contents">I come now, Mr Prodi, to your, and my, favourite subject, and to the end of my speech. This is the third of my three points and concerns your “agency”. I put inverted commas around this, however the interpreters may translate these. What, then, do we want, Mr Prodi? What do you and I want? We want the best scientific expertise, we want transparency in everything and we want safe and harmless products for the citizens of the European Union. Is that what we have then Mr Prodi? I say to you, “yes”, we have a large part of this. During the BSE scandal, we ensured that the European Union’s scientific committees were restructured and that scientists are now appointed under an open appointments system, that their past careers and financial interests are known about and that the agendas, minutes and also minority opinions expressed are published on the Internet. That is what I want. I want transparency at a high level. </p>
<p class="contents">I do not, however, want what I fear you yourself want. I do not want industry exercising influence. You mentioned as an example the Medical Agency in London. It has the task of authorising drugs produced through biotechnology, and that is how it earns its money. If you make an agency responsible for doing this, then it is also responsible to industry. That is the wrong way to proceed, Mr Prodi, and I hope that you too will appreciate this very soon. With regard to what you are proposing, we must make it quite clear that we do not only want scientific expertise but also the exercise of supervision. If you were to discover today in the Commission, Mr Prodi, that there was a problem area in relation to the protection of plants, then you would have to be able to call upon the scientists to organise an investigation quickly, and I should like to be able to exercise supervision over them. Whatever else is created, there must therefore be a body of some kind, a subordinate authority. Whether we establish this on your own premises, Mr President, or at the joint research centre which we already have in the European Union or whether we locate it somewhere else, it is all the same to me. For me, the important things are supervision and transparency. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would say Mr Prodi (and with this I end my speech) that if we want to ensure that our citizens regain the confidence of which you have spoken, then we must be democratic. I assume, Mr Prodi, that this proposal for an agency, as you call it, is to be put before Parliament. You said that you had still not decided. Then I can only say that you have been lucky! It is this Chamber which must decide, and it is not you in the Commission who decides. In this way, we shall certainly arrive at a satisfactory solution. Thank you for your attention. </p>

<p class="contents">The recent Standing Veterinary Committee of the Union took the decision, a fortnight ago, to lift the embargo on Belgian beef exports, thus recognising the serious nature of the tests and the strictness of the standards which are now imposed by the new Belgian Government. The meat produced today in Belgium is henceforth certified as being of excellent quality, and may now return to its former position on the market. In fact, it seems to me that the European Union would be well advised to follow this example in promoting systematic testing for PCB and dioxin in all States, as this is not the case at the moment. It would be remiss of me not to mention the creation in Belgium of an agency for food safety, responsible for monitoring the entire food chain from beginning to end.</p>
<p class="contents">Victims of a crisis which they did not cause and whose consequences they have no control of, Belgian farmers, moreover, are waiting for concrete evidence of European solidarity, so that this dioxin crisis may be recognised as epizootic, in the same way as the mad cow crisis in Great Britain. This, in my opinion, is the price of Community solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">We must now, four months after the start of the crisis, rise above the emotional atmosphere – you mentioned it too, Mr Prodi – which has often dominated the debate until now. It is not, as I said, an acute problem limited to Belgium, but is, indeed, a case with a European dimension. What do we want to eat? What level of quality do we want for our consumers? How can we guarantee this quality? It is our way of life, as you said, Mr President.</p>
<p class="contents">To do this, then, the Union must invest more in the safety of the food chain, at every stage of the process, and decide, for example – as we have discussed – whether or not it is useful to create this agency, this notorious independent food agency, supposedly inspired by an American model or some other such thing. I note your various proposals, Mr Prodi, particularly citizens’ access to the early warning system; and Commissioner Byrne’s proposal on the White Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, the questions remain: when will this actually happen? What is the timetable for these proposals? I would also like to ask you a question too: to what extent does the Union, in fact, use, if at all, its own resources, such as, for example, the research centre into health and food safety located at Ispra?</p>
<p class="contents">As the elected representatives of the citizens primarily affected by all these stakes, which are crucial, this Parliament must play an essential role in this area. The vote on the next budget, including a series of amendments designed to draw the initial lessons from this dioxin crisis, will indicate whether we have decided to lead the way or not.</p>

Perhaps they do not feel capable of putting forward concrete proposals today, but we do. That is why we wished to propose a resolution for, throughout Europe, the series of scandals which have occurred means that, today, the citizens and consumers no longer have any confidence in their farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">The quibbling involved in stating that the Committee on the Environment has scheduled a hearing on animal feedingstuffs should not be an obstacle to the debate. Of course, one can listen to the experts on a small part of the subject, but the fact remains that we, as Members of Parliament, must take initiatives. It seems to me that what the citizens expect of Parliament and the Commission are initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Adopting a resolution today would have been a clear sign on this subject. From the recent past and its frenzied emphasis on high productivity, we have inherited a situation which, in the agricultural sector just as – too often – elsewhere, has subordinated policy to the major food-processing groups and major distributors resulting in mad cows, dioxin-contaminated chickens, motor oil in cooking oil, sewage sludge in cattle meal, and who knows what else? There is a long list of scandals which show that, as regards agricultural production, European States have been no more virtuous than their American counterparts, even if they have banned hormones. We should have the courage to say so. The recent attempts by some governments to control these industries are still insufficient. What is more, a good number of European States have not taken any action.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve this, we need regulations which prioritise the precautionary principle which the Greens have long cherished. In addition, we must agree on the meaning of this principle. For us it means getting back to the quality of foodstuffs which guarantees the safety of products intended for consumption. We are first of all asking for a list of all the toxic substances which can contaminate our food through pollution, be it of air, water, or soil. We are asking for regular tests in branches of industry where there have been problems with toxicity, and inspections in agricultural areas located in the vicinity of firms creating pollution. We are asking for traceability at all levels, not just in the labelling of the products that go into the housewife’s shopping basket, but also beforehand. We want to ascertain the exact content of products which go into cattle feed. Finally, according to this same principle, it is vital to wait for a period before accepting genetically-modified products whose long-term effects on the resistance of plants unsuitable for cultivation are unknown, as little known as the adaptability of weeds to GMOs.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Union really wishes to show all those who have suffered from past neglect that it wished to draw all the parties involved together and that they can once again have confidence in its policies, it must immediately put forward some very concrete proposals on food safety.</p>

Many active farmers who were working in accordance with good rural practice had to cease production. No details at all have so far been given of the costs of this. The massive industrial contamination of feedingstuffs through additives introduced without regard for any maximum permitted limit leaves the consumer with the justified impression that the production of animal feed has degenerated into its mere exploitation. </p>
<p class="contents">Disposing of used sludge and sewage sludge may be a problem, but guaranteeing the safety of animal feed additives must be placed higher on the political agenda than it has been so far. I expect the Commission, when it creates a food agency, to specify that animal feed should be traceable back to its origins and to formulate legal provisions which penalise criminal practices and reward working farmers.

It is always incomplete in the sense that scientific information nowadays is progressing, but it is the duty of those in politics to realise that until we are certain about specific aspects, we must not experiment on citizens. You mentioned a White Paper on Food Safety. We find this proposal interesting and all hope that it will not be like Delors’ White Paper on Unemployment, which, it appears, has still not created even a single job. Let us hope that the White Paper will make citizens’ lives healthier. </p>
<p class="contents">We also want legislation, immediately. We want to know who the inspectors are, and who inspects the inspectors, as an old Latin saying goes. From March onwards, there were delays – given that the crisis happened as late as May, when Belgium’s dioxin crisis was exposed – which shows that there are not enough food safety checks and that analyses of our daily diet to check for the possible presence of PCBs and dioxin or other contaminants are, in practice, non-existent or incomplete. </p>
<p class="contents">To move on to another matter, we believe – and there have been various surveys in past years which uphold this – that large-scale distributors often ‘like’ to coat defrosted meat with toxic substances in order to put it back on the market. In 1990, we protested at the scandal of the gelatine-coated beef, also from England, which hit the headlines in 1992, and of which consumers bore the brunt.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know what dioxin is made up of: chlorine, carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. It is insoluble in water, is heat-resistant and lingers for hundreds of years. I do not think it is very sensible to keep consuming it every day. There is meat meal in animal feedingstuffs, which is made from abattoir waste along with a mix of blood, feathers and carcasses. </p>
<p class="contents">Since 1995, the European Union, in the shape of the Commission, has ruled that, following the mad cow affair, meat meal is no longer permitted for ruminants. Let us consider ruminants. Meat meal was fine for fish, fine for chickens, sheep and pigs. The consequence is that by continuing this system, we ended up with the Belgian crisis. Chickens continued to eat meat meal. How did we discover that there was excessive pollution? When the threshold was exceeded by an extra 1500 points, eggs no longer hatched to produce chicks and then they said, “well, maybe something’s wrong – even with all those checks!” So, since 1995, meat meal has been replaced by fish meal, but then, if we investigate a little – because there have been very few investigations in recent years – we discover that fish meal contains a high percentage of meat meal, which is still made with carcasses and feathers in abattoirs. I believe that until today, only France has had the intelligence to say, just a moment, let us change to vegetable feed because we can no longer guarantee our consumers’ safety. And now we hear the European Union saying – and the rumour has been going round since August – that it wants to authorise meat meal residue for up to 0.15% of the total feed. But we must be aware that, if we look closely at the figures, 0.15% of 4000 tonnes of feed for cows means 6 tonnes. I do not think this is an acceptable percentage if we want to protect our health. </p>
<p class="contents">The Mario Negri Institute in Milan has shown that for Italians, dairy products, meat and fish are the biggest sources of PCB contamination. </p>

<p class="contents">The Council and the Commission would like to get the measure of this concern, but at the moment, they do not seem to be particularly capable of offering solutions other than pernickety but overcautious regulations, which the sharpest and most unscrupulous people will continue to circumvent, to the detriment of food safety. Recent examples provide clear evidence of this.</p>
<p class="contents">So, I would like to take advantage of this general debate to stress to my fellow Members and to the other institutions the need to get back to a few common-sense principles which have been swept away by great theories which are based too much on economic concerns and not enough on human concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">Confidence is not achieved by decree, it must be earned. Of course, it may be something innate, especially in the case of country products which are subject to quality rules which are handed down for generations sometimes. So, let us take advantage of this in order to recognise and acknowledge as justifiably special the products which are deserving of confidence. At least, let us leave those who have forever known and practised their business with the complete confidence of the consumers to continue to do so, without raising the guillotine blade of unsuitable directives above their head, unsuitable because the author of the directives is unable to grasp the reality of the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">These country products, I say to you, should never be penalised under Community regulations, especially not when they are sold as local produce, for their quality is almost certainly the best guarantee of food safety. Let me take our local farmers’ markets as just one example. Of course, the fruit and vegetables that I find locally are not kept in isothermic containers, but at least we know where the products come from. If they are not fresh, they rot. So, in this case, sell-by labels are not needed.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, when one does not have the privilege of living so close to the production sites, it is necessary to intervene in order to merit confidence, and never to betray it. But I worry when I see that the most basic safety measures are not taken. Whether it is a case of negligence or deliberate disregard, it is a serious error for which all the parties responsible must be accountable to the population.</p>
<p class="contents">So, in order to ensure food safety in the face of the unknown, I believe that, going beyond the practice of scientific committees which is far too widespread in the United States – and which I deplore, even here in the European Union – with decisions taken behind closed doors, we must, above all, guarantee the consumer complete and accurate information right from the original production sites. The transparency of these products, their traceability with details of their production and components, and comprehensive labelling will enable everyone to be kept informed. In addition, the use of non-natural components, such as GMOs or hormones must be clearly indicated, even if we want them to be banned.</p>
<p class="contents">How many more scandals must we expect before requiring, without risking incurring fines, recognition of the precautionary principle which, in the field of human health, is the only one capable of guaranteeing consumers the protection they are entitled to? This is the question you must answer today if this debate is not to have been in vain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After all, Europe has more competence in the agricultural sphere, which absorbs half our budget, than it does in any other area. Nevertheless, we have had to contend with what have proved to be particularly severe forms of food poisoning in various Member States in recent years and there is little or no supervision in the agro-industry, which incorporates all manner of filth and rubbish into the food chain.</p>
<p class="contents">My country is now having to contend with the consequences of the notorious dioxin crisis. But everyone knows that what is happening in my country is just the tip of the iceberg and that the food safety problem is not confined to one or a few countries. Everywhere you look, there are residues of medicines and pesticides in the food chain. There are salmonella and dioxin problems everywhere and the list just goes on.</p>
<p class="contents">We do have a large number of European regulations and standards but they are rather fragmented. There appears to be a lack of a framework. Most importantly, there is no effective supervisory body to ensure that all these regulations and standards are adhered to. At the present time, more and more people in my country are asking the question, and rightly so, if it is normal practice for us to foot the bill for the stringent standards adhered to and, especially, for the stringent supervision exercised in our country when other Member States, I regret to say, do not take a blind bit of notice of these standards and supervision. It is an either/or situation. But since there is a free market and open borders and almost unlimited imports, including those from non-member States I might add, then effective measures must also be taken to impose common safety and environmental standards within the European Union, but also in the countries from which our food imports originate. These standards must then be supervised in earnest.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, European agricultural policy absorbs half of our budget. 80% of that budget goes on 20% of agricultural enterprises, which is a very clear sign, of course, that for years European agricultural policy has taken the side of the agro-industry rather than that of the small-scale producers of high-quality agricultural products.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that some responsibility for the problems we are facing should also be taken at European level, and that the EU should step in with financial aid when large numbers of small-scale farmers and agricultural enterprises in my country fall victim to what in many cases amounts to nothing less than the derailment of European agricultural policy.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Well, the debate is being held today after all, and as we are here and we have heard President Prodi’s statement, we have been able to take into consideration the things he has announced, i.e. the creation of an independent European food agency, prioritisation of food safety, strengthening of controls, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope however that these proposals are not just empty words. A European agency may be effective, but it may also be no more than a group of officials attempting to deal with problems far removed from real events, and this is not what consumers expect. Given the many scandals we have seen in the food sector and the growing concern of consumers, passed on, what is more, by political decision-makers, I believe there is an urgent demand for greater transparency, more controls, greater traceability, and especially greater responsibility at every stage of production.</p>
<p class="contents">President Prodi, there is no way around true reform in agriculture. I believe that recent decades show that we have been playing the role of the sorcerer’s apprentice. So, today, we are faced with food scandals relating to BSE, dioxin, antibiotics, pesticides, and the excessive use of fertilisers as well. What scandals we have already witnessed, and how many more are still to come? So, Mr President, you would be specifically to blame if you were unable to propose a real reform in agriculture and, from that point of view Madam President, it is a pity that the Council is not represented here, since agricultural policy is chiefly dependent on the Council. It is not possible to progress without carrying out real reform, one more concerned with product quality and respect for the environment. True, all this has a price, the price of extensive production, but the agricultural budget is a sizeable one and all that is required is the political will to change the way it is distributed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Commissioner, Commission President, Madam President, we must present a united front in the discussions we are to have with the United States about our relationships within the context of the WTO. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome what President Prodi has said today. The citizens of Europe have the right to know what they are eating, where it was produced and by what means, and to have these things clearly indicated and labelled. Of course, all of us believe that where other countries’ products are concerned; but we also need to know it about our own.</p>
<p class="contents">When I asked the Commission representatives in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection a couple of months ago about the reported illegal recycling of sewage sludge into animal feed in some Member States, nobody could define for me what sewage sludge was, where it was being used or why. Two separate directorates of the Commission were there – the then DG XXIV and DG VI. Everybody looked at everybody else. I would like to hear from Mr Byrne today, using this small example initially, whether he has got to the bottom of this problem. We are not talking here of a practice of which no-one knew the dangers before. It is a disgusting procedure. We need to know why and how it has been allowed to happen. I hope Mr Byrne, when he comes to reply, will be able to tell us.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need is the ability to act quickly where the law is not upheld. In the dioxin scandal, for example, what is needed, it seems to me, is not so much a mad rush to ban a whole range of products – RVOs and so on – as the possibility of discovering whether these things are new pollutants or simply products which have become polluted. It we can find that out we are on the way to a better scrutiny of the products themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">A food agency, which some have doubts about, is to me as credible and as necessary as an environment agency, about which there were also doubts at its inception. It would provide a benchmark for all Member States. For those whose precautionary legislation is defective it would be a boost and a buttress. For those who now set high standards, as I believe my own country does, it would be a reassurance that we are all toiling in the same vineyard and on the same level cornfield. The tragedy is that in areas where we have a rudimentary common policy, through the scientific committees and the new Veterinary Office in Dublin, some Member States still break ranks.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had a relentless drive to achieve full safety methods in beef production in my country, quite rightly after BSE. That led to the end of the beef ban in August of this year, but not, apparently, in France. I would like to know now from Mr Byrne how he proposes to validate Community decisions based on scientific advice – as the lifting of the beef ban was – when they are flouted by a Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Safety issues simply cannot be allowed to degenerate into shabby national politics at the will of any Member State. I would like to know how the White Paper will ensure coherent safety standards, proper labelling and precautionary advice. We want to see these things implemented in the three-year target period that he has set for himself. It would be disastrous if we were left with the politics of retribution and recrimination where we could move towards common European standards. It would be absolutely ludicrous if we were to go into the next WTO round unable to set out clear standards ourselves which are the framework of the precautionary principle. If we do that we are left exchanging insults on the basis of self-interest and ignorance. Europe can surely do better than that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In so doing, we have known for the past few years now that cattle fodder is one of the weak links in the food chain. I can remember that when the dioxin crisis began in Belgium, in my country that is, people said: how could we have detected that? Nobody had ever imagined that something like that would end up in cattle fodder. I now ask myself if there are still a number of things which we do not suspect of being able to enter the chain but which do, in fact, end up there. And so I think it is time to set to work on a positive list and, as Mr Florenz said, to ensure that we know what is allowed to be in the food chain and what is not. That is my first important point.</p>
<p class="contents">A second important point is this: after months of hard work, my country’s faith has been restored in the European Commission and so, we are starting work using a system that is stringent and that is very expensive, it is true, but that is worth the effort nonetheless; it is one of stringent supervision and stringent standards. The tests on cattle have shown that there are a number of cases which do not derive from cattle fodder but do derive from contamination, dioxin contamination, caused by industry and by incinerators. We are aware of this in Belgium because we have carried out a great many tests, but what is the situation in the rest of the European Union? Is it not the case that efforts should be made to monitor this in other EU countries as well, and a number of other things too? Was there not a report on incinerators by the European Parliament and should that not be in the hands of someone in the Council? Could we, at long last, be allowed to know what stage we have reached? I had wanted to ask the Council something else and I think it is a pity that they are not present. We note that the Commission wants to be strict, not just towards Belgium but also towards the others. I hear that there are a number of countries that are nowhere near as enthusiastic and that are putting the brakes on. I would certainly like to know who these countries are and why they are taking this line. Am I right in thinking that certain Member States no longer want to go as far as the Commission’s proposals?</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that as the European Parliament we must support the Commission when it takes rigorous, rapid and explicit action. Its White Paper certainly must not be used as a delaying tactic.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet, a food agency does not create any security, and a White Paper ought not to be misused for the purpose of putting off long overdue decisions. We need a change of direction in foodstuffs policy. In the past, the Commission has made itself too much the mouthpiece of industry and all too often trampled on the precautionary principle. You spoke of labelling from field to table. All right, but what of the duty to label feedingstuffs? What of the duty to label genetically-modified additives? You know of the loophole in the Order on novel foods. What of an Order on novel feedingstuffs, an Order relating to genetically-manufactured feedingstuffs? What of a stamp of quality for foodstuffs free from genetic modification?</p>
<p class="contents">What is not needed is a mere shunting yard of a White Paper. Rather, what we need here is a quick decision. As long as two years ago, the Commission gave us an assurance about these matters. Really, we ought to have had these regulations a long time ago. What I am expecting from you here is a clear timetable and a clear statement as to when these legal decisions are to be taken. In the field of PCBs, too, more limit values are needed. We know from the EPA in the United States that there are further toxic PCBs. We also need clear rules and bans. It is not acceptable that you should demand more safety in the field of antibiotics too when, at the same time, the Commission permits antibiotics in additives. </p>
<p class="contents">As we have already been reminded, we must finally have a clear positive list in the field of pesticides as well. May I say one more thing. It is completely irresponsible to speak of industry’s accepting responsibility for its own actions while it postpones decisions about environmental and risk liability.

<p class="contents">The French delegation is extremely perplexed with regard to the comments we have heard if we put them back in the context of the crisis we witnessed several years ago, the BSE crisis or “mad cow” crisis. Indeed, following an assessment by the French national food safety agency, France decided last week not to lift the ban on beef from Great Britain.</p>
<p class="contents">I was personally in favour of lifting the embargo with regard to Northern Ireland. In fact, there was no BSE there, or virtually none. Controls and traceability of products were of an acceptable level there. This is not the case in Great Britain: the disease has not been eradicated and the numbers of diseased animals there is still too high to prevent all risks of contamination and to guarantee consumers a healthy product.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also taken note, like all my fellow Members, of the Commission’s intention to create a European agency for food safety and for medicinal products. I am resolutely opposed to this initiative. Member States must be in a position themselves to establish the level of precaution and food safety they wish for their citizens. We saw that the Commission was fully responsible for the slowness of the decision-making process in the mad cow crisis. I therefore do not trust the Commission to guarantee my fellow citizens an adequate level of health safety. The role of the Commission and the European institutions must, in the specific case of food safety, be limited to negotiating the precautionary principle within the framework of international agreements and to coordinating the policies of Member States and the European Union. The sacrosanct principle of the single market and globalisation must not be allowed to undermine the food safety which all the citizens of the European Union are entitled to expect.</p>

These are two matters which have been explained to citizens as extraordinary events, but given the frequency of similar cases in the European Union, in our opinion, we can no longer use stopgap measures but need real solutions instead. </p>
<p class="contents">The latest striking evidence comes from dioxin. We have to think of stable and lasting solutions. The solutions target specific areas: 1) the consumers; 2) a new agri-environmental revolution; 3) precise political direction which the Community bodies must give. Overall, the broadly positive note is coming from the producers and consumers. On the one hand, farmers, who have for some time firmly followed the set of rigid production rules, have been guaranteeing and giving their full backing to – as history and current events show – the maturity of consumers. On the other hand, a possible way to resolve the problem is linked to consumers themselves, who by now well understand the European policy on brands and typical products which aims to strengthen local European products that are perfectly able to avoid being crushed by international competition that favours standardised food products instead. But in this context, we certainly cannot ask the producers to sacrifice themselves in the context of problems which all too often means they give way and are beaten. They lose out in the market through no fault of their own and can only look forward to a prolonged period of trying to win back the confidence that they had gained by hard work and production costs which here again, were all too often undervalued or at least, not given their full value. </p>
<p class="contents">The subject of production costs does not appear either in the regulations on rural development or in the regulations on consumer policy. There is not even the barest mention. Issues such as dioxin should teach us that, while it is true that farmers who have higher environmental standards should have higher incomes, in the case of food these requirements should also be applied, to an even greater degree. So, if it can be proved that the producers had nothing to do with cases like the dioxin scandal, then it is worth considering putting an appropriate price on quality.</p>
<p class="contents">The concept of quality has often been discussed and I too would like to refer to a precise but complex weave of characteristics: hygiene, traceability, safety, specific production – and environmental – characteristics, nutritional value etc. But quality – not the standardised quality which I mentioned in reference to the global market – must be recognised both in normal situations and even more so in conditions where producers face almost constant environment risks. Agenda 2000 and Regulation 1257 recognise and emphasise aspects which are connected with moves in this direction. </p>

Today, I want to touch on three points which appear to me to be crucial if these guarantees are to be lived up to.</p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost, we need effective legislation, at European level too, of course. You did indeed refer to 800 basic directives but in fact there are still huge gaps in this legislation. It just does not make sense for there only to be PCB and dioxin standards for Belgium, and for it not to be deemed necessary for other European countries. Neither does it make much sense to me that we are not to discuss how to proceed with pesticides, antibiotics and with other undesirable contaminants in food. I feel I have no choice but to agree with those here present who have called for a positive list to be compiled as regards cattle fodder, for you would not believe how much goes wrong there.</p>
<p class="contents">A second important point appears to me to be the introduction of a sound supervisory system. You may say that responsibility for supervision should fall first and foremost to the Member States and indeed it should. However, the Committee of Inquiry in Belgium has shown that things are going badly wrong there. To my mind, it is extremely important for supervision to be undertaken in the same way in all Member States, for there to be guarantees for this supervision, for the supervisors themselves to be subject to supervision, and for the agency in Dublin to be given more autonomous authority to exercise supervision on its own initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">My third and final point is one that I feel it is very important to touch on in today’s debate, namely that there is a real need for the work of all the departments concerned to be coordinated. We are all aware that there are many of them. Even though the Commission is being re-organised, it is still the case that a variety of departments are involved. President Prodi, Belgium has set up a food safety agency for this purpose. I feel it is also important for a coordinating body to be set up at European level, and that there is also a need for reliable, scientific advice, for coherent policy at European level. I welcome your announcement about the open debate that is to take place on the setting up of a European food agency.</p>
<p class="contents">President Prodi, if this agency is to be independent of something then, to my mind, it is essential for it to be independent of industrial lobbying. When it comes to our food policy, we cannot allow commercial interests to take precedence over the interests of the consumer. We believe it is absolutely essential that an agency of this kind should always fall within the Commission’s sphere of political responsibility, and always be under the political control of the European Parliament. Equally, we feel it is essential that all the Directorates-General throughout the Commission’s administration should work together in an efficient manner. I hope that Commissioner Byrne will be able to fulfil his role as coordinator efficiently and effectively.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For our part, we must all swiftly rectify this basic error: this is not so much a matter which concerns producers: these crises are crises of the food production industry and the feedingstuffs industry, for which the producer then winds up involuntarily looking like the responsible party.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to raise one issue which has not yet been mentioned, and that is the matter of heavy metals in sewage sludge. Sewage sludge contains heavy metals, including considerable quantities of cadmium and because of this, in my own home country, and in the Nordic countries generally, this sludge may not be spread on the fields at all, because cadmium gets into the food chain and thereby enters the human body. It is inconceivable that it has been possible to use sewage sludge for years in the preparation of feed and in fertiliser, although this was banned in the EU ten years ago. Our European agriculture model has received a heavy blow and, because of this, we must swiftly take up these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">President Prodi said that he would also deal with economic matters. For this reason, the factories using prohibited substances must be closed immediately. Then we would be acting on a sensitive issue, intervening in aspects of the economy, and that would have a very speedy effect. Such action, which adds to monitoring and bureaucracy, must be totally transparent, however, so that everyone knows what is actually going on. Sewage sludge and waste cannot be permitted to be used in animal feed.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are part of the three-cornered relationship of Council-Parliament-Commission, but I note that the Council attends rarely, if at all. This is scandalous.</p>
<p class="contents">We must search our own hearts. I feel that this Parliament behaved in a eunuch-like way yesterday in refusing to link this debate on food safety and the WTO with a resolution. I feel there is a need for a broadly based discussion in the public arena about the recycling industry. I endorse the comments made by Mr Whitehead.</p>
<p class="contents">We really need to have all the facts about what goes into our food. Waste matter must be treated as such. If something can still be recycled then it must only be allowed to enter the food chain having fulfilled extremely stringent conditions, and it must always be retraceable.</p>
<p class="contents">President of the Commission, I welcome your proposals. In common with Mrs Roth-Behrendt, I too feel very strongly that there should be a dioxin register. It is clear that our food contains dioxins that also derive from external sources. The situation in Belgium is evidence of this and that is why we must take action.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have been pondering the Green Paper for one and a half years now. The Green Paper itself has been in existence for more than two and a half years and, in fact, nothing more has been done in the meantime. The BSE crisis and now also the events of the last few months have demonstrated that food safety must be made a priority, but also that such things are only given priority when there are crises. We are banking on the fact that this is now going to change. Mr President of the Commission, the fact that it was you that provided the introduction to today’s debate gives us cause for hope.</p>
<p class="contents">Your statement was certainly full of good intentions but I only heard a little about the actual measures that are to be taken. That is why there are some questions I still want to ask and which I would be pleased to hear answered.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly there is the matter of the agency for food safety. It seems that an agency of this kind is to be something of a deus ex machina, but still we must ask the question: what exactly is its role to be? What would the division of labour be between the proposed agency and the existing one in Dublin? Would it be adequately staffed from the beginning? What would its relationship with the national services and agencies be? Last, but by no means least, to whom would this agency be accountable?</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the internal market. It must now be obvious to everyone that public health must take precedence over economic interests and those of the internal market. Nevertheless, the internal market is an established fact. What will the Commission do to stop Member States introducing protectionist measures under the pretext of public health? Suspicions on that score are rife. I would also refer you to the intervention made by Mr Whitehead.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point is prompted by the dioxin crisis. The Commission compelled Belgium to carry out PCB testing but there is no European PCB standard. It is an either/or situation: either there is a public health problem or there is not. If there is then the whole of Europe is affected, which means that Europe-wide measures must be taken and the same yardstick must be used throughout the EU. Hence, my question: will the Commission produce a European PCB standard, and if so, when? I have submitted a question in writing on this but I am sorry to say that I have received no response as yet.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have a question about the distribution of competences. I see there are no less than four Commissioners whose competences relate to food safety. My question is as follows: how are these responsibilities to be coordinated? Has a system of cooperation been agreed? Who in the Commission is to have the final word?</p>
<p class="contents">Then, of course there is the international dimension. The Green Paper is long behind us and we have the White Paper to come. We have prohibitive regulations in relation to hormones in meat and our own regulations as regards genetically-modified organisms, but the question is to what extent the European Union will continue to be able to choose its own policies, and how far the Commission will be able to go in demanding international recognition for the right to autonomy and the right to maintain EU authority over food safety and political choices relating to food policy. These are questions which I would be pleased to receive an answer to. I lend my support to the comments some of my colleagues have made about the scandalous absence of the Council from this debate.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have listened with interest to the debate today. I have listened with interest to the things which Mr Prodi has said in the past about how we can reach a solution to the crisis with food safety within Europe. One conclusion comes immediately to my mind which I do not hear Mr Prodi addressing, and that is the implementation and enforcing of existing legislation. Forget about creating new agencies, forget about new rules; why are you not looking much more seriously at implementing and enforcing the existing legislation? If you had done that, then we should not have had a dioxin crisis in Belgium. Mr Prodi really has to think about that and perhaps produce proposals for that before Christmas.</p>
<p class="contents">Central to the solutions that he is proposing is the food agency. We have to remember, Mr Prodi, that when this Parliament has looked at this problem of a food agency in the past, we have not been absolutely sure about whether this is the right way forward. However we, like you, are prepared to listen and consider it. But I have to say to you that we will have to ask you some very hard questions before we can be satisfied that you are moving in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">The first question will be whether it is a food and drug agency or a food safety agency that you are proposing? The second will be how much power you will devolve from the Commission to this new agency, and perhaps to some of the existing agencies, so that they can do their job better and assist the food agency in solving the problems regarding food in Europe? How will you ensure the accountability of these new agencies? Would you consider, for example, hearings held here in the European Parliament to choose the directors of those agencies? There are many issues that we want to hear from you about, Mr Prodi. We would like to hear from you today about them. We definitely want to see them in your White Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I would say that there is already a confusion in the minds of parliamentarians about who is responsible inside the Commission for key elements of this problem. We have Mr Byrne responsible for some issues and Mrs Wallström responsible for others, particularly as regards GMOs. You must resolve those issues inside the Commission before you take steps towards creating a food agency.</p>

For that very reason, support must be given to the efforts made by Member States such as Belgium, which is endeavouring to keep the consequences of the food contamination episode to a minimum and to guarantee safe and healthy food. I would even go as far as to say that these efforts must be continued at a European level.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider there to be four priorities arising from the dioxin crisis experienced by my country and these are as follows: firstly, Belgium has set up a federal food agency which will become operational at the end of this year. I believe that the same course should be pursued at a European level, but that there is no need to set up a new body in the process. The work can be incorporated into the existing office in Dublin.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, notwithstanding the European Veterinary Committee’s decision that it is no longer necessary for PCB tests to be carried out on Belgian meat, Belgium continues to carry out these tests on meat destined for export. I therefore believe that tests of this kind must take place throughout the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, supervision must be carried out on the basis of the same quality standards. It is not permissible for Member States to still be using different standards for ascertaining food quality. This distorts competition, which is to the detriment of those who play the game by the rules, if I can put it that way. European legislation must provide a quality labelling system and must ensure that tests and quality standards are the same throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, a European financing system must be established. It is not acceptable for one Member State to bear the brunt financially for a crisis such as the dioxin crisis. There are a number of amendments to next year’s budget on the table that will be able to provide the necessary financial room for manoeuvre. We hope that these will be adopted during the next plenary session and that you, Mr Prodi, together with your Commission, will give it the legal basis it needs.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this situation, supervision at the final stage and the setting of upper limits are no longer adequate measures. What matters is that we have supervision over the process as a whole. Interestingly enough, supervision of the process as a whole is laid down in the order concerning conventional, organic farming. So, in an area where production holds no dangers, we have supervision of the process as a whole, and quite rightly too. I support that as well. In the other areas, however, we do not have such controls. This kind of final-stage supervision is a direct invitation to criminal wheelings and dealings. Meanwhile, opportunities are taken to blend substances, something which – we must suppose – has led to the systematic addition of toxic substances in the field of feedingstuffs. This must be changed.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I should like to address is the need to restore the close relationship between producer and consumer. There is no place for anonymity. I tell you that if I were to behave on my farm in the way that much of industry, including the food industry, does, people would not come back; or, if they did, it would be with a stick in order to teach me a lesson! Then I would have no more customers. This close relationship between producer and consumer, together with responsibility on the part of the consumer for his or her own behaviour, must be restored. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In spite of this, the subject of food safety is high up on the agenda. I believe that producers and consumers are in the same boat here, for the producers are themselves also consumers. That is something we sometimes forget in the overall discussion. Losses in the cattle and meat industry due to falling sales caused by constant public discussion of these matters are, however, unsustainable in the longer term. </p>
<p class="contents">In Germany, a country in which animal corpses and waste from slaughterhouses are recycled in the appropriate manner, the discussion of animal feed has now become a macabre media spectacle. Unappetising pictures, together with headlines about the everyday cycle of horror in disgusting factories, are increasingly marginalising meat production and the practice of keeping livestock on farms. The fact is that, in a number of countries, sewage sludge is now also being declared a biomass and animal feed enriched with this is driving the last customer away from the meat counter. Feedingstuffs legislation is part of a quite distorted picture. I appeal to you and to us all. We can no longer skulk in dark corners. That must be our maxim! Should the consumer really be convinced, in the future too, that farm animals have been reduced to the status of interim depositories for dubious feedingstuffs? Is the consumer to go on thinking that we in the EU close down farms and so give up cultivating cereal, but burn the corpses of our animals and use meat and bone meal as animal feed? I cannot begin to imagine that, in this period of innovation, we cannot find new and different ways of disposing of waste. </p>
<p class="contents">Our farmers certainly do not want this policy. Should the consumer then continue voluntarily supporting this practice through his consumption of meat? He will simply not do this, and for ethical, moral and emotional reasons. Declining to use meat and bone meal as animal feed benefits both producer and consumer. Voluntarily refusing to be involved in such processes is something which is already seen to be having a very positive influence upon the way in which meat is advertised. </p>
<p class="contents">I shall say one more thing: as far as I am concerned, food is not superfluous junk. Food is now already being wasted, partly because of production costs. This state of affairs also has a bad effect upon European agriculture. Mr Prodi, it is not acceptable to deceive consumers again, as in the dioxin scandal. We need an entirely clear information policy in all Member States. The tactic of covering up these matters really must be brought to an end. I fully support you when you say that we need a comprehensive system of labelling. This should include everything of relevance to the consumer. But we also need reasonable prices so that both producer and consumer are in accord with one another.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am particularly pleased that you yourself are here today to inform us about a most important issue, even though I believe that it is too soon since the new Commission was nominated for you and your fellow Commissioners to have come up with specific proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that there is now an urgent need to set up a system of continuous scientific control not only for the safety, but also for the quality of food. Mr President, the Green Paper on food was discussed two years ago, and we are still waiting for the White Paper which I hope will outline specific initiatives and the responsibilities of the European policy on food issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like you to tell me what steps you will be taking over the next six months and to clarify who will be responsible for the portfolio for food safety, because I believe that, up until now, there has been some overlapping of competences. Now that we are undergoing institutional reform, I would like to know who will be responsible for announcing the relevant information and for tackling the crises when they do crop up. As part of the reform of the common agricultural policy, I wonder, Mr President, whether you should perhaps look at promoting small producers, so as to ensure better quality goods. Unfortunately, all too often, citizens have been informed about everyday issues which concern them when it is too late. For such sensitive matters, preventative action should be taken so that the food chain can ensure the physical and psychological well-being of all consumers and not be an object of exploitation for purely financial interests.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For tens of thousands of years, our forefathers have known that corpses, both animal and human, have to be buried or burned. They have to return to the great cycle of nature and become new materials. Nowadays, we seem to believe that natural cycles of this kind imply re-use and that animals we shall be eating ourselves should be fed with dead animals of their own species. We need to regain a holistic understanding and realise that whatever we put onto our fields we get back in the form of bread and, above all, drinking water, which is also an important form of sustenance. What we give animals to eat, we later find on our own plates. </p>
<p class="contents">There is a need for openness and public scrutiny at every link in the food chain. That is our best form of inspection. It is obvious that consumer groups, environmental organisations and the media should have free access to farms and to factories manufacturing foods and animal feedingstuffs. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Union needs a clear and precise set of regulations governing food safety. This would not distort the market if it were the same for everyone. It must cover agriculture, the methods we use for rearing animals, the feedingstuffs and medicines which animals are given and, of course, how the raw materials are handled subsequently. It is quite a simple matter to produce a set of regulations but very difficult indeed to monitor compliance with them. What is needed in fact is intensive collaboration and interaction at local and district levels. The European Union must create some form of supervisory system for supervising the inspectors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome today’s statement and debate as a recognition of the continuing need for action. It is right that public bodies and politicians, whether in local authorities or governments, should play a part in regulating food production and processing. The European Commission and we in the Parliament, too, should do all in our power to ensure that consumers Europe-wide can have confidence in their food purchases.</p>
<p class="contents">The BSE problem is one case where, at a European level, stringent conditions were put in place in relation to the export of UK beef. These conditions were met, resulting in the recent lifting of the ban which has had such a major effect on agriculture and related industries in that country. This came as a long-awaited sign, bringing some relief to our hard-pressed farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">Can it be acceptable then, given that the European Union body responsible judged it the right time to lift the ban, that individual states, without producing and publishing a clear justification in terms of food safety, should maintain the beef ban This decision by the French government last week comes as a particularly bitter further blow to Scotland’s beef farmers, whose herds are predominantly grass-fed and did not have a BSE problem in the first place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In our opinion, the main cause is that the social system puts profit before human health, especially when it comes to the profits of large corporations and the health of their workers.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is further exacerbated by both the liberalisation of trade resulting in the circulation of products which have not undergone any fundamental inspections and the severe competition which has become an excuse for monopolies to seek out more unorthodox ways of cutting costs and increasing their profits. Thus, fundamental quality control is being left to the consumers themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither Mr Prodi’s statement nor the discussions so far have touched on the core of the matter. Our problem is not about the confidence or lack of confidence of the citizens. The matter will not be resolved with food labelling or White Papers, nor will it be resolved by increasing the directives from 100 to 150. If we do not tackle the irresponsibility of monopolies at all levels, the dangers will become even greater.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe them to be the consequences of the policies that have been pursued.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a Green Paper on this issue, we will have a White Paper and 800 directives, but the root of this matter, the reality, is that it is a consequence of the economic policies and decisions which have been taken in Europe, and of globalisation. In agricultural production, quantity has taken precedence over quality and this has caused the balance to be upset. We have abandoned European traditions, we have ended up with extensive and semi-extensive livestock farming and, as Ferdinando Riccardi pointed out a few days ago, Plutarch reminded us in his treatise on animals of some cows who had gone mad as a result of becoming carnivores. We have turned our ovine and bovine animals, which are ruminant herbivores, into carnivores, like those animals in Plutarch. And not only have we turned them into carnivores, we have tied them up, immobilised them, treated them with unnecessary antibiotics, castrated them, inseminated them, kept them in conditions which are inhumane – and the expression is quite appropriate – for animals. We have changed to an earthless form of agriculture. We have abandoned European traditions. This is the real cause of the problems we are experiencing.</p>
<p class="contents">And apart from this, whatever happened to animal welfare? We talk of animal welfare, but this welfare must begin with food.</p>
<p class="contents">President Prodi, do you and your Commission really intend to tackle the problem at its source or will you carry on acting as a trouble-shooter and apply stopgap solutions every time a problem arises? I would ask for more investigation, more control and more accountability for those countries which do not comply with the regulations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, the European inspectorate must be able to inspect whenever it deems it necessary. The current situation in which a Member State, in the case of fraud, can hold the key which locks the European inspectorate, cannot be allowed to continue. This legislation must be amended.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must fight fraud relentlessly, and to this end it is necessary that some sectors, which have paid an unfair price for this dioxin crisis, are compensated by means of market measures. It is essential that fraud is never rewarded in any way, through direct or indirect measures. Food fraud has been committed and, therefore, the Commission must ensure that it does not, through any measure, for the first time, reward fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to point out that during the dioxin crisis, there has been a degree of genuine dishonesty between the Member States. We must ensure that there is Community honesty with regard to information policy. Perhaps this lack of honesty with regard to information is due to the fact that we were in an election period, but I must point out that there was a real war of accusations between certain Member States. This is very serious and we require measures which will safeguard this Community trust between the different Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We need urgently to know what steps the Commission is taking against the French. The British farmers are in crisis at the moment. GBP 1.5 billion worth of exports has been lost in the UK because of it. Commission scientists say they are satisfied, so why are the French flouting the rules? They have no new scientific evidence.</p>
<p class="contents">The BSE crisis happened because the previous government reacted too late to the problem. They closed their eyes to it. Cows should never have been fed the remains of other cows, but it was not just a problem in the UK. Britain is vigilant now. Since 1996 no cases of BSE in the eligible age group – that is 6 months to 30 months – have been discovered. Some other countries cannot say the same. They do not have to adhere to the same rules.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time we had a level playing field. Hygiene standards in the UK are second to none, and the ban must be lifted across the EU, including France. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am referring to food produced here but also to food imported by the European Union. The same safety standards are needed in both cases. This will form an important part of the discussions due to take place at the WTO Round.</p>
<p class="contents">What appears to be forgotten is that the food industry is of enormous importance to the European economy. On average, a fifth of disposable income is spent on food and drink. This means that BSE and dioxin scandals and the like do not just harm consumers and farmers, who are often able to do little about it, but, without a doubt, they harm all the workers employed in the industry too. This has many unpleasant consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I also feel that those who take risks with food must be severely punished. On turning again briefly to the relevant section of the food book or the Green Paper, I find that as early as 1997, there were calls for national legislation and European penalties to be harmonised. I have the feeling that nothing has happened there yet and that we are simply taking far too much of a softly softly approach. When someone infringes an environmental law in the United States the name of the company and that of its managing director are published, and so perhaps we could do something similar in the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="contents">I have just mentioned the publication of the Green Paper. However, the Commission now wants to produce a White Paper. I have the feeling that this will delay matters somewhat. It would be more useful to receive a proper answer to the questions that were already raised in the Green Paper. Everyone here accepts the need for integral chain management, but how is this actually carried out in the Member States? What control does Europe actually have over this and what options does it have as regards imposing penalties? Problems arise with the animal feed meal. What is being done on that score? It ought only to be permissible for animal feed to contain components of vegetable origin; why is this not so? If this were the case, then the feed would definitely be safe.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point relates to supervision. Our system for obtaining scientific advice is now very well organised. We must supervise food safety at a European level. An excellent idea. I am certainly not in favour of a system along American lines. It is the government that must be responsible for food safety, fulfilling a coordinating function. But what would the Commission do if, for example, food safety controls in the Netherlands were to be improved upon by those of a new agency? Would Brussels be informed? Do you have an opinion on this? All these sorts of affairs are going to have to be better organised.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I share all the views expressed by my colleagues in the Socialist Group. I would, however, like to draw the attention of this House and of the Commission to an often neglected aspect of this whole problem, i.e. the resignation of the parties responsible at the European, and more especially the national, level for the health and safety of consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Generally, authorities are slow to react. They do not always effect the necessary preventative controls. But as soon as a scandal breaks, public authorities go into overdrive, opening all the umbrellas they can, with the primary intention of covering themselves. This is the Dr Garetta syndrome, named after the official responsible for the contaminated blood case in France. Since then, the people responsible for public health no longer take any risks whatsoever. This is called the precautionary principle, in itself a valid principle, but one which authorises all sorts of aberrations if it is used by Ministers or officials whose only purpose is to cover themselves against taking any sort of responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">So bans are introduced with a vengeance, without any regard for confusion of the farmers or the shopkeepers who are doing nothing wrong. I do not have enough time now to expand upon the subject, but I would like to draw the Commission’s attention to the need not just for preventive action but also for increasing the accountability of all the official inspectors, all the experts, so that the precautionary principle does not become a principle of refusing to accept responsibility on the part of those in charge of monitoring food safety and consumer health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How safe is our food? Who can guarantee its safety? Who keeps watch over these matters? The internal market has removed frontiers and border controls, and we are proud of this and happy about it. Free trade. A Europe of citizens. Europe must now, therefore, also guarantee food safety. That is what the people at home are saying to us, and that is what we are concerning ourselves with in the field of consumer protection. I would remind you of the Directive concerning Product Liability of a few months ago which inflamed passions in this very Chamber. The crisis about dioxin in eggs and meat shows that directives and orders alone are not enough. At home, ordinary people are already saying to us: trust is all well and good, but proper supervision is better. Europe must accept its responsibility; that is to say, we certainly first need crystal-clear definitions so that we can say that one thing is healthy and the other unhealthy, one thing harmful and the other harmless. We need clear, uniform, Europe-wide standards, Mr President of the Commission. For us in Germany, sewage sludge is waste and does not, under any circumstances, belong in feedingstuffs. </p>
<p class="contents">Feedingstuffs are to be found at the beginning of the food chain, and they must be as safe as the food itself. Healthy animal feed means healthy animals, and healthy animals go on, logically enough, to produce healthy meat. That is the farmers' capital. Farmers must be able to rely upon manufacturers of feedingstuffs. Farmers themselves cannot check up on what feedingstuffs contain. Above all, they cannot know whether they contain substances they ought not to contain, for there are no labels specifying these substances. Manufacturers of feedingstuffs are liable for their products and they must also be liable for losses caused to farmers. What has happened here is not permitted under any order in connection with feedingstuffs. That means that the consumer has been deceived. </p>
<p class="contents">Commission President Prodi, we are reducing cereal production in Europe in order to avoid over-capacity. To save money, unhealthy substances are being mixed in with animal feed in order make it go further. That can no longer be conveyed to anyone. The trouble is certainly to be found in the low prices. If, for example, farmers are only able to earn EUR 1.25 per kilo of pork, then everyone wonders how the production costs can be covered. So feedingstuffs have to be cheap. The issue then comes full circle with consumers asking the question: are we also prepared to pay more for foodstuffs? Food must also have its value. We must be prepared to pay more for it. </p>
<p class="contents">Education and the provision of information can contribute to improving and enhancing citizens’ relationship with the foodstuffs they eat. But responsibility for food safety comes first, and only then can confidence increase.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me now again emphasise, Mr Prodi, that what you have talked about – and what has also in part become clear from many other interventions – is something which you ought to, if you would, take home with you.</p>
<p class="contents">For us, there are three essential points. We need good, proper legislation, and we need it quickly. There is one thing you must do in connection with this, Mr Prodi: you must also put your own house in order. It is just not acceptable that responsibilities should be scattered among different Directorates-General with the result that no healthy, sensible legislation comes into being. It is not acceptable that Directorate-General III should be responsible for processed food, drugs and genetically-modified organisms and that Directorate-General XXIV should also have a portion of responsibility for these while Directorates-General VI and XI should retain a small portion of responsibility for feedingstuffs. This is just not on, and I would ask you, Mr Prodi, to regulate the situation in a sensible way. Legislative powers belong inevitably with whatever Directorate-General is responsible for consumer protection and health policy. </p>
<p class="contents">What is more, we have established in this debate that we need good scientific advice. Many of our colleagues have referred to this and have said that we need an independent, authoritative advisory body. I would say again that any such advisory body must not be influenced by Member States or the interests of industry, Mr Prodi, and it ought not to have any powers to lay down regulations. This power lies with the European Parliament alone and, in a small number of exceptional cases, with the Commission in its comitological proceedings. Nowhere else! We must be in agreement about this.</p>
<p class="contents">We then come to the subject of supervision, Mr Prodi. When we have all this – that is to say when we have good, healthy, sensible and integrative legislation, together with good scientific advice – we still need supervision. I would ask you to make it clear to the Member States that supervision cannot be had for free. In recent years, the Member States have neglected their obligation to implement legislation and supervise production. They have never really reported to us about how many supervisors in the Member States supervise what, when and where. It is, however, their duty to do this, and you, Mr Prodi, must convey this unpleasant news to the Member States. When the Member States in fact carry out what should have been their task for a long time, namely to check that food does not poison us but enables us to live, then we still have a supervisory authority at the Commission. We have the Control Office, or the Foodstuffs and Veterinary Office, which reports to Mr Byrne’s department and which has its headquarters in Dublin. In the Committee on Budgets, we have just now decided that this body should have more departments so that it can carry out its supervisory tasks. I would ask you, Mr Prodi, to lend your support to the idea that this body in Dublin should be able to visit the Member States without warning, that it should have investigative powers and that it should be able to carry out its task of overseeing the relevant supervisory arrangements in the Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">Once these three goals have been achieved, that is to say, once we have designed sensible legislation, have access to scientific advice at a high level and are properly carrying out the relevant supervision, only then are we really on the safe side. Then, we shall have a system unlike any other in the world. We shall then also be able to go to the WTO negotiations in Seattle and say: everything is above board, we are not practising protectionism, we are enabling our citizens to live healthily and that is what we also want for you in the United States and in the developing countries. We want to cooperate in what we do. This, however, is our task: that we should put our house in order, as we already have done in a sense. It is still not perhaps perfect in every detail. We are, however, getting there. We must, then, also make this clear outside the European Union in the negotiations which will begin with the Millennium Round. I believe that we shall then be able to say to our citizens: nothing is ever guaranteed in life, but we are providing you with the highest possible levels of safety, well-being and health that, as far as anyone can judge and on the basis of scientific advice, we can offer at present. If that is your stated goal, Mr Prodi, then you will be a successful President of the Commission.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Obviously, I share the premises of Commission Decision 640 of 23 September 1999 which highlighted that on the basis of WHO findings, dioxin is one of the most carcinogenic substances in existence. This is why the WHO recommends keeping the acceptable daily dose at 1-4 picograms per kilogram of body weight. And yet, as a scientist and as a politician, I cannot help but feel perplexed and concerned by the conclusions arrived at in this decision, in other words, a maximum ceiling of tolerance set at 200 nanograms of PCB per gram of fat, both in poultry, in meat and in pig derivatives. </p>
<p class="contents">I wonder, Mr President, who can guarantee – albeit with this point of reference for PCB at hand – that the levels of dioxin present will not harm people? Basically, the danger is not only linked to the levels, but also to other pharmacokinetic characteristics typical of these compounds which have a half-life of around 5.8 years, maybe even 7 years. This means that they linger for dozens of years after intake. Therefore, after continuous intake, there certainly will be an accumulation which can be dangerous. I therefore think that the directives issued by the Commission which you lead should cover permanent checks on dioxin levels but also other pollutants, in all the food we eat. The same goes for the air we breathe and the water we drink. Taking all this into account, I think then that clear directives are in the interests of citizens and consumers so that people’s levels of exposure to dioxin and PCBs – which belong to the same class as dioxins – are as low as possible. </p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I agree with what Mr Florenz said about a European agency. It is something that would be extremely useful, but would achieve little, Mr President, if it were not organised across the Union, as close as possible to the citizens following what I myself suggested to the Finnish Health Minister. And so we must have highly specialised laboratories in every European region that are close to the citizens and which can scientifically guarantee what we eat, drink or breathe each day. And this can all be done, as I have already clearly said, in specialised laboratories already in place in universities. </p>

The clear trend is for consumers to desire and demand high-quality food. It is essential that our farmers should produce fresh and natural food. European food must correspond to the demands which consumers are increasingly placing on it, and quite rightly too. Consumers want food which is safe and healthy and which has been produced and processed in ways that are friendly to the environment and to animals. In the end, health is important to all of us, ladies and gentlemen. I should like to point out here that over recent years, indeed decades, Austria has pursued another path in agricultural policy. I must say that it has proved worthwhile. Over 10% of farmers in Austria, in other words 20,000 businesses, engage in organic farming.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of increasing competition and further concentration in the market, the future of the foodstuffs industry lies in the specific promotion and development of quality products and services. That is one reason why we cannot, and should not, afford scandals such as the BSE and dioxin affairs, irrespective of whether they were triggered by carelessness, avarice or whatever. The image of us all, of farmers and producers, is damaged by such events, and this has consequences. Not only does it lead to uncertainty for the European consumer, but it also damages our foreign trade. The strength of Europe and that of European agriculture lie in their good reputation. I would therefore vigorously urge us to go in more for trademarks and symbols of quality. With our guaranteed production methods, we can really only win.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also urge that Europe should not fence off or close its markets, but pursue purposeful agricultural and food policies which are in keeping with the conditions and also the needs to be found in Europe. The European model for agriculture, as decided at the European Summit in Berlin, must be given priority in the WTO negotiations. I would also call for it to be at last stipulated that all feedingstuffs should be labelled. We as farmers can only produce high-quality products if we can also be certain that the animal feed we also have to buy is also in order. Labelling is one way to achieve that goal. For the consumer, however, this means that quality has its price and that food, including meat, should not be used, as it has been to date, as a lure in supermarkets. </p>

Furthermore, inept handling of these issues by the respective governments and the EU itself has seriously undermined public confidence in the ability of politicians to deal with crises in the food chain.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, I welcome both Commissioner Byrne’s commitment to make food safety his number one priority and also the statement by the Commission President, Romano Prodi, in this House on 23 July, when he said that one of the first tasks of his Commission would be to restore consumer confidence in the safety of food products. Hence this debate. Commissioner Byrne, I may add, is to be commended for his prompt action in agreeing to produce a White Paper on EU food law later this year and also to tighten up the EU’s rapid alert system for food emergencies.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would urge the Commissioner to go the extra mile: if he and his colleagues are determined to regain the confidence of consumers and the food industry in the EU’s food safety structures, then he should establish a European food agency along similar lines to the US Food and Drug Administration. Such a body could take responsibility for the Commission’s present inspection and enforcement functions in relation to the food hygiene, veterinary and plant health legislation. It could also have responsibility for the rapid alert system itself. It could be given the role for the authorisation process for GMOs and genetically modified foods while also maintaining a monitoring brief on genetically modified foods throughout the EU. Health promotion campaigns on nutrition and diet and the ability to initiate research into food allergy and food-borne disease could also come within its remit.</p>
<p class="contents">I would argue that the list of possible functions is by no means exhaustive, and its accountability could also be ensured if it were required to produce an annual report and if its officers regularly appeared before the Parliament’s Environment, Public Health Consumer Policy and Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge you, Commissioner Byrne, to give serious consideration to the establishment of an independent food agency along these lines. Such an initiative would, in my view, restore not only consumer confidence in food but also public confidence in the EU itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is, of course, as false as if one were to maintain that everything is in order. That is just the first thing I want to say. In fact, the dioxin crisis was necessary in order to ensure that a number of the Commission’s and the Member States’ shortcomings arising out of the BSE crisis might finally be sorted out. I am talking about the positive list and the question of open declaration. But the question of how, in future, we are to handle the issue of meat and bone meal in terms of an effective recycling system still remains. </p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, it is of course remarkable if, on the subject of labelling, the Member States and also the Commission consider postponing the identification of cattle and the labelling of meat until after 1 January 2000. They would not be able to explain the fact to anyone outside. There must be clarity about what is going to happen. Mr Prodi, an agency is naturally no substitute for a policy, and there can be no question of our seeing a proliferation in the number of agencies, for then there would come a point when we no longer needed the Commission! </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">You cannot, however, go and create agencies where things might become difficult for you in order to evade some of the responsibility and then say, in cases where you can in fact exercise power (as with cartel law): we are doing this as the Commission! These things do not go together. As always, discussions are therefore required. I believe that we need a rapid alert system and that the Commission must be entitled to intervene in the Member States more quickly than has so far been the case. Also relevant in this connection is a framework Directive on Foodstuffs which is worthy of the name and which, in providing preventative protection to the consumer, is easy to read, workable and can be overseen. </p>

In order to make this a priority, however, we need a series of actions which will cover the whole of the issue of safe food for European citizens and not just part of it.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, the following is required. Firstly, from a legal perspective, we need a review of Community legislation on food, animal feedingstuffs, raw materials, additives, preservatives, contaminants such as pesticides, and the labelling thereof. We should deal with this issue first in the immediate future, so as to successfully fill the legislative gaps which exist today in the single market. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as far as administration and controls are concerned, we need to draw up measures so that the Commission services can function effectively, without any overlapping of competences, and so that we know who is responsible for what. Furthermore, we need effective implementation of the legislative framework, which inevitably means cooperation both at Community and national level, mainly through coordinated action. </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly and finally, from a scientific perspective, we should widen and further the scientific knowledge and methods we have for the production of safe food and animal feedingstuffs. We should introduce methods of detection and restrictions on various substances which contaminate food, and examine the suitability of various animal and plant-based foodstuffs and foodstuffs based on recycled products such as oil.</p>
<p class="contents">Here, then, are three areas in which action is needed: legislation, controls with constant vigilance and a scientific perspective with constant advancement of knowledge and methods. In this way, we can always be ahead of the problems and not run around panic-stricken when such problems crop up, shattering the confidence of European citizens and causing serious damage to public health. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, we hope that you will act soon and swiftly, because this issue and food safety are prerequisites for safeguarding the health of the European citizen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is both welcome and reassuring that from the very outset the new Commissioner, Mr Byrne, has demonstrated an unequivocal commitment to restoring consumer confidence in the food industry. The review of EU animal feed legislation in the wake of the recent series of scares is most welcome as it goes to the root cause of problems that have arisen.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the review will address key areas of concern to Parliament in its July resolution, such as sufficient controls in the animal feed production chain, a register of all animal feed producers, traceability of ingredients in animal feed and the setting of dioxin limits.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming from a region that depends heavily on the fishing industry, I want to refer to Commissioner Byrne’s proposals on dioxin levels. It is important that scientific testing look at the dioxin/PCB level of compound feed as an end product, rather than the dioxin level of just one ingredient such as fish oil. In this regard, proper consultation of the fishing and aquaculture industries is not only desirable, but absolutely necessary and essential so as to avoid any detrimental consequences for the fishing industry that may be caused by levels not scientifically justified.</p>
<p class="contents">The damage done by the dioxin scare is immeasurable, both in terms of shattering consumer confidence and the economic consequences of tarnishing the image of key industrial sectors and export generators. Producers, traders and the entire agri-food business have felt the effect. The Commission’s determined effort to restore consumer confidence by putting effective control mechanisms in place is clearly welcome. Consumer protection must have absolute priority in all measures regarding food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I should like to apologise to the House for being absent when my name was called earlier, and to thank you for giving me an opportunity to speak. Could I say to the President and to the sessional services that it would be helpful if there were monitors in all the meeting rooms to ensure that we were fully <span class="italic">au fait</span> with what was happening in the House.</p>

I think that here, too, the Commission must prove it is capable of working as a team. </p>
<p class="contents">You said that the White Paper must be very ambitious, that it must have a precise timetable and the Commission will undertake to achieve this. We must also clarify the matter of the precautionary principle because it is a framework principle which everything hinges on. It is unthinkable that without dealing with this aspect we could have rules which would convince all consumers and clarify the system. During the debate we must keep in mind – and this is important – all the problems of agriculture and reward quality agriculture, as well as giving a lot of room to the matter raised by Mrs Roth-Behrendt of the relationship between technical and democratic control. This is why we have introduced this debate today. It is an extremely important issue because we must have – let us call it – an agency, which will take these two fundamental principles into account. This agency, this structure – and here I am addressing Mr Nisticò in particular – absolutely must be in contact with the citizens. So the monitoring structures must be adapted and be decentralised to a local level. We must not create a centralised bureaucratic structure.</p>
<p class="contents">The last matter, which I believe to be of enormous importance for our future work, was raised by Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mrs Thyssen, and is the fact that various Commissioners and various Directorates-General are involved with Parliament. I would respond that this is – for better or for worse – our way of working. This is a very complex question which not only involves the Committee on Public Health, but also the Committees on Agriculture, Research and Trade. We cannot consider simplifying complex matters. We must have a coordinator, but also keep in mind that the whole Commission – and there are various Directorates-General – are still involved. Our problem is to constantly coordinate this process and not try to reduce it by taking away the role of the various Commissioners. </p>
<p class="contents">We discussed this subject in depth at the meeting of Committee Chairmen and we are trying to improve things because I do not think we can solve the problems by pretending that the competences have been simplified or unified. We have to be aware of the complexity and assume the responsibility for coordinating, but make it understood that the other Commissioners also have their responsibilities for this delicate task. </p>
<p class="contents">I now invite Commissioner Byrne to reply in detail to your questions on this debate which I am finding very constructive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a very timely debate and I am happy that it is taking place at an early stage of the Commission’s life. I am particularly happy of course to have my friend and colleague, the President, here with me to discuss these issues with you.</p>
<p class="contents">We speak a lot about consumer confidence, but I would like to say once again that consumer confidence is not an objective in itself. The real objective is to achieve food safety as one of the pillars of public health policy. I have been giving some thought to how this can be achieved, and that is why I have made the proposal that we should bring forward a White Paper on food safety. I am pleased that this has been welcomed by you here this morning. The White Paper will contain an examination of important issues that have been raised by you, such as the control of the food chain, the reinforcement of controls, the labelling of foodstuffs, and the improvement of the early warning system so as to ensure that there is full transparency in the rapid alert system and in the early warning system.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of you have mentioned that there is not the degree of accountability or the degree of openness or transparency in relation to the rapid alert system that we would all like to see, and I intend to address that in the White Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had quite a lot of discussion on the issue of a food agency. Its model is not yet fully determined, its shape has not yet been finally realised, but we have given some considerable thought to this already. I believe that we can have an agency that is independent, that gives scientific advice in an independent way, and yet at the same time can achieve the degree of accountability that all of you here as parliamentarians require and deserve. I believe that these two concepts are not mutually exclusive. They can both be achieved if we design the shape of the agency carefully and in a proper manner. And, of course, I look forward to discussing that with MEPs at the appropriate time and I look forward to the meeting that I will have with the Environment Committee later this month when this issue will be discussed further.</p>
<p class="contents">Greater transparency for consumers is absolutely essential. I will also be addressing the issue of traceability. Many of you mentioned this issue and it is, of course, of enormous importance.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of other issues that we would like to touch on. I am conscious of the amount of time I have available to me and I would like to point out that I will be discussing all of these issues in more detail with you at the Environment Committee meeting later in the month.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, there is the issue of the controversy that has occurred recently in relation to the ban on UK beef. Let me say at the outset that I have received preliminary advice on the report that has been presented by the French authorities, and this advice leads me to the conclusion that there is no new evidence contained in that report that has not already been considered by the Scientific Steering Committee of the European Union. Bearing this in mind, I have sought to have an urgent meeting between officials from France and the Commission, and this will be taking place this week.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also, last night, sent a letter to the French authorities asking them to reply as a matter of urgency to me, and to set out whatever background evidence they may have that led them to the conclusions that they appear to have reached. If there is any new information contained in the reply from the French authorities, that of course will be referred by me immediately to my own scientific advisers and I will seek an urgent analysis from them of these matters. The preliminary advice available to me so far is that no such new information is available, but I wish to see if we can resolve this difficulty which has emerged over the last couple of days in a diplomatic and an amicable manner. It is for this reason that I wrote the letter last night and asked for the officials to meet one another.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to bring you up to date on the meetings which I had with the Agriculture Council last week in Brussels. I should say that this was the first occasion when a Commissioner with the responsibility for food safety attended the Agriculture Council. At that meeting, there were three issues that I focused on and I would like just to briefly refer to them with you this morning because these are issues that many of you have identified as being important.</p>
<p class="contents">The first one relates to the dioxin issue and the Belgian authority’s involvement in that.</p>
<p class="contents">As many of you are aware, the tests that have taken place in Belgium have indicated that in one per cent of the examinations there was a small residue of dioxin and that this dioxin was present not as a result of the animal feed – what the tests were originally designed to determine – but rather from background industrial pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">It is reasonable to draw the conclusion, as many of you have, that if it exists in Belgium, there is a risk that it may exist in other parts of the European Union or, indeed, in other parts of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I drew the Agricultural Council’s attention to my concern about this and informed the Council that it was my intention to add to the Residues Directive two further substances that are contained in the list of substances at Annex I. The two substances I intend adding are dioxin and PCB. In addition I informed the ministers that I wished to have monitoring take place in other Member States to determine the existence and levels – if any – of dioxin as a result of background environmental factors. I am happy to tell you that the ministers were very receptive to these proposals. I expect movement on this in the relatively near future.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue that was of concern to me and to which I drew the ministers’ attention was the existence of sludge in foodstuffs. Some of you have mentioned this morning the importance of feeding stuffs. The common factor in a lot of these crises in relation to food, whether it is BSE, dioxin or sludge, is animal feeding stuffs. That is why I have focused on this issue as being an important one for examination and remedial action.</p>
<p class="contents">I pointed out to the ministers that there appears to be an argument being advanced that there is some ambiguity in the feeding stuffs legislation in relation to sludge. I am not satisfied that such ambiguity exists. I have said so. I expect Member States not to include residue in feeding stuffs. I pointed out to them that it is my belief that consumers are shocked by this development.</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">I got a good reception from the ministers and they approved of the views that I put forward to them. I expect there to be progress on this front also.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the sludge issue, in the event that there is continuing difficulty on this and that an argument continues to be advanced that there is ambiguity, I will have no hesitation in bringing forward legislation to resolve any ambiguity that may exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I drew the ministers’ attention to the question of GMOs and feedstuffs. I propose to bring forward another feed directive in relation to this matter. It is the best way to deal with it. I informed the ministers of that fact also.</p>
<p class="contents">The final issue I want to address this morning is the question of international trade and the relationship with the World Trade Organisation. All of you know that Articles 152 and 153 of the Treaty, as inserted in Amsterdam, give the portfolio for which I have responsibility considerable horizontal rights in relation to the examination of all Community policies. My belief is that it is essential that we focus – as President Prodi has said – on health issues and food issues as being of primary importance when we consider matters of international trade.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to discussing all these issues with you in the future and, specifically, as I have already said, at the Environment Committee later this month.</p>
