<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Foster (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, the resolution initiated by my colleagues, Mr Van Orden and Mr Deva, concerns a matter that is highly topical and most urgent even though this is the first occasion on which Parliament has devoted time to the tragic conflict in Sri Lanka which has been going on for over 17 years.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution sends out a powerful message. The fighting has to stop. The parties have to get round the table and reach a reasonable solution that will last. In this regard, it can only be helpful for the international community, whether it is the UN, the Commonwealth or the European Union, to maintain a strong and current interest in developments.</p>
<p class="contents">This legitimate interest should not interfere with the work that has already been carried out by the Indian and Norwegian governments whose representatives have been engaged for some time now in the difficult and sensitive task of brokering negotiations. I know that in spite of the dreadful atrocities that have been committed against the civil population and against members of successive administrations, the Sri Lankan government at the highest levels is willing to enter into negotiations and is setting no conditions. We must all recognise the overriding importance of maintaining the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka. Beyond that there are many political options that can fruitfully be pursued.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community, including the EU, should be ready to provide substantial material support in due course for whatever solution is worked out and to assist the economic and social reconstruction of the country after so many years of conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, Parliament’s resolution is unequivocal in its condemnation of terrorism. This is a scourge which affects us all. There is no excuse for the indiscriminate acts of murder and mayhem carried out by the so-called Tamil Tigers against children and ordinary civilians going about their daily business and against democratically elected politicians. This is an attack on civilised society and the democratic institutions which we all value so highly.</p>
<p class="contents">Inevitably, the people most effected and most helpless in these situations are the nationals of the target country who have fled the conflict and are trying to lead new lives in Europe. These people are most vulnerable to threats and intimidation from organisations acting on behalf of terrorists such as the Tamil Tigers. Of course, there are many other terrorist groups whose activities are sustained in a similar way. They cleverly avoid breaking the laws of the host country and so can continue their ghastly activities with impunity. This situation must change.</p>
<p class="contents">I commend the resolution on Sri Lanka to this House.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have had agreements since then to grant autonomy to the Northeast Tamil region, which have been abrogated by the government.</p>
<p class="contents">In this conflict, far too many people have died. There has been a growing catalogue of violence and human rights abuses on both sides – by the Tamil Tigers and, sadly, the government security forces. These are well documented by organisations such as Amnesty and the US Department of State in its 1999 Country Report. Young Tamil men in particular can find themselves being a victim of violent coercion by the Tamil Tigers and violent interrogation by the security services.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that thousands of people have been displaced within Sri Lanka. Thousands more have sought asylum and the whole population lives in fear of violence. We cannot say what the exact state of affairs is at the moment as there is a complete media blackout in force as part of a set of new restrictive laws introduced in May. The resolution is clear. Those laws must be lifted before the elections in August.</p>
<p class="contents">Something has to change. We have to do what we can to work for a peaceful and lasting settlement. It is clear that the international community is no longer prepared to see internal armed struggle as only a problem for the state concerned and that long-term political investment and negotiations are necessary rather than arms sales. Northern Ireland is a clear example of the difficulties of such a process, but also the possibilities. This resolution is important in its call for immediate cessation of hostilities and the lack of preconditions is a welcome move.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation would also be helped by agreement between the Sri Lankan political parties themselves and we welcome the efforts of the Norwegian and other governments and feel that the Commonwealth could have a very valuable role to play in this situation.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In 1948, when Sri Lanka obtained independence, it was one of the most prosperous countries in South Asia. In 1952, Lee Kuan Yew, the newly elected Prime Minister of Singapore, said: “My ambition is to make Singapore emulate Sri Lanka in prosperity, education and standard of living”. Forty-eight years later, that beautiful island of Sri Lanka has been smashed by a terrorist group now recognised as the most powerful terrorist organisation in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">There are four million Tamils in Sri Lanka and there are 15 million Sinhalese. One million Tamils live in the north; the other three million live in peace in the south with the Sinhalese. They hold high office in Colombo, the present foreign minister is Tamil, the country’s leading businessmen are Tamil, so are judges, doctors, lawyers and cabinet ministers – the list goes on. Yet this pointless war also carries on, to serve the single purpose of a terrorist leader pursuing his own ambition. The resolution states how many people he has killed. The LTTE has to be stopped. I ask Member States to proscribe this terrorist organisation and to help build peace and stability in Sri Lanka and strongly support the initiative currently being taken by the Norwegian and Indian governments.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

True, this is the first time we have tackled this issue, but we see similar cases every day. </p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we hope that peace will be preserved and that these issues will be resolved through negotiation rather than force. However, we must not forget that the fundamental principle of self-determination is all too often disregarded, sacrificed on the altar of another, equally valid but opposite principle, that of the territorial integrity of the States. At this point, a choice must be made between the two solutions. I would not presume to say which solution is better but we must find the courage to consider all sides of the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the Members referred to the case of the State of Singapore. Singapore used to be part of Malaysia but it is now an independent State. The division took place without conflict, and, today, Singapore is no longer part of Malaysia but has its own complete territorial and State independence. This was achieved without conflict, without murder, without torture and without acts of violence. On the other hand, in the same geographical area, we have also witnessed another conflict, the conflict of East Timor and, with far too great a delay, Parliament declared itself in favour of the independence of the eastern part of the Island of Timor.</p>
<p class="contents">There it is. At times, I find it difficult to understand how the same people, the same Members of Parliament, are able to adopt different positions on situations which are, if not identical, at least similar in some respects. The Island of Timor has been split into two parts and there are now two separate states, thanks to a referendum which was carried out democratically, although not in the best of conditions. The people decided their future and, although this involved fighting, conflict and so forth, succeeded in obtaining what they wanted. </p>
<p class="contents">I wonder why this Parliament does not call upon Sri Lanka to hold a referendum as well, along the lines of the referendum held in East Timor, and to abide by the result. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I say to Mrs Foster and Mr Heaton-Harris that they want to check their stories and sources because it needs both sides in a conflict to be committed if a lasting solution is to be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">I know Sri Lanka, I have been there. I can give you examples of what I have seen. I have seen Tamil men being harassed on the streets by government troops. I know that Tamil people need 11 pages of documents just to travel from Batticaloa in the east to the capital, Colombo. And like everyone here in this Parliament, and all European journalists, I have been unable to go to Jaffna recently, nor have I seen any television coverage of the battle at Elephant Pass. I have seen the fighting in Sierra Leone, Chechnya, Kosovo but nothing from Sri Lanka because the Sri Lankan Government does not allow press coverage. That goes back longer than last May.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a government whose defence budget has risen by 11% in a year and which, one day, will have to answer allegations of involvement in the assassination of leading Tamil figures and other human rights abuses. Let us have a peace for all Sri Lankans, based on citizens’ rights, humanity and in which government resources are directed at building communities, not helping to destroy them.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is salutary to recall that over 60 000 people have been killed during the course of this conflict – people in both ethnic groups.</p>
<p class="contents">We appreciate the efforts being made in Sri Lanka to reach a peaceful solution to the conflict but we also reiterate, as I am sure all honourable Members would, our concerns for the respect of the basic rules of international humanitarian law.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares the concerns of the European Parliament regarding the latest developments in and around Jaffna. On 15 May, the presidency issued a declaration on Sri Lanka. This called on both parties, firstly, to cease hostilities and to begin negotiations; secondly, to ensure the safety of the civilian population and, thirdly, to cooperate with the Norwegian government in its endeavours to facilitate a negotiated settlement of the conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say in passing that I would like to express my own appreciation of the role played by the Norwegian government, which regularly reminds us by its behaviour on the international stage what we are all missing in the European Union on account of the Norwegian people’s referendum decision.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency declaration also rightly called on the government to lift as soon as possible the restrictions on civil liberties and press freedom, which have been introduced under the emergency regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">As for our support for rehabilitation in the north and east of the island, a viable political solution has to be found and a measure of peace established before we could consider a major role in this process. That is fairly clear and understandable.</p>
<p class="contents">Assistance in favour of refugees and internally displaced persons will continue naturally to be given through the UNHCR and non-governmental organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission will continue to provide emergency humanitarian aid to populations affected by the conflict. Through our delegation in Colombo, we are following closely the impact of the situation on the civilian population and we are in permanent contact with the ICRC, the UNHCR and the main NGOs.</p>
<p class="contents">I last visited Sri Lanka in the late 1980s. I flew into Jaffna – I think I was the first minister from anywhere to do so – in the back of an Indian helicopter gunship. Alas, 12, 13 years later, the violence continues. It has been a terrible blight on one of the most beautiful countries in the world, with some of the most talented people. We are reminded of Sri Lanka’s potential, which we heard about earlier, through the occasionally accurate words of senior minister Lee Kuan Yew. That is a reminder of what has been missed in Sri Lanka as a result of this violence.</p>
<p class="contents">We all hope that it ends very soon. If we can contribute to the work being done by the Norwegian and Indian governments to help bring the parties together, we would be happy to do so.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
