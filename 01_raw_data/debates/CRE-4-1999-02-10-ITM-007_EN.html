<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Verheugen, </span>  <span class="italic">Council. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when Mr Fischer presented the programme of the German Presidency here approximately a month ago in his capacity of President‐in‐Office of the Council, the first priority he listed for this six‐month term was the successful conclusion of the Agenda 2000 negotiations by the time of the special European Council meeting on 24 and 25 March. It is now just six weeks to the day until this meeting, which will be held in Berlin at the request of Chancellor Schröder.</p>
<p class="contents">The negotiations on the individual components of the Agenda, which we have been conducting intensively since the Commission submitted its legislative proposals eleven months ago and at full stretch since the beginning of the year, have now reached a crucial phase. I am glad that at this stage I can now discuss Agenda 2000 with you in detail.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me start with a brief outline of the timetable up to the special summit. By the time of the General Affairs Council and Agriculture Council in just under a fortnight"s time we will have had a first run‐through of all the major components of the global compromise to be reached by the Council bodies and Councils. This first consideration of the key questions, under the aegis of the General Affairs Council, the Economic and Financial Affairs Council and the Agriculture Council, has already proved fairly successful in terms of reaching compromises and consensus on some aspects. But it also became clear that we still have an enormous way to go and very little time to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The Heads of State and Government will assess the progress made to date, especially the results we hope to see from the Agriculture Council on 22 and 23 February, at their informal summit in Bonn on 26 February. We expect this meeting, to which Chancellor Schröder has also invited the President of the European Parliament, to provide important guidelines for the further activities of the final phase.</p>
<p class="contents">Immediately after the Bonn summit we will, after all, have to start tying up the package that the Heads of State and Government are to finish negotiating on and bring to a political conclusion at the end of March and during April, under the responsibility of the General Affairs Council as the coordinating body. For the rest, you could regard the fact that Chancellor Schröder has moved the special summit from Brussels to Bonn as a sign of our strong commitment to bringing the negotiations to a successful conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">The German Presidency will do its utmost to achieve that successful conclusion. We have become convinced that other Member States are also firmly resolved to achieve it and therefore want to conduct the negotiations in a constructive and positive manner. Everybody realises that a balanced package is the only solution, and that there can be no winners or losers. Each Member State must have its appropriate say on the final result, but at the same time each must make its contribution to achieving that result. Everything must be laid out openly on the table. There can be no taboo subjects!</p>
<p class="contents">It is of paramount importance to the Union and thus to all the Member States – and all the partner states realise this – for us to be able to declare the European Union the winner at the end of March; for one thing is sure, Europe could very easily become the loser. Putting it off will not make the solution any easier, on the contrary. If a few months after the entry into force of monetary union, and indeed only a few weeks before the June elections to the European Parliament, we disappointed people"s hopes that we would prove capable of action, the consequences would be very serious.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Union, which since the beginning of this year has become a new financial market with global influence and global responsibility, cannot also resolutely assume the corresponding political responsibility – on the basis also of the Amsterdam Treaty – then too Europe would be the loser. And if the momentum of the enlargement negotiations is weakened and the date of their conclusion is postponed, the effects would be so damaging as to set us back in our work for a long time. I hope these and other arguments will prompt all the Member States to make more and even greater concerted efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile it is generally realised that, unlike the case of the earlier Delors I and Delors II packages, this time it will not be possible to reach a compromise in the end by making extra funds available. On the contrary, the unequal burden‐sharing that resulted from this kind of approach in earlier cases must be corrected this time, for the sake of the legitimacy and future viability of the European Union. I do not think any of our partners questions the principle of fair burden‐sharing, just as they cannot question the principle of solidarity, which is the constitutive principle of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">One basic condition for the success of the negotiations as a whole is that the Heads of State and Government decided in Vienna to include all the components of the Agenda in the discussion and only to seek a solution in the form of an overall package. Everything is laid out on the table. That means a balance can be found covering every aspect, and the combination of various parameters ensures that the further negotiations will be sufficiently flexible and dynamic.</p>
<p class="contents">In many areas of the Agenda, it has proved possible to broaden the basis of agreement over the past weeks. This applies in particular to the reform of the Structural Funds, where consensus has now been reached on major issues. I am thinking, for instance, of the reduction of the number of objectives from seven to three, the reduction of the number of Community initiatives and the long‐disputed question of coherence between national aid and EU aid; I am also thinking of the efficiency performance reserve, where gratifying progress was made at the last General Affairs Council.</p>
<p class="contents">On other important questions, such as strict adherence to the 75 % criterion for Objective 1 areas and reserving some two thirds of funds for Objective 1, the discussions have already produced clear majorities. Here you must not forget that under the Austrian Presidency broad political agreement was already reached on the pre‐accession instruments that are so important to enlargement policy. The same applies to the financial regulation on trans‐European networks.</p>
<p class="contents">In both areas – structural reform and pre‐accession instruments – I held talks yesterday with European Parliament representatives under the informal consultation procedure, continuing those that were begun under the Austrian Presidency. We attach the utmost importance to this dialogue at political level as a means of concluding the Agenda successfully and on schedule. In the coming weeks we will therefore carry on with this dialogue intensively and in a constructive spirit.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Fischer gave another assurance to that effect in his reply to the letter from your President, Mr Gil‐Robles Gil‐Delgado. Dialogue is not a one‐way street. The Council will take account in its decision‐making of the positions expressed by the European Parliament during these discussions. The informal consultation forms part of our endeavour to provide Parliament with comprehensive information at all times, as reflected in our debate today and our offer to hold an exchange of views on Agenda 2000 at any time in an informal political trialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">We are well aware that not only the Council but especially you, the Members of the European Parliament, will have an important part to play in resolving the Agenda‐related problems in good time. Our presidency will do all it can to cooperate closely with you on a basis of trust.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">McCarthy </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – I do not need to remind the President‐in‐Office of how essential it is to meet the timetable, not only to secure the necessary democratic legitimacy for the Agenda 2000 package but also to allow programmes and policies to be implemented in a timely and effective manner. We welcome his efforts in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">We, however, need to make progress on <span class="italic">our</span> priorities. Parliament's priorities on the general framework regulation are, in fact, clear. As regards the modified proposal on the efficiency performance reserve, Parliament must be involved in decisions on the mid‐term review and the reallocation of the national reserve. What role for Parliament can the presidency and the Council envisage to guarantee effective parliamentary scrutiny of the reserve mechanism?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirty‐four pages of guidelines have been produced by the Commission for the operation of regional programmes. How will these relate to the regulations? How will they be discussed in the Council? The guidelines underline the vital role of urban areas in the European economy. Will the presidency demonstrate its commitment to urban areas by arguing in favour of Parliament's priority requiring continuation of the URBAN Community initiative?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's reform proposal does not contain any contingency plans for unexpected economic and social restructuring in the regions. Does the presidency agree that it would be wise to set aside some resources under a special Community initiative for unexpected crises to enable the Union to act in such situations? Likewise, is the presidency prepared to promote this priority in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, partnership is a key priority for Parliament in ensuring that the Europe we build and its policies are genuinely inclusive, supporting a People's Europe. For this reason, we want a strong partnership pact in both designing, drafting and implementing the new generation of programmes. Will the presidency back Parliament's demands in the Council for a strengthened partnership pact, and what concrete and practical actions will the presidency take to ensure that partnership is not just an optional extra but an integral component of all programmes, strengthening the cohesion of a People's Europe?</p>

We are in fact very much interested in the Council"s own activities concerning enlargement, and in particular how the Council views the state of progress in the negotiations. Is it the case, as we often read at present and also hear from the various think tanks, that we are already thinking about discussing accession dates for certain countries? There are certain reports to this effect and there is a great deal of optimism, and we have also heard the Foreign Ministers of certain Member States say that it is time to set accession dates. It has always been the case with the enlargement strategy that both the Commission and the negotiators have said that this would be the wrong approach, that the accession date is a matter for the country itself and not the Commission or the European institutions as such. The countries themselves must satisfy the rules and conditions for membership and it is our job to encourage progress.</p>
<p class="contents">It has always been said that setting dates for certain countries would be an encouragement for them to be rather less energetic in their efforts as it would be seen as a kind of guarantee of membership. Is there any reason to review that position and now to say it is better to set dates after all? What would be the reason for this? Do you see any virtue in this?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we are seeing that public opinion is changing, and this is affecting the negotiations. In some applicant countries public opinion is becoming progressively less positive towards membership of the European Union. It is perhaps also true that in many cases there is a serious lack of knowledge about the Union, as also in the Member States at present. Is there not good cause for the Council too to encourage a drastic improvement in information on the European Union in the applicant countries?</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Mulder </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, first of all I should like to express my appreciation to the German Presidency for taking the trouble to come here this afternoon in order to explain how far negotiations have progressed. I am pleased that Mr Verheugen has said that everything is on the table during these negotiations. I should like to stress that fair burden‐sharing is one of the important points in this whole negotiating process, and I believe that this must not be ignored when we talk about support for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Over recent weeks Parliament has voted on the main points of Agenda 2000. We voted on structural policy and on agricultural policy. If my calculations are correct we are planning to spend considerably more than what I read at present in newspaper reports on the Agenda 2000 negotiations. I believe there is a danger here that we will not reach agreement on the financial perspectives. If my knowledge of the rules is correct 314 votes are needed, and when I saw the voting pattern on the main points here in Parliament we seemed to be very divided. I would also warn against assuming in advance that if there is agreement in the Council on drastic spending cuts, Parliament will automatically approve them. I fear this is not so. We would then fall back on Article 203, which would mean that we would be spending considerably more than the Finance Ministers generally want to see or consider desirable in relation to the launch of the euro and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">I am a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and I should also like to say something about agriculture. I would warn against the general view that everything spent on agriculture is a waste of money. I am not just saying this because of this morning"s demonstration here in Strasbourg. Too often I hear that half of the European budget goes to 3 % of the population and so on. I believe we must see this in relation to all tax revenue. When I look at the tax burden in Europe, approximately 50 % of the gross national product, my calculations tell me that approximately 2 % goes to 5 % of the population. That is certainly not excessive. We must of course always ensure that money is not wasted. We must have no more surpluses and keep production within limits. But we need to keep agricultural management in Europe basically as it is, and I think the German Presidency would do well to try to achieve this..</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Pasty </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span><span class="italic"> – (FR)</span> Mr President‐in‐Office, you have just said that there would be neither winners nor losers in the general agreement that you hope to develop between now and the Berlin summit.</p>
<p class="contents">We saw today that there were many French and German tractors in Strasbourg. If my information is correct, there will also be many tractors on 22 February in Brussels and these will come from all over the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We understand the farmers" concerns. The common agricultural policy is the European Union"s main common policy. They are worried because they cannot subscribe to the Commission"s proposals. Moreover, I am very surprised that Mr Fischler is not on the Commission bench, while two other Commissioners concerned with the Agenda 2000 package are present. The Commission"s proposals are going to bring a drop in prices that will not be fully compensated, but if my information is correct, the Council would favour more moderate reductions in prices but with a reduction in compensatory aid.</p>

But I would also say that a good agreement is better than agreement at any price, we should not seek just any agreement but rather a good one, especially since it will remain in force for seven years.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also refer to an underlying problem in this area: both in the original Commission proposal and in the proposals that have been discussed in the Council, we have noted the same thing: a lowering of own resources from 1.27 % to 1.13 % in the case of the Commission proposal – entirely to the detriment of the structural funds and actions. How can that be acceptable?</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to ask the Council how it can reconcile this situation with the fundamental principle of economic and social cohesion enshrined in the Treaties. And what can you tell us about own resources, Mr President‐in‐Office?</p>

Could he tell us, firstly, what pressure he is under from the Finance Ministers to bring about a deal within the financial limits they require? Will he be able in the longer term to bring about a deal under which the European Union will be able to finance the extra support that is required because of the cuts in prices? Is it not time to face up to reality and accept that this reform as proposed will not work? It will be more expensive to the budget and the consumer will not get any benefit. The processors and the retailers will eat it all up.</p>
<p class="contents">We saw the demonstration here today and know that agriculture throughout Europe is in a serious state. My problem is that when I go back to my farmers and tell them of 30 % cuts in beef and 15 % cuts in milk they do not understand. Nor do they want to understand it. The most recent statistics indicate a 57 % fall in income in my region during 1998. This is on top of other serious falls in 1996 and 1997.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the regional aspect, I understand that yesterday in Bonn the President‐in‐Office met my party leader, David Trimble, First Minister Designate from the Northern Ireland Assembly. I understand that during that time you had discussions with him on support for Northern Ireland under Objective 1 and our position in the future. As you will know, politics in Northern Ireland is at a very delicate stage at this moment in time. Could you tell us if you were able to reassure him, that the Council will be supportive to Northern Ireland in the future? The fact remains that if the Republic of Ireland and border counties achieve Objective 1 status and Northern Ireland does not, that will be unacceptable.</p>

A joint text setting out the financial framework is vital to enable finance ministers to allow their opposite numbers in the agriculture ministries to implement the long‐debated reform of the common agricultural policy, but there was no consensus. The German minister, Mr Lafontaine, went too far and, instead of confining himself to the subject of agricultural spending, structural spending and own resources, sought to widen the debate. The result was disagreement and, in effect, a decision to stabilise spending for the period 2000‐2006.</p>
<p class="contents">The countries in favour of freezing agricultural spending lined up with the position of the German Presidency, leaving the question of the CAP worryingly unresolved, while outside the Chamber the farmers" anger is becoming a genuine cause for concern, especially as the next few days will see demonstrators from all over Europe joining those who are here today.</p>

Thirdly, as regards the fair distribution of payments, how are you going to remedy the fact that under the agricultural policy, 20 % of farmers receive 80 %of the funds?

If you were to continue at this rate, Mr President‐in‐Office – and I do not want to level criticism at you personally or at the German Presidency – you are not going to be able to stick to the timetable that you yourself have set. It is clear that, unlike the Council, the European Parliament after painstaking debate has been able to adopt coherent positions on the issues arising under Agenda 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">Back in November last year, Parliament set out its priorities regarding the general framework regulation. Perhaps I may be allowed to mention a few of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we said that 0.46 % of Community GDP should be made available for structural actions. I understand the pressure that is exerted by public opinion in the richer Member States. However, we must not forget that the EU budget, despite all the ambitious targets it sets, is currently equivalent to that of Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we said that exactly, and not approximately, two thirds of Objective 1 resources should be made available, and that we must stick to the criteria defined by the Commission for including regions under Objective 1, one of which states that only those regions with a per capita GDP which is less than 75 % of Community GDP can be included.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we said that priority status should be given to Interreg, and that there should be a special part relating to cooperation with islands and among island regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we opposed the efficiency performance reserve, as originally proposed by the Commission. Proposals for a smaller reserve of 4 % with national top‐ups are a move in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to make two points in connection with the Cohesion Fund. Firstly, Mr President‐in‐Office, I think that we must respect the Treaty, which provides that Member States with less than 90 % of Community GDP must participate in the Cohesion Fund. Secondly, I would like you to tell me to what extent the positions of Parliament will be taken into consideration, as it is obvious that the European Parliament is not prepared to budge from these positions. Of course, we will discuss and negotiate, but we cannot adopt stances which are completely out of line with these priorities.</p>

Nor do I know if the Presidency‐in‐Office is aware that this is largely due to the way in which Austria, and now Germany, are approaching this issue. In my view, they are putting an overly unilateral slant on the work and giving too much consideration to the pressure of public opinion within their own countries, rather than taking an overall view of the European Union as they should do.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the basic problem, in my view, lies in the fact that the ceiling for own resources is insufficient. However, it is also true, of course, that the debate has concentrated on expenditure and forgotten about revenue. There is no doubt that we need an agreement that not only guarantees but also develops the principle of social and economic cohesion, together with the relevant instruments. We also need to have a proper debate not so much on how to reduce those instruments, but on how to increase the contributions from all the Member States fairly. For example, what is the Presidency"s view of the proposal to include the criterion of relative prosperity in the chapter on revenue? Does the Presidency agree with the French proposal for some form of aggressive measures for the Cohesion Fund, which to my mind would be unacceptable?</p>

The first concerns the pre‐accession aids. Pre‐accession aids are to be coordinated in the PHARE committee without, as it seems now, the presence of the applicant countries themselves. To what extent can this kind of pre‐accession strategy be described as being based on partnership?</p>
<p class="contents">My second question to the Council concerns the regional policy/Structural Fund component in the EU. How much importance does the Council assign to the principles of partnership in the Structural Fund regulation, especially the participation of the environmental partners, the participation of the environmental NGOs, the participation of representatives of equal opportunities for women and of the social partners?</p>

Even though the Austrian Presidency already achieved a consensus, that is to say a consensus was already reached during the Austrian Presidency, I do of course have to ask again how far you can still take Parliament"s decisions into consideration. We saw positive steps in that direction yesterday, but I believe you should clarify once again whether there is in fact still any chance of movement here.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also say a few words on the Structural Funds. The current debate that centres on the need to stabilise expenditure and ensure fair burden‐sharing is certainly right, but we in the European Union have another task before us which must always be given due consideration: it is the question of job creation. Here I will take up the cudgels for the Structural Funds and for maintaining these policies as far as possible. Structural aid is targeted at forward‐looking development models and economic sectors which have the potential to create new employment opportunities. Is the Council aware that we must set this as a priority? Fighting unemployment and creating jobs is in fact the top priority, and this is reflected in Agenda 2000 too, where it is very strongly emphasised.</p>

<p class="contents">He pointed out that the final agreement should not have any winners or losers and that Europe must be the only winner. We agree with that. But he also said that at this stage there will be no additional budgetary resources, and he stressed, in particular, that the budgetary burden should be more fairly distributed.</p>
<p class="contents">Up to now, Mr President‐in‐Office, none of the proposals that the Presidency has put forward in the Community institutions, be they in official documents or in ‘non‐papers", appear to look for a compromise to ensure that this burden is fairly distributed between all those involved. Instead, they only appear to consider the decision to reduce Community expenditure, which is beyond any logical justification.</p>
<p class="contents">With all due respect, you are planning a reduction in agricultural expenditure of almost EUR 41 770 million – almost EUR 6 000 m per year – and a reduction in Category 2 expenditure of EUR 47 000 m – almost EUR 6 714 m per year – without any justification, in the light of Commission reports on cohesion. This does not seem to reflect a compromise that has no winners or losers. On the contrary, there clearly are losers: the cohesion countries who will have to bear the burden of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to ask the German Presidency the following question: when is the Presidency going to put forward truly balanced proposals for a compromise in which all the Member States will participate, with each country naturally prepared to make allowances that might enable us to reach an agreement when necessary?</p>
<p class="contents">Up to now, Mr President‐in‐Office, there has been little progress in the informal negotiations between Parliament and the Council. Parliament merely sets out its views and the Council takes note of them.</p>
<p class="contents">We were in the same situation with the Austrian Presidency, and we have very little time left now to conclude important agreements.</p>

<p class="contents">I think you should have added something there. It is not that you hope for our cooperation, but that you need it. The financial perspective forms part of the Interinstitutional Agreement and, by its very definition, the Interinstitutional Agreement is an agreement between institutions. Therefore, it is not enough for you to reach an agreement with the members of the Council. You must put forward a proposal that Parliament is satisfied with, and, as Mr Mulder pointed out, it will require 314 votes to be approved.</p>
<p class="contents">What proposals can you put forward that might satisfy us? Have you already considered some kind of flexibility mechanism or would you prefer us to apply Article 203?</p>
<p class="contents">You cannot call for more Europe in every way and more policies, try to combat unemployment and proceed with enlargement while providing less funds to do so. I think that a clear proposal is needed here. And in conclusion, I would like to ask whether we are soon going to see signs that social democrats are in the majority in the Council?</p>

<p class="contents">But there is one thing I would like to know. I understand from a major German newspaper that as from the year 2002 for field crops, 2004 for beef and 2005 for milk products, the respective compensatory payments will be reduced cumulatively by 3 % a year and that the intention is to reuse only 25 % of these cuts for special agricultural measures, which means that 75 % goes back into the EU budget. Let me ask you quite plainly: if this 75 % of aid is removed again, then as I see it that will lead to a spectacular increase in the net contributor position of some states. That in turn will produce a further redistribution at the cost of those who already pay a large amount into the EU and get far less back. I would be grateful if a little more could be said about this issue, at least in relation to Agenda 2000, since it does after all have something to do with agricultural policy.</p>

I have noted down 83 questions. Do I have 83 minutes" speaking time? No. So I will have to try to summarise the main subject areas and give combined answers.</p>
<p class="contents">First, all the questions relating to supposed results are pointless. So far there are none except for the two I mentioned. There is agreement on the efficiency reserve and there is agreement on the question of the consistency of national aid regions and EU aid regions. But these two agreements are also conditional on an overall agreement being reached. Let me tell you at the outset: before the European Council meeting in Berlin there will be no advance agreements on any of the questions you have raised here, simply because the global package has to be made up of many, many components, components that will bring the individual Member States advantages and disadvantages. The Member States" assent is bound to depend on the overall balance the package produces for each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about a lot of money for the individual states. Unfortunately, the political majorities in the Council play no part at all here. During the deliberations each country naturally looks to the needs and interests of its own people and tries to reconcile them with our common European objectives. I am not counting on us being able to obtain advance results on important individual issues before Berlin because the global package has to balance out the different interests. Most of the questions in fact suggested that agreement or plans already exist on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor has the German Presidency made any compromise proposal at all at this stage. After all, our duty as the presidency is not to put all our efforts into pushing through the German point of view; our duty as the presidency is first of all to sound out where the broad lines of a compromise are emerging and then, when the time is ripe, to propose that compromise. And that is what we will do. But at present we are still trying to narrow the options. I gave you a few examples of areas where we can already see majorities and perhaps also consensus beginning to emerge. But this process is not complete yet on any single important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">One Member of this Parliament referred to public opinion in the Member States. That is something I take very seriously and which the German Presidency also takes very seriously. Let me just point out to you that public opinion in Europe is not united on these questions. I am well aware of public opinion in Spain. But public opinion in Germany, for example, is quite the opposite of what it is in Spain. The same applies elsewhere. So there is no point in telling the presidency about public opinion in a particular country. We have to concentrate on finding a solution that is acceptable to all and consistent with our European objectives. Let me confirm quite specifically that one of the objectives of Agenda 2000 – and we treat it as such – is to concentrate available European resources more emphatically on the objective of combating unemployment. That is one of the key objectives of the whole operation. The people of Europe see unemployment as the main challenge and expect us to do everything possible to combat it effectively. Agenda 2000 can make a major contribution towards that.</p>
<p class="contents">I also confirm specifically that the Agenda is directly linked to the question of enlargement. I do not believe that the question of dates is really important at this moment. In any case there has never been a fixed date for the enlargement process. Neither the Council nor Parliament, nor the Commission, nor the applicant states ever fixed a date. Agenda 2000 also establishes the preconditions for enlargement. If we do not manage to conclude the Agenda by March, that will send out a discouraging signal to the applicant countries. That is another reason why it is so important for us to conclude the Agenda in good time.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the conditions under which Parliament is meeting today, with farmers and tractors outside on the street, let me point out that agricultural policy forms one component of the global package. It is not a question of agricultural policy alone. That policy is a component of it in terms of financial volume, and given the structure of our budgets it is of course the biggest component. A large majority of Member States are convinced that agricultural policy must also play its part in achieving the overall result, which is to say it must also be reformed, firstly in relation to compatibility with the WTO competition rules and, secondly, in relation to the financing of the European Union after enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the specific question was asked, let me also say quite clearly that the objective of a European agricultural policy cannot and must not be to jeopardise or even destroy farming. On the contrary, the objective of European agricultural policy must be to preserve farming in all the European regions for the future. The presidency for its part is convinced that the proposals that are under discussion – after all we are still only at the discussion stage – do not tend in a direction that would allow us to say that farming no longer has a future in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I can understand that you would like to be able to discuss concrete agreements now. But that is not possible because, given the negotiating process that is under way, the global package will in fact not be tied up until March. In cooperation between the presidency and Parliament we opted for a procedure that is now gathering momentum rapidly. We are meeting more and more often and are also discussing more and more subjects. We are fully aware that we need Parliament"s assent. During the discussions in various forums the presidency does indeed point out that when the various national positions are put forward, account must be taken of the European Parliament"s opinion. However, I must admit that some Member States take this more seriously than others. And some people seem to think we can just leave it to the presidency to decide how it will then persuade the European Parliament to agree to the results of the special summit.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case we are endeavouring to incorporate as many as possible of Parliament"s views in the results of the summit. That is why I am grateful for all the ideas put forward in this debate in the form of questions. Let me assure you that we will take account of all these ideas, comments and recommendations in our deliberations.</p>

As a Member of Parliament who has sat through this question‐and‐answer session, I find it particularly unsatisfactory that, after a lot of statements, the President‐in‐Office has, in the end, such a short period of time in which to answer about 83 questions.</p>
<p class="contents">A much better way to hold this sort of debate, which is vital, is to inject some life into it and apply the Brussels format we use to question the Commission on occasion. At present, it really does not work! This is a vital subject for European citizens. This has been a <span class="italic">dead</span> debate, where few Members have been able to ask questions, but even fewer have received answers.</p>
