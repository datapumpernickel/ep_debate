I wish to move, under Rule 144, that Mr Cunha’s report be referred back to committee and I do so with the support of the Greens/ALE Group. On Monday, my colleague, Mr MacCormick, raised questions about the admissibility of part of paragraph 6 of Mr Cunha's report, and this involves very strong issues which may well be raised again today. But before we get to that point, I also believe that there are significant political and practical issues surrounding paragraph 6 and the proposals therein.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be in all our interests to try to seek a consensus in our approach to this. Therefore, further discussion by the Committee on Fisheries and indeed the possibility of an opinion from the Committee on Legal Affairs on this matter would be helpful to all sides of the argument.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the doubts and some of the controversy which surrounds paragraph 6, a referral back would also allow, and should provide, an opportunity for further consultation both with the industry and with our experts in the Commission and elsewhere. I request that we vote to refer this back to committee and to return it to the House in due course, after further consideration. I also ask that this vote, if agreed, be a roll-call vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is rather a "doomsday" weapon and I would be unhappy if we had to use it where there is a simpler method available to us for reconsidering the question before it finally comes back to the House.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a very important point. Paragraph 6 of the Cunha report, as I read it – and as many of my colleagues read it – effectively proposes undercutting the principle of relative stability which has, since 1983, been the very foundation of the common fisheries policy and which indeed Commissioner Fischler at his hearing before this House said was fundamental to the common fisheries policy. Introduction of a scheme of quota penalties would undercut it badly and that is what paragraph 6 suggests. That should be referred back and considered in committee, both in the Committee on Fisheries and in the Committee on Legal Affairs. I have pleasure in asking the House to support Mr Hudghton’s motion.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is firstly because the Cunha report has been approved by a majority in the Committee on Fisheries. And not only that; the philosophy of this report is the one maintained by this Parliament in successive reports on the evaluation of the MAGPs.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to Mr MacCormick’s specific question, on whether paragraph 6 undercuts, or not, the principle of relative stability, I would point out that paragraph 6 in no way undercuts that principle. It simply proposes, as a possible penalty against those who fail to comply with the MAGPs, who are the people who do most harm to resources, a temporary suspension of quotas, which is not a definitive suspension, nor does it imply the transfer of quotas from some Member States to others.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, the principle of relative stability is maintained as are – and this frightens some people – the key points on distribution of the principle of relative stability. Therefore, I would like to tell you that there is not the slightest danger of that principle, the sacred principle of the common fisheries policy, being attacked. It simply proposes serious penalties – and because they hurt a lot, some people will complain – which should make the protection of resources more effective.</p>

On the other hand, we are talking about a temporary suspension of quotas in order to force Member States to meet the objectives of the MAGPs. This would be further clarified by the approval of Amendment No 3 tabled by Mr Ford. As rapporteur, I propose that you vote in favour of this amendment. Secondly, the aim of paragraph 6 of my report is precisely to encourage the European Union to create an effective system of penalties. If we fail to create penalties forcing countries to meet the objectives of the MAGPs, then these MAGPs will not only serve no purpose but, more than this and much more seriously, they will act as a form of discrimination between those Member States which do comply and reduce their fleets and those which do not comply and are not penalised.</p>

We cannot deal once again with another procedural motion, using another Rule, when this House has already voted on the basis of the question and has already said that it should not be referred back to committee.

This report shows that, in 1997, the Community fleet was reduced by 2% in terms of gross tonnage and by 3% in terms of power.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, on 1 January 1998 the Community fleet actually exceeded the MAGP IV final objectives by approximately 16% in terms of power and 7% in terms of gross tonnage.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this seemingly optimistic assessment of the effectiveness of the MAGPs in matching the size of the Community fleet to the availability of fish stocks is subject to some major reservations. The first stems from the difficulties in comparing objectives between MAGP III and MAGP IV due to the change in the criteria for measuring and segmenting the fleets. The second reservation is that we are continuing to use different measurement criteria in each Member State which makes any assessments difficult to compare. The Commission itself gives a warning in its report about the unreliability of the data supplied to us.</p>
<p class="contents">The third reservation about this seemingly optimistic assessment stems from the fact that the meeting of these objectives varies greatly among the Member States. Two Member States have not met these objectives and one has provided data in an unacceptable form. On the other hand, there are Member States such as Portugal, Spain, Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom which have already met or even exceeded, in the case of Portugal, the final objectives laid down in MAGP IV.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, I am basically proposing two types of measure in my report. The first involves standardising the criteria for the measurement and segmentation of the fleets. In this way, a clear and constant comparative assessment of the Community fleet can be made in each Member State. This is fundamental to the effectiveness of the MAGPs. The second type of measure concerns the need to have a Community regulation which specifically establishes an effective penalty system. It is only in this respect that I suggest in my report, by way of example I must stress, the suspension of quotas for Member States in breach of these objectives in order to force them to comply. </p>
<p class="contents">(§) Amendment No 13 by Mr Ford should therefore be adopted in order to underline that this suspension is temporary. I would stress that this does not involve any transfer of quotas between Member States and there is no violation of the principle of relative stability. This is simply a temporary suspension to put political pressure on countries to comply with the MAGPs. This point is fundamental because it has been proven that financial penalties within the FIFG serve no purpose. Without this measure, Member States will have no incentive to meet the established objectives. Furthermore, with a situation in which some countries comply and others do not, if we do not penalise those which do not comply, this will lead to major discrimination in the application of the common fisheries policy between Member States. It will also penalise some fishermen more than others. Finally, if these two types of measure suggested in my report are not adopted, the multiannual guidance programmes for the fishing fleets will not only serve no purpose but, worse than that, they will act as a form of discrimination and distortion of competition between Member States, shipowners and fishermen. In this case, it would be better to dispense with them altogether.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fraga Estévez (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, this year we once again have before us a Commission report on the Member States’ compliance with the measures relating to the restructuring of the fleet, adopted in 1997. It once more beggars belief that the Commission has been able to draw up a report with the jumble of information sent to it by some Member States which, in our opinion, makes it a practically useless document.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission report indicates four modes of behaviour on the part of Member States with regard to their obligations to comply with the Multiannual Guidance Programmes (MAGPs). A few, incidentally, as well as complying with the global objectives for restructuring the fleet, send harmonised data – as Community regulations require. Others, the majority, continue to send data mixing up the GTs and the GRTs, which makes it very difficult to measure their degree of compliance with regard to the reduction in tonnage. A third group consists of two Member States who do not comply with the global objectives of the MAGPs at all. Lastly, a third Member State sends no data whatsoever and has failed to do so for three years.</p>
<p class="contents">This constitutes an intolerable form of discrimination, not only amongst countries which comply with their global objectives at the expense of imposing great sacrifices on their fleets, but also amongst those which, while not complying with them, at least respect their obligation to publicise their data, as a result of which they are penalised for the fact that that data is not in compliance.</p>
<p class="contents">The same does not happen with a Member State which, ignoring all relevant Community regulations, has withheld its data for three consecutive years and therefore, since this data is not available, cannot even be penalised. This is such a travesty that only through a great sense of responsibility will we be able to persuade the compliant States to continue to adapt their fleets to existing resources and not the opposite.</p>
<p class="contents">The sad result is that we continue to impose these obligations while not really knowing, at the moment, how many vessels the Community fleet consists of and, less still, its tonnage. In this regard, the Commission has made it known that a study by experts will be available next month on the sizes of the fleets in all Member States, apart from one, and I would like to know whether that is the usual one.</p>
<p class="contents">Does that mean that, next year and in subsequent years, Mr Cunha will have to return to present us with another of his excellent reports on the evaluation of the degree of compliance with the MAGPs, warning of the danger caused by some Member States who continue to believe that the safeguarding of Community resources is someone else’s problem?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this situation has to end. Therefore, for very good reasons, our rapporteur is calling for penalties, in the form of reductions in fishing quotas, not only for those who do not comply, but also for those who hide the facts and commit fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the penalties contained in the new FIFG are a step forward, but they are not sufficient to prevent a situation of non-compliance which has already been going on for too long. We therefore support the rapporteur’s demand for measures which will act as a genuine deterrent and we consider, given what some people think, that this type of penalty is totally appropriate: firstly, because the situation has reached the point where we have to strike where it hurts most; secondly, because, although quotas are not included in structural policy, non-compliance with the MAGPs threatens resources. The protection of resources is the ultimate aim of the common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, after what has happened this morning, I would like to say one thing: while I have always been convinced by the quality of Mr Cunha’s reports and proposals on this subject, this time I am even more convinced, and I believe that he really has put his finger on the problem. I would like the other two institutions, which have to adopt resolutions on the subject, to realise that the application of effective penalties could really resolve the problem of excess fleet which the Community is currently suffering and thereby protect our resources and, above all, our fishermen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us imagine a chess match in which a player moves his bishops diagonally – as the rules dictate – but uses his knights as if they were rooks and in which, furthermore, he tries to carry on playing after he has suffered a checkmate. Let us imagine, also, that the match referee is looking in the other direction. That seems to me to be basically what the last Commission did. We trust that the current Commission will fulfil its mission as a guardian of the Treaties and that it does not ‘let so many goals in’.</p>
<p class="contents">The preservation of fishing resources depends, rightly, on respect for the agreements on TACs and quotas, temporary fishing bans and commitments made by Member States on the reduction of their fleets, and, as such, if, from this delicate house of cards which we are all building, someone were to remove a card, the whole construction would collapse.</p>
<p class="contents">Compliance with the MAGPs is an essential requirement if we are to safeguard the balance between resources and fleet capacity. The degree of compliance amongst the Member States with their obligations, laid down in the MAGPs, varies enormously, as this report demonstrates.</p>
<p class="contents">This report indicates countries which, through great economic and social effort, and with enormous effort on the part of their fishing fleets and their people, have complied fully. This is recognised by the Commission and Mr Cunha in his report.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Cunha, who I congratulate on his excellent report, also indicates the degree to which some Member States do not comply and the clear lack of will of certain other countries who, furthermore, refuse to provide reliable data. As the rapporteur has explained so well, it is incredible that the Commission has shown so much tolerance towards a country which, for so many years, has failed to provide reliable information on the situation of its fleet. This has probably been possible as the result of the political weakness of the previous Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to refer to other reasons which are the responsibility of the Commission and the Member States, because it is necessary, in this new stage, for them both to make an effort to harmonise the reference criteria in force for measuring the tonnage and power of vessels. This is the only way we can prevent some countries from out-manoeuvring the regulations, which is what some are currently doing. The Commission will also – as Mr Cunha says in his report – have to be stricter with regard to the segmentation criteria of the different national fleets, improve the definition of geographical areas and use its power to impose penalties, although of a temporary nature, to oblige States to fulfil their obligations with regard to reducing fleet sizes.</p>
<p class="contents">We socialists demand that the Commission make a commitment, here in this Parliament, to put an end, not only to its tolerance of non-compliance with the MAGPs, but also to the lack of transparency of certain States whose attitude simply prejudices those other countries who are eager to fulfil all the objectives laid down in the MAGPs.</p>

We are looking very seriously at the Commission’s remarks in the annual report on the results of the multiannual guidance programmes for the Community fishing fleet. It should also be pointed out in this regard that the report dates from 1997 and that it is now the year 2000. The annual report is characterised by a series of changes to the reference basis and, as such, by complicated evaluations concerning the measurements, which become still more flimsy because not all Member States keep to the programmes. Some countries fulfil the final objectives for MAGP IV, and other countries hesitate or are very behind. There is also talk of there not being reliable data from other countries. It is important to point out that there may perhaps be major inaccuracies, since there are no uniform criteria for comparison. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Cunha refers in his report to the fact that the goal of the multiannual guidance programmes is to create a balance between the available fishing resources and the common fishing fleet’s activities. It is to be emphasised that a considerable reduction in the fishing fleet is a prerequisite for securing sustainable development within the sector. Here, I am thinking especially of young people just starting out. I am thinking about investment in new vessels. It is also a clear prerequisite that the socio-economic burden should be distributed justly and equally between the Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">We are concerned about the fact that a number of the Member States are negligent – in fact, almost indifferent – about submitting reliable data concerning the status of their fishing fleets. It is also very obvious that a number of Member States even show little interest in reducing the capacity of their fishing fleets in accordance with the objective of the programmes and with the resolutions contained therein. </p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Fisheries urges the Commission and the Member States to adopt uniform and comparable criteria for measurements, and this must be an absolute requirement. The Commission is also urged to increase its supervision of developments within the Member States’ fleets. This, too, we fully support. In addition to tighter supervision, the Commission is urged to implement or, in certain cases, to intensify measures to compel the Member States to comply with the stipulations requiring them to reduce the sizes of their fishing fleets. Such measures may include refusing to help them renew and modernise their fishing fleets and bringing legal proceedings before the European Court of Justice. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Cunha proposes that the Member States’ shortcomings in submitting data may lead to fishing quotas being reduced. We do not think that this is the correct way of going about things, for we do not believe that fishermen should be punished because of sloppiness displayed by the Member States. In connection with this amendment, we have asked for split voting. We have also requested split voting in connection with the reference to relative stability, since we think that things have been mixed together here in a way which might perhaps distort the principle established in the Treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They recommended deep cuts in the EU's fleets to allow stocks to recover. The Council could not accept that so the final regulation calls for relatively modest cuts. Thus, the combined EU fleet is only supposed to reduce by 2.3% in terms of tonnage and 3% in power during the five years of the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commission's report shows, by the beginning of 1998, after only one year of the programme, the aggregate EU fleets were already far below these targets. Rather than showing how good the Member States have been, what this actually shows is that the required reductions were very modest indeed and far less than was necessary. Nonetheless, and this is the point of real contention, many Member States have not abided by the regulation and many of the fleets are too large. What does one do with these Member States who place themselves above Community law and ignore their obligations?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has proposed several things: it can withhold structural funds, but that is only a valid tool if the Member States actually utilise the funds. It can take Member States to court but that is time-consuming, expensive and difficult. In its proposal for the recent renewal of the FIFG, the Commission suggested that non-complying Member States should be denied access to permits to fish under third­country fishing agreements. Predictably, the Council refused.</p>
<p class="contents">Some means must be found that will be effective to persuade or force Member States to respect their legal obligations. Mr Cunha asked the Commission to consider the possibility of quota sanctions if the MAGP objectives were not respected. Some consider this to be in breach of the principle of relative stability, but let us remember that relative stability is only one principle in the common fisheries policy. The basic regulation also says that Community management systems must enable a balance to be created on a permanent basis between resources and exploitation. In other words, if the stocks all crash, relative stability of a zero quota is not worth an awful lot.</p>
<p class="contents">We think that the idea at least deserves serious consideration. There is already a precedent in Regulation 847/96 on the multiannual TACs. Under that regulation, if a Member State exceeds its quota in certain fisheries, its quota the following year is reduced, not just for the amount of over-fishing, but by an additional amount which increases, the greater the amount of over-fishing that has taken place.</p>
<p class="contents">This is clearly a penalty but it was not viewed as being in breach of relative stability. Perhaps Mr Cunha's suggestion could have been a little more carefully worded to make it clear that any reduction would not be permanent but of a limited duration, and that is why we will support the amendment by the PSE on this point to include "temporary". I am sure everyone will agree that some way must be found to ensure that Member States follow the law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While some countries are not meeting the objectives laid down or are not providing reliable data, others are not only meeting these objectives but are exceeding them, as in the case of Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, at the beginning of 1998, the Community fleet exceeded the MAGP IV final objectives in terms of both tonnage, by 16%, and power, by 7%. On the other hand, France and the Netherlands were unable to meet the MAGP objectives and Italy failed to provide reliable data. Yet Portugal not only exceeded the European average but, with a reduction of 38% in terms of tonnage and 21% in terms of power, was the country which reduced the fishing effort of its fleet to the greatest extent. This has, of course, involved decommissioning, job losses and a threat to the survival of nearly 180 important communities.</p>
<p class="contents">There is therefore a clear imbalance in the fisheries situation within the European Union, even taking into account the necessary caution which must be used in analysing the data presented in the report, as underlined by the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">For Portugal, the current situation is particularly serious and basically results from a common fisheries policy which takes no account of the specific conditions in each Member State. Having said this, the national politicians must also accept some responsibility as they want to be the best at complying with the European rules.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now clear that a fisheries policy based on scant support for fleet modernisation and renewal, on measures encouraging the decommissioning of vessels and the cessation of activity, and on deteriorating working conditions and lower incomes for fishermen, combined with strong foreign competition, has led to a drastic reduction in the national fleet. This is causing Portuguese fishermen to emigrate to join fleets of other countries, particularly those which are not meeting their MAGP objectives and which are even increasing their fishing capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">A major overhaul of the common fisheries policy is needed, and not just of the specific issue of the MAGPs. Particular attention must be paid to the specific aspects of each country. Special support must be provided for the renewal and modernisation of the fleets of Member States which have already met their objectives. Measures to support the survival of fishing communities must be established. An improvement in the living and working conditions of fishermen must be ensured and compensation must be provided for closed seasons, as in the case of the sardine closed season in Portugal, or for any other necessary reductions in the fishing period. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Under previous programmes, this sector has already made considerable efforts to adapt the capacity of its fleet. Despite this, the Commission is demanding that it continue to reduce capacity. Below a certain threshold, however, the level of the fleet is no longer adequate to absorb port and commercial infrastructure and make it profitable, which is likely to lead to completely unjustifiable relocations and reductions in the numbers of fishing vessels, as long as we remain within our catch quotas. The guidance programmes designed as programmes to continually reduce the fleet should not become permanent features of the common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Members of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group cannot adopt the Cunha report as it stands. For that reason, our colleague, Dominique Souchet, has tabled five amendments that aim to point out that the catch capacity should be adapted, and not necessarily systematically and continuously reduced. In fact, our aim is to ensure the future of the fishing fleets of the Member States of the European Union. Our amendments also make it clear that it is difficult to make a comparison between the third and fourth programmes owing to the introduction of new elements, such as the composition of the catches and the nature of the fishing gear. They also draw attention to the fact that it is difficult for the Member States to provide the detailed and numerous amounts of information requested of them within very short time limits.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, our Group is against paragraph 6 of the motion for a resolution. In fact, it is not up to the European Parliament to request that the penalties applicable in the event of failure to respect the programmes or the notification procedure can consist of additional reductions in quotas. Firstly, in our view, there is no legal basis for that and, in any case, it is not necessary to distort the principle of the guidance programmes whose aim is not, I repeat, to make fishing activity in Europe die out, but, on the contrary, to control it in order to ensure its long-term future.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, owing to the recent oil slick in France, our Group has also tabled two amendments that request a freeze on the implementation of the reduction programmes for the areas affected by the disaster. The whole European Parliament has this week been moved by this disaster. From our Group, Dominique Souchet and Philippe de Villiers have visited the scene of the disaster, in Vendée, and have told us how urgent the need to undertake measures to show our support is. It is clear that fishing activities in these disaster-stricken areas are going to become more precarious for a time. Under such conditions, the desire to apply restrictive measures in a uniform manner across the European Union, without taking account of these exceptional situations, could lead to further disasters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It follows, therefore, that I should oppose the multiannual guidance programme or "Magpie" as we call it in the UK, that familiar black and white bird that is so good at indiscriminately killing juveniles and also is a well known thief – which is very much the UK fishing industry's view of the common fisheries policy. But even if I was not opposed to it on general grounds, I would oppose the Cunha report on the grounds of its specific contents.</p>
<p class="contents">My principal reason for doing so stems from the very words of the report such as paragraph (a) on page 4 which points out "an appropriate resource conservation policy is an essential requirement in order to guarantee the future of a profitable and competitive Community fisheries sector". Stressing the word "appropriate", my problem is that "Magpie" is not an appropriate resource conservation policy. From a UK perspective, the central flaw is that we have had to accept a large number of foreign trawlers into our waters over which we have no direct control. For us it is not a question of too many boats chasing too few fish, as the Commission would have us believe; for us it is too many EU boats chasing too few fish.</p>
<p class="contents">A more fundamental flaw is the quota system. The most recent estimates are that 3.7 million tonnes of fish are thrown back dead every year. This is a true environmental disaster. We have to attack the quota system. It has been totally ineffective at controlling the fisheries resource in any way at all.</p>
<p class="contents">I will be against this Cunha report because it is creating yet more sanctions. It is making criminals of yet more fishermen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I warmly congratulate him on it.</p>
<p class="contents">I will speak clearly and briefly. We constantly refer to the existing problem of the relationship between the size of the fishing fleet and current fishing resources. We speak of excess fishing capacity, of the overfishing of resources by an over-sized fleet. The Commission implemented the Multiannual Guidance Programmes (MAGPs), intended to rebalance this relationship. However, it is also blatantly clear that the application of the MAGPs varies considerably from State to State. Some have complied completely and have reduced their fleet by 40%, others have not complied; others even refuse to provide the data on their compliance, and the most serious thing is that the non-compliant countries expect to be treated in the same way as those which have carried out the very difficult task of reducing their fishing capacity with the subsequent economic and social sacrifices.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Cunha’s report is therefore important and appropriate. It points out to the Commission the basic defects: less than rigorous plans, unequal control and, above all, a lack of homogeneity in the criteria applied by the different States in measuring their fleets. As if this were not enough, the report highlights the lack of effective penalties for those who do not comply, which, to top it all, means that certain mechanisms which could be useful in terms of achieving the objective for which they were created, are simply no use.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore necessary to harmonise the criteria and penalise those who do not comply, by means of effective measures, such as that proposed, by way of example, in Mr Cunha’s report, involving the reduction or suspension – at least temporary, having accepted Mr Ford’s amendment – of the quotas for non-compliant countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that Parliament will adopt this report, as the Committee on Fisheries has accepted it, with the amendments which the rapporteur has referred to, and that the Commission and the Council will take good note, so that they may give new life to a key instrument for achieving the objectives of the current common fisheries policy, based on sustainable development in the sector, which is what we in the Committee on Fisheries are defending. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have some sympathy with the political position that our nationalist colleagues put forward this morning with respect to paragraph 6, but in terms of dealing with it they took the wrong approach. It is not appropriate and we voted not to send the report back to committee. Nor do we support the notion that paragraph 6 is inadmissible. The best approach is to vote on the report and to follow the political logic.</p>
<p class="contents">I have tabled an amendment which substitutes "temporary removal of quotas" for the suggestion in paragraph 6 that it should be "permanent" if Member States do not comply with the regime. If that amendment or anything similar is carried we will be supporting the report. If it is not, then we will be opposing it. Such an amendment will put pressure on governments to obey the law without condemning the principle of relative stability which, as we are all so well aware, has been the basis of the common fisheries policy since 1983. This is the best approach, the one we are going to follow, and we hope that the other political groups will allow the report to go through with the necessary amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, the automatic reduction in quotas for Member States in breach. My concern is that the effect of this is actually to impose the sanctions in the wrong place. If we reduce quotas, it is fishermen and their livelihood that will suffer. It is simply contrary to the principles of justice to punish some people for the faults of others.</p>
<p class="contents">My second concern is with the reference to the relative stability principle. In my view, the argument that the paragraph does undermine that principle is a compelling one. As it stands, there is a reference to an automatic reduction of quotas with no specification as to extent or time-limits. This could lead to a major erosion of traditional fishing rights. It is very different from the reduction in the case of over­fishing, which simply restores the balance. I am aware of the amendment that suggests that the reduction should simply be a temporary one, but I think it would be far safer to take out the references to quotas and the relative stability principle altogether. I accept entirely that we need serious and effective penalties but please let us make sure that they respect the principles of the common fisheries policy and fall on those who deserve them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Clearly, if European Union rules and regulations are agreed, then there is a responsibility on Member States and governments to comply. I have no difficulty whatsoever in supporting that principle, but how should a defaulter be penalised? Is there a need in this case for new sanctions? If so, are the sanctions proposed by Mr Cunha likely to be effective?</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 6 attempts to address the issue of quota sanctions which Mr Cunha and Mrs Fraga Estévez support so strongly. I make no apology for having raised points of order on this issue earlier in the morning.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal to utilise automatic quota cuts is doubtful in its legality, impractical and almost unenforceable and punishes the fishermen – not Member States, as my Scottish colleague said a moment ago; and most importantly, threatens to undermine the principle of relative stability.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Fraga Estévez has rightly reminded us that quota penalties have been raised in this context in previous debates in this House; in 1998 a similar proposal was debated, and it might even have had the same author. The then Commissioner, Mrs Bonino, in her response to that debate said, and I quote: "one amendment contains proposals for sanctions. The Commission does not agree with this proposal for several reasons. Firstly, because the automatic reduction in quotas for non-complying countries seriously undermines the basic principle of the common fisheries policy, which is that of relative stability.” She summed up saying – I quote again: “I would therefore ask Parliament to reconsider a reduction in quotas as a sanction because of these possible implications.”</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the new Commission will take the same line following today's debate. I am sorry that Mr Fischler is not here to answer for himself although he did, at this hearing, make very positive comments about relative stability, which I welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments to paragraph 6 have been tabled but I cannot support them because both accept the principle of using quota cuts as a penalty. Quota-setting should be based solely on science and conservation objectives, not used as an automatic penalty. If defaulting Member States are to be encouraged to comply with their MAGP targets, then an effective system of sanctions must be targeted at governments – not at fishermen. We have asked for split votes on paragraph 6 and I hope that we will have the opportunity to exercise these. I hope that Members of this House will oppose, in principle, the use of quota penalties as a deterrent in this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Dam (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, in this debate on multiannual guidance programmes, we have to be clear about the ultimate goal of the policy. In essence, it aims to protect fish stocks by imposing restraints on fishing quotas. To enable the sector to meet this quota, the European Union has imposed an additional measure on the Member States to reduce their fleets. The multiannual guidance programmes are not therefore a goal in themselves but a means in the service of quota schemes. </p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, I have to note that the rapporteur is confusing the means with the end. This is evident from the fact that he urges that a quota reduction be imposed on Member States which do not meet the multiannual guidance programmes, irrespective of whether or not they observe the quota. In this way, he elevates the multiannual guidance programmes to the highest goal and degrades the quotas by just thinking of them as handy tools. As such, Member States which do not fully meet the objectives of the multiannual guidance programmes but do observe the quota – which is, after all, the ultimate goal – are being disproportionately penalised. For example, take the Netherlands. It has, admittedly, reduced its fleet to a lesser extent, but manages to remain within the quota by introducing a sea day scheme. Would it not be much fairer to impose an extra reduction on the fleet of Member States which exceed the quota constantly and which, as such, constitute an actual threat ? </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the reliability of data on the fleet capacity of the various Member States. Policy based on unreliable information is poor policy and is harmful to the integrity of the public authority. This is why I would call upon the Committee – as a matter of urgency – to have the data of the Member States verified thoroughly by an expert and independent organisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I noticed that he managed to bring a number of aspects with regard to the multiannual guidance programme into the limelight. He observes, rightly so, that a great deal of data is unreliable, that it is difficult to obtain the correct data and this is one of the problems which the European fisheries policy is facing. So far, I have a great deal of sympathy for this. </p>
<p class="contents">My criticism focuses on a number of other points; namely, once you establish that data is unreliable and that a programme is, in fact, a supplementary programme, but then support sanctions which are extremely far-reaching, then this can lead to discrimination against Member States and certainly against fishermen, because the moment you realise that data is unreliable, you also have to look at the sanctions you are using. Otherwise, it could well be that countries which fail to carry out part of the guidance programmes adequately and are being penalised for it – because this is a fact in current policy – are being more heavily penalised, whilst countries which have not properly collected their data are being safeguarded against this. This is, to my mind, unacceptable. </p>
<p class="contents">What I would like to argue in favour of, also in the framework of this report, is that we arrive at improved data comparison within the European Union. Harmonisation of data, better inspection and, based on this, the development of a specific policy. </p>
<p class="contents">The second point which I would like to advocate in this context is that when sanctions are imposed, these should be restricted to the policy adopted, in this case the multiannual guidance programme. This means that Member States which cannot meet this programme in one way or another can be faced with possible sanctions, which means that it may well be possible that they will receive less funding. This is a sanction which quite simply goes hand in hand with the policy. I would like to underline this, otherwise – as I do fundamentally disagree with the multiannual guidance programme from this point of view, because it focuses too little on the enforcement of quota, if this is a means to an end – I fear that especially Member States which use a slightly different system or which monitor the observance of the quota very well, will be affected more so than others. In this context, I would very much like to back the position of the fishing countries around the North Sea and the North Atlantic region. </p>
<p class="contents">I remain of the opinion, Mr President, that I value the purpose of Mr Cunha’s programme and his report, but I have very strong, fundamental objections when he proposes possible sanctions in the area of cutting quotas, even on a temporary basis. This tool cannot be applied in this case. It is a totally different policy and, in my opinion, this Parliament should reject this particular aspect as a matter of principle and needs to fight for a better fisheries policy with better control. On this basis, we can also pursue a better policy. This is the first step we need to take. A second step is to observe the quota. We have other means of doing this. The third is to ensure that a multiannual guidance programme is geared to restructuring and nothing else. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission report analyses the performance of the Member States and shows that Portugal fully met the objectives established for all the fleet segments. It also reveals that the data contained in the Portuguese vessel registers correctly matches the information presented in the Portuguese Government’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">The 1997 report only failed to provide data on five vessels in the fleet. This is now being corrected as data is only missing on three vessels. This aspect of compliance with the MAGP objectives, which could and should be positive, has had negative repercussions at national level, both within the fisheries sector and in the press and public opinion in general. This is because compliance with these objectives normally means a reduction in the capacity and size of the fleet. Those who comply should not be penalised and this must be explained to the fishermen. This is why we suggest effective penalties such as the temporary reduction of quotas for Member States found to be in breach of, or failing to meet the deadlines for, submitting data. </p>
<p class="contents">This situation must be put into perspective. When it is said that increasing numbers of vessels are being decommissioned, this is not strictly true, at least in comparison with the current situation. Therefore, in Portugal in the period from 1992 to 1995, 144 new projects were presented. In the period from 1996 to 1999, 194 new projects were presented. In 1999, 40 new projects were presented. One important aspect to which the Commission’s attention must be drawn is that the fleet must be adjusted in accordance with the need to protect on-board working conditions and the health and safety conditions for the fish. This may sometimes require an increase in gross tonnage.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I must ask the Commission, if an MAGP V is established in the future, not to start from zero, but to take into account the efforts already made by the Member States and the results obtained by these in previous MAGPs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While I have reservations, I do not see any other way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">It is interesting to think that those Member States that have the great fleets today built up those fleets in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In Ireland, we feel thoroughly aggrieved at the size of our quotas and the capacity of our fleet. We must remember that when the other maritime nations – Britain, Spain and Holland – were building up their fleets in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, there was actually a law which forbade the transport of fish in Irish ships. So we arrived in this century with the same sort of boat, the little curragh, in which St Brendan sailed to America in the eighth century. That is why the fishermen I represent feel very aggrieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the Dutch have seven times as many ships over 24 metres as Ireland, even though we have much more by way of resources in the ocean. I want to record the fact that we are not satisfied and to say that if we exploit the seas the way we should and if we conserve and manage our fisheries the way we ought, we could probably take twice as much fish from European waters as we do. We would not have any more jobs, as the capacity is already there to do it, but we would make more than double the profits we make at the moment. A sensible system of conservation and restraint for the present will guarantee the resource for generations to come. I sincerely hope that, when we have done this and despite the fact that "relative stability" has become a sacred principle here, a country like Ireland on the edge of the Atlantic with vast resources will one day enjoy a more equitable share. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since Member States failed to do this, it was necessary to impose fleet reductions. In the Netherlands, a solution typical of our country was opted for. In tandem with the fisheries sector, agreements were concluded to reduce the number of sea days. In this way, modern, profitable ships do not need to be taken out of circulation, companies do not go bankrupt and, most importantly, of course, the Netherlands fishes within the quota imposed. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Cunha’s report, which, by the way, I value, now seeks to automatically reduce the quotas of countries which fail to observe the multiannual guidance programme. This goes against not only every principle of justice, but also puts the cart before the horse. Indeed, the objective of the multiannual guidance programme is to force countries to fish within their quota. It would be absurd to impose a penalty reduction, especially an automatic penalty reduction, on a country which is fishing within its quota, such as the Netherlands. In this way, the means and the end are reversed. </p>
<p class="contents">It is also too early for such a measure. The Netherlands is one of the few countries which provides clear information on its fleet capacity and fishing quota. Until such time as there is a uniform way in which this information can be measured in all Member States, we cannot actually examine whether all Member States observe these objectives. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, by keeping within the fishing quota by reducing the number of days they go to sea, the Dutch fishermen also observe the Working Time Directive. Although the fisheries sector is, strictly speaking, excluded from this directive, fishermen are also entitled, of course, to suitable rest periods. Reducing the number of sea days can contribute towards this. Mr President, my delegation will vote against the report if paragraph 6 of the resolution is adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to say that both this report, and the previous resolution prepared by Mr Cunha on compliance with the multiannual programmes in previous years, have been of great benefit to the Commission in drawing up new regulations, specifically the application of the FIFG funds, approved for the next few years.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is in complete agreement with Mr Cunha and other speakers with regard to the importance of the Multiannual Guidance Programmes in terms of safeguarding the future of the Community fishing fleets. Nevertheless, I would like to highlight certain issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, with regard to the requirements in terms of measurement – one of the key issues when ascertaining actual compliance with the MAGPs by the different Member States – although it is true that we have still not achieved total harmonisation of the units of measurement on passing from one system to another, the Commission is working on it and has implemented different initiatives. Amongst other initiatives, it has requested an exhaustive report from an external body with expertise in this area, <span class="italic">Seafish Industries Authorities, </span>which has visited the competent authorities in the different States in order to study appropriate ways to harmonise these measurements.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of this report, as well as reports and other works carried out by the Community’s own inspectors, the Commission will draw up, as necessary, a proposed review of the regulation on measurement, that is to say, a proposed review of the transfer from MAGP III to MAGP IV.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to add that the Commission is collaborating with the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) in order to determine how to also establish a common regulation for the measurement of engine power, another key element in ascertaining the capacity of fishing capability of each of the respective fleets.</p>
<p class="contents">Having studied how to improve both the definition of the MAGP and the measurements regarding the capacities of each fleet, we come to the crux of the matter: control of the degree of compliance with the multiannual programmes and control of the compliance with what the Council agrees on the proposal of the Commission. The Commission is not satisfied with the way this question is developing and, although advances have been made, not everything that the Commission proposed at the time has been done.</p>
<p class="contents">Advances have been made insofar as the suspension of public aid is an effective instrument, at least with regard to a certain Member State, which has changed its attitude and which has begun to provide more information. Therefore, progress is being made in terms of greater compliance with the multiannual programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The new structural policy on the fishing industry for 2000-2006 clearly includes provisions in the field of penalties which will provide the Commission – once and for all – with the means to make stricter demands with regard to compliance with the objectives of the different MAGPs on the part of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me to point out, to those of you who have expressed dissatisfaction on the grounds that the penalties approved are insufficient, that this has not been due to a lack of will on the part of the Commission. The Commission had proposed additional penalties and the Council rejected them. These included additional penalties such as denying the opportunity to use new fishing grounds in third countries, financed by means of Community funds, being imposed on countries who do not fully comply with the MAGPs. This measure, which would have been very effective, was rejected by the Council. Therefore, it is not the Commission which does not want to make provision for more effective methods of achieving greater compliance, rather the Council. Of course, the Commission is prepared to continue moving forward on this issue and what is required is a similar resolve on the part of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the controversial proposal contained in paragraph 6, I have to say that it raises certain problems from a legal point of view. It is true that, being a purely temporary suspension, it may perhaps be considered. However, there are other types of system and the Council has not wanted to adopt them either. Frankly, we doubt that the Council will change its mind and accept a proposal of this type. If it changes its position, these or other proposals will be welcome. Proposals would be presented because the Commission has already done so and it has been the Council which has rejected them.</p>
<p class="contents">We clearly have to remember that penalties, in the end, often harm the producers themselves. If we draw a parallel between agriculture and fisheries – which we obviously can – certain types of penalties end up affecting farmers, whose income is eventually reduced. The reduction of a fleet in a particular country obviously means a sacrifice on the part of seafaring and coastal populations, who are affected by that reduction. Certain types of activity have social effects and it therefore falls to the Member States – and the Community, where appropriate – to adopt supplementary measures to deal with these effects.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in terms of compliance with the MAGPs and, above all, fishing quotas, and the rational management of fishing resources, that we really hold the future of the European fishing industry in our hands.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank and congratulate Mr Cunha once again on his report, and I repeat that, with regard to compliance and penalties, the Commission has made positive proposals while others have not wanted them and, of course, the Commission will continue to try to bring about greater compliance with all the obligations on the part of all Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
