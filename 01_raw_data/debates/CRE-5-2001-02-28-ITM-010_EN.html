<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Varela Suanzes-Carpegna (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are once again holding – and once again at night – an important debate on the common fisheries policy, specifically on its external aspects, on what we could call the external fisheries policy, by which I mean the European Union’s participation in Regional Fisheries Organisations, which from now on I shall refer to as RFOs for short, and the renewal of a fisheries agreement with a third country, in this case Equatorial Guinea.</p>
<p class="contents">I would firstly like to congratulate my fellow rapporteurs this evening, Mr Piétrasanta and Mr Gallagher, on the wonderful work they have done.</p>
<p class="contents">To focus on the first of these aspects, the role of the European Union in the RFOs, in this case we are dealing with RFOs that regulate the populations of highly migratory species, that is, tuna and related species, such as swordfish. These are fish resources of the highest commercial value to which we must apply the utmost effort since they are of enormous economic importance, both to the Union and to third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to draw your attention to the Community decision-making procedure in this field. In committee we have introduced an amendment to the regulation on control measures, so that the Commission may present us with an annual report on the control and monitoring measures carried out within the scope of the RFOs in which the European Union participates. This report must include the provisions which are adopted by the management committee of the fisheries sector in implementation of the provisions of that regulation. The European Parliament is given very little information and, what is even more serious, there is a sense that these consultations with the European Parliament are useless, since we are consulted after the event, when the measures have already been adopted, thereby making a mockery of the role of the European Union’s principal democratic institution.</p>
<p class="contents">We must change this system, Commissioner. We are already trying to do this <span class="italic">de facto</span> through the ICCAT meetings, a system which we must extend to all the other RFOs in which the European Union participates, and we hope there will be an increasing number of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Committee on Fisheries wishes to have prior knowledge of the proposals the Commission is going to make in these fora. We want the Commission to discuss them with us and then put them forward, thereby fully involving the European Parliament in meetings which it is going to continue to participate in – or at least I hope so – as an observer, as it has been doing recently thanks to the code of conduct established between our institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not going to dwell on the enormous role which the RFOs are expected to play, on which our committee has already produced several reports. Please allow me to remind you, in this context, that we are producing an own-initiative report which is closely related to the RFOs: I am referring to the control of illegal fishing in international waters, to the report on ships flying flags of convenience, which is unfortunately also a frequent problem in the fishing grounds for highly migratory fish.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament wishes to participate, together with the FAO, in the definition of new notions, which are more precise and more developed, of undeclared and unregulated illegal fishing, of declarations of catches, of inspections at sea and in ports, of prohibitions of landings etc. for this irresponsible form of fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we have therefore also asked to attend the initial control and inspection meetings of the RFOs, and also those on criteria for allocating quotas, since they must be linked to those organisations, so that in the future one of the main criteria for allocation may be the real capacity for compliance with the control and inspection measures which these RFOs<span class="bold"> </span>implement. It seems neither advisable nor reasonable that a State should increase its catch quotas if it does not have the means necessary for controlling them.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, we are happy with the Commission’s efforts to regroup the broad and diverse regulations referring to highly migratory fish, although these efforts present us with decisions that have already been adopted and which are binding at an international level because no objections have been raised against them. The Commission is, furthermore, only making these efforts in order to achieve greater legal certainty. However, we would like the European Parliament to participate more actively in the proposals which the Commission must put forward in these fora, communicating them to the Committee on Fisheries beforehand.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, not only as rapporteur for these reports, but also, above all, in my capacity as current Chairman of this Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries, I must repeat here once again, Commissioner, our committee’s request, ratified by Parliament, for the administrative structure of the Directorate-General for Fisheries to include within its organisation a specific unit to deal with the management of the populations of these highly migratory species.</p>
<p class="contents">The many RFOs in existence for these species, and those that may still be created in the future, as well as the importance of the European fleet which fishes for highly migratory fish, plus their high commercial value, which we mentioned earlier, are crying out for greater material and human resources from the Directorate-General for Fisheries and for the creation of a specific unit within it. Commissioner, if you attended a meeting, either a preparatory working meeting or an annual meeting of one of these RFOs, and saw the resources deployed by other delegations and the resources available to the Community delegation, you would immediately give the order to create such a unit.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context and within the reform of the staff organisation of the Directorate-General for Fisheries currently taking place, Parliament therefore repeats its desire that this request be considered.</p>
<p class="contents">I would finally like to refer to the amendments approved by the Committee on Fisheries in relation to the management expenses arising from the European Union’s membership of these RFOs for highly migratory fish.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Committee on Fisheries has considered, and it has been taking this line previously, that if the European Union is to have exclusive competence in the field of the common fisheries policy, the international financial commitments acquired by the Commission, in exercising that exclusive competence, must in turn also be met exclusively by the Commission, by means of the Community budget, and not be passed on to the Member States. To have competence must mean having the financial capacity necessary to confront it. And a policy described as common – as is the case with the fisheries policy – must fully apply the principle of sufficiency of resources which governs it.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the considerations, Commissioner, which I have wished to raise in relation to these two reports for which I have had the honour to be rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Piétrasanta (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the most sought-after species of fish in the world are those which are referred to as “highly migratory”, including the commercially important species of tunas and billfishes (swordfish, marlin, sailfish).</p>
<p class="contents">Large quantities of these species are caught: in 1997, 3.5 million tonnes of highly migratory species were taken in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans combined. The European Union was a very active participant in these fisheries throughout the oceans of the world. Vessels flying the flags of different Member States accounted for over 400 000 tonnes in 1997, second only to Japan.</p>
<p class="contents">Several regional fisheries organisations have been established to regulate fisheries for these species: the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) and the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC), covering the eastern tropical Pacific, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC). The EU belongs to both the ICCAT and the IOTC and has applied for membership of the IATTC. These international organisations adopt recommendations regarding, among other things, technical measures on minimum size and weight, time and/or area closures, restrictions on certain gear types or fishing practices and limits to the capacity of some fleets.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, these measures are scattered throughout a number of regulations. The sensible aim of the Commission’s proposal is to draw together, in one regulation, all the technical measures relating to highly migratory species. Some of them have been in effect for many years while others were only adopted by the regional organisations at the most recent meetings held just last autumn, and we have taken these into account in our report.</p>
<p class="contents">The simplest and most objective way to evaluate the efficacy of the technical measures is to look at the status of the stocks which they are meant to conserve. Many, if not most, of the important tuna and billfish stocks in the Atlantic are in bad shape. According to the 2000 Report of the Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS) of ICCAT, the spawning stock biomass of bigeye tuna has suffered rapid declines over the past five years and the current levels of fishing cannot be sustained – further declines are anticipated. Of the major stocks, only skipjack is not thought to be over-exploited.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, management of the tuna and billfish stocks in the Atlantic has been more notable for its failures than its successes and, as the most important fishing power in the region, the European Union must accept its share of the responsibility. Each of the three ocean areas are experiencing similar problems, which is not surprising considering the high mobility of not only the tuna and billfish but also the fleets which exploit them. The problem of excessive fishing effort has been noted, and catches of small fish must be monitored in particular. As regards excessive effort: some form of vessel register is being created in each area as an initial step to limiting capacity. These are new initiatives, so it is too soon to evaluate their effectiveness, and they will undoubtedly not be enough to have an impact on the extensive overfishing of stocks such as bluefin.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards catches of small fish, the ever more popular practice of setting purse seines on FADs, rather than free-swimming schools of tuna, has led to high exploitation of juvenile tuna. The simple expedient of imposing a minimum landing size has been demonstrated in ICCAT to be totally ineffective. Limited closed areas and seasons may offer some protection but they have proved difficult to implement.</p>
<p class="contents">The IATTC plan for compulsory retention on board may be more useful but that solution is not presently viable in other areas as it is only in the Eastern Pacific that all large seiners have observers. Finally, unless a way is found to eliminate fishing by vessels flying flags of convenience (FOC), all the other efforts proposed will come to nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would draw your attention to two other comments which should be made. Firstly, the special attention which should be paid in order to also reduce by-catch, other than that involving juvenile fish, which is often the result of longlining and purse seining. ICCAT is taking action on this, and other organisations should also be addressing this problem. The final problem is that of authorising certain countries, which do not currently have quotas, to fish in their exclusive economic zone, their EEZ. They, quite naturally, wish to be allowed to fish the stocks within their waters, but in that case it would be logical for the European Union to reduce its share of the catch, which it has so far refused to do. The EU must be more flexible on this question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Their movements, both through exclusive economic zones and through free waters, their current regulation by four regional fishing organisations, their high economic value, which makes them the target of many fleets, and their association with species which are not subject to direct fishing, such as dolphins and marine mammals, explain the fact that even the United Nations has decided to intervene by means of the agreement on highly migratory species.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the Commission proposal to group together in a single text the technical measures for the conservation of these species, which have arisen from Community legislation and from the recommendations of the international organisations, is very appropriate and is generally to be applauded.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that a single text will not only be useful to legislators and to the fleet, which will not have to refer to dozens of different regulations in order to find out what their obligations are, but that it will also contribute to finally improving control. It is even possible that a single text will respond to this Parliament’s frequent demand that the recommendations of the regional organisations be incorporated into Community legislation with a speed that we are still far from achieving.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to this proposal, Mr Piétrasanta has produced an excellent report and, furthermore, he has sought to place his trust in the opinions of other MEPs who are already involved in certain issues. I am referring in this case to the Commission’s peculiar intention to sidestep the ICCAT recommendation to restrict the number of ships authorised to fish long-finned tuna by means of the subtle trick of not including certain so-called ‘experimental ships’ in the restriction. When we are eight months away from the final ban on driftnets, when this species has just been subject to a TAC and when the ICCAT’s 1999 scientific report expressly warns against this so-called ‘experimental’ fishing, the Commission’s intention is quite simply irresponsible, and the tactic of transplanting a recommendation in one paragraph in order to remove its content in the next one is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that there is already an internal Council agreement to try to lessen the impact of the ban on driftnets on certain Member States, but this has already been suitably compensated for within the Council by means of quota assignments. The intention therefore to limit the presence of boats, whether we like it or not, with a fishing tradition in order to open up the ports to new fleets is completely unacceptable and I therefore ask for your full support for the amendments tabled by the Committee on Fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, it only remains for me to thank the rapporteur once again for his collaboration and to congratulate him warmly on his wonderful report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To the increasing activity which the European Commission must carry out in the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna we can add that which is carried out in the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission and the activity which is required by its participation in the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission. The Commission’s human resources for this task are altogether insufficient and the sector therefore feels under-represented. Furthermore, neither the Commission nor the Member States affected are carrying out parallel diplomatic work in the search for allies, since there is a lack of a cross-sector focus and a joint vision in the Union’s external relations, which leaves our fishing sector unprotected, which is not the case with the fleets of other fishing powers. In the practical field, we pay the price for this when it comes to decision making or reaching agreements, as happened in relation to the lack of scale on swordfish at the last ICCAT meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore wish to see the creation of a specific unit for highly migratory fish in the Directorate-General for Fisheries. A single text and a single regulation require that we have a single management unit.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the reports by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna and Mr Piétrasanta, I congratulate both rapporteurs on their wonderful work. The Socialist Group supports the Community meeting all the expenses incurred by the observers, since the representation of the Union in the international fishing organisations falls within its exclusive competence. We also support the request for greater information on the control and monitoring activities carried out within the regional fishing organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">My group also supports the amendments in the report by Mr Piétrasanta, whom I congratulate on his very thorough work, including the Latin corrections. I believe there are questionable aspects in his explanatory statement, but we share his concern about the presence of ships flying flags of convenience whose operation does not come under any control. The Community and the RFOs must not hesitate to confront them, because the first to be affected by this type of fishing are the resources and the Community fleet, which complies with the rules of the common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must liaise with the sector in order to define the strategy on the management, control and conservation of these highly migratory species. In our view, the strategy must be based on the defence of the historic rights corresponding to our fleet. Commissioner, if the Commission wants an easy negotiation, the simplest thing is to agree with the other States, as happens too often, and give in to States which have no fleet or any real interests.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Community fishing sector has created a market which did not exist before and has made great sacrifices in adapting the fleet to the resources available, and therefore before allocating higher quotas to other countries the quotas corresponding to the Community fleet must be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we Socialists believe that the Commission must pursue certain imports, mainly those from Indonesia, which are based on dumping. It is estimated that this type of import, which enter the Community with an export subsidy from Indonesia, amounts to 14 000 tonnes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I only have two points I want to make. The first concerns the very important amendment tabled by my colleague Mr Piétrasanta in committee. Stocks of blue and white marlin are severely depleted in the Atlantic and they do need protection. In 1996 ICAT adopted a resolution saying that the contracting party should promote the use of mono-filament leaders in recreational and long-line fisheries. This gear helps with the live release of marlin and so can contribute to the conservation of the stocks. Mr Piétrasanta wanted to strengthen this resolution by saying that the gear should be obligatory rather than just simply encouraged. After all the stocks need our help. However, the amendment was defeated as it would have interfered with the catching of sharks by EU industry. However, there are no international or even European regulations on shark-fishing and these species are also in some cases over-fished. It is unacceptable to reject measures to conserve depleted species because they would hurt completely unregulated fisheries for other depleted species.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I want to make is in relation to the financial contribution report by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna. Member States should finance measures, including observer programmes, to monitor their responsibilities. The Commission has offered to fund half the cost and that is sufficient. We will be opposing one amendment, but supporting the overall report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Quite rightly, measures agreed on in these organisations are given a place in Community law. However, in my view, the method followed deserves no beauty prizes. Parliament is asked, as a kind of rubber stamp, to approve an ordinance that already has a binding character.</p>
<p class="contents">Rapporteur Varela Suanzes-Carpegna has, in my view, not understood the Nice Summit. He believes that the European Union is a superstate, and must shoulder all the costs of deploying observers to monitor the catching of tuna on board ships of Member States. When the rapporteur lands back with both feet on the territory of the Union, he will have to acknowledge that the Union is a far-reaching collaborative agreement between Member States. Cofinancing is certainly not a dirty word and does not imply a renationalisation of policy. It seems to me only common sense that Member States that benefit from the tuna catch should contribute proportionately to the costs. A cost-benefit analysis for each Member State might be a cause of embarrassment to the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">The stocks of fish species that migrate over long distances are in serious danger because of overfishing, the catching of under-sized fish, and by-catches. Rapporteur Piétrasanta rightly observes that the Union must accept its responsibility for the poor management of these fish stocks. Precisely because of that, the Commission must take a leading role in managing these fish species.</p>
<p class="contents">The danger that more and more ship owners will send their ships to sea under a cheap flag of convenience and so evade the management measures is a real one. The blacklist with embargoes on importing from countries that pay no attention to management measures agreed within the regional fisheries organisations should be supplemented with a public campaign aimed at informing the public on the methods of fishing, by-catches and the killing of dolphins. In this way the public will have the opportunity in its purchasing behaviour to opt for best fisheries practice. Such a campaign would involve one of the major forces in the free-market model, namely the consumer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to the species described as highly migratory, the total catches have increased significantly. Indeed, in 1997, 3.5 million tonnes of highly migratory fish were caught in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. As we are quite aware, the European Union is an active participant in these activities of fishing the world's oceans. Recently, a number of regional organisations have sprung up which aim to regulate the fishing of these species. These organisations adopt recommendations which provide, amongst other things, for limits to the capacity of some fleets, time and area closures and technical measures on size and weight. If no objections are raised, the recommendations become binding upon the contracting parties.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, moreover, add that the regional organisations continue to adopt effective measures to resolve various types of problems, such as those listed above, but it will certainly be difficult for them to resolve a thorny problem which is common to all the areas such as the elimination of fishing by vessels flying flags of convenience.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence the need for a joint action of cooperation between the regional fisheries organisations and the national governments, in order to prevent shipowners, who feel overburdened by the regulations in force, from deciding to fly a different flag.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, may I draw your attention to and emphasise the fundamental role played by the regional fisheries organisations in this matter where, given the huge scope of the subject and the specific local situations, it would be difficult for the Community institutions to respond adequately to the different requirements, as the regional fisheries organisations are able to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is therefore a proposal to be welcomed, since it creates more efficient conditions for implementing one of the most important aspects of the common fisheries policy. It is aimed at fish species that are under considerable pressure from fishing due to their great geographical mobility and their high commercial value. For reasons, however, that I must say are beyond me, the rapporteur has issued an opinion on the Commission’s original proposal and not on the compromise proposal arising from the December meeting of the Fisheries Council, and on which I think it would be more appropriate for Parliament to issue an opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not going to repeat aspects that have already been highlighted by the two rapporteurs and, especially, by my colleagues in the PPE-DE. I simply wish to emphasise two important aspects. The first concerns the issue of disciplinary measures to be imposed on vessels flying flags of convenience. This is a crucial aspect that we must resolve. The second aspect is that ships experimenting with new fishing methods must be included in the quotas for their respective fisheries. Lastly, I wish to state that it is becoming necessary for the European Union to fight within the various international bodies for coordinating fisheries management in which it participates so that all of the world’s fishing fleets, especially those of the great fishing powers, fully respect the same rules for conservation that the European Union itself respects. I think that this is a fundamental point. Finally, I wish to thank the two rapporteurs for their excellent work and I hope that their reports will be adopted with the amendments tabled by the Committee on Fisheries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fishing of these species has certain characteristics in common, irrespective of where it takes place, which is why we have proposed a coherent package of measures. Our aim is to implement the recommendations of various international organisations in which the Community is actively working for these resources to be preserved.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me start with a few comments on the two regulations, one on control measures and one on technical measures. We have included both new and existing provisions in these regulations. As the international tuna fishing organisations are very proactive and decide on new measures every year, we have suggested a fast-track procedure which will allow new measures or changes to existing control and technical measures to be implemented for the Community quickly and efficiently. I am delighted that Parliament also supports this idea.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the proposed amendments, I should point out that we can accept the first amendment to the regulation on control measures if it is changed, i.e. the Commission proposes that it submit a report on control measures in the Member States to Parliament and the Council every three years. This would then be coherent with the control regulation which applies to internal fisheries. The amendments to the regulation on technical measures are acceptable to the Commission in substance, but there is a procedural problem here. I think it would be better to take account of this problem when the regulation on technical measures is next amended. That way, the present proposals could be implemented immediately and I would gladly promise to submit a new proposal to implement the most recent measures decided in the international tuna fishing organisations by 1 October 2001, i.e. by 1 October this year. We shall then consider your amendments in a fitting manner in this proposal. Which is why, at this point in time, I am unable to accept Amendment Nos 1 to 7, which concern, as stated, the procedural issue and the start date of this proposal. Amendment Nos 8 and 9 concern technical measures, which we can accept.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the regulation on financial support for the assignment of observers. This proposal is part of the Commission strategy set out in our communication on regional fisheries organisations. We want to promote the introduction of a system of observers working on board Community ships in order to guarantee that juveniles, especially tropical tuna juveniles, are protected. Hence our proposal of financial support.</p>
<p class="contents">Now you are calling for the Commission to bear the full cost of this observation system. I should point out that it is primarily the duty of the Member States to implement Community law, in all areas. The Commission has not plucked the proposed figure of 50% out of thin air; it is based on past practice or, more specifically, on the 1995 Council resolution on the cofinancing of control measures. Which is why the Commission cannot, unfortunately, agree to the proposed amendments to the regulation on financial support for observers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
