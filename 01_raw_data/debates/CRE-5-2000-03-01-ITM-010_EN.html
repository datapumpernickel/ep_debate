<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hudghton (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – Infectious salmon anaemia is a contagious viral disease which was first recorded in Norway in 1984, then in Canada in 1986 and first found in European Union territory in May 1998 in Scotland. Although the virus has been found in other species, the disease itself is so far confined to salmon. The virus is known not to survive above 25o Celsius and scientists have therefore agreed that no threat to human health exists; it simply cannot survive in warm-blooded creatures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Scottish salmon-farming industry is the biggest in the EU, spread throughout some of Europe’s most peripheral communities. It sustains some 6 500 jobs and generates around EUR 800 million annually. It is obvious therefore that this issue is especially important to Scotland but it is vitally important to all parts of Europe that the disease be brought under control and, if possible, eradicated.</p>
<p class="contents">The current directive prohibits the use of vaccination and requires that all fish in an affected farm be slaughtered whether affected by the disease or not. The intention in adopting the current regime was to eradicate ISA and to do so as quickly as possible. The reality is that the compulsory slaughter policy has failed even to contain, let alone eradicate ISA, and while failing to deliver its objectives, the present rule has had a devastating economic effect on the industry with no compensation being paid and no possibility of commercial insurance.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed changes are twofold: the first would permit the use of vaccination as a weapon in this battle. This is a necessary change and should be accompanied by a commitment at European level to instigate and fund research into developing an effective vaccine. The second proposed change would permit a phased withdrawal of fish from affected farms, working to a plan based on the severity of the problem in any particular farm. This approach has been used very effectively in Norway where new reports of ISA are down to a handful of cases a year having peaked at some 80-90 cases per year in the early 1990s.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore support the Commission’s proposed changes and I am calling for their urgent adoption and implementation. I also highlight the issue of compensation and call for the amendment of Council Decision 90/424/EEC by specifically including ISA in its appended list of diseases, thereby enabling compensation to be paid at 50% Commission, 50% Member State. I thank colleagues in the Fisheries Committee for their overwhelming vote in support of my report and I in particular thank my Scottish colleagues in the committee for their input to this whole process.</p>
<p class="contents">I am opposing Amendments 7 to 13 which were decisively rejected by the Fisheries Committee. Most of their content is either unnecessary or already referred to in my text. In particular, I have drawn attention to the need to study the extent and effect of interaction between farmed and wild salmon, the need to investigate the source of ISA and the need to test more widely for the virus in wild stocks. These amendments by the Green component of the Greens/European Free Alliance Group are designed to provide justification for Amendment 13. This amendment is completely unacceptable and inappropriate as it seeks not only to retain the requirement for immediate compulsory slaughter of all fish but also to prevent any fish, whether diseased or not, from an affected farm from being sold and I must emphasise that under current policy no diseased fish are sold. There is no proposal to change that and under the proposed new regime there is no question of diseased fish being sold. Amendments 7 to 13 simply fail to take account of the reality as evidenced by the starkly contrasting statistics from Scotland and from Norway. In Scotland we have endured a draconian regime which has failed to achieve its objective. In Norway, with their much longer experience, compulsory, 100% culling was abandoned some years ago and a range of measures have led there to a dramatically improved situation. It is in all of our interests to ensure that in Scotland too we contain ISA and prevent its further spread.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week saw the publication in Scotland of a report by a joint government and industry working group on ISA. This comprehensive document takes account of a wide range of possible risks and recommends action to combat them in areas such as site-to-site transmission, security measures to curtail escapes, treatment of waste and effluent, methods of detection and diagnosis, farrowing and rotation, disinfection of equipment and many, many more. Some can and will be implemented immediately by local authorities using existing powers, others will be incorporated into codes of practice. All will be beneficial, not just in relation to ISA but in achieving better standards in aquaculture generally where required. Your votes, colleagues, in favour of my report in full, as endorsed by the Fisheries Committee, will be a very important part of a wider ISA control package based on the reality of Scotland’s situation and the lessons learned from the success of others.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stevenson (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – I congratulate Mr Hudghton and fully support his report and would urge the honourable Members of Parliament to do likewise. As he said, fish farming is a critically significant source of employment in remote parts of rural Scotland and at a time when the rural areas of Scotland are suffering their worst recession in over a hundred years, the aquaculture industry provides an essential boost to the rural economy on which many thousands of direct and indirect jobs depend.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, as he said, in excess of 85 000 tons of Salmon is now produced in Scottish fish farms in an industry which generates more than EUR 800 million annually. Regrettably, although ISA was first detected in Scotland only two years ago, it has now spread to 29 farms directly and around 240 other farms are affected in some way or another. Wild salmon, trout and eels have been found to carry the virus which now seems to be endemic even in the wider marine environment. But I must say that despite the scare-mongering of the Greens, it has to be emphasised that ISA cannot under any circumstances be transmitted to humans, and I must repeat what Mr Hudghton said, that the virus cannot survive above 25o – which is human body temperature – it is a virus of a cold-water species.</p>
<p class="contents">It can, nevertheless, in the affected fish, lead to severe weight loss and early death in its advanced stages and it therefore has had a serious economic impact on the whole Scottish aquaculture sector costing the industry around EUR 60 to 70 million in losses arising from the mandatory premature culling and other eradication measures. So this report, Mr President, provides an encouraging range of proposals for improving the way in which the authorities in the UK and elsewhere should respond to the disease. By recommending the introduction of a method of containment and gradual culling, similar to the system used successfully in Norway, the rapporteur seeks to introduce a more flexible approach to the disease which will provide confidence, not least to the insurance sector who have hitherto shied clear of providing any form of cover due to the insistence on a policy of compulsory slaughter. By recommending the research, development and ultimate use of vaccination to control and eradicate ISA, the rapporteur also provides comfort to the pharmaceutical industry who have hitherto had no incentive to invest in the development of a vaccine. So I thoroughly recommend and hope that the Parliament will support this excellent report.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Scottish salmon farming is the biggest in the European Union and accommodates 90% of the British aquacultural industry. The industry is located in some of Europe’s most peripheral communities providing an economic lifeline to those communities. In recent research it is estimated that the industry is worth EUR 800 million per annum and 6 500 jobs rely on its existence.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this report gives a clear method for dealing with Infectious Salmon Anaemia which is both practical, realistic and also achievable. The example of Norway demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach. As for the amendments, I oppose the amendments tabled by Mr Hudghton’s Green colleagues, that is numbers 7 to 13, not because I do not care about the risks to human health but because, according to scientific evidence, the virus does not survive beyond 25o Celsius and according to medical evidence, human beings at that temperature are dead. There is a saying that the dead tell no tales and I am sure they do not eat fish but I do and I look forward to the implementation of this report.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I too agree that Amendments 7 to 13 are unfortunate, indeed Amendment 13 would not merely negate the intended effects of the proposal but actually would make the situation even more difficult than under current rules.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not though to deny the importance of environmental considerations in relation to fish farming. Mr Hudghton has already referred to the final report of the UK joint government industry working group on ISA and the measures there are of relevance for fish farming wherever it happens, not just in farms affected by ISA. Secondly, looking forward to the motion for a resolution on the Katiforis report later this evening, paragraph 28 is of particular importance. This calls on the Commission and Member States to step up the adoption of measures to combat the possible negative effects of aquaculture on the marine environment. Thirdly, referring to the earlier discussion on the collection of fisheries data, I very much hope that the Commission will engage in projects and studies looking at aquaculture in the environmental context but I believe that is the way forward in relation to the environment, not the way that is suggested in Amendments 7 to 13, and I hope honourable Members will reject them.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This infectious salmon disease is caused by an orthomixomicrovirus which breaks down the blood of salmon, causing death. It spreads very easily through mucus in saline water, etc. Under the 1993 directive, not only the diseased fish can be culled but also the farmed fish where individuals are affected, exactly like the case when one cow is sick in a herd and the whole herd is culled according to the principle of precaution. What we currently propose is to relax this directive, so that we do not cull all the fish, but only the fish that are found to be diseased. For the others, well, we would have time to see what would happen, according to local circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is a very serious matter that we act in this way. I would particularly draw my colleagues’ attention to this fact as we cannot make do with saying that a temperature of 27° has every advantage for the human race and that, consequently, there is no risk to men. What about women? Nobody has undertaken any studies on human tissue in that regard. There is also a risk to the environment, because we know that there is an incubation period in salmon and that, consequently, if they are eaten, they can be carriers of this virus and present a risk. There is another risk to the environment as well, because this disease is transmitted to wild fish, as we have seen.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, together with my colleague, Patricia McKenna, we have tabled amendments against the proposals made by the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should come back to the Attwooll report again in the Committee on Fisheries. I believe there have been some misunderstandings here, for example, where the database is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in discussing the Hudghton report, we have now come to an issue that is very sensitive to my mind, for it relates to health. At the same time, it is of vital significance in the true sense of the word, for as we have heard, diseases can endanger the stocks of many aquaculture enterprises overnight. We are a long way off having this under control. This report is about a disease termed infectious salmon anaemia. Although, as we have heard, there is no direct threat to human health, we all know that consumers react quickly, and often extremely badly in such situations, particularly in my country. The ultimate consequence of this is job losses. It is not just the Scottish delegates that have a sad tale to tell there.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">When a fish disease of this kind breaks out, the consequences are enormous. There was a premature fish harvest on account of the disease, which led to the collapse of the Community market, with corresponding repercussions throughout the Union. It is therefore in the interests of the Community to combat diseases of this kind. This proposal is heading in the right direction in this respect. I particularly welcome the flexible arrangements, i.e. the fact that a cautious approach is to be taken and enterprises are only to be shut down when this is truly justified. We must not throw the baby out with the bath water!</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I must stress that this is only a step in the right direction. There is still much to do and to this end, I urge the Council and the Commission to take up further measures; in particular, to create incentives for research into a vaccine, and what is more, for research into the origins and causes of fish diseases of this kind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Now people have said here that Norway has done a better job of controlling the epidemic of ISA and that the proposed change will bring us more in line with the Norwegian approach, but it must be said that there is more than just one difference between the Norwegian policy and that of the Community. This is a Community policy which will effect Ireland as well – where I am from – should similar unfortunate events occur.</p>
<p class="contents">There are other differences that exist in the policy for inspections of disease, fallowing periods, restriction on movement of contaminated fish and materials and others. Before we jump to copy the slaughter policy of the Norwegians, we should try these other things first to see if we can mitigate the disaster. And people have spoken in the past about BSE. For many years the Greens were calling for the BSE issue to be addressed. Had it been at that time, you could have actually saved an awful lot of farmers and the EU a huge amount of money. So it also has to do with environmental protection. The protection of the farmers themselves and the protection of public health.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission proposal aims to ensure a more pragmatic approach towards controlling a disease that has the potential to cause important losses in salmon farms. However, this cannot be allowed to compromise our objective of reducing and possibility eliminating ISA. Nor can it be done, if the proposal involves a threat to public health. The environmental implications must also be taken very seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">I am advised that ISA is considered non-pathogenic for humans and mammals. The disease exists since 1984 and there is no report of it affecting human health or mammals. The virus harms cold-blooded animals. It does not replicate at temperatures above 25° centigrade and would, if present in fish for human consumption, be inactivated when ingested. In no way, however, can diseased fish be used for human consumption. As an extra precaution, I am validating this advice to our scientific committee.</p>
<p class="contents">During the debate, a number of important issues linked to our disease-control strategy have been raised including compensation. I deeply regret the losses suffered by the Scottish salmon industry. You may know that with effect from 15 January 2000, under the new financial instrument for fisheries guidance, Member States may encourage eradication of diseases in aquaculture. The Commission’s services are drawing up implementing rules in order to ensure the practical application of this instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">Council Decision 90/424 constitutes another instrument for Community financial support in case of disease outbreaks. I must emphasise, however, that there are serious constraints. Budgetary resources are very limited and priorities with other diseases have to be set. So further thought is necessary. I regret therefore that I am not at present in a position to accept amendments that refer to compensation through Decision 90/424. This is in particular the case for Amendments Nos 3 and 5.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree, however, with the statement in Amendment No 2 saying that no compensation has been made payable to salmon farmers. I am not able to comment on the availability of commercial insurance.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission included in its proposal a possibility for vaccination of salmon. The intention of this proposal is to introduce a tool for combating the disease in emergency situations. I believe a vaccine should not be used for preventative purposes as suggested in Amendment No 4. Experience in other areas has shown that preventative vaccination has the adverse affect of creating healthy virus carriers. Those could perpetuate an infection. I therefore am not able to accept Amendment No 4.</p>
<p class="contents">You also referred to the need for further scientific research on the nature of the disease. I agree that such research is needed and I understand this is at present being organised in the United Kingdom. I will follow very closely the results of this research and take it fully into account in future legislative proposals. It must be further examined whether and how scientific research in other parts of the Community must be organised. In this context I am happy to partly accept Amendment No 1, taking into account, however, that scientific investigations are not done by the Commission but that the Commission relies on results of investigations carried out in the Member States. I also can partly accept the part of Amendment No 6 saying that Directive 93/53 should be amended as a result of scientific and technical evidence.</p>
<p class="contents">As I pointed out earlier, the available scientific evidence is that ISA is not a threat to health. I can therefore agree to Amendment No 10 with the <span class="italic">proviso</span> that the words, and I quote, “of the highest possible standard” are replaced by “are safe”.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the environmental impact, it is a well-known phenomenon that while stocks have fallen during the last decades several reasons have been advanced to explain these reductions: pollution, over-fishing, changes in climate, etc. It cannot at present be excluded that ISA has an impact on wild stock. Fish escapes from aquaculture premises have been reported in the past and the virus has been found in wild stocks. In this context, a number of scientific questions that can only be resolved through further research remain open. It is for that reason that a careful approach towards the control of ISA is needed. Diseased fish should not remain in the farms and I am prepared to look into the matter so as to avoid unnecessary shedding of a virus into the environment. For that purpose, I propose to amend our initial proposal to provide that rural programmes established by the competent authority must be approved by the Commission. This is to avoid excessive withdrawal periods. I also propose to provide that the withdrawal of fish displaying clinical signs of disease should be immediate.</p>
<p class="contents">The procedures for setting additional control measures that already exist in Community legislation will be used to establish withdrawal schemes based on the state of health of the fish in order to minimise a possible environmental impact. Bearing this in mind, I can agree to accept Amendment Nos 7 and 8 with a minor change to the latter. I am also very sympathetic towards Amendment No 9, but I believe that it can be better formulated so as to join, at the same time, environmental concerns and disease control and eradication strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not feel in a position to accept Amendments Nos 12 and 13. It is my feeling that these amendments aim to achieve a zero risk. I believe this objective is very difficult to achieve without closing down the fish farming sector concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to Parliament’s own views on these amendments and will take careful note if you believe that such an approach is the best way forward. I can partly accept Amendment No 11.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to emphasise that we continue to strive to maintain a high level of health protection in accordance with our obligations under the Treaty. I believe that measures that are proportionate to that objective is the way forward. We remain committed to eradicating the disease, an objective that will be beneficial for both the environment and the salmon-farming sector. I hope that in accepting our proposal the European Parliament acknowledges our commitment and I would be very grateful for that.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
