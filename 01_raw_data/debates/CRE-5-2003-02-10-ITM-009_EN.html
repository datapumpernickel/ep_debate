<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lamy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, as Mrs McNally said during the previous debate, agriculture was one of the make or break issues at the Doha negotiations mentioned recently in another context. Mr Fischler and I will both attend the informal WTO mini-ministerial meeting in Tokyo at the weekend, and agriculture is one of the issues on the agenda. We are pleased the Council of Ministers recently approved the Union’s negotiating position. It was unfortunate, however, that approval was only possible after heated debate and several delays. Nonetheless, the fact that Council has approved this position will strengthen our own hand considerably at the forthcoming discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now say a few words on the main features of the modalities of agriculture negotiations, as they are known in negotiating jargon. These modalities will figure prominently between now and the end of March. Firstly, I should like to shed some light on the meaning of the term modalities. It might seem a fairly uncontroversial term, but it is in fact a key element of negotiations, because what is referred to as an agreement on modalities is actually an agreement on rules and figures. To give you an example, these rules may relate to subsidies. They can lay down which subsidies are permitted and which are not. Such rules may also relate to import procedures. As for the figures, they are intended mainly to achieve a reduction in tariffs and a reduction in subsidies. This is what is at issue in the current phase to be concluded by 31 March. Of course, there is more to agriculture negotiations than this. Nonetheless, it is a very important element of such negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, Mr Franz Fischler and I have always made it our business to ensure the Union pulls its weight in negotiations on agriculture. The proposals we have put on the table bear witness to this. They demonstrate that the European Union is in a position to negotiate on agriculture further to the reform of its common agricultural policy. At the same time, however, the Union is determined to negotiate so as to ensure that development becomes the driving force behind bilateral negotiations. The proposals we placed on the table testify to our commitment, our mandate and our ambition. At Doha, we committed ourselves to negotiating on the whole agriculture chapter. This includes opening up of markets, the reduction of export subsidies and domestic support, mainstreaming non-trade concerns and making a strong commitment to development. Our mandate does not permit us to pre-empt aspects of the reform of the common agricultural policy on which no decision has yet been reached. We are bound to operate strictly within the framework of previous reforms and particularly the most recent of these, under Agenda 2000. It is worth emphasising lastly that we wish to be fully involved in these negotiations, particularly where the interests of the most vulnerable countries are at stake. We hope to play a leading role in the negotiations. Contrary to statements made from both ends of the spectrum, ours is actually a middle–of–the–road position. It is in stark contrast to the positions of extremists of both sorts. We trust our position will enable us to facilitate agreement on all aspects of the agricultural negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to share with you some of the details of the content of the proposals. Firstly, with regard to access to the markets, we are proposing a 36% overall reduction in customs duties, with a 15% minimum reduction per line. This reduction is based on the method applied during the previous round. It has been tried and tested. In our view, it is the only viable method given the time constraints we are up against. Our formula differs radically from the so-called ‘Swiss’ formula put forward by several other countries in that it allows wider margins for developing countries. Clearly, this is vital to the negotiations in question. It is worth mentioning that the adjective ‘Swiss’ is somewhat misleading, as Switzerland itself denies any responsibility for the formula attributed to it. We have proposed detailed and ambitious provisions for developing countries. These include zero rating for a minimum 50% of exports of agricultural products from developing to developed countries. Another proposal is for duty and quota-free access for all products originating from less developed countries and destined to industrialised and emerging countries. This amounts to extending the scope of our ‘everything but arms’ initiative. The issue of phased tariffs for products of particular interest to developing countries will be raised for the first time.</p>
<p class="contents">Our approach to export subsidies is in the same vein. As a first step, we propose a 45% average reduction of the budget envelopes for export refunds. Further, we are prepared to progressively do away with all export refunds for certain products. Allow me to emphasise that point again. We propose gradually to eliminate export refunds for products of particular interest to developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be made quite clear that obviously, this twin proposal can only be implemented if the other parties involved also restrict comparable export subsidies. I am referring to certain types of export credits and to what could in some cases be termed the abuse of food aid. I also have in mind the activities of state enterprises based in countries that actually enjoy a more liberal reputation, activities amounting at times to unfair practice. The Commission’s stance on this issue is unequivocal. We are not prepared to be the only member of the WTO to make concessions on agriculture issues. The effort we are prepared to make must be matched by all other parties supporting exports. We trust also that all industrialised countries will play their part in opening up markets.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we are proposing to retain the current arrangements for internal support, as far as the yellow, blue and green box system is concerned. It does not make sense to tamper with a system that has proved sensible and is capable of responding to needs as they arise. On the other hand, we are proposing a 55% reduction of the internal support causing the most distortion in international trade, namely what is in the orange or yellow boxes. Further, we wish to introduce some new provisions. There are a number of loopholes in the current system of ceilings for the boxes, and these are being exploited to the point of abuse by several countries. I have in mind in particular variable aid of the deficiency payments type and our request to delete the <span class="italic">de minimis</span> clause for developed countries. In our view, its scope has been too broad.</p>
<p class="contents">Another of our proposals involves integrating the expectations of developing countries, especially the most vulnerable, hence our proposals on market access. Another significant proposal, for which we are indebted to various non-governmental organisations is the notion of a so-called food security box. This would involve putting in place a special safety net mechanism for the most sensitive products in specific developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like to comment on other issues to be negotiated, over and above those strictly related to trade. We aim to request clarification or updating of rules in areas such as environmental protection, rural development, animal welfare, consumer information, the precautionary principle and the protection of designations of origin. As you will appreciate therefore, these broader issues are high on the European agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion I would like to say, Mr President, that these proposals aim to allay the concerns of three main interested parties. As regards our trading partners, notably the developing countries, on this occasion we are proposing a quite different and special treatment of the latter. We hope the European agricultural sector will be reassured that we shall continue to fight for support to allow them to continue to provide the services it renders to society. We shall also strive to protect our quality products by defending our designations of origin. We have the interests of consumers in Europe and elsewhere very much at heart, and trust that the WTO will not raise too many objections to the implementation of rules on health and information. To summarise, our proposals on agriculture do reflect most of the concerns informing our approach throughout this round of negotiations. These are development and opening up the markets to benefit mainly the developing countries, all to be governed by rules designed for the benefit of our society and the international community as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cunha (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Communication that the European Commission has just presented to Parliament on the modalities of the agricultural agreement to be negotiated at the forthcoming WTO Round was unanimously approved on 27 January by the General Affairs Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this proposal to be balanced and to be in line with the spirit of Article 20 of the Marrakech Agreement and of the Doha Declaration and makes a genuine and generous contribution to those who until now have gained little from almost 50 years of multilateralism in trade – in other words, the world’s poorest countries. Evidence of this is the proposal for free access to the markets of the richest countries for the agricultural products of the poorer countries. Also, the compromise proposal intended to ensure that at least 50% of rich countries’ agricultural and food imports come from the poorest countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal is coherent with current practice in the European Union which, as the Commission states in one of its recent documents, imports more food products than the United States, Japan, Australia, Canada and New Zealand put together.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what gives us the moral authority to say that this WTO Round must be the development round. This is also why we have proposed a food security fund that will enable the poorest countries to implement measures to protect their markets from the subsidised exports of the rich countries, thereby enabling them to develop local production and to fight hunger and poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also be aware, however, of one important aspect, which is that an excessive reduction of customs tariffs could undermine preferential access to the EU market, which is already benefiting some countries with which we have trade agreements. Amongst these are the ACP countries, under the Cotonou agreements, and the countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean. We will have to be careful about this because if we establish excessive tariff reductions and do not ensure that our market preferences in favour of these countries are consolidated, these same poor countries could lose market share to other, richer and more competitive countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also because of this attitude of openness and support towards the poorest countries that gives us, the European Union, the moral authority, to say that we also have the right to protect our farmers and to preserve our social model. The European negotiators can therefore only accept a final agreement at the WTO that firstly preserves the European farming model based on farming’s contribution to rural land-use planning, to the territory’s balance and to the vitality of rural areas, which represent almost 80% of our territory. What this means, specifically, is that the EU will be able to continue to support its farmers and to guarantee a reasonable – and only a reasonable – level of Community preference for farm produce.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must ensure the right balance between greater trade liberalisation and greater requirements in areas that are not strictly trade related, but are definitely related to the trade in food, such as, in particular, the quality and safety of food, compliance with basic environmental standards and adherence to the trademarks and denominations of origin and geographical indications of our products which, as we all know, are widely counterfeited by a huge variety of countries across the world, with the WTO rules unable to prevent this happening.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless this is done, we shall be doing something that our society does not understand and we shall be attacking our own interests and, even worse, we shall not be supporting the interests of the poorest countries. I think that the European Union has provided a good example of good, reasonable proposals for these countries that have until now been the most marginal players, the most marginal beneficiaries of the WTO – the poor countries. We have come up with good and positive initiatives under ‘everything but arms<span class="italic">’</span>, and our proposal for negotiation consolidates these proposals. I therefore believe that we must call on other rich countries in the world, even more highly developed than we are, to follow the EU’s example. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with you, Commissioner Lamy, that the agriculture negotiations will be very important in determining whether or not the meetings in Cancun are a success. I am pleased too that you have defined for us ‘modalities’, it is a word strange to the English language, but of course, once you come to rules and numbers you are then beginning to be so clear that certain vested interests begin to take fright, so these negotiations will be difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union certainly has a world responsibility in terms of negotiations on agriculture. As Mr Cunha has just said, the volume of trade alone would make us significant. However, we do not have sole responsibility, and countries such as the United States should be reminded that they have a responsibility too. I am sure in your discussions with Bob Zurlik you will remind him of that. However, you said quite clearly that the European Union can and will negotiate, so let us look at what that means.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally we have the interest of European producers and consumers in higher food quality, rural development, environment protection and animal welfare. Some of those issues need clarification, and at the same time, the <span class="italic">raison d'être</span> of the development round are the needs of agriculture in developing countries where, proportionately, it is of far more importance than it is in the European Union. It is the principal source of income and employment in developing countries and a major tool in the fight against poverty and indeed in the improvement of food security. So our aim is multi-faceted, we need a better deal for agriculture in developing countries, but we also need to strengthen targeted support for certain aspects of European agriculture. We have a certain margin of manoeuvre within which to do it.</p>
<p class="contents">There is some feeling within the Socialist Group that the proposal is somewhat lacking in ambition. We expect to be offering to the developing world a bigger and an earlier reduction in all agricultural tariffs and in getting rid of restrictions of imports from the developing world. We want more insistence on the importance of the greenbox and more attention to special and differential treatment. You will need to consider whether the current CAP reform goes far enough. The Socialist Group would probably think not. We will leave it to you to push the agenda forward as quickly as you can. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mulder (ELDR). </span></span>  – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> My group is also of the opinion that the mandate that the Commission has been given is a good one, and that it is quite happy to be publicly associated with it. Negotiations have only just begun, and we are sure that if the Commission <span class="bold">– </span>Europe <span class="bold">– </span>takes a certain step, other trade blocs will have to follow. For us the most important thing is that we have found that the European people do not fully support European agricultural policy at this moment. Clearly this must change, so we must change European agricultural policy. We are in favour of the maximum possible reduction trade subsidies that distort trade, and this applies in particular to export subsidies and other similar subsidies imposed by other trade blocs. We are therefore generally in favour of greater liberalisation of trade in agricultural products. Something else enters into this, however. In Europe we have all sorts of rules which have little to do with the health of the product but much more to do with ethical principles, such as animal welfare, the bird and habitat directive, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Elsewhere in the world, farmers have far fewer of these kinds of rules to contend with. I always find it very difficult to explain to European farmers why they have to adhere to these rules and at the same time compete with farmers elsewhere in the world who do not have to. This seems to me to be a recipe for unfair competition, and I think that the Commission should emphasise this, particularly in its negotiations with the World Trade Organisation. What is more, farmers in various parts of Europe do not always enjoy a very good income.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot change everything from one day to the next, and I therefore think that we need to pay great attention to the European agricultural model; this is something that we can certainly defend in an international context. We must be able to reward farmers for their performance on a basis other than their production of agricultural products. I can therefore only emphasise the need for the Commission to defend the worldwide recognition of regional products grown in Europe and the ban on their being grown elsewhere under the same name. The Commission must also emphatically underline our endorsement of a system of integrated agricultural production, with control from stable to table, so to speak. I would also like to emphasise that in addition to the policy of improving product prices, we need another policy to cover the use of agricultural products for industrial purposes. Finally, everything but arms: the overwhelming majority of my group supports this, and we must do something for the poorest developing countries. The great question for our group is that of how the Commission is dealing with the principle of origin, and how, as we intend, we can be sure that products imported by us really do come from the poorest countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is clear that this is necessary for institutional balance and the whole decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a new practice, however, since there are precedents in the reform of the CAP of 1992 and in Agenda 2000. I say this because certain aspects, such as the reduction in internal support, involve the need to adopt very controversial aspects in the proposed regulations on intermediate reform.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about aspects such as total decoupling which, as well as being rejected by many MEPs – including myself – is also opposed by professions and many Member States. With regard to the content, I would continue to say the same thing: we are accepting a policy which will lack substantial and sufficient funds and which could therefore have negative effects on Community agriculture and in particular on the least-favoured regions.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the more specific proposals, I believe that there are some quite positive aspects in relation to the least-developed countries. However, the assumption is made that greater liberalisation of trade will lead to greater economic development. And this is not always the case. In this regard, I would like to point out that the two most liberalised markets – coffee and cocoa – are the agricultural markets with the highest level of poverty surrounding them and in which the producing countries call for less liberalisation and more regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither can the negotiations be based on world market prices which, although it is true they are linked to the volumes marketed, bear very little relation to production and consumer prices. In any event, I believe it is important to make progress in order to remove export refunds for agricultural products with damaging effects on local agricultural production in the least-developed countries. We must recognise the right of the less developed countries to protect themselves from these subsidised exports in order to safeguard their fundamental right to food security, to food sovereignty and to the survival of their small-scale and family-run farms.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the proposal to create a food security box is interesting, since it would be very useful also for the European Union for strategic and food security reasons. But in this regard the Commission is forgetting our dependency on vegetable proteins from outside and, specifically, from countries, in this case, which are not underdeveloped or developing, but which are very developed. And our dependency stands at 75%. This seems to me to be an extraordinary oversight.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, given its distorting use by the United States and other countries, I am very pleased with the proposals to eliminate the <span class="italic">de minimis</span> clause, to subject export credits and food aid to strict discipline and to protect geographical indications. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are good reasons for this. We have to see that, in the past, although agricultural trade affected the world's agricultural production only to a minimal degree, its mechanisms, and the resultant price destruction had a profound effect not only on European countries, but also on those in the developing world. Not only there, but also in Europe, its practice of dumping – in the form of export subsidies – destroyed or marginalised rural farming, bringing even greater hunger, forcing countries into a state of dependency, and causing debts to accumulate.</p>
<p class="contents">It is abundantly clear that trade does not fill stomachs, and if anyone does get rich from it, it is seldom if ever both the parties concerned. It is therefore understandable that it is from these sources that highly sceptical questions are being asked about precisely what is to be negotiated at the WTO. If the WTO negotiations are to be successful, then these mechanisms have to be done away with. Care must be taken to give absolute priority to the right to produce basic foodstuffs, the right of countries to alleviate their own people's hunger, the right to cultivate the land and to treat the environment properly, along with the right to pass farms on to the next generation, thus maintaining rural farming, as well as the dismantling of destructive trade mechanisms, and of what we call world trade, which amounted to nothing more than export dumping. This will enable us to develop in solidarity with people in the developing world, as well as with rural farming in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hyland (UEN).</span></span>   – Mr President, the WTO negotiations on agriculture, combined with the Commission's proposals for CAP reform, represent fundamental change for European agriculture and the welfare of farm families. I have said on many occasions in this House that uncertainty about the future is having devastating consequences for farm families.</p>
<p class="contents">I query the degree of compatibility between the Commission's commitment to the EU agricultural model, which is based on family farming, and the proposals in the world trade negotiations. Trade liberalisation, combined with a progressive reduction in EU farm support – particularly when this reduction is to apply to those already on the margins – raises serious doubts as to our real intentions.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the detail of the WTO proposal, what we see once again is a desire by the Commission to exceed the mandate given to it by Member States. The cuts proposed in export subsidies, import tariffs and domestic farm support are both excessive and unnecessary. They certainly go beyond any area of commitment entered into in the Uruguay or Doha Rounds. When we see how our competitors behave - especially in the United States' Farm Bill - one has to ask why we in Europe have to lie down on every occasion and roll over. Now that the EU petition has been tabled with the WTO, I plead with the Commission to defend vigorously the vital interests of European and, indeed, Irish agriculture. Improved market access will intensify competition in the EU market. I call on the Commission to be particularly vigilant during the negotiations on the products more sensitive to this aggressive competition, in particular beef and butter. I want the Commission to ensure that only minimal tariff reductions will be applied to those sensitive sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">It is impossible to debate the forthcoming agricultural negotiations at the WTO without putting the matter in the context of the Commission's mid-term review last month. All six impact studies, which the Commission carried out, assumed there would be no change in the multilateral trading framework. However, this is clearly not the case.</p>
<p class="contents">While it is difficult to forecast the outcome of the current round, the one thing we can be certain about is that a reduction in tariff protection will be part of any agreement. Given the volume of beef and sheepmeat that is entering the EU at present levels of protection, it is equally certain that most, if not all, of the gap in the EU market created by the reduction in EU supplies will be filled by products from third countries. I ask where then are the price increases which have been forecast by all these studies to come from? Decoupling, taken together with the WTO proposals, will cause a reduction in EU production of beef and sheepmeat.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission already knows my view that this will have a disproportionate impact on Ireland. Despite Commissioner Fischler being very dismissive of this when he presented his proposals to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development last month, I still hold firmly to my view. I am not afraid to be dismissed as a merchant of doom when I hold a view borne out by hard scientific data, compiled in an independent study on behalf of the Irish Government. For example, the Commission study indicates a 3% fall in EU beef production, but a 12% fall in Irish beef production. We will have to take the worst of both worlds: a serious reduction in production with the associated consequences for the economy, including unemployment in our vital agrifood sector, and the anticipated market vacuum filled by third-country imports.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I repeat what I said to the Commission last July when the mid-term review proposals were made and again when the legislative proposals were made last month: the combined effects of the prospect of greatly liberalised agricultural trade under the WTO and the Commission proposals for major reform of the common agricultural policy are potentially devastating for European agriculture. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Dam (EDD). </span></span>  – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Less than 10% of the world's agricultural production ends up in international trade. The overwhelming bulk is traded locally or nationally. This means that proposals intended to regulate trade in 10% of production, as is the case with the World Trade Organisation, must not lose sight of the effects of these measures on trade in the other 90%. I do not have time to go into all the aspects of the European proposal to the WTO, so I will restrict myself to the position of developing countries and the European model for multifunctional agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">For some of the world's population, food is not something that can be taken for granted. We must keep a close eye on the interests of these population groups at the WTO discussions. These interests go further than simply breaking down tariff barriers and preferential access to the European market; preferential access does not necessarily result in an increase in the income of the developing countries and their people. A recent study has shown that complete liberalisation of trade only provides poor countries with a minimal increase in their income. Countries such as India and Nigeria are asking for the WTO agreements to be applied flexibly, and rightly so. They want to support and protect their agricultural sectors and the development of the countryside in order to offer their rural population some security of existence. These countries need subsidies in order to guarantee food security and to support small-scale agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore pleasantly surprised by the Commission's proposal for a Food Security Box and by the scope that Europe wants to offer these countries to support their own agriculture by means of subsidies. Export subsidies are destroying the world market. The Commission is, quite rightly, proposing to reduce these further. If other countries agree to this, the result may be an increase in prices on the world market. I would, however, like to point out to the Commission that this does not help everybody. As many as 43 countries in Africa are net importers of food. They will therefore be worse off if food prices on the world market increase. This is why, in addition to the anti-dumping measures, technical assistance for these countries is of great importance. The incomes of farmers in the European Union are under pressure. Trade liberalisation is primarily of importance to trade and the processing industry.</p>
<p class="contents">If Europe wants to retain its family-run farms, it will have to take measures that conflict with the principles of free trade. It will also have to act more effectively than it is doing at the moment. A study by the OECD shows that only a quarter of every euro of support that goes to agriculture ends up with the farmer. Further liberalisation without sufficient protection for the European agricultural model will result in a reduction in the number of farmers. Fortunately, the Commission’s proposal to the WTO is putting the case for the multifunctional agricultural model. There should still be the possibility of subsidies for aspects that do not disrupt trade, such as the environment, animal welfare and countryside development, but I hope that the Commission also realises that a viable agricultural sector in Europe needs sufficient scope to regulate its market. Because agriculture still does not operate like a bicycle factory, we need appropriate protection at our borders. This protection must be transparent. Food aid as a capped form of dumping is reprehensible. The Commission rightly highlights this in its proposal, along with other forms of agricultural support such as export credits, export guarantees and state trading enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission's proposal is lacking a significant policy instrument that has a positive effect on the market and prices – I am referring to production control. This instrument is working properly for sugar and dairy products. The only discordant note sounded by this system is the dumping on the world market of surpluses caused by excessively high quotas. We should therefore not do away with the quota system, but quotas should be realistic. The quota for dairy products is 105% of consumption. If we brought this down to 100%, we would free the world market from dumped sugar and milk powder and we would at the same time offer our farmers a better price. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must make it clear at the outset that I do not wish to anticipate the outcome of the discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, these negotiations are taking place against a background of widely differing approaches to agriculture in the United States and the European Union. Aware of the negative consequences of the fair act for their agriculture, the United States have replaced it with an ambitious farm bill bringing in a 70% increase in financial support to the sector. In contrast, the European Union has set ceilings for expenditure on agriculture. Further, the Union is implementing a policy on decoupling, just as the United States have abandoned theirs. The Union is also reluctant to apply Community preferences, as was the case in the incident concerning cereals from the Black Sea. Clearly, these contrasts reflect differing degrees of political will. The United States wishes its agriculture to remain strong. For the United States, retaining control of what they term the food weapon is a strategic priority, so they are deploying all the means at their disposal to that end. As for Europe, it is divided on this issue, as it is on so many others. Europe is even divided on the very appropriateness of a public agricultural policy. It is divided too on the resources such a policy should have available. In the proposal on agriculture made by the United States in the context of Doha, significant public support for its agriculture is retained. It would therefore be both paradoxical and unacceptable for European agriculture to be stranded high and dry at the end of the process.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to the Cairns group, it is vital to prevent those countries that are not developing countries and have maintained unrelenting pressure since the start of the Uruguay Round from bringing about the demise of any kind of European agricultural policy by whatever means they have available. We must stand firm. Developing countries cannot become shields concealing this aim. After all, the European Union is the largest importer of agricultural products from developing countries in the world. The Union accounts for two-thirds of Africa’s agricultural exports. In addition, the Union is the only party to have created a system of non-reciprocal preferences in the framework of the Lomé Convention and subsequently of the Cotonou Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">My third and last point is that it is vital for any agreement to be subject to proper provision for concerns we deem to be crucial to society, though they are not strictly trading issues. I mean proper provision, not mere lip service. I have in mind the requirement for traceability, the rejection of social dumping, concern for the environment and authorised protection of designations of origin. Mr President, these issues have to be central to negotiations. They cannot be sidelined.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust you will take all this on board, Commissioner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Doyle (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, the Commission's proposals for the WTO negotiation modality, or rules on agriculture, were unanimously supported by Member States at the recent General Affairs Council, following earlier discussions with various trade policy groups and the agriculture fora. They have now been submitted to Geneva to be considered, along with the proposals of the other members of the World Trade talks, including the United States, the Cairns Group and the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Agreement on the rules under which the new agreement will be concluded is due by the end of March this year, and agreement on the new round itself by the beginning of 2005. But let us call it as it is. There are marked differences in the positions of the main negotiating parties, and there will be pressure on all, including the European Union, to compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union negotiates at the World Trade talks on the basis of a mandate which was approved by the Council of Ministers back in September 1999. That was subsequently endorsed by the General Affairs Council. That mandate is based on the Agenda 2000 agreement, one of the main objectives of which was to prepare the EU for the WTO negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Last December the Commission presented a draft paper which it said is consistent with the EU's negotiating mandate at WTO level, as approved by the Council in 1999. It is consistent therefore with Agenda 2000, and will not require changes to the common agricultural policy; the EU level of export subsidies and domestic support in the so-called 'yellowbox' are already below the levels of reduction commitments proposed; the market access proposals can also be accommodated without disrupting EU markets; and the EU is already committed to reducing tariffs and quota barriers on imports from the least-developed countries and from all developing countries, as proposed in the paper.</p>
<p class="contents">Most Member States question the Commission's approach in making substantial reduction commitment offers at this stage, given that there will be pressure to make further concessions as negotiations proceed. Ireland and France had difficulty with a number of specific issues, and a small number of amendments were introduced at the Council to meet these concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important of these issues for Ireland related to improved market access, or the reduction of import tariffs. Following pressure from Ireland and France, the Commission provided a declaration in the Minutes of the General Affairs Council to the effect that it would submit the proposals on market access to the Council, would remain vigilant in the negotiations in relation to products which are exposed to international competition, and would take particular account of sensitive products.</p>
<p class="contents">We also recorded in the Minutes a declaration that our acceptance of the Commission's proposal is on the basis that, at most, minimal tariff reductions will be applied to sensitive sectors, especially beef and butter. The Irish also had further concerns in relation to domestic support, the redemption of the 'bluebox' and the exemption from reduction commitments of direct payments which are of vital importance to our farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2002, 60% of Irish farm incomes were in the form of direct payments to producers which qualify for 'bluebox' exemption. The retention of export subsidies is also a major issue to us, as a major exporter of agricultural and food products to third countries. We are particularly dependent on the continuation of an EU system of export subsidies in order to remain competitive on export markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Fischler contends that his decoupling proposals will reduce production and therefore increase prices, but this ignores the reality of the Commission's World Trade proposals of a decrease of up to 36% in import tariffs amongst other multilateral issues. We still need answers from Commissioner Fischler as to how he is going to square that circle. The 36%, 45%, 55% proposals at World Trade talks, together with the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy – which includes proposals for decoupling and modulation – and the uncertain implications of enlargement, have created a climate of serious mistrust in a Commissioner who wants to tear up an existing decision of EU heads of government after only two and a half years of a seven-year agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, we have a duty of care to the developing world, but that must go hand in hand with the duty of care to our own farmers. Notwithstanding the generosity of the common agricultural policy, and as a result of a combination of falling prices, lower production levels and higher costs, aggravated by exceptionally bad weather, they face ongoing and serious declines in income and uncertain futures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Certainly, when I hear the opinions of the traditional farmers' front, it is clear that this Parliament still has much work to do. From a Socialist point of view, world trade is about fair play for all. It is essential that we achieve breakthrough in the negotiations on the agricultural portfolio. We would like to secure two things in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly we would like to see an end to the dumping of products from Europe and the USA on the markets of developing countries. We would also like to see our markets opened up more towards developing countries, in which populations are sometimes more than 80% dependent for their incomes on agricultural activity and the abolition of quotas and tariff restrictions on developing countries exporting to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly we would like to see production subsidies in the European agricultural policy converted into public grants for nature conservation and new economic activities in the countryside (recreation, ICT, animal welfare). In other words, less, but spread out more extensively; less support for large-scale farmers; more support for quality and a reasonable existence for farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">The latter is essential, as liberalisation is one thing, but we do not want the market to do everything. What we need is public supervision and regulation. We are talking about a social model for Europe. We are well aware that in doing so we will have to prevent this support from public grants from being indirectly used as capped subsidies, thus once more resulting in protectionism and products being sold on the world market too cheaply.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion it is clear that the proposals now being put forward are a good starting point. At the same time we would like to ask Commissioners Lamy and Fischler to make more than 50% of agricultural products from developing countries tax-free. We would like to see change phased in before 2011. What we would like to see is over 30% off the tariffs, and in 30% less time.</p>
<p class="contents">We wholeheartedly endorse the concept of the Food Box. We also realise, however, that the ACS countries must do their homework better and come up with proposals more quickly. Then there is the USA, of course. It is clear that the USA, with its Farm Bill, is currently going completely against the spirit and the facts of Doha. This places us in an enormous dilemma. We are of the opinion that Europe and the developing countries must together exert pressure on the USA to abandon this position, because we are convinced that the current policy is bad for us, for our environment, and for the welfare of our animals, as well as for the developing countries. As the Group of the Party of European Socialists has already done in the last legislative term, let us also demonstrate the courage to change course despite all the ifs and buts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is furthermore stated in clear terms that ‘the actual measures involve the fair sharing of agricultural burdens and the developing countries, too, should be given greater opportunities.’ That is a logical development in view of the fact that, in the EU too since the 1992 CAP reform, liberalisation keeps making advances in the implementation of the GATT resolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The good ship WTO is steaming ahead, with undertakings in the agricultural and food industries swimming in its wake as best they can, as, every time the consumer spends a euro on groceries, the farmers get only an average of 25 cents. The liberalisation of agricultural trade has its advocates and its opponents. There is unanimous agreement that developing countries should be given easier access to the European Internal Market, yet, despite liberalisation – or, indeed, as a consequence of it – there has been no definite improvement in the situation as regards world hunger; indeed, as the motions for a resolution point out, this has got worse.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not clear what sort of permanent and comprehensive body of Europe-wide legislation on non-commercial matters might be able to maintain the balancing act between, on the one hand, the maintenance and improvement of European agriculture's competitive position on world markets and, on the other hand, the protection of insufficiently competitive agriculture at a time when it is being made more multifunctional for the benefit of society. My mind is quite open as to whether the European agricultural model, combining multifunctionality with a policy of subsidies, can be implemented with any international legitimacy. The great danger is already present that this will prove no long-lasting protection and that the abandonment of European subsidy policy will then begin in earnest, because there will as yet be no political majorities, and where they do exist, they will be compromises. On the other hand, the WTO's fundamental categories do not include issues of rural development, environmental protection and animal welfare. What is true of enlargement must also be true of the WTO negotiations, the principle being that nobody should be any worse off. The situation before the negotiations and after them will be considered in that light, so we can look forward to the result with some excitement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When all is said and done, agriculture represents an economic and social market framework the countries of the Southern hemisphere can only dream of. You are mandated to bear the European Union’s great responsibility in this field. I believe the countries of the south should consider the Union their staunchest ally. We must therefore ensure that every person’s fundamental right to have food is not sacrificed on the altar of the god of trade and financial transactions.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes down to it, agriculture is an indicator of public welfare the world over, as was stated a moment ago. For the countries of the south, it involves food security, and also the quality of food, water and the soil. It means recognition of regional products, the preservation of the landscape and the sustainable development of rural areas. All this applies to the countries of the north as well as to the countries of the south. Hence, as you said, your mandate should demonstrate there is no selfishness on our part, and that we are willing to eliminate a number of export subsidies. These subsidies are also ruining small farmers within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The right of peoples and countries to feed themselves with local, healthy products should allow them to take protectionist measures when necessary. If your safeguard clause reflects this right, it will go hand-in-hand with fair-trade, and would be a welcome extension of the ‘Everything but arms’ initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Martinez (NI).</span></span>   – (<span class="italic">FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, two new worrying developments have emerged in connection with the latest round of WTO negotiations. These developments concern the atmosphere of negotiations on the one hand and the subject of negotiations on the other. The atmosphere has changed due to the strong pressure exerted by the United States representatives on their European counterparts. Mr Robert Zoellick has referred to European partners such as France and Ireland as colonialists who are two hundred years behind the times. You are an exception Commissioner, as you have all but been awarded an honorary doctorate by the Bush administration. All this has taken place against the background of references to ‘Old Europe’, or even cheese-eating monkeys. We know that your opposite number Mr Robert Zoellick, signed an open letter from Mr Wolfowitz in January 1998 calling for a war on Iraq. You seem to be negotiating with a hawk Commissioner! You know him better than I do, however, so you must be best placed to judge if he really is one.</p>
<p class="contents">The subject of negotiations has also changed. To date, we had been discussing subjects which lacked soul. Now, as we discuss agriculture, we are negotiating on quality, the environment, welfare, animals and consequently essentially cultural matters. The present round does not concern goods. It concerns knowledge. It concerns the very essence of people, and their very being. Hence the fear of nothingness, as the Louvain students made clear to you. Agriculture constitutes an exception to the rule. There is its unique structure, the AOCs and the countryside. Hence the deep-rooted fear that you might not stand up for this agricultural exception which goes right back to Mesopotamia. It is nothing new.</p>
<p class="contents">Serious misgivings abound, and they are mainly of a political nature. We fear that Cancun will be a ‘Munich in the sun’. There are moreover precedents for this. There is the mysterious agreement of 2001 on bananas. Chiquita collapsed just like Enron. There is the failure to challenge the issue of dependency on oil-producing crops, even after the opening-up of former Eastern bloc countries and the consequences of mad cow disease. Above all there is Mr Fischler’s project, begun in July 2002 and confirmed in January 2003, which involved deep cuts in subsidies. At the same time, the United States established proposals to spend 190 billion over ten years from May 2002. Nonetheless, the <span class="italic">de minimis</span> rule would keep all this within the green box.</p>
<p class="contents">Our fears are also based on an unfathomable contradiction. Surely it cannot be right to destroy our agricultural infrastructure and know-how when by 2020 there will be two billion more mouths to feed. This is the basis of my fundamental fear. Commissioner, we seem to be already condemned as we speed along on board the shuttle Earth which is as riddled with cracks as the shuttle Columbia. Yet here we are discussing commerce and global free-trade when we know drinking water supplies are dwindling and when two billion people lack electricity or medicine. I am beginning to wonder therefore whether the WTO, like the European Union, is a museum piece. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fiori (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Commissioner, the subject of this evening’s debate is certainly the basis for a tapestry of some of the major themes of world and European politics. For example, the first theme is without a doubt that world agricultural trade and the talks which are outlining and will define the aspects and modalities thereof represent the point of confrontation between market liberalisation and governments’ desires to pursue protectionist agricultural policies which go beyond production itself and affect what are known as non-commercial aspects too, such as environmental protection, food safety, the safeguarding and promotion of quality and the preservation of rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">We have listened to you carefully this evening, Commissioner, and it is clear from what you have said that the European Union has expressed a strong desire to negotiate an agreement for the further liberalisation of the trade in agricultural products. In our opinion, however, the agreement must be well balanced and must be an agreement which benefits everybody. It would appear that this is also the position which Commissioner Fischler has upheld on a number of occasions with regard to Community agricultural policies. Not more than a week ago, in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, he pointed out that the rules which emerge from the new rounds of talks next autumn must be fair and apply equally to all. Thus, the idea which emerges of cutting export subsidies is an idea which is certainly attractive and which I certainly support, but only on condition that other subsidies causing the distortion of the international trade market are also regulated.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is another major political theme which is connected with the subject of this evening’s debate. We need an overall perspective on the matter. The current economic situation, whose development will interact with and be affected by the future development of the agricultural sector, cannot be viewed purely in terms of international trade, for international trade is directly dependent upon the proposal to reform the common agricultural policy. What was to be a mid-term assessment review has become a veritable transformation of European agriculture. The Community policy guidelines in this sector, in addition to seeing the market as a means of economic development, are intended in Europe to ensure consumer protection – consider the recent creation of the European Food Safety Authority. This principle of food safety has been expressed and accepted at WTO level too, but it has only been accepted as an ideal. Much progress will be needed before quality equal to that of our own produce is guaranteed. The production costs sustained by the European agricultural economy differ substantially from those sustained by the developing countries, for the standards of quality, safety and health and hygiene are different. It is as desirable that clear international rules for the protection of agrifoods should be established at the forthcoming negotiating rounds as it is for the <span class="italic">Codex alimentarius</span> to be duly valued and respected in the protection of recognised typical European products.</p>
<p class="contents">European farms operating in a globalised context must invest in the quality of their produce to acquire specific market shares which are sensitive to new consumer demands. Production standards are now oriented towards ensuring the traceability of production from stable to table. In this sense, the possibility of marketing European agrifoods produce at world level must go hand in hand with the economic development of the less wealthy countries, with mutual respect for local agrifoods production in a global context of balanced growth regulated by both the economy and well-defined rules, but, above all, by the clear need for growth which benefits all to the detriment of none.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the basic issue before us now is that the proposal you have outlined to us this evening, Commissioner, contains a principle. We need a common agricultural policy which preserves the conventions we are used to. Your speech and the documents available to us uphold a principle which we find it very hard to accept, to the effect that the proposal for mid-term review, which provides, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, for decoupling and the non-fulfilment of<span class="bold"> </span>blue box commitments, should take precedence over the WTO negotiating modalities, which provide for an endeavour to preserve the blue box aid instigated with the McSharry reform. There is therefore a need to redefine the negotiating modalities, removing the Blue Box chapter altogether and thus irretrievably eliminating the possibility of safeguarding direct payments in a multilateral context. If this should happen, we believe that it would be the beginning of the liberalisation of the European agricultural sector, which is essential not just for the sector as such but for the whole of the European economy as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would also like to say that the commitment to greater openness must be accompanied by a fair distribution of responsibilities amongst the developed countries. In this regard, we must condemn the unilateral nature of the United States’ agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I am concerned, however, that the model of agricultural multifunctionality may be jeopardised. I must tell you that in the proposal for negotiation multifunctional considerations are mentioned just once when the Commission refers to access to the market for the poorest countries.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Community agriculture, it is true that we are now referring to social objectives such as the protection of the environment, public health, obligatory labelling or the need to compensate for the additional costs of animal welfare. But European agricultural multifunctionality no longer plays an important role in this offer for negotiation and the main focus has passed to the decoupling of aid, the principle which the Commission is going to concentrate the negotiation on, in the internal support chapter.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I believe that, if we allow our entire negotiating strategy to rest on the principle of decoupling, we may find ourselves without any room for manoeuvre in terms of guaranteeing elements which are essential to European agriculture, such as the stability of markets, with the maintenance of stable and economically viable prices which allow producers to earn an income. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The inviolable principle behind all European Union decisions is how best to serve the interests of big business and the multinationals. The forthcoming reform of the CAP – which is a catastrophic overhaul, not the mid-term review it claims to be – is being carried out in the run up to and under pressure from WTO negotiations. The proposed WTO agreement speeds up the liberalisation of the international trade in agricultural produce on the pretext that international trade will increase and benefit the developing countries. The same was said of GATT, and look what happened there. GATT was going to increase the international trade in agricultural produce and generate wealth. Not only did the developing countries and their people not benefit; they were worse off than before, with no margin for development even in countries with a high output like Argentina. All that happened was that the multinationals producing and selling agricultural produce sent their profit figures soaring.</p>
<p class="contents">The same will happen with the WTO agreement, for three basic reasons. The first has to do with the approach, which favours monopolies, as did GATT. The second has to do with the international system of prices and subsidies for agricultural produce and the international system of prices for industrial goods. The rich countries buy cheap agricultural produce and sell expensive industrial goods, including medicines. The third reason has to do with who produces and owns the agricultural produce in numerous developing countries, where farming and agricultural produce are owned by huge multinationals paying starvation wages.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Communist Party of Greece is against the proposed agreement and is doing everything it can to coordinate the grass-roots fight in every country for international trade based on mutual benefit of equal value to all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is no mean feat. In fact it is very difficult, as we have people on one side who believe the Commission is going too far, and others who believe that it is acting far too cautiously. If the European Union is to have a credible voice in the Doha process, this procrastination must stop. With enlargement on our doorstep we must act immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's proposals will benefit European farmers in the long term and improve prospects for meaningful global trade liberalisation talks. I hope that we send the clear message that it is the farmers themselves who should receive a greater share of the market price, and not the increasing numbers of powerful monopolies that are controlling, in a devastating manner, our agricultural industry at the present moment in time.</p>
<p class="contents">The balance we seek is to support small farmers - 90% of the farmers in my country, Wales, are small farmers who farm in less favoured areas - and rural development and Pillar II, on the one hand, while also taking account of farmers in the Third World. It is a very difficult balancing act. We can no longer continue with a situation where the average European dairy cow now has a bigger annual income, thanks to European subsidies, than half of the world's population. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the difficulty we have, and that you in the Commission have in particular, is, in essence, the fact that you have to reconcile two different strategies. On the one hand, you have to implement reform in the European Union's agricultural production, and on the other, you have to improve developing countries' access to the market. That is of course extremely difficult, and is made more so by the very ambitious timetable, as you are required to be able to point to successes as soon as this year – successes in the Cancun negotiations. You must at least say in what direction you are taking us, and in doing so you also have to keep sight of your obligation to successfully conclude the negotiations in 2005. Add to that the complications with your trading partners, and the whole thing, taken together, amounts to a thoroughly tricky act.</p>
<p class="contents">I have looked at many documents and position papers from Germany, but also from other countries, so that what is here on the desk in front of me is a pot-pourri. On the one hand, much that is said is complimentary; people approve of the fact that something is happening at last, and that we are going in the right direction. On the other hand, there are also many reservations and concerns, with fears that the European Union will end up with the model of what I might summarise in general terms as a sort of ‘leisure agriculture’, and that we are to some extent losing sight of the need to be flexible enough to be truly competitive and to be able to compete internationally. We may well be able to do a great deal for the environment and agriculture, but there is the risk of other instruments falling by the wayside.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, both you and Commissioner Fischler have, I believe, always said that we have enough room to manoeuvre. We have flexibility. We have to look at the details, perhaps at the milk prices for example, or in other areas, to see what else we might do.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude with a very brief question. At a seminar of the Group of the Party of European Socialists last week, representatives of the developing countries kept referring to the development box, and expressed the desire that more be done about it. Perhaps you could say something about this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Baltas (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, the motto we need to adopt for negotiating our agricultural policy at the WTO is: ‘More empty words? No, thank you. Specific proposals? Yes, please’. And the proposals and the timetable for applying them are nothing if not specific. The overall package being contributed to the forthcoming WTO negotiations by the European Union puts the ball very firmly in the European Union’s court. Rather than just tabling proposals, it needs to make a studied demand for something in return. We need to know, for example, what the other developed countries are going to do and which parts of the system of protection for European Union farmers need to be safeguarded.</p>
<p class="contents">While we are on the subject of protecting our farmers, and I mean the farmers of the 25 Member States of the European Union, not just the 15, we need first for the multifunctionality model of European agriculture to be recognised and protected. Secondly, the review of the common agricultural policy – and the Socialists’ agree with the general philosophy here – must not pay the price for any misplaced commitments undertaken at the negotiations. Thirdly, as far as the environmental dimension of rural development, striking an ecological balance, food standards and so on are concerned, the European Union must lobby for a common clause for all countries based on its standards. It is both pointless and unacceptable to make it easier to import agricultural produce from developing countries which do not meet European standards. Finally, we are not doing poor countries and their farmers any favours if we manage to increase farmers’ incomes in poor countries, merely so that the developed countries can sell them extortionately expensive AIDS drugs, for example. In other words, what we need at the negotiations are not just impressive proposals of good intent; we need to juxtapose them with social benefits, we need a certain type of negotiation which serves broader social interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am not sure this is news but it is nevertheless the case.</p>
<p class="contents">We should ask ourselves what is really at stake in this whole affair of multinational commercial agricultural negotiations. The issue is whether the European Union can and should subscribe to controls, ceilings and rules. In the future these would limit the support and protection we currently afford to our farmers and would like to continue to afford them. Further, I would like to remind you of some of the principles on which my position and Mr Franz Fischler’s position are based. I would then like to dwell on two or three points in a little more detail.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, at Doha we made a number of commitments on negotiations. Our undertakings went considerably further than those we gave on the previous occasion. I am referring to Marrakech in 1995. We agreed to increase market access by reducing our support within the Union and reducing export subsidies. These matters form part of our negotiation mandate. We shall pursue this, as previously agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">Our second principle concerns our work on these issues. In allocating concessions, we should give priority to developing countries and ensure that concessions and consequently control measures are applied in an equitable manner. There is no question of the European Union as part of the developed world accepting control measures other developed countries would reject.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to outline my third and last general principle. This debate is not the same as our internal debate on the reform of the common agricultural policy. The debate over our position in relation to the World Trade Organisation is quite separate from the internal debate on the reform of the common agricultural policy. We are not debating the reform of the common agricultural policy in Geneva, Tokyo, Washington, Sydney or Cancun. It will be debated internally, along our own lines. It is true that we are debating our position in relation to the World Trade Organisation in Brussels and Strasbourg, but in the spirit I described.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has indeed put forward a proposal. If adopted, it will usher in further reforms in the management of the common agricultural policy. It remains to be seen if and when these decisions are taken. It has yet to be established also which of these decisions will be used as negotiating tools and when. This is not the case at the moment however. I must make it clear to Mrs Doyle that the 36%, 45%, 55%, that Mr Franz Fischler and I have now put forward with the agreement of the Council, follow from reforms already adopted. They do not compromise the eventual outcome of other reforms in any way.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to whether what we have put forward is too ambitious or is not sufficient. You have already responded to this question I think. Some of you think our proposals lack ambition and others think they go too far. Mrs McNally made it clear that, in her opinion, we could have gone further. I would like to say that I do not believe we could have gone any further, at least not at this stage. If here and now all the contracting parties within the WTO made the type of commitment we have put on the table, we would all have taken a great step forward towards establishing better control measures to support agriculture throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Now for the question of whether we are going too far. I believe this is what Mr Hyland is concerned about. I do not believe that we are. I do think however that we have already gone too far in reforming the common agricultural policy in recent years. This was perhaps the essence of what Mr Hyland was saying. As you can well imagine, this is not the view of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to address the points made by Mr van Dam, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf and Mrs Erika Mann. They rightly pointed to the issue of food security. They based their arguments on the fact that in agriculture, only 10% of production is traded on the international market. This contrasts with the situation in other sectors. They are right in what they say and this is why we have introduced a new measure that has been widely commented upon. We are building in the concept of food security, a safeguard clause, a separate section devoted to food security. As I said in my introductory intervention, we have taken inspiration from various quarters, in particular non-governmental organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I finish, I would like to respond to Mr Mulder. It is true Mr Mulder, that the rules of the so-called ‘Everything but arms’ initiative include very strict controls on the origin of products that mean that only products from the least advanced countries benefit from the ‘zero duty, zero quota’ measure agreed for their benefit. These rules are very restrictive and some of the countries believe they are excessively so. It is therefore right the rules should be so rigorous.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say two lessons have been learnt from this debate. The first is that Mr Martinez appears to have certain existential concerns. This in itself is excellent news. The second is that, for once, there are excellent reasons for such concerns. On this occasion, I do actually share the view that agriculture concerns not just goods but our very being. I am sure my colleague Mr Fischler would agree on this too. Mr Martinez is right on this point. Agriculture is about goods that are produced, distributed and end up on our own or other people’s plates. Agriculture is also about a service, however, and there is far less talk about that. The goods component of agriculture can be found on the market and in trade links. Goods are bought and sold. The service component of agriculture encompasses food security, the environment and welfare. This is not discussed. In general it is poorly served by market forces.</p>
<p class="contents">Agriculture is therefore made up of two interdependent elements. One can be seen to circulate, and could be deemed to fit the same rules as applied to the production of socks, tyres and shoes The other element cannot be equated to the trade in socks, tyres and shoes in any way whatsoever. This is the service component, and because of it we have a special relationship with what we eat and what we produce. The coexistence of the goods and the service components of agriculture is at the root of the difficulties we are up against. This is how we in Europe perceive agriculture and this is why Europe has adopted a balanced position on a number of outcomes. We are not, however, prepared to sacrifice what we believe to be the collective cost of agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">We will pursue this concept of the two aspects of agriculture in our discussions. I have already made it clear to those of you who are interested in or indeed passionate about this issue that there is everything to gain from discussing this whole matter again, before the Cancun meeting. We should, if possible, debate the negotiation program as a whole, and not bit by bit disjointedly as we have this evening. Mr Franz Fischler and I are certainly willing to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wanted to speak because my position in relation to agriculture is not the same as the position presented to this House by a number of other Irish Members. I say this because it is important for the variety of opinion that exists in relation to farming to be on the record. I welcome the proposals put forward by the Commission in relation to farming.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the issues that is constantly ignored in Ireland and elsewhere is the contradiction between our spending a considerable amount of money on development aid in assisting developing countries, and yet maintaining a common agricultural system which, at the same time, undermines the very people we claim to be trying to help with our development aid. That is an issue we have not yet come to grips with in Ireland or, to some extent, in the rest of Europe. It is not a position that you will hear too often from an Irish Member in this House and, for that reason, I wanted to put it on the record. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
