Following the debates with the Council last night I was wondering whether this report is actually close enough to the original proposal for first reading procedure to be possible. There are certainly a number of amendments where we need further clarification. If we vote for them would this actually take the report further away from what this House is allowed to vote on? This concerns Amendments Nos 4, 5, 6, 18, 21, 33, 36, 40, 42 and 46, some of which directly imply policy down to individual schools in Member States. I would like to hear whether this is actually a legal procedure for us to be voting on now.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Regulation No 3582/86 is about the protection of forests against atmospheric pollution and Regulation No 2158/92 has established a framework for the protection of forests against fires. The rapporteur proposes increasing the sums allocated to both of these programmes, whereas the Commission proposal seeks to cut them drastically. The rapporteur’s attitude is an appropriate one. It does seem logical to take account of the virtual doubling of the Community’s forested surface area since the last round of enlargement in 1998 and to fulfil the requirements of the European Union’s forestry strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Admittedly, there is no legal basis in the Treaty for a common forestry policy. We are not using this report to start up the debate again but simply to point out that the European Union’s forestry strategy is based on subsidiarity. In other words, action is only proposed if it offers added value in relation to national action. The problem is identifying whether there actually is added value. Subsidiarity works in favour of Community action in this specific context.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the issues in all the forests of the Fifteen Member States are not identical. So, the Nordic countries, which since 1998 have comprised most of Europe’s forested areas, are affected most of all by atmospheric pollution, stresses due to climatic factors and soil acidification whereas the countries of southern Europe are more subject to the effects of desertification, drought and fires. These disparities must not, however, preclude the need to operate a monitoring system of this type at Community level, at this time when the interdependence of the stress factors acting on forestry ecosystems in general and as a whole has been acknowledged.</p>
<p class="contents">Increasing the financial allocation would, moreover, come at an opportune moment, because our forestry areas are threatened by fire following the terrible storms last December, and indeed many outbreaks of fire have already been reported. If we are to prevent disasters of this type, then we must improve fire safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, when the Commission’s communication of 2 February 2000 advocates resorting to the all-out precautionary principle and a Community action programme in favour of civil protection instituted by the Council Decision of 9 December 1999 is waiting only to be implemented, is not the time to cut off funding for Regulation No 2158/92.</p>
<p class="contents">Combating atmospheric pollution takes on a new dimension in the light of the guidelines established by the Commission regarding climate change, biodiversity and sustainable management. Ecosystem surveillance promises to be a multidisciplinary activity. If atmospheric pollution has lost something of its extremely topical nature in the face of these priorities, it may be consistently integrated into the list of planet-wide challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">The heart of the problem is political, however. Some Member States have expressed doubts as to the importance of forests, even though the forestry industry employs 2.2 million people in Europe, and forests cover 36% of the surface area of the European Union!</p>
<p class="contents">We have this vicious circle scenario. The regulations in question need political support. In order to receive political support, however, the networks must be capable of detecting changes and indeed risks, and financial support is needed in order to prove the existence of such risks in scientific terms!</p>
<p class="contents">While awaiting the matter of extending these programmes beyond 2001, it is our political responsibility to provide them with financial support. For the data gathered is intended to be used as technical justification for political decisions in areas where ‘nothing to report’ means ‘no action necessary’.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, the protection and attention which they are afforded is not commensurate with their importance. The major catastrophes which forests have suffered over recent years and the failure to react adequately in dealing with them are seriously jeopardising the ecological balance, as well as health, safety and numerous cultural and social values inextricably bound up with our forest heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">Mountain and forest areas, especially in the Mediterranean, have been seriously damaged by deforestation, fire, erosion desertification, abandonment, abuse and inadequate reforestation, with the result that tens of thousands of acres of forest land have been lost.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to bring to your attention the dramatic problem in Greece, which is at the top of the European league in terms of the numbers of acres burnt for every fire. Only 10% of the surface area destroyed in Greece is reforested. The remaining 90% is either abandoned or, more usually, is swallowed up and developed by economic interests (such as the tourist businesses generally encouraged by the government of the day), which take advantage of the fires – and/or are perhaps guilty of arson in starting them – the unresolved problem of land ownership and the fact that there are no forest land register or records of government-owned forests in order to improve their profits.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a wide variety of forests within the Community (northern, temperate, Mediterranean and tropical) and an equally wide variety of general and specific problems. Not only has the EU's forest policy to date failed as a result of fragmented, one-off, inconsistent and incoherent action and the wholly inadequate funds provided; the Commission has now proposed further cuts in the already minimal funds available to protect forests from fire and atmospheric pollution. The reason given for the proposed cuts is the reduced take-up of funds during the last period! But the problems have not been solved. On the contrary, they have multiplied. Such a policy is not merely hypocritical. It is aiding and abetting fire.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall not give up.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on the European Parliament to stand by its repeated votes and positions on the need to strengthen measures to prevent and fight fires and protect and enhance the value of our forest heritage in all areas of the Union. We believe that the Community funds allocated to forests were and still are totally inadequate and we call for them to be increased in line with real needs and the importance of forests.</p>
<p class="contents">We really must take suitable initiatives in collaboration with national and local authorities and the agencies responsible and set out an efficient forest policy and develop direct and coordinated action so that the forests destroyed can be revived and reforested on the basis of the latest scientific data and methods, taking account of the biological, climatic and ecological conditions in each region and, we repeat, the EU and the national governments must provide the funds needed in order to create the necessary infrastructure and recruit sufficient personnel which, if Greece is anything to go by, are woefully lacking.</p>
<p class="contents">In doing so we shall be helping to ensure that the forests in these countries are protected, developed, restored ecologically and used productively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was a rapporteur on this subject in 1992 and I am particularly interested in following legislative developments on the subject. As for phthalates, the chemical substances used to plasticise PVC, I have always campaigned for proactive measures with a view to protecting, as indeed we ought, this particularly vulnerable group of consumers, i.e. children.</p>
<p class="contents">Experiments on animals have shown the toxic and carcinogenic nature of some phthalates, which can cause liver, kidney and testicular ailments in children that suck or chew on dummies, rattles or teething rings.</p>
<p class="contents">This identification of the risks gave parents legitimate cause for concern, and should have led to firm measures being adopted, meeting the requirements of the precautionary principle. The least that can be said, however, is that the Commission’s reaction, albeit relatively prompt (referral to the scientific committee for an opinion, studies into toxicity, ecotoxicity and impact on the environment, the emergency ban decision and proposal to amend the directives concerned), was rather lukewarm in view of the issues at stake and in view of the objective of guaranteeing a high level of consumer protection and protection of human health.</p>
<p class="contents">What has the European Commission proposed? It has proposed banning toys containing one of the six offending phthalates that are intended to be put into the mouths of children under the age of three, and to put a warning on toys containing one of the 6 offending phthalates and likely to be put into the mouths of children under the age of three, and to revise the directive in four years’ time. This is, of course, completely inadequate.</p>
<p class="contents">It is ridiculous to provide for a ban only on toys and childcare articles intended to be placed in the mouth. As every parent knows, young children put absolutely everything in their mouths. We must therefore ban toys and objects containing phthalates which are likely to be put either totally or partially into children’s mouths. The lack of reliable scientific information on the movement of these chemical substances within the body should lead us to implement the precautionary principle. I should also like to point out that we should be particularly vigilant with regard to the substances used as substitutes for phthalates.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential, furthermore, to bring the labelling of toys and childcare articles containing phthalates which are likely to be put in children’s mouths into general use.</p>
<p class="contents">To avoid encouraging children to suck or chew on their toys, we should add a clause to prevent flavouring substances being added.</p>
<p class="contents">We should envisage revising the directive in order to bring it up to date in the light of developments in scientific knowledge. I am convinced that, given the information currently available, we should adopt an approach of the utmost caution. I supported the amendments tabled by the Socialist members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude by pointing out that, as far as the case of toy safety is concerned, the regulations regarding EC markings are too ambiguous and should be clarified as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For example, according to research undertaken in the United States by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, only rarely, if at all, among children is there a risk of exposure to harmful chemicals, as the quantities of phthalates in toys do not exceed that level which could be considered harmful. As the quantity of phthalates that might possibly get into a child’s system from toys is so small, the study group is not recommending that phthalates be banned.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself do not support the principle of ‘excessive force’ and an extensive ban that is not justifiable in the light of scientific facts. The toxic effects of phthalates are insignificant, and they do not irritate the mucous membrane or the skin. Although it was found in the 1980s that very large quantities of phthalates caused liver tumours in rats and mice, official agencies in Europe and the United States have not confirmed that phthalates present a risk of cancer in humans. In addition, I am sceptical about substituting phthalates with substances whose effects there is no research data on.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I support the idea of further research into those phthalates whose effects we cannot be absolutely sure about. In practice the problem is a minor one, however, as the European toy industry has, in the main, stopped using phthalates.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I did not take part in the previous legislature, which experienced the sell-off with regard to the notion of ‘French style’ public service, and I really do mean a wholesale sell-off similar to what happened to the transport, postal or even the telecommunications sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">In proposing to outline the situation as regards the transposition of the Directive of December 1996, on electricity, and of June 1998, on gas, the Mombaur report is patently expressing the ultraliberal philosophy of the Commission which, under cover of bringing about an internal energy market that is of the greatest advantage to the consumer, is demanding that these markets be opened one hundred percent to competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The process is always the same. The Commission puts forward a minimalist directive on the basis of the argument that liberalisation can only be profitable in a context of deregulation. Next the supporters of ‘ever more Europe’ transpose the directive and go even further (at the start of the year, 65% of the European market had been liberalised although the directive required only 30%!) and, finally, the Commission comes back a second time to ‘regularise’ the <span class="italic">de facto</span> situation in a much more restrictive fashion!</p>
<p class="contents">It is all the more unacceptable, given that there are still problems! What is the point of bringing about a single energy market when electricity and gas are not compatible (in terms of production and distribution, development of the market, or notions of public service)? How can one reasonably ask a service provider to ensure continuity of a public service, which is available on a fair basis, if this is not economically profitable? By the same token, how can we ask the former monopolies to now become totally competitive, when they still have major investments to pay off, the product of yesterday’s political choices? How can one reasonably demand ever lower prices in the sacred name of competition without challenging current requirements regarding nuclear safety? How can the national concept of public service be replaced by the Community concept of a general interest activity, which is far more restrictive?</p>
<p class="contents">I could carry on like this at great length. Let me point out that it took decades of republican tradition to enable the gradual build-up of our public services. Is it only going to take a transition period of four years to demolish them?</p>
<p class="contents">We were consequently unable to vote in favour of this report which expresses the will of the all-powerful Commission to go ever further and ever faster along the road of liberalisation. Liberalism may well be worthwhile, but only gradually, in small doses, without definitively ruling out state interventionism, lest we tomorrow suffer the financial consequences of giving it up! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These included the implementation of mechanisms for cooperation in overcoming problems that might potentially stall liberalisation, and negotiating access to the Community market with third countries. </p>
<p class="contents">As you will be aware, at the Santa Maria da Feira European Council, the Commission was asked to present a report by March 2001 on developments in the energy markets under the Lisbon strategy, so that we could assess progress in the liberalisation of the electricity market at the Stockholm Summit in March 2001. With the support of various governments, mechanisms were strengthened during the Portuguese Presidency with the aim of speeding up the process that was already underway with the December 1996 electricity directive. This directive stipulated the gradual opening up of this market by 2003, whereas the 1998 natural gas directive stipulates that the final phase of the opening up of this sector should be completed in 2008. This has serious consequences for Portugal, and specifically for the State Electricity Corporation, its employees and for Portuguese consumers. </p>
<p class="contents">This action sidelines both the issue of employees’ jobs in this sector and the interests of individual Member States, including the protection of a high-quality public service that serves the interests of consumers.

Basically, this means taking this strategically important industry away from the public sector and giving it to private-sector companies to run so that they can increase their profits. The state then merely regulates the private monopolies and ensures that guidelines issued by the European Union are complied with and it is the country's economy and its people that pay the price. The whole thrust of the report is geared away from serving the interests of the people – the interests of the man in the street – and growth in the national economy and towards serving the interests of large monopolies.</p>
<p class="contents">The report contains quite a few inaccuracies in its bid to present the liberalisation of the energy market in an attractive light. For example, it is not true that competition has reduced prices and created jobs in Great Britain. In the 4-5 years since electricity was privatised, prices have increased substantially, jobs have been lost and there is no longer a national, long-term electricity development programme. Elsewhere, the same report admits that jobs have been lost as a result of liberalisation, but considers that new jobs will be created in non-productive sectors, on the stock exchange, in advertising, in financial services and so forth</p>
<p class="contents">According to a study by the Public Power Corporation in Greece, the present staff of 32,000 will be cut to 20,000 and numerous services which are crucial to both the PPC and the economy of Greece, such as the production of new technologies, power station studies etc. will be abolished as a result of the liberalisation of the electricity market. Privatisation and liberalisation will push up prices, especially to consumers on the small Aegean islands, who pay a price per kilowatt/hour several times below cost.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also unacceptable that a public-sector corporation should be forced to allow private-sector companies to use its highly valuable transmission and distribution grid in the name of so-called competition. If the EU really wanted healthy competition, as it itself understands the term, it would force the private sector to create its own grid and generating stations and compete with public corporations, rather than force the public corporations to "offer" their grid to their competitors. This is simply a way of making it easier to shift assets to large companies. It is for precisely this reason that an attempt is being made to separate sectors, thereby preventing public-sector corporations from operating with a view to optimising vertically integrated activities and become competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">Generating electricity is not the same as producing a simple commodity. The energy sector is crucial to the economic development of a country and vital to its defence. Consequently, liberalising the energy markets jeopardises both the security of a country and its economic growth. This risk can clearly be discerned; as the report stresses, "In a frontier-free Europe, public utilities must operate in the single market. These firms are no longer strictly national; nor are their shareholders". </p>

Most countries are by now well under way with implementing extensive changes to the structures of their markets. Some countries have already implemented full liberalisation, and I am especially pleased that Denmark is in the vanguard. Denmark ought to make use of this favourable position and complete the liberalisation, as has already happened in Sweden, for example. It is therefore unfortunate that the Danish Government does not apparently have any plans for the time being to take the final step towards full liberalisation. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Mombauer’s excellent report hits home regarding several points. In particular, it should be emphasised how important it is to take account right now of the candidate States’ situation. Liberalisation of the energy markets in the countries of Eastern Europe will require special arrangements, and particular account must be taken of the environment. It is also important to draw attention to the fact that all electricity production should be transparent, and that special support for this must in no circumstances constitute a distortion of competition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Out of nigh on two hundred pages, the bank devotes just a single page to this subject, plus a tiny graph showing only the observed decline in the strength of the euro. The only explanation given is the difference in economic health and structures between Europe and the United States. </p>
<p class="contents">Although that is true, it is not a sufficient reason. It should be mentioned, first of all, that Europe is not a single country, with one people, one state, and one economic government and that, consequently, the euro is generally considered to be more vulnerable than a national currency. Furthermore, it was launched at too high a level at the outset, precisely because it was evaluated in relation to the existing rates for genuine national currencies, even though it has none of their intrinsic qualities.</p>
<p class="contents">How do European leaders intend to combat this depreciation? Firstly, indirectly, by means of policies to promote growth, an approach we can only endorse. At the same time, however, we see the European Central Bank raising interest rates, officially in order to combat a non-existent risk of inflation, but in reality in order to support the parity of the euro. It is a double-edged sword, because, if it is used at the wrong moment in the cycle, it may cancel out the growth that they are trying to stimulate by other means.</p>
<p class="contents">The other dubious solution is the headlong rush to strengthen the eleven members of the euro zone, which is supposed to lead gradually to a single European economic government. This will not change a great deal in the short term. In order to deal with the root of the matter, we should have to deny the nations of Europe any autonomy whatsoever, but this is patently impossible. In any event, a deadlock is being imposed on the system at the same time. As I explained at a recent symposium of the French National Assembly, the Charter of Fundamental Rights is intended to serve, among other things, to put an even greater stranglehold on the peoples of Europe in relation to Community law and hence also in relation to the single currency. This venture is helping to take us to a point where we lose our freedoms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur even goes so far as to criticise euro area countries that have reduced working hours since, as he sees it, this attitude contributes to “rendering labour markets more rigid instead of more flexible”. </p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur therefore puts himself in the position of defending the most refined form of capitalist neo-liberalism, at which we must protest most vehemently by voting against the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to make it clear to Mrs Peijs that I voted against this report. </p>
<p class="contents">This report reflects the concern felt by many leaders in the face of the public’s virtually total lack of interest in the implementation of the euro. We are, however, eighteen months away from a crucial deadline: the withdrawal of national currencies and the start of the physical circulation of euro notes and coins. So far, admittedly, progress has been relatively smooth for the euro, as the initial phase has principally involved technical experts, bankers, investment experts and stock market traders, who have all had adequate warning and who, moreover, are favourable to the idea on the whole. In such circumstances, it is not surprising that the euro has been easy to establish in this phase. </p>
<p class="contents">From now on, however, progress promises to be a lot less smooth, since the euro is about to come up against the citizens who, more often than not, have not yet fully understood what is going to be expected of them and who are going to find themselves cornered by decisions which have already been taken. In order to make up for this omission, the European Parliament is demanding that the information policy be stepped up, increasing appropriations by approximately 30%, to EUR 38 million per annum. In order to deal with the complexes of decision-makers who might be experiencing doubts, it adds, somewhat ingenuously, that, to quote the resolution voted on, “according to Article 37(b) of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999, information policy is an autonomous action which needs no legal basis”. </p>
<p class="contents">In such circumstances, indeed, why should we hold back? </p>
<p class="contents">Let me mention, incidentally, that we have always challenged the Commission’s option to make expenditure commitments without a legal basis, and we also challenged this interinstitutional agreement which the Council was weak enough to accept in contravention of the customary principles of proper management of public monies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Money is something in which it is necessary to have confidence. It is therefore important that the necessary information should be made available, and more information should of course be made available than we receive whenever countries at present introduce new designs on notes and coins. In our vote, we attached importance to information being provided in the individual countries by the Member States and to special agreements being entered into with the Member States concerning this issue. We agree that it is right for the Danish Government not to have entered into such an agreement.

The euro is preventing us from regulating the economy by adjusting interest rates and exchange rates. Furthermore, the so-called stability of the euro is financed by large cuts in unemployment benefits and in provisions for education, health care, housing and public transport. I am therefore of the opinion that the euro is only convenient for businesspeople, lavish holidaymakers and MEPs, but not for the majority of people. </p>
<p class="contents">Insofar as there was ever faith in the euro, this faith has been eroded extensively since the euro has dropped in value compared to the Danish Kroner, the Swedish Kronor, the British Pound and the currency of many countries outside the European Union.

<p class="contents">While the aim of familiarising Europeans with their future currency is a perfectly legitimate one, given that the decision to give up national currencies has already been taken (in conditions which I deplore), I am adamant in rejecting the propaganda this text puts forward in support of what Mr Karas terms “an essential, identity-building factor in the process of European integration”.</p>
<p class="contents">This text at least has the merit of exposing the outrageous untruth to which the supporters of a federal Europe resorted when they asked the French to ratify the Maastricht Treaty in 1992. At that time, the single currency was presented as a purely technical instrument to improve the operation of the economy in relation to the dollar and the yen, and as an operation that was perfectly neutral in terms of national sovereignty. How far we were then from seeing it as the key element in the process of integration!</p>
<p class="contents">This text will be an essential weapon, let us have no doubt, for all the people in Great Britain, Sweden and Denmark fighting to safeguard their national democracies. The euro, even though its supporters in these countries deny it today, is in fact the instrument of warfare of a federal Europe rejected by the overwhelming majority of its peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">So when the honourable Members reject the amendment tabled by William Abitbol, simply asking that this integrationist objective be clearly stated in the Commission’s communication programmes, they are contributing to a propaganda operation which their voters will most certainly punish them for.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution of the Karas report claims that women for some reason do not share the general enthusiasm which should have greeted the implementation of the euro. This smacks of the unpleasant tones of revolutionary propagandists of every age, seeing reactionary plots between the cloth and the women in every household rejecting the bright revolutionary future. It seems not to have occurred to anyone that it is perhaps because of their day-to-day experience of economics that women are more than reluctant about the transition to the euro. This is a despicable attitude, which reveals the dictatorship of the orthodox thinking which involves branding the men or women that oppose the euro, or who merely show some reluctance, as ignorant, illiterate or uneducated. This is where blind federalism takes us! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament in turn responds to the reports from both these bodies with two reports of its own that do not vary greatly from year to year.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a new feature, however, this year. The Thors report, supported in particular by the work of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and Mr Söderman’s request, is attempting to give the Ombudsman a general right of access to all the documents that need to be consulted when investigating the case for a complaint. We are opposed to this proposal, not because we reject supervision of the administration, but because such powers exceed the jurisdiction of an Ombudsman and approximate to those of a judge.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious, and we will certainly not deny it, that the frenzied Community administration and the ravages it causes cannot but add to the dissatisfaction of our fellow citizens and, hence, give rise to ever more appeals. The proliferation of competencies, the diversification of spheres of intervention and the legislative bulimia of the Commission and the European Parliament will no doubt do nothing to make this phenomenon any better.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ombudsman and his colleagues are not, however, the right people to meet these challenges. It is our political responsibility to cut such disputes off at source by giving our work precedence over issuing activist texts to justify our existence, with proper respect for the principle of subsidiarity which will prevent the European Union ruling on subjects that are none of its concern, and by ourselves, if necessary, making use of the authority we have in terms of supervising Community bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">Too often we have seen this House hiding behind expert committees because it refused to accept its own political responsibilities. If we have to allow the Ombudsman to monitor administrative problems, we must, for our part, learn how, before and after the fact, to control the insane Community machinery which is running amok. The excesses we must fight are often the product of the very nature of the current construction of Europe, something we must tackle at the very root. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must, unfortunately, observe, however, that this sector is examined only from the Liberal point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Atkins’s report on the European Commission proposal on the single European sky goes along with this rationale of liberalisation at any price. This was the cause of the French air traffic controllers’ strike last week. This was how they expressed their concerns about a purely commercial view of their profession. I understand their action, and I can certainly not say as much for Mr Atkins, whose report urges the Commission to encourage Member State governments that currently tolerate a situation where national labour disputes disrupt air traffic to tackle the problem as a matter of urgency”. It is pathetic!</p>
<p class="contents">No one can deny that the air traffic situation has deteriorated. Air traffic corridors and airports are at saturation point, delays are common, with one in three aircraft behind schedule, and the whole business is accompanied by a trail of environmental and noise pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish therefore to pay tribute to the determination of Mrs de Palacio, the Commissioner responsible for transport, in tackling the problem head-on in order to achieve the creation of a single European sky as soon as possible. I disagree entirely, however, with the means she puts forward and with the report’s proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">The report proposes to introduce competition among air traffic control centres, taking away the link between regulatory authorities and operators. The supervisory function would be carried out within separate companies whose capital would be open to air companies or private partners. Such liberalisation would serve to jeopardise air transport safety, and this, of course, is unacceptable and contradictory to the EC Treaty, according to which improvement of transport safety is one of the chief objectives of common transport policy.</p>
<p class="contents">France would certainly seem to be the odd man out in Europe, where, in most countries, air traffic control is administered by agencies, under state supervision but open to private capital. France wishes to keep these activities in the public sector. The principle of subsidiarity must be applied here, and each Member State must retain control of the organisation of air traffic control. This is essential, especially as the problem with delays is not caused by air traffic control, which is responsible for less than 25% of all delays!</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I support the proposals to strengthen the role of Eurocontrol, the pan-European agency responsible for the management of the airspace of European states, be they members of the European Union or not, in its capacity as regulatory authority. The report is wrong to underestimate this agency’s potential, but I have voted against a report which is completely unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We cannot, of course, deny that there is a need to improve the situation of regulation and air traffic control in Europe in the spirit of the single European sky. It is perfectly obvious that the aircraft in our airspace should not be on the receiving end of inconsistent, uncoordinated and complicated handling of their flight plans. And it is true that, although some progress has been made with Eurocontrol, the time has already come to move on to the next phase and to improve the system, bearing in mind one absolute imperative: safety. Regulation and air traffic control must not be subject to the law of competition, but rather to the concept of a general interest service. Moreover, the United States have never liberalised their own air traffic control, as this is managed by a single state agency. That just goes to show!</p>
<p class="contents">The Atkins report, however, is entirely concerned with the goal of opening the service up to competition, even though it is hard to see exactly how it could be a source of private profit or how the profits made could possibly reflect its performance!</p>
<p class="contents">The pretext for driving forward this liberalisation, furthermore, is delays in flights. This is certainly a situation that must be remedied, but, in order to be effective, we should really analyse the actual reasons for delays and the real solutions. We should first of all note that there have been positive developments this year as delays have substantially reduced in France. This indicates in the first place that we should make a distinction between temporary disruption (use of airspace by the military for Kosovo, the change in the control system, etc.) and structural problems.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also measure the problems due to the air companies or the limited European civil airspace with regard to the number of overflights. Air traffic control does not play a very significant part in causing delays, in the final analysis, and, in any case, improvement of the system involves improving the organisation of the coordination of the various Member State control systems, supporting Eurocontrol in this role.</p>
<p class="contents">This should be the priority and the guidelines on the single European sky. Unfortunately, the Commission does not appear to be on this track, and the Atkins report is even further off the mark. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reason for this is that governments compete with each other by building ever more and ever larger airports, and that apart from these airports, there is no need for creating infrastructure comparable to railways or motorways. As such, since time immemorial it has been common practice in this sector for different companies to compete with each other for the same route. Airfares bear out this freedom too. There is no link whatsoever between the distance to be covered and the fare. Where passengers are wanted, prices are low; where it is believed that there are more than enough passengers, prices are high.</p>
<p class="contents">There is little left to be liberalised in this sector. Despite this, there are people who expect further liberalisation to be a panacea. It is supposed to lead to cheaper flights, a wider range of flights and no more delays. According to the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, this consideration is very one-sided and only serves two interests: that of airline companies and that of the consumer, whose only focus is more and ever cheaper flights. </p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, a number of other aspects take priority over this, such as passenger safety, livelihoods and the working environment of the employees, environmental protection and the protection of the railway industry from price dumping and other forms of unfair competition. </p>
<p class="contents">There is little point in blaming the workers for everything that could cause irritation among passengers. These workers are sometimes obliged to strike out of self-preservation. Neither is this the fault of Eurocontrol, which has taken over a number of cross-border state responsibilities. Safety should not come second to the pursuit of profit by companies which aim to take over Eurocontrol’s market. The problem has far more to do with the excessive growth in aviation and price competition at the expense of long-distance rail transport. The current proposals do not address this problem. From this critical stance, we tabled 11 amendments. Since it has transpired that a majority within Parliament does not support our stance on this, we were unable to assent to the final version of the Atkins report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, it draws hasty and mistaken conclusions, which lean markedly towards the liberalisation of airspace and towards the future control of this airspace by the main air transport companies.</p>

I should like to show my solidarity with this strike and with the demands of the air traffic controllers’ unions.</p>
<p class="contents">The responses to the saturation of European airspace are pushing us into a headlong rush, with airports and airstrips proliferating, the working conditions of employees in the sector deteriorating and pollution on the increase.</p>
<p class="contents">We, on the other hand, are in favour of the harmonised development of transport on a European level, prioritising the fulfilment of real social needs, and opting for railways as the best solution for most needs, particularly for distances of less than 500 kilometres.</p>
<p class="contents">Liberalising air traffic control will not solve the problem of delays, since only 20 to 30% of delays can be attributable to air traffic control.</p>
<p class="contents">It is known that today the military have seized, in France for example, 80% of the available airspace. Why has this never been challenged?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is using the delays as an excuse to move towards a split between a European regulatory office and the establishment of a privatised internal market for the provision of air traffic services.</p>
<p class="contents">Such measures, undertaken under pressure from lobbying by air companies, can be implemented only to the detriment of safety, especially given that the companies themselves will be able to put themselves forward to provide such services.</p>

<p class="contents">The European Parliament's proposal contains numerous positive proposals which are negated by its very inability to set out the problem of negative developments in labour and labour relations as a whole. Because no attention is given to the main trend towards restructuring labour relations and reducing and abolishing the fundamental rights acquired by workers or framework labour conditions such as minimal working times and conditions, temporary and part-time employment and cuts in social security and protection, the resultant framework is completely negative and non-conducive to the application of any policy to protect working women during and after pregnancy.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish to point out and highlight the risks inherent in a strict prohibition on dismissal, especially under the present, extended regime of generalised atypical employment contracts and the indirect exclusion of pregnant women from jobs, a regime in which we need not just to maintain and consolidate but to increase maternity leave, define the maternity allowance more clearly and apply strict and more substantive controls on night work by pregnant and breastfeeding working women.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only must we strengthen the legal framework protecting the health and safety of pregnant women and rectify omissions and clarify ambiguities – the "Trojan horses" used to bypass and infringe legislation –, we also need to deal with the lack of political will on the part of national governments to apply the directive properly, a lack which is sorely in evidence from the sluggish state of control mechanisms in the Member States during the previous period. A typical example is Greece, where there are no controls on employers' obligation to carry out an integrated written assessment of occupational hazards in the workplace, including a specific assessment of the hazards to pregnant and breastfeeding women.</p>
<p class="contents">Experience has demonstrated that reducing employability and "adaptability" to guideline Community priorities on employment issues renders any protection basically non-existent and cancels any individual arrangements in practice. The problem is: what guidelines are being issued, what sort of employment policy is being applied? And unfortunately, we have confirmation that the EU wants to make more drastic cuts to allowances and social insurance, to amend and downgrade provisions on dismissal and to reduce and abolish provisions to protect working conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not delude ourselves as to the nature of employment policy and the social policy of the EU in general or the interests which it represents, which is why, despite sharing the EU's positive position on the protection of working women, we believe this is nothing more than yet another report of ideas and good intentions. We therefore call on working women and men to continue their social fight for an overall change of policy and for a policy which centres on man and respect for his needs and dignity. A fight geared primarily to the implementation of the principle of full and stable employment, with full, consolidated social rights for everyone. Only such a framework will safeguard the rights of the particularly sensitive category of pregnant women and the rights and respect for life as something other than the raw material of profit, subject to the laws of costs, competition and inexorable market forces. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A strict European framework must be established to protect pregnant women against any form of discrimination during recruitment, regarding issues of their working conditions, access to maternity leave or its duration: 20 weeks including 8 mandatory weeks after the birth. Women must be protected against any wrongful dismissal and their former wage must be guaranteed. Finally, night work must be prohibited for both men and women in sectors where it is not absolutely essential, rather than seeking to modify the conditions for pregnant women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
