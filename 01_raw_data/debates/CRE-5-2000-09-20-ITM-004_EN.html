<p class="contents">Recent times have been marked by the fact that oil prices have been rising for the last 18 months, and the European public is feeling the full effect. Clearly, the people who will suffer most as a result of this rise will be the least-favoured social groups and also certain specific sectors which are particularly affected.</p>
<p class="contents">At the beginning of 1999, the price of a barrel of crude oil stood at around 10 dollars, whereas today it stands at around 33 to 35 dollars. This is the highest level since the Gulf war, and is a level which most experts believed could only happen in cases of geopolitical crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason for this rise is very clear: the restriction on production on the part of the OPEC countries which coincides with a world economic recovery and the resulting increase in demand. The impact of this rise has been particularly great in the European Union and especially in the euro zone, owing to the euro’s value against the dollar.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot ignore the consequences of this rise on Europe’s economic development. In specific terms, we estimate that, at the moment, this accounts for 1% of our inflation and a reduction of around 0.3% of our growth. Some specific professional sectors – farming, fishing and transport – are in situations which are at times frankly difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">However, both the producing countries and the consumer countries share a common interest, that of stability and the predictability of prices. We would all benefit from prices being established in a market of free competition and not, as is happening now, in accordance with a monopolistic situation in a market which to be honest is less than transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the European Union’s level of dependency currently stands at around 50%. However, unless we introduce new measures, we will reach more or less 70% by 2020. In the specific case of oil, our dependency on external sources stands at between 85% and 90%. This must clearly lead us to a debate on the increase in our energy dependency on external sources and, therefore, on our vulnerability in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">We must grasp our responsibility and our destiny with both hands. Although the European Union’s competence in the field of energy is limited, we must not remain passive in the face of such a situation and allow it to get worse, but rather we must find answers. That is why ensuring a sufficient level of independence and, above all, of availability in the European Union’s energy supplies, must be a priority policy and furthermore a policy on a Community scale.</p>
<p class="contents">Little more than a year ago, when I first came into contact with this House as future Commissioner with responsibility for energy, I indicated very clearly that, from the Commission’s point of view, there were two crucial elements which needed to be considered in the coming years. On the one hand, the need to strategically promote dialogue on energy policy in international fora, and especially with the large producing and consumer countries, and, on the other, the need to adapt our priorities so that we can better focus our changes in the face of adverse energy situations such as the current one.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission intends to fulfil these fundamental objectives and has been working on them for several months. The Commission has practically finished the preparation of a Green Paper on the security of supply and on the Kyoto commitments, that is to say, the conditions for emissions in the energy sector. This Green Paper will be adopted before the end of the year. I hope it will serve as a starting point for a broad debate amongst the interested parties to examine the role and place of each of our energy sources over the next twenty or thirty years. Furthermore, we must promote international dialogue in the short term and step up this dialogue with the producing countries in order to convince them of our common interest in price stability – an issue which they themselves have raised – putting forward the objective of a price band.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we have to take account of the geopolitical context in which we are moving, especially of the peace process in the Middle East and the complex political situation in the whole area.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must send a clear and forceful message to all the OPEC countries and highlight the need for appropriate measures to be taken in order to fulfil what they have indicated to be their objective, that is to say, for oil prices to return to a reasonable band. We must say that we are the main net importer and the second largest consumer of oil in the world. The European Union therefore has the means and reasons justifying its voice to be heard but perhaps political means are not sufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as this dialogue with OPEC, however, we must not forget that we need to maintain and strengthen our strategic relations with Russia and we should consider the necessary means to modernise production and distribution conditions in that country which is, let us not forget, the third largest producer of oil in the world and, if we take account of gas, their position is absolutely vital.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must maintain a united front and speak with one voice. Disparate initiatives by individual Member States will always be incomplete and, what is more, less productive than those on which we stand united.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the fiscal aspect, an issue that has been much discussed in recent times, the Commission understands the concerns of the professional sectors most affected by the sudden increase in oil prices. In this respect we encourage the Member States to enter into and maintain social dialogue with all the interested parties in order to find solutions which are suitable and conform to Community law. One of the lessons we can learn from the blockades which have paralysed economic activity in various States, is the need to raise the level of coordination between Member States and, of course, with the support of the Commission. To this end, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in a few minutes I will leave this meeting to depart for Luxembourg, where a special Council of Transport Ministers is taking place.</p>
<p class="contents">For both environmental and economic reasons, Member States must not give in to pressure and change their overall medium-term policy on oil. A reduction in taxation or subsidies over an extended period would simply amount to a transfer of the fiscal income towards the OPEC countries and would send them an inappropriate message.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the very difficult situation we are in at the moment probably requires, in the short term, the adoption of aid measures by the competent public authorities. In fact, there are already some agreements on the table. I must point out though that these measures must be purely transitional and in all cases must conform to competition rules and not violate the internal rules of the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">We must seek consensus on the approach to fuel taxation and prevent the kind of cacophony which results from the actions and statements of the different States of the Union. For example, what is the point of talking about ecological taxes on a European scale if we cannot quickly harmonise the rates of the special taxes and VAT within the Union?</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, in this context I must say that a reduction in the special taxes in favour of road transport can only be considered as a very short-term measure, lasting no more than a few months. In no event can it be extended, since that would run directly counter to the objectives to promote other types of alternative transport, such as the railways, it would go against our Kyoto objectives and would undoubtedly contradict what have been our guiding principles in European Union transport policy until now.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is extremely concerned about the serious attacks on free movement which have taken place recently on various occasions. We believe, and I wish to say this once again, that no one social category should be allowed to hold the whole of society to ransom.</p>
<p class="contents">I was talking about aid, however, and I wish to say that we must break up and end anti-competitive practices and these practices are clearly taking place in the fuel sector. Why should there be such a considerable difference in the prices – before tax – of oil derivatives as there is at the moment in the European Union, in some cases just across the border in the next country? The Commission intends to continue the contacts established with Member States in order to detect any practices which contravene competition rules. Any agreements between companies or abuses of dominant positions must be severely penalised. We will also have to examine the question of competition between intermodal sectors in order to find solutions on a European scale. But we must not fool ourselves, ladies and gentlemen. We are talking about short-term actions which may alleviate the current crisis, but in no way change the undeniable fact that our economy is vulnerable to energy fluctuations. It is true that the economy is less vulnerable than it was 25 years ago, but at the end of the day it is still vulnerable. Oil consumption in the European Union stands at 12 million barrels per day and is expected to reach just over 13 million in 2020. It is probable that the barrel price, in normal economic circumstances, will not in the long term return to below 20 dollars – and, of course, in no event to what it was 18 months ago, that is to say, 10 dollars.</p>
<p class="contents">We must tackle this dependency and this situation through two fundamental fields of action: diversifying our sources and saving energy. The discussion of diversification requires a long-term debate. The future Green Paper on supply will contribute to it. I wish to state very clearly that, when talking about diversification of energy sources, sustainable energy has a clear and decisive contribution to make for the future, but at the moment we cannot ignore any type of energy.</p>
<p class="contents">The management of demand and energy saving is the other area on which we must focus for the long term. With regard to oil, we are today 50% more efficient that 25 years ago, but it must be said that the transport sector still has to make a special effort in this area. More than 90% of the increase in oil consumption in the Union from now until 2020 will be absorbed in principle by the transport sector. That is why we need a White Paper on transport policy which seeks to readjust modes of transport, to improve the Trans-European Networks, to eliminate points of congestion, to promote the railways, river transport, short haul sea shipping, to promote effective and less polluting urban transport, with the rationalisation of the use of the traditional car and the promotion of innovative research projects into clean fuels, and to improve the awareness and education of drivers.</p>
<p class="contents">Measures must also be adopted for construction and savings in this sector, which is one of the fields that consumes most energy, not to mention the promotion of competition in the gas sector and the emergence of gas as a competitor and alternative to oil.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that we will only overcome the current crisis through coherent strategies which are well coordinated and multi-faceted. Unfortunately, we do not have access to a panacea to resolve this situation in the short term, but luckily this current crisis has shown us the only way to overcome it: to promote competition in our markets, consolidate our common presence at an international level, coordinate our actions, adapt our priorities to the new energy objectives and act together in the fiscal field. In the difficult situation we find ourselves in, the citizens expect us to turn these objectives into tangible realities, thinking not only of the immediate future but also of the medium and long term.</p>

We must ask ourselves whether it is necessary to get caught up in a crisis before we start to speak about better strategies. Nothing would now be easier than calling on all Member States of the Union to substantially decrease taxation on oil products up until the price of a barrel of crude hopefully returns to the 22 – 25 US dollar mark, or thereabouts. And it would be just as easy now for the Member States and their Ministers of Finance to declare that taxes should not be touched at all. The reason for this is the difficulty of replacing tax revenue in the short term, and the long-term consumption-curbing effect of taxes whereby we aim to have an impact on the future state of our environment.</p>
<p class="contents">However, something has to be done. People have had enough, and above all the livelihood of people in certain occupations is directly and badly endangered, as the Commissioner said, to mention just the fishermen, farmers and people who drive for a living. In the longer term, fuel prices will bump up inflation still further and threaten the whole EU area with an economic setback. The Member States now have to find a common approach in both the short and the long term. Measures taken separately by individual countries under pressure from the protests will only make the situation more problematic and will distort competition. The responsibility for action clearly lies with national governments. Short-term measures will be the hardest. Naturally it is essential to have intensive negotiations with the OPEC countries to increase oil production, if that is possible in general, thus easing the situation by ensuring steady supplies. It will be difficult to get a quick result, however. This means that very precise measures with regard to taxes on diesel and heating oil, for example, within the realms of possibility, will be a good solution, if they are implemented generally.</p>
<p class="contents">The reasons for the crisis can be found, not just in problems with supply, but also possibly in the refinery chain structure, the nature of the fuel market, futures market practices, and storage policies in certain countries and areas. It is claimed that the refinery chain is in the hands of so few that a cartel-like situation has developed in the market. I myself am not claiming that this is the case, but we need to look into the situation. One question is this: is the Union in a position to negotiate strategies for vital stocks of oil both within its own territory and with the United States, as, apparently, the decline in US stocks and now their need for replenishment are pushing up the spot price of oil even further. The Commissioner has already mentioned the dilapidated state of production machinery in Russia, a large oil producer. Is it not time – the question is obviously mainly directed at Russia, but it is for us to consider also – that we embarked on measures that would persuade people to invest in Russian oil production? In the long term, as the former Saudi Oil Minister, Sheikh Yamani, suggested, the permanently high price of oil will lead to other forms of energy. With a glint in his eye, he said that the Stone Age did not end because people ran out of stones. What is essential now, however, is the ability on the part of the countries of the Union to react in the short term. Is it actually so that a reduction in the relatively same rate of tax on liquid fuel until the middle of next year by national governments throughout the Union is impossible?</p>

Furthermore, this is a policy which requires much perseverance as well as investment and resources, because the problem, in relation to energy, is that ‘we only remember <span class="italic">Santa Bárbara</span> when it thunders’, that is to say, in normal conditions, as Mrs de Palacio has pointed out, consumption tends to increase, and in a society where the car is king, this means a trend towards greater dependency.</p>
<p class="contents">In the medium and long term, I believe that the course of action described by the Commissioner, in line with what the Commission had proposed, should be maintained, monitored and strengthened, taking advantage of the development of sustainable energy, reducing dependency on oil, managing, for example, to break up the compartmentalisation of certain national markets and I am thinking, for instance, of the development of the railways as a complement and an alternative to the development of road transport.</p>
<p class="contents">None of this, however, is going to resolve the current situation. That is to say, we need a virtuous policy, but at the same time we are now facing a particularly complex situation in that there are a series of professions who are in a very difficult position and which, as forms of Community-scale protests are developing in Europe, has lead to blockades and disorder and disparate reactions from our governments.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like very briefly to point out that, in recent times, thanks to more rigorous budgetary management, there has been talk of lightening the tax burden. The people do not therefore understand why this cannot extend to oil products. We must be able to understand this reaction and, at the same time, we must explain to our citizens the reasons for our decisions. It is true that compensatory measures are required. It is very important that we manage to improve the situation of transparency as well as anti-monopoly measures, which are the responsibility of the Commission, because somebody is benefiting: OPEC has increased the price, but does not take more than 5 or 6 dollars per barrel. Above all, we must try to see to it that our governments react jointly and that, finally, we create a European energy policy that is in keeping with the common economic and social area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Energy is not cheap. It is a scarce commodity. We seem to have forgotten that, once upon a time, we paid as little as USD 10 for a barrel of oil. We did not ask ourselves the questions which we probably should have asked and which we are asking ourselves today. Commissioner, you also mentioned that we have seen prices rise for the past eighteen months. I wonder why the European experts and powers that be did not meet sooner to establish, when prices first started to rise, how things would develop, how this could be prevented from continuing and how we could avoid getting to the point where we are today.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you also stated that we should respond as a united front but we now see that every country has caught “the French flu”. There is a lack of internal coherence, both in the reactions to the protests – protests which I can often understand very well – and in defending the currency, as well as a lack of external coherence in our attitude to OPEC. We have to admit that a price of USD 10 per barrel of oil is just as abnormal as one of USD 35 and you are well aware that, while a price of USD 10 may be attractive to ourselves, it is not viable globally. These are facts which we all seem to have forgotten for the time being. I believe we ought not to do this in future.</p>
<p class="contents">You have listed the main strands in your communication which you published in the first week of September. They are sound, and cover transport policy, energy policy and environmental policy. I hope that, this evening in Luxembourg, you will manage to persuade people to adopt the same line because we need to emerge from this crisis now. We need to ensure that the next crisis is not as deep and can be held off for longer than we might anticipate. At any rate, initiatives should be tabled at European level and a minimum level of cooperation guaranteed in order to help the most needy, as you stated yourself. This is why I believe that a cut in the general tax burden, as proposed by my party in Belgium, is to be preferred to a specific tax burden on fuel. What we must not do, whatever happens, is to say to people that energy could become cheap, as this would be the wrong message altogether. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the third one, and since 1979 energy policy has been little more than a series of failures. A lot has been said about switching to a sustainable energy policy, but precious little has been done about it. I welcome the ideas that have been put forward here today by the Commissioner. Now transport ministers really do have the opportunity to make a definite U-turn in energy policy in the direction of a sustainable energy economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Road transport has increased from a 50% share of all transport in 1980 to an 85% share in 2000. If we were now to reduce fuel taxation generally, this would be very much like lowering the price of heroine on the drugs market. The end result would surely be that there would be more drug addicts than before and a greater crisis. We should not be making these kinds of mistakes now.</p>
<p class="contents">Nuclear power is not an alternative either in this situation, as only 10% of electricity is produced using oil, and, besides, all the development work going on with regard to new vehicles, for example, is based on the idea that the cars of the future are perhaps more likely to run on hydrogen, but certainly not on nuclear energy. Our group has today proposed an integrated programme such as this to serve as the European Union’s new energy policy programme. We want to start implementing this also with regard to the budget, and we are proposing a new budget policy called ”New Energy Sources”. We want to promote energy saving, for example, and better construction technology for homes and buildings. We also want the European Union to have powers to manage the new energy policy. We require the issue of energy to be included in the Treaty and have its own chapter there, and we want to stress how important it is to rid ourselves of the requirement of unanimity with regard to taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">For almost ten years, we have been trying to establish a common energy tax in the European Union. Commission Members have come and gone, but this problem has always remained unsolved. In the short term we have to help the direct victims of this oil crisis, but it has to be done with the proper care and focus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first of these problems concerns our relations with the South, in the event the producer countries. Did Europe worry, at the beginning of last year, about the disastrous consequences for the economies and populations of a number of these countries when the price of a barrel of oil fell to less than USD 10? This was hailed as good news when, in fact, the situation was just as worrying as an increase in the price to USD 34. We need to establish a genuine long-term partnership between these countries and ourselves. And then, all the other root causes of the current situation need to be looked at: cases of speculation, the inadequate stocks in the United States and the fall in the value of the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem revealed, in my view, by this crisis is the lack of coherence between our strategy choices within the Union. The talk nowadays is of giving priority to rail over road transport and going in for piggybacking. That is basic, a real social choice and an ecologically responsible act in the strongest sense of the term. But for how long has exactly the opposite strategy been adopted, with road transport being pushed hard at the expense of rail? Europe is so little prepared for this development that, today, you still have to change trains between France and Italy because the value of electrical current supply in the two countries are incompatible.</p>
<p class="contents">The third fundamental problem illustrated spectacularly by this crisis is the extreme difficulty many European leaders have in making an accurate assessment of grass-root demands. They have not seen, or have not wanted to see, the serious problems which this rise in fuel costs presented for people obliged to use their cars or dependent upon domestic fuel oil. Our fellow citizens are not prepared to shoulder the burden of this economic crisis, and they are protesting at the way in which countries have indulged the oil companies, even though the latter have been quite shameless in the profits they have been making. More and more pressure is going to be exerted in favour of a reduction in fuel tax and an appropriate levy on oil companies’ profits.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority of my group is of the view that the Fifteen ought to take radical environmental measures, effectively promoting rail transport while responding, in the present context, to this legitimate social expectation. In so doing, they would also do Europe what I think is a currently much needed service. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The prime cause is the increase in production prices due to the oligopoly carefully organised by the oil-producing countries. The short supply of oil has been exacerbated by the sanctions against Iraq, the unjust and immoral continuation of which may be in the interests of the American oil companies but is contrary to the interests of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The second cause is the depreciation of the euro and, therefore, of all the participating European currencies. It was valued at USD 1.18 when it was launched. It is now valued at only USD 0.85. We were promised a strong currency. It was a lie, and now we are having to foot a much higher bill.</p>
<p class="contents">The third cause is the excessive, even insane, taxation practised by the Member States, and this proto-socialist policy has been continued, if not actually initiated, by conservative governments. It is maintained under pressure from green organisations which are hostile to the motor car because it represents freedom for the individual. It is taxation of this kind which multiplies the increase in farm gate prices by a factor of 3, 4 or 5.</p>
<p class="contents">The alignment of our foreign policy with that of the United States, the depreciation of the euro as a currency and the increase in taxation due to pressure from green campaigners are the three causes of the increase, which we deplore but for which our institutions bear a very heavy responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You really would have thought you were back in 1973 after the first oil crisis. And that is not counting the plummeting euro and the explosion in the price of a barrel of crude oil, factors not anticipated in the past oracular pronouncements by self-styled experts on Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Largely predictable though it was, this crisis is as much the responsibility of the oil producers as of government. Many varied solutions have been put forward, for the situations and the reasons for them are different from one country to another. Many of these solutions are perfectly rational and obvious and, occasionally, ideological such as restrictions on vehicles or the eco-tax but, as you reminded us, none of these is a panacea that will in itself sort out the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be remembered that what chiefly distinguishes the fuel question is its relation to currency and taxation issues and the way it goes on to affect urban and rural planning. For, if this crisis affects people in their working lives, it also affects people in their private lives, especially in rural areas where the car is still too often the main means of transport and communication and the one to which people resort. It is a situation resulting from the gradual withdrawal of public services which has not been offset by private operators, who are much too concerned with maximising their profits.</p>
<p class="contents">Strategies relating to taxation, the currency and urban and rural planning are matters for each Member State and each Member State alone, in accordance with the sacrosanct principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, we want to see lower fuel tax because, at present, it is too much of a burden on the people of Europe, in both their private and working lives. However, there are additional strategies open to our Member States. The European Union must leave the latter free to exercise their sovereignty in making judicious strategy choices when it comes to energy savings, supplementary forms of renewable energy, the redistribution of freight to the railways and rivers and the development of public transport and the opening up of rural areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They were political crises of man-made origin, and they came about in 1973 and 1979 with the fall of the Shah regime. For fifteen years now there have clear indications and studies – for example, Global 2000, the report compiled for Jimmy Carter – to the effect that there would be a real shortage in raw materials by the turn of the century. In other words, the third oil crisis we are experiencing now, is here to stay.</p>
<p class="contents">Whether the price drops again in the short term is of no consequence because there will be a steady upward trend in the long term. It even says in Colin Campbell’s study – anyone interested in having a copy can get one from me – that there will be a shortage of raw materials, i.e. oil, in the early years of the 21st century, the reason being that the production curve has passed its peak. I therefore believe that even demonstrations are onto a loser, because you can only squeeze so much juice from a lemon. We will still have oil, but it will not come cheap. In other words, the price of oil will rise to between USD 40 and 60 in the future. There are enough studies to this effect. Even if they should prove to be wrong, now is the time to consider and analyse them. Nor is it an OPEC crisis, because only 40% of the oil produced comes from OPEC countries; the remaining 60% comes from non-OPEC countries. If this was just a man-made crisis, the other oil producers could redress the balance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not as much of a crisis as the 1970s. It is as much a taxpayer’s crisis as an energy crisis. It is not acceptable for governments to put the blame on OPEC, on oil companies, on peaceful protesters, on other political parties, or even on the European Union for protests about levels of taxation that are too high.</p>
<p class="contents">In the UK, tax takes 75% or three-quarters of the price of a litre of petrol or diesel and that is the responsibility of the government, no one else. Energy supply is more elastic than demand. We learned this in the 1970s, when higher prices brought more oil fields into production yet did not reduce consumption in the transport sector.</p>
<p class="contents">High taxation raises revenue, but fails to cut consumption. Nevertheless, the price increases and the tax protests are timely, to remind us both about our dependence in Europe on imported energy and about the difficulties we face in achieving environmental objectives such as CO2 emission reduction.</p>
<p class="contents">If taxation of energy is to be used for pursuing environmental aids, then the policy has to be transparent and consistent so as to carry public opinion with us. Where policies are perceived as unfair and inconsistent, as in the UK, then protests will enjoy widespread popular support. To put fuel taxes up so much as to make industry uncompetitive while reducing taxes on domestic household energy consumption, is crazy politics and bad economics.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not be beguiled by arguments about harmonising taxation, because harmonised taxes under socialists have only one way to go and that is up. That is not what the taxpayers and consumers of Europe want. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Americans, like ourselves, are suffering an explosion in farm gate prices. Since barrels of oil are paid for in dollars, the increase has a greater impact upon countries whose currencies have lost ground against the dollar. Among these currencies are the euro, the Danish krone, the British pound and a lot of other currencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs de Palacio has just emphasised that Europe is the world’s biggest oil importer. Given this status, it is not right that it should continue to pay for its imports in dollars. The Socialists are asking the Commission to encourage European oil importers to sign contracts in euros. An initiative of that kind has a chance of succeeding. Producers know that the dollar will be certain to lose value against the euro. For producers, contracts made out in euros could become an insurance against an inevitable economic downturn in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">A word about monetary policy. The ECB has recently justified keeping tight control of its key interest rates by referring to the inflationary pressure created by the increase in oil prices and in rates of exchange. According to the ECB, monetary policy cannot remedy this situation in the short term. Economic policy cannot offer a solution to the rise in oil prices either, and must, in addition, be subject to a rise in the cost of capital. The ECB says that imported inflation is also a form of inflation to be combated.</p>
<p class="contents">I would conclude by saying that the price of oil will be brought down neither by increasing the cost of investments nor by reducing the purchasing power of the people of Europe. Rather than soothing inflationary fever, is not the ECB’s treatment in danger of damaging the health of the European economy? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Such prices are unacceptable. I believe we must temporarily reduce the various tax burdens to an economically and socially sustainable level. Bear in mind that we are not the ones that set the tax rates. As a European Union, we have set minimum rates of taxation for motor vehicle and mineral oil. It is the Member States that have the room for manoeuvre. They have pushed it to the limit, and now we are facing this crisis of high oil prices, they must drop these prices and coordinate them. We cannot have a situation where, rightly or wrongly, one government caves in but another does not, and where companies in one country have distortions in competition to contend with that companies from another country do not. They get the same prices in the same market but their costs are different. This is an intolerable state of affairs for the transport sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam Vice-President, I would suggest that you go to Luxembourg and tell the Transport Ministers, firstly that we need concerted action, and secondly, that we need to see a reduction in costs for the transport sector. Thirdly, we do not want the Transport Ministers to make empty promises that will be scotched by the Finance Ministers in two weeks’ time. The decisions reached by the 15 Member States this evening, or in the course of the next few days, must be upheld. They must translate into action. Some Ministers bemoan the fate of the transport sector, whilst others refuse to reduce or amend taxes. Such two-faced behaviour is unsupportable!</p>

British Conservatives still are but it is time to wake up. We have two choices. One is a bad choice and that is to adopt a short-term fix and cut taxes, abdicate our government responsibilities. We cannot avoid the other choice and the real question which is: How do we use a finite resource when demand is increasing and we have environmental promises? The rational choice is to stop the profligate use of petrol and diesel and to change the behaviour of the public and of those involved in transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us lower and enforce speed limits. We must lower our dependency on imported petroleum products. We must adopt alternative fuels – biodiesel, fuel cells, gas and electric cars. Let us realign the Fifth Frame Work Programme in its mid-term towards much more research into and development of those alternatives. Let us put more money in the budget, change the decision on programmes like SAVE and Altener. We do not need a new budget heading. These heading exist. Let us put more money in them. Let us negotiate – but as the European Union – because stability is in the interests not only of oil – importing countries but also of oil – exporting countries.</p>

Yes, we must increase the financial support, and yes, we oppose cartels and monopolies. That is all quite true. But reducing taxation and other things – which, funnily enough, is what certain Members to my left have suggested – is no way to solve the problem. That would lead nowhere. OPEC and the oil producing countries will immediately move in to close this gap. They have a political and economic hold over us. What chance do we stand against this?</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling from Mr Jarzembowski)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Have we reduced our consumption? No. Mr Jarzembowski, who has just spoken – he can shout loudly, and so can I as it happens – says that there must be a paradigm shift where traffic is concerned. There is more road transport than there was ten years ago. It is high time this was changed. We need a paradigm shift where transport is concerned. There needs to be more transport via rail and water – let us make it happen. We need to be less dependent. Let us pursue a common energy policy, for example. You, Mrs Palacio, and we MEPs, should call for a common energy policy to be incorporated into the Treaty. We are still lacking such a policy. So who is guilty of blocking it to date?</p>
<p class="contents">For example, what we need to do, Mrs Palacio, is to get rid of the link between gas and oil prices. You could do that in tandem with the Commission. Why are gas prices linked to oil prices? There is no reason why they should be. You are the obvious person to bring this about. We can do all of these things. There are many things we can do, which the Member States have failed to do so far. We can use these opportunities. Unfortunately, I am speaking too fast for the interpreter, and I apologise for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Right now, there must be no falling out between groups on the right, and those on the left or in the centre, above or below. The OPEC States will watch from the sidelines, smile indulgently, and put the prices up.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling from Mr Jarzembowski)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We must show a united front, and the same goes for the Ministers meeting in the Transport Council – and you, Mr Jarzembowski, would do well to shout less loudly and at last get round to doing something in your transport committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ten dollars per barrel of oil was far too low a price and, furthermore, it had negative effects on our economies, although this seems more complicated to explain. On the other hand, 35 dollars is too high a price for us to bear. That is why we have to try immediately to persuade OPEC to increase production in order to lower the tension over prices, so that we can really fulfil that “target band” and make the markets more stable.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not once again – as the spokesman of the Socialist Group said a moment ago – forget the problem and ‘only remember <span class="italic">Santa Bárbara</span> when it thunders’, but we should maintain our action over time. In the Directorate-General for Energy we have been working since November on the medium-term strategy for energy, and I therefore hope that we will be able to present a quality document in the coming weeks. We are seeking a medium-term view, which is combined with a review of the Union’s transport policy because it is a fact that energy is a crucial component in transport. Much of our energy is destined for this specific sector in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">This means coordinating the energy policy. I would like us to try to communitise this, but, in the mean time, we must coordinate the energy policy of the Member States. It is also necessary to continue making progress on transport policies and we must avoid, as a result of a crisis such as this, suddenly changing our transport policy and energy policy which has been established over recent years. We must be coherent. We must not therefore use the method of lowering taxes as a solution to this circumstantial rise in oil prices.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps, in a very limited way, some countries may resort to that method, above all because there may be an exception in the directive on hydrocarbons. We could probably consider certain proposals such as postponing the ecotax, but what we cannot do is propose one thing and then its complete opposite. I repeat that we must have a minimum degree of internal coherence in our policies. Energy and transport policies are medium- and long-term policies, which cannot be modified under pressure from very specific circumstances, which I am sure are going to change within a year and a half or two years although, no doubt, we will not return to prices of 10 dollars per barrel. However, they are going to change simply for market reasons, even if OPEC does nothing. Furthermore, OPEC is prepared to act and I hope that it does so and does so well.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, these long-term measures cannot absolve us of our current responsibilities, responsibilities, which we all share, which range from safeguarding the freedom of movement to complying with Community rules. But it is also the responsibility of the governments to take measures to alleviate the difficulties and provide solutions for the sectors that are most affected. We are talking specifically of the transport sector and now, in the Council of Transport Ministers, I hope we will reach some agreements. There are also problems in the fishing and agricultural sectors, without forgetting that there is another whole series of sectors affected by these difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">We must work on issues such as energy saving, renewable energies, research into biofuels and the use of biomass. Before the end of the year we will produce a regulation on buildings which this House can deal with.</p>
