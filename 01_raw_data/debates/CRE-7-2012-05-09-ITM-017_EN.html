We here in Parliament are by no means exceptional; our citizens are also permanently mobile and on the move in Europe. Our young people, in particular, are constantly online nowadays.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am particularly pleased that tomorrow, we will be able to adopt the Roaming III Regulation, as it is known, which will enter into force on 1 July 2012. In other words, just in time for the holiday season, we will be able to give our citizens the benefit of lower tariffs when they use smartphones in Europe. The future belongs to mobile devices. These days, everyone is mobile 24 hours a day. In recent years, there has been a huge increase in data transfer via smartphones in particular, and we will see further huge increases in the years ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">In contrast, the costs of using a mobile phone abroad are still extremely high; indeed, they have hardly come down at all. That is unacceptable. The charges must reflect reality. We cannot allow people using smartphones at home or in another European country to be charged many times what they have to pay at home for making calls, sending or receiving texts or downloading data. I can tell you that I am with a German provider, and at the beginning of this week, my provider informed me that I will have to pay EUR 8.20 if I download one megabyte of data here in Brussels. That is a complete rip-off, and we cannot allow it to continue.</p>
<p class="contents">What, then, will the new Roaming Regulation do? Its main aim is reduced charges for all our citizens. We hope to achieve this by creating greater competition in the roaming market in future. We are introducing maximum charges, and one particularly new element is a maximum retail charge for data transfer. The first maximum retail charge will take effect on 1 July 2012. In future, one megabyte will cost no more than EUR 0.70. The charges will be lowered further from 1 July 2013, when a maximum retail charge of EUR 0.45 per megabyte will come into force. The third price reduction will take effect on 1 July 2014, when the maximum charge will become EUR 0.20 per megabyte. We had to fight hard for these maximum retail charges in tough negotiations with the Council. I would like to extend my great thanks to my shadow rapporteurs and, in particular, to the rapporteur for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, Robert Goebbels. Had we not fought so hard for better charges, then we would not be today where we hope to be after 1 July.</p>
<p class="contents">The market will also be opened up to new providers without a network of their own, in what is known as an open access solution. Moreover, from 1 July 2014, consumers will be able to choose roaming services from providers other than their national provider. This proposed solution is known as unbundling and, in future, European customers will also be able to use local services when travelling abroad – known as local break-out – by being able to choose the best offer from the various local operators, as is already the case for WLan access.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also introduced consumer protection rules. In future, these will apply not just within Europe, but also outside the European Union. The obligation to send a warning when users reach a certain tariff level, a certain level of charges, will also apply abroad. Other consumer protection rules have also been introduced in order to prevent involuntary roaming.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, I can say that today is a good day for our citizens of Europe. I am pleased that from 1 July, charges will be reasonable, even for roaming.</p>

It goes without saying that I also welcome the fact that this dossier has been brought to a successful conclusion, and I would also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Ms Niebler as rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">Further work on completing the single market is a top priority at a time when the EU needs to stimulate growth and create opportunities for employment. That is why the Danish Presidency is investing so much time and energy in the single market and the digital single market, including in key areas such as telecoms and the information society. Services provided by modern electronic means of communication such as mobile devices are now straggling the boundaries between telecommunication and the information society. Web access, mobile applications and the transfer of data and images are increasingly concerns. They are the drivers of those rapid advances in technology which are changing the very way we think about information transfer.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when markets and jobs are increasingly global in scale, it is vital for businesses and consumers to be able to use a full range of services accessible via mobile phones, tablets and other devices, irrespective of their location. They need to be able to access these services when travelling and wherever they are conducting business. It is therefore essential for Europe’s competitiveness that we create as seamless a market as possible for such services. That means improving the conditions for roaming and bringing prices closer to those of the domestic markets.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a process that has been under way now for several years. Significant advances have been made through a series of important steps. Today, we have reached the third step, with the Roaming III Regulation. On behalf of the Council, I would like to welcome the agreement reached with Parliament on this important issue. It will help ensure lower prices for roaming customers by introducing greater competition in the roaming market. This is something which is particularly welcome to those in Europe who depend on cross-border information transfer for their businesses and for individual use. It is important that, with close cooperation between the Commission, the Council and Parliament, we have managed to cover all the key elements in the original proposal, including price caps on all the services that are available through roaming.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, the agreement before us respects a set of essential principles, including the need to have an agreed text in place by 1 July of this year: the requirement for the new regulation to be technology-neutral rather than to make technology choices which could soon be out of date; the commitment to ensure that the structural solutions of the new regulations lead to more competition and thus – hopefully – even lower prices for EU citizens in the medium to longer term; the need to continue with a price cap mechanism as a temporary safety mechanism for as long as is necessary for the structural solutions to take effect; and the need to fully involve the body of European regulation for electronic communication in the technical implementation of the regulation and maintain consistency with other relevant legislative or political contexts, such as the regulatory framework for electronic communications or the Digital Agenda for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe’s citizens will be able to take advantage of this new regulation very shortly. It will save them money and increase their access to a wider market. That has to be a positive development. It is a sign that the institutions of the European Union are working for the direct benefit of our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, I would like to thank both Parliament and the Commission for the excellent cooperation during negotiations. I would like to express our gratitude to the Chair of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, the rapporteur, Ms Niebler, and the shadow rapporteurs for the excellent way in which they have handled these important negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow, this Parliament will vote on the regulation. If endorsed, it will bring direct benefits to Europeans. It is an important step which will ensure that consumers will enjoy even lower roaming prices, while, at the same time, it will stimulate much needed competition in the area and thus increase Europe’s competitiveness and encourage growth. This is what Europe needs: concrete results for the benefit of our citizens, creating growth and jobs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Neelie Kroes, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, Mr Schuman would be proud of this institution, together with the Council and the Commission, delivering results that can be recognised by the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to start by paying tribute to Angelika Niebler, who has done an extremely good job with her team-mates. The Danish Presidency took everything into account to fulfil what we had in mind, delivering results before the conclusion of their very fruitful Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">It is perhaps one of those examples in which we can prove that together, and in a European context, in a digital single market we can make it easier for citizens to travel and also take into account everything connected with travelling. With this new Roaming Regulation – and hopefully the voting tomorrow will be positive, but I am sure that will be the case – the basis of the Commission’s proposal is recognisable in this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me remind you what is at stake. These days – as Angelika has already said – mobiles are everywhere. People expect to use their phones wherever they go, especially across internal borders, which are supposed to have disappeared. We are talking about a borderless Europe. A Europe of smartphones, data tablets and data online content means a tremendous boom in mobile data. In that context, high roaming charges are an irritant for a citizen and also an obstacle to a single market.</p>
<p class="contents">People are fed up with nasty surprises when they open their bill. Today, we can put an end to them once and for all, for voice, text and data. We can show how the EU protects citizens’ interests. That is what Mr Schuman had in mind. The agreement we have in front of us will do this in three ways.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we now have a future-proof solution. Injecting competition into the roaming markets will mean, for the first time ever, a structural and sustainable way to protect consumers, because competition is the best guarantee of long-term low prices. Under the new rules, mobile users are empowered to pick the roaming provider right for their travel needs, separately from their domestic provider. So this is a big step forward. Companies will be able to compete through innovative services, which is also a big step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, also for the first time ever, we are tackling data roaming. People who want to browse abroad should not be held back by a fear of high charges. Angelika mentioned that this should be a signal for us, and what is at stake with this proposal, which will be much more acceptable. High charges are a constraint on citizens, on businesses and on economic growth. This agreement removes that constraint on all three, by capping data charges and by letting people choose their data roaming provider, perhaps just as easily as they choose a wi-fi network.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, also for the first time ever, we are extending protection beyond the EU, with better on-the-spot information and warnings about roaming charges, to avoid nasty bill surprises when you get home. We can deliver this with this agreement too.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, you should not see this agreement in isolation. Roaming is just one piece in a much bigger story. We are promoting competition and lower consumer prices – as we have done with mobile termination rates and continue to do in telecoms markets. We are putting Europe at the forefront of the data revolution, through access to cheap data, as we could also do with our proposals to open up public sector data – a great challenge in front of us. We are building a digital single market with consistent rules so that Europeans can easily enjoy great content, wherever they are and whatever device they are using – as we will be doing through our proposals on the cloud, data protection, e-ID and many more.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope with all those we can enjoy a success like the one we are celebrating today. This is a stimulus to do a lot more for the consumer. What does this mean for a family for example? A family will save over EUR 200 on their summer holiday compared with 2007 prices. This summer holiday, a business person will save more than EUR 1 000 per year. Data prices are kept for the first time so that you can use your maps, Facebook and videos at a fair price. Overall, there is a saving of 75% compared with 2007. Yes, you heard that right – a 75% saving. Price caps will be in place until 2017 and there will be full competition from 2014, when choosing a roaming plan will be like choosing a wi-fi network.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the proof that the EU is good for citizens. We are putting money back in your pocket and making markets work fairly. This is also good for businesses because it lowers costs. For the mobile operators, the better prices will attract new customers and grow the market. We have ended the rip-off once and for all.</p>

I will, however, take the liberty of saying frankly and very undiplomatically that I expected the European Commission to put forward a far bolder proposal. We – Parliament and the Commission – are, after all, both EU institutions and we should be working together to eliminate barriers in the European Union and fight for a single market, but instead not only did we have to conduct difficult negotiations with the Council – working with the Danish Presidency is a real pleasure – but we had to secure a very substantial reduction, of at least half, in the Commission’s proposals. So I hope that further proposals on digital policy will take greater account of rapidly changing technologies, the changing times and the rapidly changing needs of the citizens and of businesses, because – as the Commissioner said – there is still a lot more to be done in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Not only has it been a success – as far as I can see – by substantially lowering the upper limits of what operators can charge consumers for mobile services when they are in another EU Member State, but the proposal for a regulation that we will vote on in this plenary session also includes other measures such as, for example, extending transparency clauses to European consumers travelling to non-Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">However, above all, the greatest merit of the Roaming III Regulation is – in my view – its desire to become obsolete and create a competitive market for roaming services themselves, where it will no longer be necessary to regulate the situation in each of the different 27 markets every two years, but rather the situation in the single market, which should represent the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This regulation, which we will vote on tomorrow, will not only be limited on this occasion to establishing new maximum tariffs that mobile phone operators must respect when European consumers travel outside the European Union, but, for the first time, we are tackling the situation – in my view, in a much more intelligent way – by establishing a competitive market.</p>
<p class="contents">If the structural measures proposed in the regulation are successful, we European consumers will have the option of taking out a roaming contract with a different operator to the one providing us with mobile services in our own country, and we will be able to do this simply and keep our phone number. It is an essential contribution to the development of the digital single market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These reductions will be important because Parliament has called for them and implemented them. In this regard, I would like to thank all my colleagues who have formed a united front when it was needed against the Council and the Commission and I would like, above all, to thank Angelika Niebler, who was an exemplary rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s initial proposal was not very ambitious. It essentially aimed to lower wholesale prices in order to boost competition, which is largely inexistent among operators. The Council was divided. Many states remain under the influence of their old national monopolies. The Council was therefore seeking to maintain the profits of these national telecommunications champions.</p>
<p class="contents">That is precisely where the problem lies in the mobile communication market in the European Union. The market is dominated by a cartel, or at least a <span class="italic">de facto</span> cartel. Four major groups – Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom, Orange and Telefónica Movistar – share some 80% of the mobile communication market in the EU. They are present in all, or nearly all, national markets, either directly or in conjunction with national operators. However, these groups, which all operate at EU level, want, at all costs, to keep national borders in order to impose roaming charges.</p>
<p class="contents">I am among those who believe in the need for competition, the famous invisible hand that was so dear to Adam Smith. However, I believe even more in the need to manage the very visible hand of public authorities in order to intervene in markets and impose price reductions where necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has just taken an important step towards the progressive abolition of unjustified and unjustifiable roaming charges. Our aim must remain a large internal market which also applies to mobile communications. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament in particular has succeeded in insisting that the Commission present a report evaluating developments in prices in the market no later than 30 June 2016.</p>
<p class="contents">I will quote Article 19(2): ‘If the report shows that the structural measures provided for by this regulation have not been sufficient to promote competition in the internal market for roaming services for the benefit of all European consumers, or that the differences between roaming tariffs and national tariffs have not approached zero, the Commission shall make appropriate proposals to the European Parliament and the Council to address this situation and thus achieve an internal market for mobile communication services, ultimately with there being no difference between national and roaming tariffs’.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, such is and remains our ambition and I know that the vast majority of MEPs support us in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">What we will vote on tomorrow, ladies and gentlemen, is, in fact, a gift for all Europeans for Europe Day, which we are celebrating today. It is a gift that will be very much appreciated because, as Angelika Niebler but also the Commissioner have just said, today, everyone needs their mobile telephone or these other devices that form the world of modern communication. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Well, you should be; we should all be.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I think it is safe to say that we Liberals do not like price regulations, but for roaming this has proved necessary. Looking back at the history, we began to regulate prices due to a cartel-like situation, where a complete lack of competition in roaming services meant that operators could set their price levels as they pleased. It is not liberal when the market does not work and the consumers have no choice. So introducing price ceilings has been a necessary tool to try to bring costs down.</p>
<p class="contents">However, despite some progress, prices continue to be significantly higher than domestic mobile prices. The reason is quite simple: the market still does not work. The price caps might have pushed prices down, but it has not increased the competition. The average mobile roaming prices are pretty much identical to the regulated price caps. That is why the Liberal Group demanded more competition from the beginning, and that has also been our main priority in the negotiations. It is not sustainable to undertake a revision every two or three years, so we need to break down the barriers between our national telecommunication markets to create market pressure to lower the prices.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the new roaming deal is a step in that direction: the combination of allowing access to independent operators on the big companies’ networks and allowing for the separate sale of roaming services will give enough choice to consumers to simply dismiss those operators who demand ludicrous prices. Another crucial element that we fought hard for is the local break-out, allowing mobile users to access the Internet locally on a visited network – just like accessing a wi-fi hot spot. This is a new technology which can persuade mobile operators to realise that, unless they lower their prices, they will lose business.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is crucial implementation work to be done now to ensure that especially the structural solutions work. We will be following this process closely from Parliament, and hopefully we will not see each other here again in four years’ time, as the market will be doing its job and providing competitive prices for all consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today, I have mixed feelings. On the one hand, it is true, I recognise in Ms Kroes the kind of liberal I like, a liberal who wants real competition on the market and who challenges all abuse from those in a dominant position. It is not for nothing that you used to be the Commissioner for Competition.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, I would like to thank Angelika Niebler for having made considerable efforts to improve the Commission’s proposal and also to take on these monopolies.</p>
<p class="contents">We can therefore, somehow, be pleased, as today we are seeing roaming and data prices on the market which can reach up to 10 000 times the cost price. Imagine that: 10 000 times the cost price! These are obviously extreme examples but they are part of the reality and we will reduce this, over time, to a ratio that will be, broadly speaking, around 50 times the cost price. We can therefore say: ‘Hallelujah! We have gone from a ratio of 10 000 to a ratio of 50 – great progress!’</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, tell me, in which truly competitive market are there profit margins like this? How is it possible that, in an economy which is, in principle, a large market economy – a ‘social market economy’, yes, but a market economy nonetheless – we can still find margins like this? In French, it is what we would call a racket! The word is not French but you understand what I am talking about. The regulation that we are putting in place actually helps to keep this racket going. What we have seen in the past is that all the real prices converge at the fixed ceiling. This therefore means that there is no real competition.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that the Commission has made many efforts to develop structural measures that lead to real competition, but I agree with Mr Goebbels: how is it possible that these four large groups, which are <span class="italic">de facto</span> present throughout the internal market – we call this an internal market! – behave as though we were 27 impenetrably separated national markets? This is clearly unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">That is therefore the source of my bitterness with regard to the text that we will vote on tomorrow – we had voted against it in committee to encourage Ms Niebler to go further. However, we must indeed recognise that, if the text that we will adopt represents significant progress, it still has a long, long way to go in terms of consumer protection.</p>
<p class="contents">What I am hoping therefore, is that, in fact, as Jens Rohde said, we do not have to rule on new standards again in four years’ time in terms of the price ceiling for roaming. This is not normal. What I want to see is real competition. We saw what happened with <span class="italic">Free</span> in France. It is an effort at national market level. We need much more competition. The racket that telecommunications and mobile telephone operators practise is a racket that must stop, like all rackets in any self-respecting economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was said, at the time, that this would be a temporary measure, lasting for two years. The regulation was then extended to 2012. Now we are talking here about 2022. In European terms, temporary thus means at least 15 years.</p>
<p class="contents">On no account do I want to stand up for mobile operators in this place. It is well known that, at the very least, they acted in concert when setting roaming prices. However, five years of experience in the regulation of end user prices for roaming calls have proved the critics of this form of regulation right, since prices for end users have generally been held close to the upper limit. Price regulation should be no more than an emergency measure, applied when absolutely necessary, since any form of regulation hampers innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation we are debating, for example, proposes fixing the wholesale price of an SMS up to 2022, and thus for 10 years. It is as if we had sat down 10 years ago to determine today’s price for sending a telegram, a service that has now completely died out.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of price regulation, we should try to allow more market mechanisms into the telecoms environment. The proposal under debate may introduce an initially interesting novelty – the separate sale of domestic mobile services and regulated services. I would like to emphasise the word ‘regulated’. In this way, we are again, unfortunately, creating not a new market environment, but only a kind of new quasi proposal with indirect regulation which will again suit just a few multinational, oligopolistic operators. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The most innovative aspect of this regulation is the move from simple price cuts to giving consumers the possibility of choosing a different operator for roaming services, while keeping their number. This is where competition can deliver lower prices for consumers, especially in times of crisis. BEREC now has the responsibility for ensuring that this is done in the simplest and most consumer-friendly way. If the solution is over-complicated, this regulation risks failing its objectives. For this reason, any technical solution detailed by BEREC should not be over-complicated or excessively burdensome for the mobile industry.

First, it is about the development and integration of our single European market. It applies to 380 million customers. This, in itself, represents progress. Customers get the possibility to make a free choice, and their protection is also beefed up. The third thing, which is extremely important in my opinion, is that small and medium-sized enterprises get a chance to access foreign networks, thereby strengthening competition. This will then be reflected in lower prices.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I believe that much remains to be done. For example, the promotion of unified model contracts, which would make market access possible. It is also necessary to ensure that operators cannot make up for alleged losses through the palliative of costlier domestic calls. None of this, however, detracts from the importance of the text. I would like to thank Ms Niebler, who has pushed hard for this arrangement to be far more comprehensive than the previous one.</p>
<p class="contents">To those who say that this hinders market-based solutions, I would also like to point out the well-known fact that market liberalism is actually a form of protectionism favouring the privileged. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This means that smartphones can be used without incurring huge costs. The plans for more competition in the mobile communications market are particularly pleasing. From 2014, customers will be able to find the cheapest provider and buy their roaming services separately, even from foreign providers. Every time you cross a border, your mobile phone will automatically switch to the network of the provider you have selected, while your phone number remains the same.</p>
<p class="contents">Roaming charges are the only area in the EU where costs are incurred simply by crossing a border. All in all, this is the right approach to take. It is a very positive move, particularly in the light of the fact that the internal market has not always produced good results. I am thinking here of the ongoing social dumping caused by opening up the labour market in south-eastern Europe. Here, we have finally achieved something positive. We are moving in the right direction and congratulations are in order. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Roaming is an example of how we are responding to the wishes of the citizens of Europe. Recently, a student from the University of Linz complained to me that she had paid EUR 3.60 a minute for a conversation that she had had in Brussels with her boyfriend in Munich, which would have cost her only EUR 0.07 per minute from home. The exorbitant bill that she received for a conversation lasting two hours was more expensive than her entire stay in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Reding has reacted quickly. We were able to adopt the Roaming I Regulation in record time, within a period of only seven months. For the first time, there was a sunset clause. As a result of the rapid introduction of rules at a European level, we are remaining up-to-date in this area and can offer our citizens corresponding benefits. This represents a huge advantage for consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Many speakers today have emphasised that this is all about prices. I would like to dispute that. We are not regulating prices. Instead, we are making it clear at what point our citizens have the right to protection against abuse. We put our trust in the industry when it came to data roaming. The industry promised us that dramatic reductions would be forthcoming. This did not happen with Roaming II and that is why we now have this Roaming III Regulation. When you realise that you can still buy a one gigabyte data package in one Member State for EUR 4, that you may be forced to pay up to EUR 13 900 for this package elsewhere, and that in other countries outside Europe, the cost is currently between EUR 2 500 and EUR 3 500, it is clear that the reduction to EUR 700 is a huge step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to express my gratitude for the fact that this figure will fall to EUR 200 by 2014. However, given that a figure of EUR 4 is normal at a national level, I am calling today for a Roaming IV Regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Merkies (S&amp;D). </span></span>  – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Ms Niebler, and Mr Goebbels in particular, thank you for this excellent result. We have reached an agreement quickly and this was essential because the current legislation will cease to apply in a few weeks’ time. However, the maximum rates in the agreement are considerably lower than those originally proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The result is good for consumers, because they will notice the difference as early as this summer when they travel abroad. Phone calls and text messages will be cheaper. The real task, however, is doing something about data services. That will be a major intervention. Currently, the rates are however much you are prepared to pay, anything from EUR 3 per megabyte, but soon they will be a lot less, namely, EUR 0.70 per megabyte.</p>
<p class="contents">Today is Europe Day and we are celebrating Europe’s past success stories. Certainly, intervention in the mobile phone market has been one of the success stories of Europe, but it is a success story of the past. My question is: will what we have done now be a success story of the future? I ask this because what we have decided now is a suboptimal solution. It is a solution which creates additional fuss for the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">What lies at the core of the issue is separating national and international markets and this is all to do with dual IMSI, the dual SIM card and local break-out. Why do things in such a roundabout way? We could have made it a lot easier for everyone. Now, consumers will have to spend hours behind the computer in the evening trying to work out what contracts they need to choose. If the internal digital market is our objective, then why take this roundabout route?</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, an optimal solution that we could have achieved much more quickly, and that is: ‘roam like you are at home’. My question is whether it will come into being in 2016, without further intervention? The proposal, therefore, was that it should come into effect earlier. A genuine internal market is Europe’s success story, as someone here has already said. So, we do not want any differences between national and European rates; the proposal by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists &amp; Democrats in the European Parliament was to phase out maximum rates and to then introduce a single rate in Europe from 1 July 2014. The advantages will be cheaper deals for consumers and a genuine internal communications market. ‘Stop roaming now’ was the motto.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a few more questions: namely, network neutrality has been included in the roaming agreement. The European Parliament has also adopted a resolution on the subject and the Dutch Parliament has passed a law to ensure network neutrality by preventing providers from being able to suddenly prioritise certain websites. Commissioner, you have said that you would put forward a proposal for network neutrality after the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) has completed a study (which took place on 6 March).</p>
<p class="contents">The success story must have a follow-up on the digital market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">During the next summer holidays, mobile phone calls from abroad will be significantly cheaper and, for the first time, there will be price transparency outside Europe, which is also important. For me, an essential feature of this regulation is that we have not repeated the mistakes of Roaming I and Roaming II. It has become clear that simple price limits, which actually have the same effect as price fixing, do not lead to more competition. Therefore, it is important for us to focus now on unbundling roaming services and national contracts for mobile communication services. We are creating a market which will lead to low prices of its own accord by providing genuine consumer choice and introducing new market players.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we still need a safety net for prices as a transitional measure and to protect consumers from abuse. However, more competition also requires more market players and they will not come onto the market while the price limits are too low and there is too little scope for innovative offers. It will also not help consumers if operators do not have enough money in future to invest in new, faster networks. Ultimately, we do not want to fall behind in Europe. For these reasons, I welcome the fact that we have found a sensible solution and I would like to thank Ms Niebler specifically for her important contribution to this common-sense regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumers will notice the benefits of the new Roaming Regulation in their wallets. By 2014, there will be significant falls of up to 45% in the cost of incoming and outgoing calls and, as early as July 2012, consumers will be paying almost 20% less. Particularly in the case of data roaming, there have been no limits to misuse until now, which has, in some cases, resulted in horrendous prices. A cap will be put on these in future. We must continue to work towards completing the internal market and, if possible, finding a solution which means that in future, we do not need roaming charges at all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have talked about this issue, and we have all agreed with each other and said the right words. We said that data roaming is something that genuinely damages the internal market and harms consumers. We also said that this is something that needs to be regulated, which is something that people who do not like regulation may regret.</p>
<p class="contents">We were all in agreement about this, so we all said the right words, but when it came to the figures, they were wrong. From 2014, the ceiling will be 20 cents per megabyte for data roaming. It perhaps does not sound very much per megabyte, but it amounts to EUR 200 per gigabyte. If we compare that with the national prices in any country, we see that consumers are still being robbed. Unfortunately, we will need Roaming IV, as Mr Rübig said earlier. This is a step in the right direction, but it is too little and it is moving too slowly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It reads, ‘Using the web in Europe costs three pounds a meg’. As a result of this new rule, the price will drop to 56 pence. Excessive charging from roaming causes both consumers and operators to lose out. I know many consumers who just switch off their data roaming when they are travelling and do not access any services at all, meaning operators do not sell any services at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst many consumers who do travel will like these new caps, it would have been much better if the operators could have come to a voluntary agreement on charges, because there are risks that operators will pass on the costs of capping roaming to domestic customers through higher bills or that this will limit the funds that these operators have for investing in future infrastructure – and boy, do we need those investments to fill holes in our rural coverage and for deeper coverage in our cities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A certain level of regulation is therefore justified, including the setting of maximum prices for the individual types of service provided. Just like my colleagues from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, I, too, firmly believe that the Commission proposal is too generous to operators, particularly in relation to the maximum retail price of 50 cents per megabyte of data downloaded abroad after 1 July 2014. I therefore support the justified changes to the regulation drafted by the Committee, and I am delighted to join those MEPs who will be voting for the adoption of this improved draft of the regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On the one hand, we want to achieve a high level of consumer protection and, on the other, a functioning internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, setting price caps is not a measure that is appropriate for the market. Consequently, it is no surprise that we had numerous debates on this issue before the first regulation was adopted in 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">However, our conclusions were clear: the cross-border services market was not working. For this reason, the first regulation was adopted with price caps on calls, and this has demonstrated good results.</p>
<p class="contents">The people of Europe have welcomed this measure and it is also one of the measures that is most widely recognised.</p>
<p class="contents">However, reassessments of the mobile phone services market have shown that the market continues to be uncompetitive.</p>
<p class="contents">The number of mobile phone users is increasing. Mobile phones are becoming increasingly versatile, with more and more applications. They allow us to use an increasing variety of services.</p>
<p class="contents">Every day, millions of citizens in Europe use mobile phones for calls, text messages and browsing the Internet; people use them to arrange their private lives. In addition, mobile phones are becoming increasingly useful in the business world.</p>
<p class="contents">This has also led to a continuous increase in the numbers of potential roaming users.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, huge numbers of Europeans continue to switch off their mobile services abroad for fear of high bills. We want to put a stop to this.</p>
<p class="contents">The message we are sending out to them today is: in less than two months, the price of cross-border mobile services will fall again thanks to the new regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">There is strong support in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for this regulation and the price reductions, but this is not the only measure we are taking.</p>
<p class="contents">Namely, we are also proposing structural measures that will facilitate the proper functioning of the mobile services market to help provide even greater choice for users.</p>
<p class="contents">I would sincerely like the market to get off the ground by 2015 and hope that we do not need to intervene any further with drastic measures such as price caps.</p>
<p class="contents">Congratulations to our rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The crisis and our response to it are distancing citizens who, in order for confidence in this common project to be restored, need to recognise the benefits that Europe can offer. If we want a Europe without borders, not only must we allow free movement – which some have recently called into question – but we must also facilitate it.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has defended from the start the creation of a single market for mobile communications. Since the start of the review of this regulation, we have defended the idea that roaming tariffs should be brought into line with domestic tariffs, putting an end to the discrimination that exists.</p>
<p class="contents">With our position, we have managed, for the first time, to include putting an end to this discrimination as the final objective of the regulation on roaming. In the short term, the price of voice calls, SMS and data while roaming will, progressively, be lowered considerably. Consumers will end up paying 65% less in 2014 for roaming tariffs compared with what they currently pay. Furthermore, they will have more options when choosing between operators thanks to the new structural measures that have been introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">However, for the S&amp;D Group, these measures are still merely transitional. We will remain vigilant in order to check that the measures introduced produce the desired effects and introduce more competition into the roaming market. Otherwise, I can tell you that we will continue in the 2016 review to call on the Commission to propose new measures to complete a real single market for mobile communications that gives adequate benefits to consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, to eliminate roaming is to build Europe; it is to reduce the obstacles that national borders still represent. In short, it is an opportunity that we must not miss in order to continue making progress on this common project that we believe in and that is the European Union. Congratulations to Ms Niebler, Mr Goebbels, Ms Merkies and to all those who have made this agreement possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The current pricing system for roaming services is not sufficiently transparent. Further increases in the prices of roaming services create obstacles preventing the development of a single European market for these services and must therefore be reconsidered. This is why I am in favour of the proposal that provides for a cap for wholesale prices and the price levels that will subsequently be offered to end consumers. The proposal’s second part, which aims to reinforce the need for greater transparency in pricing in the market, includes providing consumers with complete and transparent information on roaming tariffs.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Niebler, for her wonderful work on this complex and important directive, which aims to reduce the price of roaming services for European consumers during the current economic crisis. The current situation is incompatible with the concept of developing a single integrated European services market and the idea of these services being affordable to all of us and of having free competition in this market. This is why I fully support Ms Niebler’s work and find it excellent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has made it less expensive for mobile phone users to make phone calls abroad. The report will cap data-use costs abroad and allow consumers to choose their data provider.

Finally, rather than demanding new sacrifices from our citizens, the European Commission has committed itself to cutting charges; in this case, we are talking about mobile phone roaming charges within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The cost of international roaming on public communications networks used to represent, and still does today, a genuinely oppressive burden for consumers. This measure increases competition in the sector and reduces the cost of communications when abroad. This will be of help to citizens who are travelling in EU territory and use their national mobile phone number to place calls, surf the Internet and send SMS messages.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the objectives of the 2020 strategy and the Digital Agenda, I believe it is necessary to add to the development of the European communications market, making it more competitive and facilitating market access for new operators. I am in favour of the text because it harmonises the international roaming regulation, protects the consumer and ensures fair treatment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is a good example because, as was said, it has an impact on citizens’ real lives, on their daily lives. It also helps businesses to expand their market, not because charges are high and services reduced, but because they can increase their service offering and, in substance, it also helps the economy as a whole. That is why I believe that it is, without doubt, a positive example, a good example.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet you will have realised, Commissioner, that there is a widespread desire in this House; in particular, let us recall the speeches of two of my colleagues, Ms Riera Madurell and Mr Goebbels, not to mention many others, who would like this good example to become the best possible example, and would like us to move towards a zero-cost roaming outcome. Such an outcome is possible, and this measure partly anticipates that.</p>
<p class="contents">Are we wishing for utopia? No. We are not, because an internal European market implies that domestic and non-domestic tariffs should be similar. There is no longer differentiation if we speak of the single market and, above all, because there is no technical justification for an increase in charges. I remember when, in 2007, we began to discuss voice roaming charges, the first of the trio that we have now tackled. There was a certain incredulity and also certain difficulties; not, however, on the part of the Commission, and here I must give the credit to your predecessor, Ms Reding.</p>
<p class="contents">The difficulties were quite wide-ranging. They came from those who said that a true market did not allow for tariffs to be regulated, that there were political prices to pay, that they belonged to an old idea of the left, et cetera, et cetera. There were those who said it would not work and so on, that it would put a brake on the market. In the end, however, we have done it. The interests of citizens and establishing that these were not justifications for increased charges have made it possible. That is how the world moves on, and things are becoming, let us say, ever more possible. That is why I think an even more courageous outcome is achievable.</p>
<p class="contents">A concluding remark on why it is not possible to do otherwise. Today, we had a visit from a delegation of Tunisian citizens; I do not know if they are still here. Perhaps one of its many benefits is that this extension to outside the EU will make us understand that the opportunity of using phones without the bugbear of charges will also aid democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have lost faith in a common EU approach and are under the impression that the EU is something for bureaucrats and not for people. However, the new rules on roaming may remove the doubts of some of these people and show them that actually, the EU is able to put measures in place which benefit citizens and consumers. We do not always manage to adopt rules which translate so directly into everyday life, but this one does have direct application. So I would like to compliment Ms Niebler on her report and add my voice to her requests to publicise our achievement – we have reached agreement between all the political groups – and to publicise it in particular among the citizens, because this will help them understand what the European Union does for them.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to point out that we mainly talk about financial issues in this Chamber and how they affect household budgets and the money in our pockets. I do think these issues are important, but they are not the only important factor in all of these changes. In Europe, and around the world, people’s lifestyles and the ways we keep in touch with each other are simply changing. These contacts are taking place to an ever greater degree using computers, telephones and the Internet. We want ever faster information; we want to be in touch with friends wherever we are; we are travelling more often, too, and it is precisely because our lifestyle is changing that the decision we are going to make today will be so very important for everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not just a matter of reducing costs, but is also about the citizens having greater influence and greater control over how much they spend.

For example, tourists who are on holiday no longer need worry about picking up a phone.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem, however, is that setting price ceilings, as an administrative intervention in the market, has its negative consequences elsewhere in the telecoms market. The aim should be to have greater competition on the roaming market. This has not happened, however, as we see from the fact that prices of regulated services have remained just below the level of the price ceilings set by the regulation currently in force. In my own country, the regulation has influenced the prices of other telecoms products, with all three operators increasing prices for SMS services, for example, in some cases several times over.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore firmly believe that price regulation based on price ceilings does not fulfil its primary function, and I would like to warn against an excessively ambitious approach to regulation in this sector. We will encourage competition more by removing obstacles to market access for new players, and not by tying up the telecoms market until 2022. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thanks to this regulation, the European Union has finally decided to intervene in favour of these consumers and reduce the cost of international telephone traffic, be it by way of voice, data or SMS messaging. This is a positive decision because the price reduction programme will lead to an average drop in charges of 35% over the next three years.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not enough, however. At a difficult time like this, for both the economy and jobs, communications, new technologies and innovation are a prime asset that Europe must defend more courageously. Every European citizen must be able to move freely between Member States using the telecommunications tariffs set by his or her own national operator. Those who travel around Europe have had enough of being ripped off and enormous bills.</p>
<p class="contents">If we really want to give a concrete response to citizens’ concerns, let us create a sort of telecommunications Schengen area, where they will no longer be charged at rates that differ from country to country within the area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thanks to the European Parliament, we have now put an end to this kind of racket.</p>
<p class="contents">I admit that I was rather unhappy about the Roaming I Regulation, because price regulation is not something that goes with a market economy. However, we had no choice. Normally the market regulates prices by means of supply and demand as part of the competitive process. However, if there is no competition on the telecommunications market, we need to step in and introduce regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">Just like surfing the Internet, making phone calls is as much a part of our everyday life as eating and drinking. We have the internal market, but citizens who travel in Europe are ripped off when it comes to roaming charges. We must put a stop to this. Against this background and given this situation, we have made the right response. The previous decisions have largely concerned price regulation. The rules that we will be adopting tomorrow will settle precisely this problem. My fellow Member has said that there is a lack of competition. With the regulation that is in front of us now, we will be creating competition in Europe, not just in one country, but in the internal market. This sends out a very positive signal. If the citizens of Europe take the opportunity that is open to them now, within five to six years, we will no longer have to talk about roaming in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also looked to the future. We have included all the options for data transmission in this regulation and we have taken a realistic approach. We should give our sincere thanks to the rapporteurs and to everyone involved. This is an excellent proposal which is in the interests of the citizens of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The aim of the regulations adopted in 2007 and 2009 and, in particular, of the current one is to protect consumers and make roaming service providers flexible by introducing roaming Euro-call, Euro-SMS and Euro-data charges. However, an internal telecommunications market cannot be said to exist while there are still significant differences between domestic and roaming service prices. Objective 101 of the Digital Agenda is to achieve convergence between domestic and roaming charges by 2015. This is why the ultimate aim should be to eliminate the difference between domestic and roaming charges, thereby establishing an internal market for mobile communication services.</p>
<p class="contents">Through the amendments tabled, I advocated that users living in border regions should not receive unnecessarily high bills due to inadvertent roaming. Roaming service providers should take reasonable steps to protect customers against incurring roaming charges while they are in their own Member State. Likewise, national regulatory authorities should take appropriate measures to mitigate the relevant problems. Selling regulated roaming services separately from domestic mobile communications services is a necessary intermediate step for increasing competition and lowering roaming service charges for customers in order to achieve an internal market for mobile communication services and, ultimately, for ending the differentiation between domestic and roaming charges.</p>
<p class="contents">We call for the regulation to be reviewed in 2016 to ensure appropriate protection for consumers, if convergence between domestic and roaming charges has not been achieved by then. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We often talk about removing barriers in Europe, and I therefore welcome the Commission’s ongoing attempts to address this issue. The goal of fully eliminating roaming charges in the EU before 2015 is ambitious, but is certainly one which I can support.</p>
<p class="contents">In my constituency, citizens frequently travel across the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, and they do not have to cross the border to have the extra charges imposed on them. This is a thing that makes many of the constituents on both sides of the border very angry, and one can understand why it does. The legislation will hopefully promote more competition in the roaming market, allowing consumers the choice of mobile operators, with roaming as a positive development, particularly in these challenging economic times, for businesses, in particular, to find a better deal, reduce their costs and seek new opportunities in other Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank Ms Niebler and the members on the committees. The new roaming charges will prevent consumers from being exploited and finally bring an end to unfair pricing practices. I hope that in the summer holidays, which some of us may spend in Greece, and hopefully we will still be able to travel to Greece by then, we will notice the difference.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would also like to mention another point that is particularly important to me and to the region I come from, which has borders with Poland and the Czech Republic. Citizens who live in border regions must no longer have to pay especially high costs. They are often completely unaware of the fact that they are inadvertently using expensive foreign networks. They cannot do anything about this and they do not receive any warnings. We often talk about a Europe without borders, but when we use mobile phones near a border, we have to pay a penalty. We want to change this situation. The service providers must ensure that customers no longer have to pay the high charges which are currently being imposed on them.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I would like to warn everyone against getting too excited, even if the signals which we are sending out today are positive. Ms Kroes, you have said that Mr Schuman would have been proud of us today. It seems to me to be rather an exaggeration to suggest that he might have been proud about this issue when we are in the midst of the most serious crisis ever to hit the European Union. I also believe that he would not have been quite as proud of the draft produced by the Commission. My thanks go to the members in the committees who, fortunately, were able to make some changes to it. This will help the citizens of Europe who are also the end consumers. However, we must also admit that the costs which we impose on the citizens of Europe as a result of our other directives and regulations add up to a much larger amount than the money which we are now saving them. We need to work on improving this situation in future. However, this does represent a step in the right direction. I believe that we can all look forward to the summer holidays and to travelling in border regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is a lot, even for a frequent text messager like me, but this tells you something about the kind of world young people live in. An extraordinary amount of text messages are being sent, but what you also see is a whole lot of people downloading data and reading newspapers on the train. This has simply become our way of life. We do not just make phone calls, we also send text messages and we use an awful lot of data services.</p>
<p class="contents">With that in mind, it is strange to see that, up till now, we have not found a solution to the associated high prices we pay, the high domestic prices – certainly in my country. Secondly, it is totally unacceptable from a European perspective that we have found no solution to roaming rates. It is bizarre – as Mr Goebbels has very clearly pointed out – because there is no good reason why mobile phone services between Antwerp and Paris should be so much more expensive than those between Marseille and Paris. We all know that it has to do with a number of large corporate groups who earn outrageous profits as a result. We are taking a step forward and it actually makes no difference to me, as a modern Social Democrat, if the cat is grey or black as long as she catches mice, and as long as the problem is resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">We want competition. We want an open market. If we fail to accomplish those two objectives, then we will set price caps. We are doing that today and this will at least ensure that prices go down by the summer and that they reach more normal levels.</p>
<p class="contents">In the long run, this Parliament, and certainly this group in Parliament, wants to see a complete abolition of roaming rates. We have agreed to make this a reality by 2016 and you and your team, in particular – because this will stretch into the next parliamentary term – will be held to account on that score. National rates, too, must be drastically reduced, because downloading data, making calls and text messaging is a right and our consumers should not have to pay too much for it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Undoubtedly, we have achieved a good result for our citizens and it shows the truth of the proverb: there is no strength without unity. </p>
<p class="contents">Our esteemed President, Mr Schulz, spoke today about Robert Schuman and quoted him talking about the need for solidarity in deeds. Well, here we have solidarity in deeds that have been official for our citizens. Like others, I, too, received a text from my mobile operator when I landed in Brussels, telling me to enjoy roaming. For better value roaming, I was getting voice calls at 42 cents a minute to make, 13 cents a minute to receive, text messages 13 cents a minute to send and various prices for Internet and data roaming. I will enjoy roaming far better (because I will be getting better value as a result of the European Union) from 1 July: the 42 cents will become 29 cents, down to 24 cents, to 19 cents in 2014. The 13 cents for calls received will go down to 8 cents in July, then to 7 cents in 2014 and 5 cents subsequently.</p>
<p class="contents">An SMS will cost 9 cents, 8 cents and 6 cents, and data roaming will go from 70 cents to 35 cents and down to 20 cents. So there will certainly be better value there for consumers. In addition, particularly for those who travel abroad regularly, the local break-out will be of great benefit. Especially if we can help create competition in the market by allowing mobile operators without their own network to use the network of other operators, that should help to make these not just maximum and minimum prices but price caps, where the real price will be far lower than this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Virtual operators will now have the right to access the networks of other operators under regulated wholesale prices. Despite all of the fairytales about a market environment, operators in my own country have so far had no interest in providing their networks to virtual operators, and nor have they provided them, because of their market dominance.</p>
<p class="contents">It is hard for us to talk about a single telecoms market when we have varying tariffs within the EU and completely nonsensical, inexcusably high prices that are not due to market competition, and not due to technical reasons, but due to the perverse pricing policy of the multinational cartels, which is based on the existence of administrative barriers and on nothing else.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the customer and the market are now slowly shaking off the yoke of cartel agreements and artificial barriers. It is worth noting that a genuine market, a market benefiting the customer and a competitive environment benefiting the customer, must be created through regulation in this case. The time is approaching when Europeans will be able to call their nearest and dearest in the EU without worry, and use the maps and navigation aids on their tablets or use emails while on holiday.</p>
<p class="contents">I am truly grateful for this signal that our policy can – at least sometimes – defend the interests of people ahead of the interests of corporations.

Today is Europe Day, when we celebrate the idea of uniting 27 countries to date, creating a single market, a common currency for many of our Member States, ongoing cultural and educational exchange; an exchange, in short, of feelings of greater togetherness and closeness. What medium unites us more these days than that of communication?</p>
<p class="contents">A single internal telecommunications market cannot, in fact, be said to exist without telecommunications and if significant differences remain between domestic and roaming prices. Therefore, the ultimate aim we have set ourselves is also the hypothetical one of being able to eliminate the difference between domestic charges and roaming charges, thus establishing an internal market for mobile communications services. It is one of the aims that we must set ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">In this way, competition will improve, and people will be protected. It is an economic saving, because high roaming charges always constitute an impediment to the Union’s efforts to develop into a knowledge-based economy and to the realisation of an internal market of 500 million consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not all. The creation of a European social, educational, cultural and entrepreneurial area, based on the mobility of individuals and digital data, should facilitate communication between people in order to attain our aim, which is to build a real ‘Europe for Citizens’.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, I thank the rapporteur, Ms Niebler, for her skill and her great capabilities at mediation, but most of all, for having attained the aims that have been achieved, given the importance of this issue. Obviously, I also thank all the shadow rapporteurs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Roaming Regulation in this negotiated form achieves some quite positive results in terms of reduced price caps for voice calls, data services and SMS. However, the way to a European single market for mobile communication, which has to be our ultimate goal, is still far from being reached. In my view, the extra costs for roaming are not justified by any technical reasons. They create fake and unjust commercial borders; they represent an actual impediment to the free competition among network operators that would lead to better services, lower prices, more consumption and more growth in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The biggest improvement that this new regulation will bring in terms of benefits for the European citizen is the significant cut in the price of data services. This was a top priority for the S&amp;D Group and I am pleased that such an important point has been agreed upon. However, I am quite disappointed that not enough attention has been given to the net neutrality issue as I believe that customers should be allowed to access any Internet services from their phones without discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">The overall outcome of the negotiations with the Council is satisfactory. However, I would like to remind you that this Parliament should push for the creation of a single market for telecommunications and that the EU must become a roaming free area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This will be noticed in the wallets of consumers and travellers, and they will notice it as soon as July this year, when the costs will be reduced by 35%. Next year, the costs will be reduced by a few more percentage points and, by 2014, 65% of the costs will have been eradicated. The price of data will also be adequately reduced, and all of this is clear evidence that politics can play a role: the market cannot decide; the market must not be able to set exorbitant prices.</p>
<p class="contents">In a borderless internal market, however, there is actually no reason for it to be more expensive to make calls between countries than to call someone in the same country. We now have a guarantee that the Commission will come back with a strong legislative proposal for a fully integrated telecommunications market if insufficient improvements have been made by 2016. We are therefore prepared to go further to ensure that people do not pay more than they should actually need to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What this regulation is about is the imposition of limits on mobile phone roaming tariffs charged to European consumers, and its main objective is to put an end to roaming charges in Europe as of 2016. Our citizens will benefit from a sharp fall in the prices of voice calls, texts and data. Whereas today, there are operators that charge EUR 3 per megabyte, as of July, the maximum price they will be able to charge will be EUR 0.70 per megabyte, and this will fall to EUR 0.20 in 2014. As for calls received, the maximum price that can be charged will be EUR 0.08 this year and EUR 0.05 in 2014. In July 2012, a family with two mobile phone users will, as the Commissioner has said, save EUR 200 on their bill.</p>
<p class="contents">The second benefit is better quality of information for consumers. From this summer onwards, operators will be required to inform consumers of the prices charged when they travel outside the European Union. Until now, this requirement only applied within Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The third advantage is the possibility of more operators entering the market. This means more competition, which will stimulate better services and better prices.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in the near future, consumers may, if they so wish, have two contracts: one for domestic services and another for services abroad, whilst retaining the same mobile phone number and having only one bill. Consumers – our citizens – will also be entitled to enter into a contract with any European operator that offers a better price. This report is a perfect example of a Europe of the citizens, a Europe of freedom of movement and freedom of establishment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The harmonisation of roaming charges is fundamental for the process of completing the internal market of the European Union. There is always much talk of a single market and the removal of tariff barriers, and yet barriers between European countries in the telecommunications sector as regards roaming charges seemed insuperable. Now this is no longer the case, and it will no longer be the case up to and beyond July 2014.</p>
<p class="contents">Tariff reductions are finally real and tangible, and this is good news for citizens throughout Europe. The agreement binds all operators in the 27 Member States, without exception, to reducing roaming charges for telephone calls, messages and Internet connections, starting no later than 1 July next. This is an important and significant saving, at a time of crisis and grave economic difficulty for so many families. What is more, I am pleased with the measure that will enable users who are abroad to opt for the services of the most convenient operator as from 2014.</p>
<p class="contents">No more chains, therefore. However, all this is not enough; it is only a first step. The real objective is ‘zero’ roaming; the real objective is the total abolition of roaming charges. Building a fair and competitive market also depends on Europe’s capacity to safeguard the needs and rights of its citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The particularly positive message today is that in future, the charges for sending texts and using data roaming will be much lower and more affordable and will have an upper limit.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to the excellent negotiating skills of Ms Niebler, from 1 July onwards, consumers will no longer be exploited.

However, measures to bring down roaming charges are still insufficient. Instead of setting maximum price limits for roaming services, we should establish a deadline for ending the existence of roaming tariffs within the European Union. Only this solution will guarantee that people have full freedom of movement within the Union while not exposing them to the costs currently associated with using all these modern means of communication.</p>
<p class="contents">Global telecommunications companies which currently provide services in the EU are today already able to operate across borders throughout all the Member States without incurring additional costs. The operation of roaming impacts directly on the average European. It directly creates artificial barriers to communication as well as barriers to travel, including tourist travel, business trips, educational trips and youth exchanges. It is in Europe’s interest to end roaming as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Roaming III Regulation is not so much a consequence of the constantly developing single market in the European Union as of the activities of the operators, who have been trying to maximise their profits at the cost of their clients. The activities of the mobile phone operators are another example which highlights the fact that free market principles do not always fulfil the hopes placed in them. It is increasingly evident that in certain circumstances, it is necessary for the regulator to intervene and force real competition to develop. No one, surely, is in any doubt that in this case, this is happening with clear social and economic benefits, because when individuals and firms have to pay lower bills, it helps stimulate the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, I am under no illusions that the operators will accept these proposals without resistance, but the example of the success of the previous regulation on reducing roaming costs is, I think, a conclusive argument in favour of this change. Furthermore, in the last few weeks, there have been huge transformations in this market segment, and we are dealing with a <span class="italic">de facto</span> oligopoly which is allowing a small number of pan-European brands to control the market. Therefore, in this situation, it is not just difficult to see real competition, but it is also hard to believe in the existence of barriers preventing cooperation between individual national operators that are part of the same corporation.</p>
<p class="contents">The lifestyle of the citizens of the world and of Europe is changing, and increasingly often we are having to work away from home for shorter or longer periods. All means of communication which make it easier to maintain contact with our family and friends should be easily and cheaply available. All means of communication which make it easier for employers and employees to stay in touch with each other should be widely available. One of these tools is cheap roaming. I do hope, however, that today’s debate and the Roaming III Regulation will not be the end of this work, but will just be another step which takes us closer to the goal of bringing down the costs of using telecommunications services as far as possible. Ms Niebler, I would like to compliment you and the shadow rapporteurs on the professional attitude you demonstrated during work on this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think one of the important achievements in this report is the fact that now, from 2014, we will be able to have what is called ‘local break-out’, meaning that we have a real structural reform changing the logic of the telecom markets in regard to Internet surfing and all those things that are more and more important today.</p>
<p class="contents">For me, it is still a paradox that in this most modern and dynamic market, the telecoms market, we still have 27 different national markets in the European Union where, in reality, we should have just one market able to form the basis for our global leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">We can discuss different price caps and we can discuss different ways of regulating how things are today, but the important thing is that, if we are opening the door for one European market in the European Union, with this local break-out, it will be possible for all of us to connect to the Internet when we are abroad in the European Union without, so to speak, phoning back home and paying these very expensive costs. We will be able to do this as we do with wi-fi.</p>
<p class="contents">So when the Danish Presidency or other presidencies come here to Brussels or Strasbourg, they will not have to get connected. We are the home country. They will be able to use the best possible offer in the country where we are and that will be the case not just for the presidencies, it will be the case for all citizens in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I think this achievement will also mean that we will be able to use all the opportunities that we are opening up today on the Internet for all mobile data traffic and that this will lay the ground for a more competitive Europe, but also a more connected Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In actual fact, we should have held this debate much earlier. However, I am pleased that we are having it right now. The last price cap for roaming services was set in July 2009, and there have been significant advances in technology since then. In spite of this, no attention has been paid to roaming at all, and we continue to pay the same prices even in 2012. Quite frankly, it is often much cheaper to take a taxi to get to your destination than to search for it on the Internet on an ordinary map, whether it be a hotel or other destination. Data transfer is playing an ever-increasing role in communication, in both business and private life. This is why I believe that this price limit needed to be set earlier, but I am pleased that it is happening now. I believe that these measures adopted at EU level will enable us to standardise communications systems across the EU in the 27 Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The EU is forced to impose cheaper prices for roaming services as companies keep pricing their services near the level of mandatory price ceilings. This demonstrates that competition is not working; roaming no longer makes any economic sense and consumers are paying up to four times the wholesale market prices charged by mobile operators to other mobile operators.

<p class="contents">As my good friend, Jens Rohde, said, irrespective of what your political convictions may be, we have seen that the telecommunications companies have not been capable of setting reasonable prices themselves. It has therefore been necessary for the Commission, Parliament and also the Council to take decisive and important decisions. This does not mean that making calls across borders will suddenly become cheap, but it does mean that it will be considerably cheaper than it was previously. This is good news for companies, which are required to create jobs and growth, but it is indeed also good news for all those who travel around in Europe, whether alone or with their families. I believe it is the experience of most people who have travelled with children or grandchildren that, when the bill comes, a few weeks later, the envelope contains a very unpleasant surprise.</p>
<p class="contents">It will now be safer, more secure and more consumer-friendly to use mobile telephony to make calls, send text messages and receive data. Therefore, the resolution that the European Parliament will adopt tomorrow is a very good example of the fact that, even in a crisis situation, we have a Europe that is aware that it has to take sound decisions for the sake of growth and consumer safety. Tomorrow will therefore be a very good day for the EU, and particularly for the 500 million citizens of the Union, and on behalf of the Council, I would like once again to thank Parliament and the Commission for their excellent cooperation, with the product of which I think we can all be satisfied. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Creating a roaming-free area in Europe must be our ultimate goal. I very much hope that we will be able to achieve this in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">I also hope, Ms Kroes, that we do not need a Roaming IV Regulation, as Mr Rübig has suggested. I hope, as a result of the structural measures and the competition which will now develop, that one provider will make a bold move and stop charging for roaming altogether. I hope that this will happen before the revision and before you submit a report here in 2016. I hope that the competitive market functions in such a way that the subject of roaming finally becomes a thing of the past.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to pass on my warm thanks. I am looking forward to the vote tomorrow and I hope that Parliament will give the report substantial support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This proposal for a regulation will help make life easier for mobile phone users with regard to prices, availability of options, quality and security. At the moment, neither European consumers nor the European economy are benefiting from excessive roaming charges and the low level of use of roaming services in the EU due to the high charges. This is why I think that introducing for the first time a cap on retail prices for mobile data services is a welcome step. Moreover, the new regulation will extend the obligation on mobile telecommunication companies to advise their own users when their roaming bill exceeds EUR 50, as well as inform them about the price of the roaming services being offered. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The calls brought no response, however, and the EU has decided to intervene in order to protect consumers through price regulation. In July 2011, the Commission proposed the third in the series of regulations on roaming. The aim of the reform is to reduce prices for international calls to the level of domestic tariffs. Healthy competition has not yet developed, and customers are still paying prices that are unreasonably high. The report on the development of the market for roaming services states that current charges are not sufficiently flexible to prevent users paying unreasonably high prices. In my opinion, the proposed reduction in charges is a step in the right direction. If we want genuinely to fulfil the vision of a single internal market, we must address the problems relating to roaming. Such an approach accords with the Europe 2020 strategy, the Single Market Act and the Digital Agenda for Europe. Electronic communications must be universally accessible and available at reasonable prices. For this reason, I support all measures aimed at eliminating unreasonable prices for roaming calls. There is no technical justification for the retention of roaming. Roaming tariffs should be completely scrapped. We must ensure that consumers are not ripped off by the large mobile operators. Their profits in this area are unreasonably high. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In celebration of Europe Day yesterday, however, one piece of good EU news has emerged: it will once again be cheaper to use mobile phones abroad next summer. A sense of proportion is to be brought to the shock that has left some people reeling upon receipt of their bill, when they discover they have faced inordinately high charges of several thousand euro, when roaming settings have been left on and random roaming has got very expensive. I know, because I was responsible for the regulation on roaming within the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. </p>
<p class="contents">The new regulation is to enter into force in July, and will cut prices to at least half their current levels by 2014. It will set price caps for roaming calls, for text messages and, for the first time, for data traffic also. It will also impose an obligation on telephone operators to inform consumers by text message when they are approaching the price ceilings which they themselves have set when they are outside the EU. In this way, we can also prevent shock charges outside the Union, where reasonable price ceilings cannot be regulated by law. In addition, the regulation proposes structural changes to promote much needed competition in the roaming market. The EU’s idea was the principle of the four freedoms: the purpose is to remove barriers to the free movement of workers, goods, services and capital. Now, those barriers have been removed once again. In the age of smartphones, it has been frustrating that their intelligence has had to be shut off just when it was needed most, while on the move under new circumstances in foreign countries. Soon, we will even be consulting maps and timetables and checking the best tips, wherever we happen to be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The regulation advances an innovative approach, because it proposes not only limits on prices, but also a structural change in the market. In addition, it will increase competitiveness between operators, stimulate the internal market and contribute to the mobility of citizens and the development of small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">Harmonisation of roaming charges is very good for the people who live in the EU, because many Europeans who live or travel outside their own country incur high costs when they make phone calls to their families. Starting in July, we will pay EUR 0.29, or a little over PLN 1.30, for making a call from a mobile phone while in another country, and the price of an incoming call shall not exceed EUR 0.08. Mobile phones should be mobile, but many people who live in the EU turn off their mobile phones, smartphones and tablets while travelling in the Union because they are afraid of the high costs of data roaming. Competition continues to be weak, and the operators are still applying excessive margins, particularly in the case of data roaming. Customers are currently having to pay several euro per megabyte, but now, as the summer holidays begin, they will be paying no more than EUR 0.70. Furthermore, they will be able themselves to choose the foreign network operator whose services they use. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The current charges for roaming services are also unrealistic. It is important that consumers are protected against the unclear pricing policies of mobile communications operators, for example, by means of the roaming initiative. Unfortunately, it is still easy to run up huge and unexpected bills on a mobile phone. Many operators still do not allow added value and data services to be blocked automatically or monthly cost limits to be agreed on, nor do they provide notification when young people exceed their free allowances. This represents a problem and not only because mobile phone users are increasingly becoming younger and, therefore, more inexperienced. Owners of mobile phones and smartphones can find themselves inadvertently and without their agreement taking out a mobile subscription as a result of supposedly free downloads or after clicking by mistake on the advertising that forms part of an app. The EU must ensure that consumer rights are respected by the mobile communications industry. For example, we need to reinforce the right to cancel a contract and guarantee that blocks can be applied to bills. Not least, users of smartphones and mobiles must have the right to agree to or reject a subscription that they have signed up to within a short period of time without incurring additional costs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although the resulting price limits will be reduced by tens of per cent, it is still only a partial success.

We all saw the increasing mobility of people in the EU, but using mobile devices abroad remained too expensive, especially for data transfer. This was an obstacle preventing small businesses and ordinary people from being integrated into the European family. This summer, European citizens will feel the reduction, and in just two years, roaming services will be at least half the price. The European Union needs such a policy in the current climate of crisis where measures are required to promote growth and the ever-closer integration of people and markets within the EU. I cannot overlook the fact either that the new roaming agreement provides for very strong measures to promote competition and enable more operators, including virtual operators, to enter this sector, without people having to change their telephone numbers and being charged for switching operators. I would go as far as to describe the developments in the roaming sector as some of the best news to come out lately, and the European Parliament deserves the main credit for this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, I welcome the proposals contained in the Roaming III Regulation, which enable these prices to be reduced. It should be remembered that removing barriers from the internal market and reducing costs inside the Union not only allows greater savings, but strengthens the competitiveness of the Union compared with other countries. It is also one of the main principles of the theory of monetary union which lies at the basis of the European Union. We should, therefore, continue our efforts, and instead of establishing a maximum price cap, we should work towards bringing a complete end to roaming within the European Union. The mobile operators are technically able to do this, which means that their financial results will not be affected by such decisions. Similar rules should also be introduced to cover Internet data transmission and Internet access while moving around the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
