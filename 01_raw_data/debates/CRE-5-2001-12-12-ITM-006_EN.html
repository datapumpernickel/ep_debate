<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 1 by Bart Staes (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0861_EN.html">H-0861/01</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Informal European Council meeting in Ghent on the Laeken declaration</span></p>
<p class="contents">On Wednesday, 4 July a representative of the Belgian Presidency of the EU spoke in positive terms of the role of constitutional regions in the process of European integration. You can count on it, and I am speaking on my own behalf and on behalf of Belgium, that we will do our utmost to broach this subject. But there are also 14 other Member States, and it will therefore be important that the constitutional regions ensure they themselves work closely in harmony, Ms Neyts stated. In a joint declaration issued at the end of May, seven constitutional regions expressed a clear, united position in favour of greater Treaty-based involvement in the European project. At the informal European Council meeting in Ghent on 19 October, EU Member States promoted the Convention procedure to prepare for further reform of the EU/EC Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Council endorse the request by Catalonia, Salzburg, Scotland, Flanders, Wallonia, Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia to be directly involved in the Convention to prepare for further reform of the EU/EC Treaties? If not, why is it opposed to greater Treaty-based involvement of constitutional regions in mapping out the future of Europe?</p>
<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 2 by Nelly Maes (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0862_EN.html">H-0862/01</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Regions' powers in a globalised world</span></p>
<p class="contents">In Nice an additional Declaration on the future of the Union was annexed to the Treaty. It offered, inter alia, the prospect of a more precise delimitation of powers between the EU and the Member States, reflecting the principle of subsidiarity. I am not alone in thinking that regions with greater powers within the European Union are a precondition for a more workable, democratic and transparent Europe. Furthermore, such European regions are closer to citizens and form a new framework with which the latter can identify, preventing movements such as that of the 'democratic globalists' becoming a movement feeding off anti-European sentiment. The Council, the European Commission and the European Parliament have a duty, at this key point in the process of European integration, to be resolute and united in opting for a clear division of powers between the EU, the Member States and the regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Council intend to give concrete shape to the concept of the delimitation of powers between the Union, the Member States and the regions at Laeken? If so, how precise is this delimitation to be, and will adequate account be taken of the subsidiarity principle? If not, does the Council consider itself to be sufficiently armed in the face of the growing gap between European citizens and institutions and in the face of growing antipathy within certain movements to all forms of expansion in scale whether at European or world level?</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Informal European Council meeting in Ghent on the Laeken declaration</span></p>
<p class="contents">On Wednesday, 4 July a representative of the Belgian Presidency-in-Office of the EU spoke in positive terms of the role of different nationalities and constitutional regions in the process of European integration. You can count on it, and I am speaking on my own behalf and on behalf of Belgium, that we will do our utmost to broach this subject. But there are also 14 other Member States, and it will therefore be important that the constitutional regions ensure they themselves work closely in harmony, Ms Neyts stated. At the informal European Council meeting in Ghent on 19 October, the Laeken declaration and the future of the European Union were discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with the process of establishing a constitution for the European Union, which, for some, goes hand in hand with simplification of the Treaties, does the Council intend to ensure that the principle of constitutional pluralism is enshrined in the Laeken declaration, so that the constitutions of the Member States and their nationalities and states exist independently of, and do not depend for their validity on, a possible EU constitution?</p>

It is indeed up to the European Council to adopt the practical rules and the framework of ideas for the Convention which has to prepare the forthcoming IGC. This framework should encompass, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, the list of the issues to be discussed, as well as give indications as to how these issues could be tackled most effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council will not confine itself to the description of the above-mentioned elements, but will also remind us that the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference must find concrete answers to the questions raised.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in the light of the Declaration of Nice regarding the Union’s future, it is obvious that one of the topics that will need to be discussed in the next few months is a more clearly defined demarcation of powers between the European Union and the Member States pursuant to the subsidiarity principle.</p>
<p class="contents">Back in July, a number of you already asked the Council – through myself as its personal representative – various questions about these constitutional aspects, and I responded to you at the time. In my response, not only did I officially refer to the preparation of the future IGC, but also to the presidency’s report to the European Council of Gothenburg, in which numerous initiatives are mentioned that are taking place in the Member States in which various regional entities were involved, as well as events that are organised within the framework of the debate in the Committee of the Regions on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency has now read the resolution on the strengthening of the roles of the regions within the European Union with great interest. The resolution was adopted in Liège on 15 November by the Conference of Presidents of the regions with legislative powers, as they will be referred to henceforth. The Committee of the Regions’ opinion which pertains to the participation of that Committee to the future Convention is now also known. However, no decision has been taken on the issues regarding the organisation of the debate and the topics which need to be discussed. As I have already said, these are matters to be dealt with by the European Council of Laeken.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking for myself, I should like to add that I am very keen to find out when the debate within the Committee of the Regions will be opened, for this is an issue that is being avoided at all costs by those involved. Outside the Committee, a number of its members complain about the fact that surely, a distinction should be drawn between those who have this legislative power and those who have not. The Committee itself is keeping tight-lipped. I have to say, I have some qualms on the matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We would be delighted if you were to give us an idea of what will be discussed at that Council. Prime Minister Verhofstadt has toured the capital cities and paid a visit to Madrid yesterday. Madrid is a difficult customer in this regional issue. The Spanish Government has more or less made the fight against terrorism its number one priority. In Spain, defending the rights, the real rights of nations and regions is often considered as terrorism or part of terrorism, and this is of course unacceptable. This is not a European stance that we can accept. I would very specifically like to ask you whether the difficulties which the Spanish very often cause with regard to the representation in the Committee of the Regions have meanwhile been resolved and secondly, and whether they will indeed not be opposed to the concept of ‘constitutional region’ being mentioned in the Declaration of Laeken. I would be very obliged if you would look into this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to your own challenging question about your opinion on the Committee of the Regions, I would like to state that, as you know, the constitutional regions are very much in the minority in the Committee of the Regions, and it is of course unnecessary to stage one’s own defeats. The Committee of the Regions was composed in such a way as to ensure that the constitutional regions would form a minority, and I would want them to be considered as federal states that, in the course of history, have never been given the chance to develop into Member States. If you allow me, I would also point out that there will be a number of small states that will soon be joining, including Malta, Cyprus, Slovakia, etc. You will understand that the constitutional regions would feel cheated if they were not to have any rights at all in this company. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was the first point I wanted to make.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I have never been aware of the fact that being in a minority is a reason not to engage in a certain fight which is deemed justified. The times may have changed, but we used to think differently about this. It is, of course, true that the regions with legislative powers are in the minority in the Committee of the Regions, but I would question whether this was done on purpose. I do not believe so, but this is a matter of opinion. I can only note that the discussion on this point is far more heated outside the Committee than it is inside. This is my observation, and maybe this may change one day, but not in the foreseeable future. I have my own thoughts about a fight which is not even fought at the right forum, but this is my personal opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Maes, I have read the text, the appeal to the Belgian Presidency which was published either yesterday or the day before. I cannot share the opinion that regions are a kind of Member State, as it were, but which, by a stroke of really bad luck, ended up not being Member States. This is a reasoning which could, of course, be taken to extremes, bordering the absurd. The reply I received from a State Minister of the Indian State of Andarpradesh to my question how many people lived in that province, will always stay with me. He said 79 million. 79 million for Andarpradesh, just imagine. This compares to a large Member State in Europe. But this is not how things work, evidently. It is the statute according to public and international law of an entity that determines the position of this entity in the hierarchy.</p>
<p class="contents">Belgium has found a solution with which you are familiar. I also believe that we are perfectly entitled to propagate this solution or to publicise it to the others, which is what Belgium did. It is therefore also the other Member States which, if necessary, should do this for their own delegations and should not expect the Union to solve the problem which they have, as yet, been unable to solve within their own borders, but, honourable Members, this is a strictly personal opinion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Do you not think, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, that, by virtue of the mandate laid down in the Treaty of Nice, that in the Laeken Declaration, this question of European diversity, of the different cultural, social and political realities, should be specifically included as an important part of the debate to take place during the years 2002 and 2003 on the future of the Union and the division of competences between the institutions, in order to seek and find the best possible structure, which will allow us to share, without tension or conflict, the various, necessary levels of competence and sovereignty in existence in Europe? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, we have the cultural, linguistic and other diversities which constitute one of the greatest resources of the European Union and of Europe in general. I am aware that these diversities are presented as one of the European Union’s most important assets in the present version of the text. This poses no problem.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we have the question of whether we should depart from what, to date, has been current European Union practice. The various institutions of the European Union do not concern themselves in assessing the constitutional arrangements of Member States, providing of course that these arrangements are compatible with fundamental principles, such as human rights and the protection of minorities and so on. This is our ongoing policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we should not confuse respect for diversities with a departure of this nature. In essence, this would involve breaking a long tradition. I regard this as a wise tradition, although this is merely my personal opinion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a solution that you are pleased with and I welcome this. For those who are not directly involved, Belgium’s constitutional structure is of a complexity that pays tribute to the ingenuity of your public law specialists, but it is a solution which I would describe as bespoke. As you know, I support independence for Catalonia and I do not think this is a viable solution for Catalonia, for instance, within the Spanish State.</p>
<p class="contents">The question I have, therefore, is very simple. Constitutional regions aside, although I recognise that these present some difficulties, could we not include, in the future European constitution, a right that, in my view, is elementary, which is the right to self-determination. Do the Catalan people not have the right to self-determination, will they not have the right, one day, to their own State within the European Union? Given that Slovenia will soon be a member of the EU, why should Catalonia not be a member as well? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Demand for drugs to fight anthrax</span></p>
<p class="contents">The anthrax crisis in the USA has produced a rise in demand for Cipro, a patented drug manufactured by Bayer. The Canadian Government's response was simply to ask the country's industry to produce 'copies' of the drug. The US Administration appears to be pondering the same course of action as US legislation apparently allows the Administration, when there is a need for a patented drug, to ignore the restrictions imposed by the patent and authorise its manufacture. Evidently double standards are operating in regard to the developing countries' request for a reduction in the price of patented drugs and a relaxation of the legislation protecting patents in order to treat AIDS and other diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">Has the Council considered what action it would take in the event of a rise in demand for a particular drug, as has occurred in the USA? Is it consistent with Community law for a Member State to have US-type legislation which allows it to ignore the restrictions imposed by patents? Will it respond positively to the developing countries' request for a price reduction and a relaxation of patent rights, which would clearly be beneficial not only for the developing countries but also for European and American consumers? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also reiterate that Article 152 – formerly article 129 of the Treaty establishing the European Community – specifies, in general terms, that Community action in the area of health shall supplement national policies. The Community shall encourage cooperation between the Member States in the areas mentioned in the Treaty and, if necessary, shall lend support to their action. In this context, the Community shall also ensure a high level of human health protection by defining and implementing all the policies and actions.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Fourth WTO Ministerial Conference, which took place in Doha between 9 to 14 November this year, adopted a Declaration on the TRIPS agreement and public health. In the Declaration, the ministerial conference acknowledged, on the one hand, the gravity of public health problems, particularly afflicting many developing countries and least-developed countries and, on the other hand, that intellectual property protection is also important for the development of new medicines.</p>
<p class="contents">In this Declaration, WTO members agreed that the TRIPS agreement does not prevent Members from taking the appropriate measures to protect public health and affirmed that the Agreement can and should be interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of WTO Members’ right to protect public health, and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for all.</p>
<p class="contents">More specifically, the Declaration recognises that the flexibilities in the TRIPS agreement include the right of each Member to grant compulsory licences and to determine what constitutes a national emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency, it being understood that public health crises, including those relating to HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other epidemics, can represent a national emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Declaration reaffirms the commitment of developed-country WTO Members to provide incentives to their enterprises and institutions to promote and encourage technology transfer to least-developed countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Declaration also specifies that the least-developed country Members will not be obliged, with respect to pharmaceutical products, to apply Sections 5 (Trademarks) and 7 (Protection of non-divulged information) of Part II of the TRIPS Agreement or to enforce rights provided for under these Sections until 1 January 2016, without prejudice to the right of the least-developed country Members to seek other extensions of the transition periods.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add that, in the Declaration, WTO Member States made a commitment to propose, before July 2002, genuine solutions that could be consolidated in order to resolve the problem of those developing countries and least-developed countries that do not have manufacturing capacities for medicines. There is the problem of possible parallel imports or other measures which must enable these countries to have access to these medicines at a price that is reasonable, and the lowest possible.</p>
<p class="contents">This will be done between now and next summer and I assure you that we will have to work like Trojans to achieve this. Time is not on our side. The problem is extremely complex, but this is a very important commitment, because it relates to an aspect of the problem which could not be dealt with by the agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On 25 October 2001, Parliament’s plenary tabled an amendment to its resolution on the progress achieved in the implementation of the CFSP<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, as a result of which paragraph 33 of that resolution now reads: ‘insists, furthermore, that the European Union should cooperate actively in settling the conflict in Western Sahara in accordance with the United Nations resolutions, along the lines requested by the European Parliament in its resolution of 16 March 2000<a href="#def_1_2" name="ref_1_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and the Statement by the German presidency of the Council of June 1999’.</p>

Does it believe that such joint action would enable the positions of its members – particularly Spain and France – to be coordinated in support of the UN Peace Plan?

As was also stated at the time, the Council is delighted with the efforts the European Parliament has made to reach a sustainable solution which is acceptable to all parties involved in the conflict in the Western Sahara. This solution forms a crucial goal for the stability and welfare in that region. The Council fully and actively supports the process which is now taking place within the framework of the United Nations, as formulated in the resolutions of the Security Council, particularly the efforts made by Mr James Baker. In Resolution No 1359 of 29 June, the Security Council clearly marked the path to be followed. In this connection, the extension of the mandate of the MINURSO was significant, because this has made it possible to continue the present consultation among the parties, under the auspices of Mr Baker. The presidency is in contact with Mr Baker. The leading role in this process is being played by the United Nations. In this connection, the Council is prepared to mediate in order to create a climate of trust among the parties and hence to facilitate a sustainable solution, but it does not intend to take the place of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is acutely aware of the great sensitivity surrounding this dossier and of the need for observing strict neutrality. This is to avoid the Council being used by one of the parties involved as an instrument, which would only have a negative impact on the search for a solution, as well as on the role of the European Union in that region. Moreover, the Council is urging the parties to take a number of urgent, humanitarian measures, such as permitting family visits and liberating political prisoners.</p>
<p class="contents">Whichever solution is opted for, it will have to be founded on broad compliance with democratic principles and respect for human rights, including the disquieting issue of refugees, but also of Moroccan prisoners, notably when these people need urgent care, in general, and medical care, in particular. In addition, I should like to emphasise that here too, the European Union is by far the largest donor of humanitarian aid to the refugees from the Western Sahara. Since 1996, the Commission has set aside EUR 56 million for this cause. The visit by King Mohammed VI to the Western Sahara has not impacted on the above-mentioned approach in any way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This may be the first time that this House has heard a political statement from the Council which goes much further than the usual strictly formal statements on the conflict in the Western Sahara. This answer with real content is very welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">But I have to tell you the following: having listened to this response, I am under the legitimate impression that in the Council too much weight may be given to a view of the conflict in the Western Sahara that does not consider that the solution to it may only be based on compliance with the United Nations Settlement Plan, which includes holding a referendum on the self-determination of the Sahrawi people, a referendum that has been blocked for many years by one of the parties concerned, Morocco.</p>
<p class="contents">You talked about many things: for example, the latest Security Council resolution, but at no time did you refer to the United Nations peace plan. Neither did you refer to the referendum and, also, you have insisted too much on some aspects, whilst forgetting others, for example the violation of human rights in the occupied territories of the Western Sahara. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have a feeling that the Western Sahara issue, to which I have devoted over half my political life so far, is actually a tragedy.

<p class="contents">I must of course take note of the response that what is done in the UN must be adhered to. I believe, though, that the European Union and the Member States must, for the sake of a common foreign and security policy, choose a coordinated way of proceeding, one that is in accordance with the UN peace plan. Following the visit of King Mohammed VI, events have followed in rapid succession. There has also been a visit to the Western Sahara by the French President, Jacques Chirac, who, in defiance of all international legal positions, said that the Western Sahara was made up of the southern provinces of Morocco – a point we are discussing in the Council of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Council's report assessing the progress achieved by the countries of the region towards the conditions for European integration, which was approved on 11 June 2001, stated that the process of the return of refugees and displaced persons to Bosnia-Herzegovina should be speeded up and that the measures to create the proper conditions to enable people to return under the correct circumstances, in accordance with the Dayton-Paris agreement, should be strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, first and foremost, the responsibility of the local and national authorities to take the necessary measures. The European Union will certainly use the monitoring process to follow this issue and, where applicable, to assess whether, on the one hand, the progress made in respecting the conditions and, on the other hand, the level of relations established and the level of technical and economic assistance are still appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">The 1995 Dayton-Paris Peace agreement, which brought an end to the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, established the post of High Representative who is responsible for monitoring the implementation of this agreement, amongst other things. The current post-holder, Mr Wolfgang Petric, has not previously hesitated to dismiss local leaders from their duties when it turned out that these leaders were opposed to implementing the peace agreement, including Annex VII, which provides for the return of refugees and displaced persons. He did so in accordance with the powers granted him by the Ministerial Conference of the Council implementing the Bonn peace accord in December 1997. On several occasions, the Council strongly supported the efforts made by Mr Petric to fulfil his mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the material support that the European Union is providing to assist the return and resettlement of these people, this question is primarily a matter for the Commission, which manages Community assistance. However, the Council understands that, since 1998, in line with the recommendations of the High Representative’s Office and the Return and Reconstruction working group, increasing funds have been granted to support the return of minority groups to Republika Srpska. This area should also continue to occupy its rightful and important position within the framework of Community assistance provided under the CARDS 2000-2006 programme, Article 2 of which explicitly mentions aid for the return of refugees and displaced persons.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you, as we near the end of six months of holding the presidency, that the Council and its various members attach extreme importance to the issue of the return and reintegration of refugees in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but also in other areas of the Balkans where this issue unfortunately persists. The tense situation appears to be gradually easing and the number of people returning to and resettling in the area will increase. Of course, the same amount will not return to each area, but there is no escaping the fact that numbers are on the increase. We shall continue to attach great importance to this issue and this item is on the agenda of all the meetings where it can be discussed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would just like to put two specific questions. First: Is it possible for the Council to try and find a precise figure for the number of refugees and expellees who have to date returned to the Republika Srpska? There were agreements about this, which can in fact only be monitored by finding out exactly how many people have gone back. I would ask you, if you are unable to do that today, to perhaps let me have that information in writing.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point relates to tangible aid for the minorities. I have heard that, especially in the Banja Luka region, the Catholic Church is intensively engaging in care for the sick across cultural boundaries and in many activities in the spheres of social welfare and agriculture, and that funds promised for these have simply not been granted. That is the second question I am putting, and I am keen to learn whether you know anything about this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: EU and international measures providing for the return of illegally transferred assets</span></p>
<p class="contents">Under the terms of the Tampere Council conclusions the Member States committed themselves to taking concrete steps to trace, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of crime. Member States were urged also to implement fully the provisions of the Money Laundering Directive (which includes the conversion or transfer of property and the identification of the customers of credit and financial institutions), the 1990 Strasbourg Convention and the Financial Task Force recommendations. They were also urged to adopt the revised directive on money laundering which is now under conciliation. The Council called for the competences of Europol to be extended to money laundering in general and for common standards to be developed to prevent the use of corporations or entities registered outside the jurisdiction of the EU in the hiding of criminal proceeds and money laundering. EU States have signed the UN Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime which commits governments to adopt within their domestic legal systems the measures necessary to enable the confiscation of the proceeds of crime.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Council consider that the above EU, UN and Council of Europe measures and strategies confirm that the European Union does have a legitimate interest in relation to money illegally transferred by former dictators, i.e.. Nigeria, and will the Council now undertake to ensure that these monies in banks throughout the EU are returned to the democratically elected Government of Nigeria? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The specific aim of these measures is to combat the laundering of money and to seize the proceeds of crime. Since the events of 11 September, a special effort has been made in the fight against funding terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Alongside this, there are a multitude of other instruments, including the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters of 1959 and the EU Convention of 2000 on the same topic. Both treaties contain a number of general regulations in the field of cooperation among states and this package of instruments also undoubtedly contributes to the fight against financial crime.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, reference can be made to a number of instruments in the field of substantive law, such as, for example, the framework decision on the fight against forgery.</p>
<p class="contents">On 16 October of this year, the Council convened in a joint formation of Ecofin and Justice and Social Affairs. On that occasion, the Council laid down the decision to adopt a protocol as part of the Convention of 29 May 2000 on mutual assistance in criminal matters between the Member States of the European Union. This protocol considerably improves cooperation among the Member States in the fight against economic and financial crime and, in particular, the fight against money laundering, corruption and forgery, and it provides for broad agreement concerning the dissemination of information concerning financial transactions, accounts and bank details.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States have committed themselves to ratifying this protocol by the end of next year at the latest. I cannot answer the specific question concerning the repatriation of capital illegally transferred to banks of the Union by former dictators, since this question falls outside the scope of the Council, as the honourable Member was notified in the first part-session of October 2001, in answer to an identical question he then posed to the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We therefore examine whether the mechanisms which ensure that a state can be considered a constitutional state are in place, or not, as the case may be, and close attention is also paid to the quality of the judiciary. For example, individual reports on the situation in a candidate country may state that, so far, judges receive inadequate training and are not paid enough and that this inevitably encourages inadmissible practices and such like. </p>

The EU is therefore opposed to the death penalty in all cases and it has agreed to work towards its universal abolition. The EU is concerned that approximately 90 States keep this punishment, although only a minority – thirty countries or so, one of which is the United States – continues to carry out executions every year.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1998, as part of its objective to universally abolish the death penalty, the European Union drew up a series of guidelines to specify the circumstances in which it should undertake specific and targeted actions. In countries where the death penalty still exists, the Union is working to progressively limit its application and insists that the punishment be carried out whilst observing specific minimum standards. I know that this is only partly limiting the unbearable awfulness of the act, but, even in such horrible circumstances, this is how things must be done…</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is closely monitoring the situation in the United States, where numerous executions take place. In 2001, steps were taken to help a number of people on death row, in line with the European Union’s guidelines, in Georgia, Oklahoma and Texas. In addition, in the autumn of 2000, the Union decided, for the first time, to intervene as <span class="italic">amicus curiae</span> in a trial before the Supreme Federal Court involving a condemned man, in order to raise before the Court the issue of the legality in international law of the sentencing to death of a person who was a minor at the time of the events. The Presidency-in-Office of the Union submitted another request to intervene as <span class="italic">amicus curiae</span> for Alexander Williams, who was condemned to death for a crime that he committed when he was under 18 years of age. The matter is still before the Supreme Court of Georgia. In another case – Atkins v Virginia – the European Union intends to make another request to intervene as <span class="italic">amicus curiae</span> before the Supreme Court in order to reaffirm its position on the application of the death penalty to people suffering from mental illness.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is aware of the details of the Housel affair and, in particular, of the fact that a judgement by the Supreme Court of the United States could be handed down before the end of the year. We would like to emphasise that, for those facing the death penalty who are nationals of a Member State, the European Union acts at the request of that Member State, which is best placed to judge whether it is appropriate for the Community to intervene. At this stage, the Council has not yet received a request from the United Kingdom to assist Mr Housel. The Council was informed that the United Kingdom is very actively monitoring this matter, in conjunction with Mr Housel’s lawyers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a Member of this House you will understand why we need to call upon the solidarity and the common sense of all Members. I pay very close attention to the comments made out loud.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we should all give thanks to Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck for the extraordinary degree of cooperation she has shown over these last six months. I am sure that her former position as a Member of this House has increased her sensitivity in this regard, including her willingness to answer Members’ questions. Thank you very much.</p>
