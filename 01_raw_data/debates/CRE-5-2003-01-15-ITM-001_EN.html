<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Yiannitsis,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is now a year since the Bonn Agreement was signed in 2001 and, as we look back over what has already been done and what has yet to be done in order to ensure it is fully implemented, I would point out that this Agreement laid the foundations for a new, modern Afghan state and that there is cause for reserved satisfaction with the progress it has made so far.</p>
<p class="contents">Once a transitional authority and administration had been set up, an emergency Loya Jirga was convened and elected a president. A Judicial Commission and an Independent Human Rights Commission have been set up. A central bank has been established and has introduced a national currency. A drafting committee has been set up as a forerunner to a Constitutional Commission. A proposal has been adopted for a national development framework, which will be used as a guide for rebuilding and improving the situation in the country. President Karzai has issued a decree creating an Afghan national army, an important step towards Afghan ownership in the field of security and stability. On 22 December 2002, Afghanistan and its six neighbours signed the Kabul Declaration of Good Neighbourly Relations, in which they agreed not to interfere in each other’s internal affairs; this will do a great deal to foster peace and stability in the region. Generally speaking, President Karzai and the Afghan Transitional Administration have achieved substantial results and the Bonn Process is on the right track.</p>
<p class="contents">During the Petersberg Conference on 2 December reaffirming the commitment to supporting the Bonn Agreement on Afghanistan and inject new impetus into efforts to rebuild the country, a declaration was issued containing a clear reference to the objectives and timetable for applying the Bonn Process, introducing a new constitution and holding elections in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the Afghan Transitional Administration and the international community, however, still have a great many challenges to meet between now and then. Over the past six months there have been a number of reforms, some visible reconstruction and limited restoration of the balance of power both within the central administration and between the centre and the regions. Progress needs to be made in these sectors in order to boost the confidence of the Afghan people, which is the key to support for the administration. The whole idea behind the Bonn Agreement was that transitional arrangements should be based on traditional, local, national and religious structures in Afghanistan. And every effort must be made to ensure there is proper representation, in accordance with rules introduced by the central administration.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the administration will need to introduce even greater order over coming months, keep a lid on hostilities and improve how the institutions function, because otherwise it risks incurring the disappointment of the people, with the risk of their turning their back on the central administration, relaxing in their efforts to meet the demands of the international community and jeopardising the efforts being made to achieve the objectives of the Bonn Agreement. By definition the administration is fragmented, with its members coming as they do from every corner of the country, which is why it is vital for it to consolidate its efforts and speed up the process to rebuild the country. One way of supporting the central administration is to ensure that all aid is channelled through it; this will affirm its authority to the entire country and ensure that neighbouring countries and local leaders are on board.</p>
<p class="contents">Security continues to be a priority and we feel that all the Afghan groups should be encouraged to solve their grievances in a peaceful manner. We share the view of the Afghan people that, as long as there is a state of insecurity, the degree of progress hoped for has still not been made. Rebuilding the country’s economy should also be a priority. The Afghan authorities need to work with the International Monetary Fund and introduce an efficient and cohesive macroeconomic and monetary framework within which stable economic development can be fostered and donors’ contributions invested. As part of this, we need to encourage the Tokyo donors to make the promised funds available through the national investment budget presented by the Afghan administration.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, Community aid to Afghanistan will continue to be provided on terms dictated by the basic principles and values we subscribe to as members of western society. Our terms are geared to achieving the aims of the Bonn Agreement and, by extension, ensuring all sides in Afghanistan comply with the procedure set up to achieve peace, a representative government and stability, convict terrorists and stop the illicit production and trafficking of narcotics. Community aid must be geared to rebuilding a stable nation, improving the food supply and supporting the return of refugees and exiles.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless democratic values, pluralism and the respect for human rights, including women’s rights, are strengthened, there can be no social or political development in Afghanistan. We are encouraging the Afghan Transitional Administration, in close consultation with the international community, to establish verifiable benchmarks and timetables to ensure the full implementation of the Bonn Agreement. The Council has already expressed its appreciation for the role Turkey assumed as lead nation for the international peacekeeping force and we would like to commend Germany and the Netherlands for agreeing to take over the command of ΙSAF for the next six months and wish them every success with this difficult mission.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to reiterate the European Union’s commitment, in cooperation with the United Nations, to help Afghanistan eliminate the illicit production and trafficking of narcotics through accelerated implementation of reconstruction programmes, including in poppy-growing areas, the development of law-enforcement institutions, and provision of an alternative, better livelihood for the local people.</p>
<p class="contents">If Afghanistan is to enter modern statehood, it needs to reform its security, administrative, judicial, financial and social domains. We welcome the fact that a constitutional drafting committee has been set up to draft a constitution which will modernise the judicial system and protect human rights. However, we note that the Civil Service Commission is not yet fully functioning. The European Union is committed to contributing to the work of these bodies. The Judicial Commission needs to be strengthened if it is to improve the procedural system. We welcome Italy’s contribution here in organising the conference on the Afghan legal system in Rome last December. We need timetables and benchmarks here in order to ensure the provisions of the Bonn agreement are applied. Activating the constitutional drafting committee and adopting an electoral law so that elections can be held by June 2004 are immediate priorities here and the presidency will continue to monitor these issues through the European Union’s special representative in Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">2003 will be a crucial year for Afghanistan and will most likely decide the future shape of the country. During 2003, President Karzai will need to push through the reforms needed for fast reconstruction and rebuilding, curtail the powers of local leaders, draft a modern, working constitution based on the principles of honest administration, convene a constituent Loya Jirga and start preparations for elections in 2004, so that the Afghan people can realise their aspirations for peace and progress in Afghanistan and determine their own future, free from violence and fear. We have reiterated the European Union’s continued commitment to delivering a substantial contribution to the reconstruction of Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, may I remind you that, in its conclusions of 4 December, the Council invited the High Representative and the European Union’s special representative, Mr Vendrell, to follow closely the implementation of the Petersberg commitments and, in cooperation with the Commission, to make recommendations for further actions that the European Union can undertake in support of the Afghan Transitional Administration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I very much welcome this opportunity, with my colleague Mr Ionitsis, to discuss progress in Afghanistan over the past year. As I said to the Foreign Affairs Committee in December, the changes have been in many respects dramatic, and do offer a real chance to build a stable democracy. But timing is critical; there is – as the Minister properly underlined – a limited window of opportunity which we have to exploit. Unless President Karzai and his Government manage to strengthen their position throughout the country, then there is a risk that these early gains will be lost.</p>
<p class="contents">But before turning to the substantial challenges that lie ahead, I would like to say something about the successes of 2002, successes accomplished in extremely difficult circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">Only a year ago donors met in Tokyo to pledge over USD 1.8 billion for 2002. Much has since been achieved in Afghanistan. In the summer, President Karzai was elected by an Emergency Loya Jirga to lead the Afghanistan Transitional Authority; constitutional and judicial commissions have been established; a new currency has been introduced, and the process of recovery and of reconstruction is well under way with increasingly strong leadership from the Afghan Government.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community has not only honoured the pledges made at Tokyo, but, not least in comparison with some problems we have experienced in the past, the speed of disbursement has been remarkable.</p>
<p class="contents">The track record of the European Union and the European Commission has been, I think one can fairly say, particularly impressive. By early December, EUR 755 million of the total European Union commitment of over EUR 830 million had actually been disbursed. The Commission has played a leading role in co-ordinating the European Union effort and we have been actively involved in building up a strategic dialogue on Afghanistan with the United States and other G-8 partners.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that I am very proud of the quality of the EC assistance programme and the speed with which it has been delivered. It is a fine example of a successful linkage between relief and recovery, and it has been a good test case for the reform of the management of the external service. It is also fair to pay tribute to the excellent staff we have at the newly set-up EC office in Kabul.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to pay tribute to the Special Representative, who brings so much knowledge and so much expertise to his extremely challenging work.</p>
<p class="contents">In more concrete terms, our development programme of over EUR 205 million in 2002 has helped to finance: firstly, the operation of 238 health clinics and over 450 primary schools as part of the Government’s 2002 Back to School campaign; secondly, the clearance of landmines and unexploded bombs from more than 8 000 square kilometres of land; thirdly, the return of some 17 000 key public sector workers, including the return to service of over 2 000 teachers and 2 000 nurses and doctors and fourthly, the creation of jobs. Through our rural recovery and urban rehabilitation programmes, we are financing over 3 million person days of work this year alone, and I should also refer to the rebuilding of infrastructure. The Commission, along with the Swedish government and Pakistan, has already started the emergency rehabilitation and reconstruction of the Kabul-Jalalabad-Torkham road and full reconstruction will start next year<span class="bold">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">In addition, our humanitarian aid has helped to support the return of over 1.8 million refugees to Afghanistan. Over EUR 70 million has been spent by ECHO in 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">That means that the money which we have spent in total in Afghanistan over the last twelve months, the money which is voted by this Parliament, now stands at EUR 275 million. I do not think anybody can suggest that we have not played – or are not still playing – our full part so far in the reconstruction of Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">For 2003, the challenge will be to consolidate this early progress. The Commission will continue to play a leading role. We anticipate total development assistance of about EUR 185 million, and there will also be continued humanitarian assistance from ECHO of between EUR 45 and 55 million. That means that we will be spending in Afghanistan this year, on present estimates, between EUR 230 and 240 million. Colleagues will recall that at Tokyo on behalf of the Commission I pledged EUR 1 billion over five years in reconstruction assistance. That is not including the humanitarian assistance figures that I have mentioned, so the total contribution of the European Commission, from your taxpayers' money, to Afghanistan, quite apart from contributions from Member States, will be well in excess of EUR 1 billion for the reconstruction of Afghanistan. Some people in the past have derided that sort of work as nation-building or social work. Frankly, when I look back, I think if we had done more of it in the 1980s and 90s, we would not have the problems that we have had recently in Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Success in 2003 will hinge on three key issues. First, the need to improve internal security. Second, the need to ensure human rights are fully respected, including those of women and minorities. When I visited Kabul last year, one of the most moving visits that I paid was to a school in the extraordinary bomb site that is southern and western Kabul, where young women had returned to schooling for the first time in six years and were sitting in classrooms without blackboards, without textbooks, being taught physics. I must say the commitment and dedication of the staff, and of those young women, was remarkable: anybody who ever thought that it would have been right for us to stand by and allow Taliban rule to continue indefinitely should perhaps have been present on that occasion. The third key issue for us is the need for continued long-term commitment from donors and for effective coordination. The argument about coordination is one which has been extremely well made by Members of this Parliament, and I will say another word about it a little later if I may. Internal security is critical not only for the future of Afghanistan but also to the delivery of aid. Aid workers must be able to work without fear of recrimination. In this context, I would like to express my strong concern about the death of one aid worker, and the serious injury of two others, in Kabul just before Christmas. I think sometimes we underestimate the amounts of courage and commitment which are required for aid workers working in these sort of circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">President Karzai’s commitment at the 2 December Bonn II Conference to form an Afghan National Army is a welcome step forward, as is the recent signing of the Kabul Declaration on good-neighbourly relations. The Government must press on quickly with the creation of a National Army, but clearly this will not be achieved overnight.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, the international community must do everything possible to support President Karzai and to strengthen the Government’s position across all regions of the country, including in the fight against opium poppy production. The Minister has already referred to our concern about this. If you look at the present UN figures, there is very considerable reason not just for concern, but alarm. There has been a substantial increase in the amount of hectares under opium production, a rapid increase in the farm-gate price of poppies, a ballooning in the production of heroin with implications not only for surrounding countries, but for European countries, and for the funding of organised crime and terrorism in the region and beyond. I believe that we have to give far more attention to this problem in the next year or so, a problem which directly affects political authority in Afghanistan itself. Overall, as agreed at the Bonn II meeting, we need tangible benchmarks to measure progress. These are critical not only to shape our vision of Afghanistan’s future, but to provide support to the reformers within the Government.</p>
<p class="contents">This is of critical importance for human rights<span class="bold">. </span>Recent reports highlight the unacceptable situation faced by minority groups, and women, in some parts of the country. We must secure fundamental change by ensuring that the establishment of the independent Human Rights Commission translates into tangible change on the ground, and that the new Constitution enshrines human rights for all, including women. Clearly, these issues are vital in view of the general elections which are scheduled for mid 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">We also cannot hope to deliver sustainable change without good donor coordination. We must all continue to give a strong and consistent message to the Afghan Government about the need to tackle internal security, to respect human rights for everyone and to set benchmarks for progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish by stressing that we must be prepared for the long haul – regardless of other events that may unfold in 2003. Rebuilding a cohesive state will take time, as will improving the unacceptably low levels of education and healthcare. I want to assure Parliament of my personal commitment to these tasks. I paid a first trip to Kabul in May 2002 and will be returning this February as part of a trip to the Central Asian Republics. I intend to make one of the priorities of my visit the discussion of the better coordination of donor efforts, including the work done by NGOs. The support received from this House has been very reassuring, especially in helping to secure funding for Afghanistan for 2003. I look forward to an equally rewarding working relationship with Parliament over the coming year and I want to express my great gratitude for the informed and thoughtful contribution which Parliament has made to the discussion of these issues. It is sometimes difficult for the international community to focus on more than one or two blips on its radar screen at any one moment. There is a real danger of us assuming that, because we do not read as much about Afghanistan on the front pages of the newspapers, our job in Afghanistan is, as we would say colloquially in English, done and dusted. It is far from that. There is a huge job for us to do in Afghanistan. There are worrying tasks for the international community in the Central Asian Republics and there are reasons for concern about the situation in Pakistan. So I hope that we can continue to focus on this work in the years ahead, whatever the tragic distractions may be elsewhere. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Personally speaking, the date of Afghanistan one year on was four months ago, on 9 September 2002, when I went to Kabul to represent the European Parliament at the ceremonies held for the first anniversary of the assassination of Commander Massoud. I was privileged to witness the homage paid by an entire nation to the memory of a man who had embodied the spirit of resistance and had so capably defended the values of freedom which he held so dear.</p>
<p class="contents">I also noted a marked improvement in the situation in the capital and the surrounding area, as evidenced by the speed with which hundreds of thousands of displaced persons and refugees, who had been forced to flee under the Taliban regime, had returned to their former homes. In June 2000 I had met them in the camps, where they survived thanks only to the humanitarian aid that continued to reach them owing to the courageous efforts – as you yourself stressed, Commissioner – of the few NGOs that remained in the face of the difficulties put in their way by the ruling regime. Finally, I was able to see the efforts being made by the provisional government to restore to the whole of the country the harmony essential for the establishment of a lasting peace.</p>
<p class="contents">I also became aware, however, of the persistent threat posed by fundamentalist terrorists, who had just taken dozens of innocent lives by setting off a bomb in a market at the heart of the busiest quarter of Kabul. And then I was struck by the impression of disorder given by the excessive number of international organisations, which were working in the field, it is true, distributing the aid needed to rebuild the country, but with no real consultation either between them or with the authorities or the Afghan people themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, President-in-Office of the Council, as you yourself said, I came away with a sense of restrained satisfaction, but I had mixed feelings; I was encouraged by the efforts being made to implement the Bonn Agreements under the aegis of the international organisations, efforts which had brought significant progress; but I was aware that the game was still far from being won; and I was convinced, finally, that everything had to be done to establish the fragile authority of the provisional government by giving it the means to demonstrate its ability to improve the security and economic and social situation of the Afghan citizens everywhere in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the situation today? President Karzai’s government continues to work through the transitional administration to promote stability, democracy and prosperity in Afghanistan. But, firstly, it is still far from achieving all its objectives, in particular because it has been unable to extend its authority over parts of the territory that are still under the sway of a small number of warlords who are refusing to give any allegiance to the central authorities. As a result, the human rights situation and that of Afghan women has not improved as much as the government would have liked and our Parliament must condemn this situation and call for all the necessary assistance to be given to that end, in particular perhaps by extending the ISAF mandate. Secondly, the fight against the fundamentalist fanaticism of the supporters of Al-Qaida and Mullah Omar has still not been won. There are strong grounds for believing that they may still be receiving support from the ‘‘uncontrolled’’ areas of neighbouring territories. That is why we welcome the commitment given by the governments of the neighbouring countries in Kabul last month and call on them to cooperate unreservedly for the complete destruction of the terrorist networks that remain.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and above all perhaps – as you yourself said, President-in-Office of the Council, and I was glad to hear it – we very much regret the present lack of cooperation between the various players involved in reconstruction. We call for the creation of a proper agency to provide the necessary coordination. As you said, if the government’s authority is to be established all the aid granted by the international community must pass through that government and, in particular, aid must no longer be given to some of the local lords.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to say to Commissioner Patten that we want the Commission to endeavour, through its own projects, to strengthen the authority and ability of the Afghan Government by making increasing use of the available resources and skills of the national labour force, which are perhaps too much overlooked at present. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Afghan people are a strong people who deserve our support. The liberation of Afghanistan by the international coalition against terrorism, against the Taliban and against the Al-Qaida network has fortunately been very successful. Commissioner Patten has rightly said that this is in no small measure thanks to the efforts of the European Union. There is a new provisional government, and no fewer than 1.8 million Afghans have returned after what has, for many, been decades of forced exile abroad, and thousands of girls and women once again have the opportunity to enjoy an education in Afghanistan. At the same time, this success is being threatened by the diversion of some of the very important international players to a new playground – Iraq. It would be very tragic if the international coalition against terrorism were to allow itself to become divided and diverted towards Iraq. We now specifically want the international coalition to give us extra support for Afghanistan and to concentrate on it, as it has rightly been pointed out in this context that we could otherwise lose ground.</p>
<p class="contents">The Afghan transitional administration, the ATA, under the leadership of President Karzai, has control over the capital, Kabul, with the help of the ISAF, but in reality the warlords still play far too great a role in the various regions of the country such as Herat. Human rights, women’s rights and reconstruction are threatened on a daily basis in these regions. The first and most important priority must be to extend the ISAF’s mandate so as to help the ATA to build up a national army that will cover the whole of Afghanistan. Starting in February, the Netherlands and Germany will be playing a leading role in the ISAF forces on behalf of Europe, hopefully with a mandate that will actually demobilise the warlords, build up the national army and re-establish authority over the whole of Afghanistan. The important agreement which Afghanistan concluded with its neighbours on 22 December last year should thus also be given another chance. Only then will Afghans have sufficient trust, and only then will they have the opportunity to take the reconstruction into their own hands.</p>
<p class="contents">Almost two million refugees have returned, and 700 000 are trekking around inside Afghanistan – in other words, they are internally displaced. That is why it is so very important that we actually give substance to the reconstruction that Commissioner Patten was talking about and that has now begun, with the cooperation of local forces, particularly in the area of education and healthcare, giving priority to women and girls.</p>
<p class="contents">Free and fair elections must be held and a new constitution prepared in 2004. The preparations for these elections are essential, as this is the way to actually establish a broad gender-sensitive, multi-ethnic and representative government.</p>
<p class="contents">Tremendous steps have been taken. A human rights committee has been set up, a central bank has been established and a constitutional committee has been set up, but much ground may still be lost, as General Morillon rightly said. I therefore very strongly support the view of the Greek Presidency and of Commissioner Patten. Let us use the substantial amounts we have at our disposal for the coming year, coupled with our effort, in a focused way. Given everything that is happening elsewhere in the world, we must make a success of Afghanistan now. That will only work if we maintain this focus during the coming year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nicholson of Winterbourne (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, may I first congratulate the Greek minister for taking up the Presidency. We look forward with confidence to a very successful and very effective six months.</p>
<p class="contents">The President today commented that our aim must be to bring Afghanistan into a modern statehood. Women's rights give increasing cause for concern, they are not improving, they are becoming worse. Facial covering has become mandatory in many parts of the country; the movement of women is heavily restricted. Virginity is examined on the whim of the police, women are dragged into hospitals and physically examined. In other words, women are reverting to their traditional subordinate role of being the property of the male. The Commissioner has already commented that women's rights in certain areas of the country are under assault, but I say this is also happening at central government level. Women are now forbidden to be presenters on radio or television, which some of them were doing successfully. I have no doubt that women journalists are also under pressure in the written media.</p>
<p class="contents">Under-representation of women has been commented on already, but I would ask you to recall the famous Loya Jirga, which was almost 100% male. When the deputy Health minister visited the European Commission recently, it was the – male – deputy Health minister, Dr Feroz, who attended, not the Health minister herself, the only senior minister who is a woman. 40% of all health facilities do not have one single woman at any level of their staff, yet it is women worldwide who are fundamentally responsible for all aspects of family health.</p>
<p class="contents">The word Afghanistan translates correctly into the words 'the land of sorrow and suffering'. For women Afghanistan is becoming, yet again, the land of their deepest sorrow and suffering. Humanitarian aid undoubtedly helps, but just as obviously it is simply not enough. I warmly congratulate both ECHO and the entire Commission involved in Afghanistan, for their fantastic work. But if we want to bring Afghanistan into the modern world, the most basic of human rights, equal respect between the sexes, must become, both a hallmark of our aid and a continuing measurement of our success. It is not so today. If we look at what Mr Solana identified as the aims of European Union involvement in Afghanistan, women are not mentioned: women's rights are just not there. Yet if we mean business, this attitude must be tackled, and it is an attitude, a tribal culture in Baluchistan, which has spread around the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Why be so squeamish about tackling women's rights? Is it because Afghanistan is an Islamic society? I do not need to quote the Koran to you to remind you that men and women were equal in the Koran from the very start of Islam; it cannot be because of that. I urge you, alter the priorities of the Council of Ministers, place women's rights high on the agenda. If we fail on that, then we will have no success at all.</p>

However, values should not just be described; justice, the fight against poverty and peace must be pursued in difficult circumstances. In reality, the more we talk about peace, the more war there is; there is talk of negotiations while troops are being prepared. When will this duplicity end? How much longer will bullets kill Palestinian children, suicide bombers kill Israeli citizens, Russian soldiers kill people in Chechnya and the USA kill wherever it thinks it has an interest, and so on?</p>
<p class="contents">I shall not give any further examples, since the world is such a big and terrible place. Is this rhetoric or sentimentality? No. I am expressing political and moral outrage, a stern warning against creating a Europe which has a forked tongue, as an American Indian chief once said while his people were being wiped out and moved to reservations. One year on from the Bonn Agreement and clearly many positive steps have been taken. The Commission’s facts and Commissioner Patten’s outstanding analyses, which I shall not dwell on as he read them out very clearly, are impressive. We all know that in a situation where there is devastation such as this, there are no shortcuts to achieving common interests without destroying specific aspects. We need to develop civilian infrastructure, rebuild houses, roads, schools, hospitals, not allow returning refugees to die from starvation and cold and attack the cultivation or sale of opium but give the population an alternative.</p>
<p class="contents">I have personally seen the progress made this year, especially in Kabul – schools reopened, girls studying journalism – but at the same time, I have seen and heard that key figures such as military leaders and the United States have allowed human rights failures, which are still apparent. I am not just referring to abuse and discrimination against women at work, in the streets, in the media and not just, moreover, in the Herat area – land of the infamous Khan – but all over the country; I am also referring to social discrimination, to favour-based politics and nepotism, applied to everyone, but especially – and the USA is primarily responsible for this – with regard to the supply of arms, aid and political support for military leaders who should be before the International Court.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to help the central government, the Ministry of Social Affairs – the Minister for Equal Opportunities, Habiba Sarabi, has appealed to us all to increase aid and support for gender policies and women’s policies within the European Commission too – and enable democratic elections to take place in 2004: these are all essential things. Moreover, it is also essential, as Commissioner Patten said, to extend central power to the various areas of the country, above all separate military power from civilian power and encourage the Human Rights Commission, not just the Afghan one – Sima Samar is a courageous woman who bravely continues her work – but also UNAMA. I met UNAMA representatives in Kabul who could not travel round the country for fear not only of warlords, but also of marines, for fear of speaking out and exposing human rights violations, in which we were also complicit. We must therefore carry out investigations for UNAMA. The passage of time does not, however, help democratic forces: Commissioner Patten also said this, just as he said we are arriving late; perhaps we could have done more in 1980. Donor countries should pay greater heed to the government, but above all to women’s organisations which are saying loud and clear that the warlords’ power must be cut off and the country must be reconstructed on the basis of law and democracy, because there can be no democracy if there is torture or massacres such as the one at Mazar-i-Sharif. Europe must continue to do its part; we cannot take a different path: we must give continuity to our work and our commitment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lagendijk (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL), </span>Mr President, four months ago we took part in another debate about Afghanistan in this very room, with some of the same people. I have just re-read the report and must come to the conclusion that a large number of subjects dealt with at the time are regrettably still highly topical, such as the position of women. To be honest, I have little to add to Baroness Nicholson’s impressive arguments on that point. I do, however, think that the time has come to do more than just acknowledge that the position of women has deteriorated over the past year. The UN Human Rights Committee, which has a special rapporteur for the position of women, should really go and carry out targeted investigations in places where we all know the position of women has deteriorated, like in Herat, for example. The time has also come for the international community, including the European Union, to make it clear that aid depends on progress with regard to the position of women, and that deterioration will have long-term consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">Another subject that we dealt with four months ago – and this has also been mentioned now by a number of fellow Members – was the extension of the ISAF’s mandate outside Kabul. Kofi Annan has described this extension as a precondition for continuing stability in Afghanistan. In his response to our contribution four months ago, the Commissioner himself stated at the time, and I quote: the Member States will certainly take note of the comments of many MEPs. Mr Yiannitsis, I would like to once more ask the question I also put to your Danish counterpart at the time: is the Council prepared to make money and troops available in order to enable this extension to happen? If not, please tell me; then we will not have this illusion hanging over our heads. I am convinced that this is necessary, otherwise there will be no stability anywhere at all in Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is it so necessary to extend the ISAF’s mandate? That has everything to do with what I would call the perverse return of the warlords. I again refer to what Mr Patten said on 4 September: we must not use the warlords in the fight against Al-Qaida again. Regrettably this is still happening. Some of the warlords are still being supported financially but also with weapons in the context of the fight against terrorism. This must come to an end. Otherwise everything we have been discussing here about reforms will simply have no chance at all. Take, for example, the fact that many warlords and generals are governors at the same time. This must not be allowed to continue. This only advances their standing; this really must come to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">The position of the ISAF has started to suffer, even in Kabul. There are increasing numbers of incidents, and the present Turkish commanding officer has rightly warned that this situation will only worsen in the event of an attack on Iraq. Understandably, there is increasing concern in Germany and the Netherlands, the countries taking over command of the ISAF, that the warlords, together with Al-Qaida, are very likely to use an attack on Iraq to turn people against all Westerners, not only soldiers but aid workers as well. If the ISAF’s mandate is not extended, if the role of the warlords is not diminished, the reforms will simply have no chance at all. Then the human rights violations will continue and – let us not forget this – the credibility of the international community and that of the European Union will be called into question. This must not be allowed to happen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The facts set out at the Petersberg Conference are encouraging: EUR 830 million already allocated by Europe, with a tangible impact on medicine and health, education – education which is now finally accessible to girls too – security through mine-clearing and the deactivation of unexploded bombs, agriculture, the restoration of urban areas, the reconstruction of infrastructure and return and assistance for refugees who are at last going back to their country.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, still a long way to go: many of the funds allocated by Europe are still frozen, and we need a stronger commitment by our countries’ governments to the democratic development of Afghanistan. A key issue for development, in fact, is to expand agriculture, which will take land away from opium cultivation. At this point, it is clear that not just the Union but also individual national governments, their Ministers for Agriculture, possibly also in conjunction with national farmers’ organisations, must help Afghanistan and Afghan farmers with more immediacy to reconvert their crops, with, moreover, the help of specialists and experts in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The terrorism emergency is, in any case, unresolved and Europe must renew its political and moral commitment to helping the secular governments of those Muslim countries that wish to combat fundamentalist extremism. Members of the various terrorist networks are not only continuing to operate in areas of Afghanistan not yet controlled by the government but, in fact, live and are active in bordering countries and are operationally linked with areas which have become centres for attracting and recruiting others, such as certain areas of Somalia and South-East Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">Support for Afghanistan goes beyond the exclusively political or economic principle of international cooperation, and constitutes a very real challenge for the protection of civilisation, the dignity of peoples and freedom now and in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issue of women, this is still a vast and ongoing problem, but it is helpful to point out that there are female Ministers in Afghanistan, such as the Minister for Women’s Affairs, and that the First Counsellor of the Afghan Embassy in Brussels is a woman who works and actively collaborates with the government precisely in order to improve the status of women.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we cannot, in this first report on free Afghanistan, forget Commander Massoud and Europe’s lethargy when he asked for help just a few months before being assassinated and before the Twin Towers tragedy. We would therefore reiterate the call on Parliament to award him the Sakharov Prize posthumously, or better still, to establish a Massoud Prize to be bestowed on those who tragically, have lost their lives defending their people and freedom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would say to Mrs Morgantini that, while today there are human rights violations in Afghanistan, if we had listened to her and her friends, and the international community had refrained from intervening in Afghanistan, as they were asking us to do, there would not have been any human rights violations in that country simply because there would not have been any human rights whatsoever, just as there were none in the past. Therefore, these <span class="italic">ex post</span> lessons must offset what existed in the past with what, with difficulty, the international community and the Karzai Government are trying, clearly with numerous problems, to establish.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point of view I would like to draw your attention, ladies and gentlemen, to something that happened two days ago and that I consider to be of extreme importance: the Afghan Government acceded, it ratified the treaty establishing the International Criminal Court. This is an extraordinary fact, if you think about it, as things stand in Afghanistan, when many countries – starting with, unfortunately, the United States – are against the Court. Well, I feel that Parliament should take note and encourage this desire to become a fully paid-up member of the international community, also in this respect, because who knows, in the future the Court could operate precisely to try crimes committed in that country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Brok (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the human suffering in Afghanistan has lasted for decades and precludes a cynical approach to these deliberations, although such would be a very tempting option. It must be clear to us that the years since the Soviet invasion saw a country that was poor in any case progressively smashed to pieces, only then for it to tear itself apart in a civil war, before the Taliban finished off what was left. The removal of the Taliban regime has now provided the opportunity for reconstruction.</p>
<p class="contents">The question arises, however, of to what extent both the military victors and the present government have the authority to achieve real stability and get reconstruction underway. We cannot fail to observe that the stability needed to get real aid efforts to the whole of the country is not in place. Are we not deceiving ourselves when much of the reconstruction work is going on only in Kabul? In Kabul, non-governmental organisations are falling over each other in their efforts to get projects going in that city, the reason being that other locations are too dangerous, and so aid soon becomes concentrated on projects that do not help rebuild the country as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">If, though, it proves impossible to stabilise the whole country, we can organise as many conferences of donors and so on as we like, but we will not get business to put its hands in its pocket and come up with private-sector funds for investment. The fact is that private-sector funds for investment are forthcoming only when there is a degree of certainty, founded upon both military security and firm legal policies, that these funds can continue to be put to work and that they will not be lost.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this to be a reason why this issue has to be examined in a very critical light, so that we do not end up engaging in the sort of activism that looks good but helps nobody. The country as a whole needs aid to be provided quickly, but it must then be distributed fairly. It seems to me that there is as yet no guarantee, for example, of the Pashtuns, who make up the majority of Afghanistan's population, having a share equal to that of others in political decision-making in Kabul, or in other beneficial things. If they do not, it appears to me that there will be a grave danger of a nascent resistance movement that new warlords could use for their own ends, so that, in spring or summer, new internal conflicts could flare up and make it even more difficult to guarantee the entire region's stability, to attract investment, and organise aid – with the country thus ending up in another vicious circle, and with us in a situation in which we can achieve even less.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that soldiers from my own country are working together with others in taking charge of Afghanistan means that I am very aware of the implications when I say that the situation could indeed arise in which these conditions make things far more dangerous for individual soldiers on the ground in Afghanistan than does anything currently being planned in Iraq. This is also a point of view that it is not wise to express openly. Even though it is not politically correct to make this connection, I fear that this is the case or, at least, that the danger is real.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone who knows Afghanistan's history will be aware that foreign troops have never felt at home there for long. When I see how even the United States of America can no longer guarantee the safety of its troops, and how they are now starting to set up camps in certain areas into which they can withdraw at night, it reminds me of other examples.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for this reason that I wish to ask you to join with us in considering these facts in an open debate, in order to bring about real improvements on that basis, rather than merely giving the impression that money is being poured away even while we know it will not solve the problem in the long term.</p>

<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, I fully endorse your presentation of the situation in Afghanistan. I think we all feel a reserved satisfaction; we all see the continuing shortcomings in Afghanistan and we all know what has to be done over coming years. You yourself referred to the lack of security, the hostilities and the production and trafficking of narcotics, as did the Commissioner, and I think that the House is in full agreement with the timetable you suggest for elections in Afghanistan and improving the situation in general.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no need for me to repeat what we are all agreed on. I should like to highlight two points which should not be left out of any discussion of Afghanistan. One is the terrible events which have taken place in the name of the fight against terrorism. Let there be no misunderstanding: I am behind the fight against terrorism in Afghanistan or anywhere else 100%. The warlords and the Taliban were never our allies. It was not the European Union that trained, armed and helped the Taliban through Pakistan. It was not us who created the forces we are now fighting against. But the fight against terrorism, the fight against violations of human rights and terrorism against women, the fight for democracy and the rule of law is only a credible fight if it is fought within a framework of respect for human rights and respect for the right to life of people who may be terrorists or criminals.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to add to today’s debate on Afghanistan by mentioning two very dark sides to this war. First, the horrendous allegations about the slaughter in Mazar-I-Sharif. I think the UN has an obligation both to investigate and examine these allegations closely and to make known and publish the results of their enquiries. And secondly, we should be ashamed about the fate of prisoners in Guantanamo and other detention camps run by the American military for members of the Taliban who have been arrested and people who have been imprisoned and are being called Taliban. The European Union should do something about this, it is a disgrace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Together with some Socialist members of the European Parliament, I went to Afghanistan in November. I want to say, Commissioner, that the welcome we received from the European Commission representatives on the spot and the work they are doing there can only increase the pride that you feel for all those members of the European Commission that we met, who helped us to visit the area and meet the political leaders there. That is the first thing I wanted to say because the European Commission is doing outstanding work out there.</p>
<p class="contents">I remember Bonn just over a year ago. I also remember the priority that the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities gave to the necessity of putting across the importance of women’s involvement in the process of organising power. I also remember that in the European Parliament we produced a report on the role of women in armed conflicts, both as victims and as players. I would like to speak about both at the same time. We can speak of both at the same time today given what the Afghan population is expecting of Europe. That is also something I want to stress: we have a responsibility to the Afghan people, who are expecting a lot from us.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming back to the position of women, this is a very complex problem, but at the same time what is clear is the need to be precise. In a few weeks’ time there will be an Afghan constitution. A committee was set up in November to draft one and the nine people on that committee include two women. But what exactly do we mean when we speak of the place of Afghan women in the constitution? We hear talk of a return to the 1964 constitution. I have had a look at the 1964 constitution: it is extremely vague about human rights in general and women’s rights in particular. They are saying the same thing in Afghanistan. It is all very vague.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that no legal text, no constitution since the Second World War, fails to make specific mention of women’s rights. It therefore seems to me to be important, as you said, Commissioner, that we should ensure the Afghan constitution mentions women. In my opinion, based on the talks we had on the ground, that is not a certainty. But it is something we must press for.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am stressing this point so strongly, as I did at my various meetings in the country. Women’s rights are revealing. They are revealing not only in times of conflict, they are also revealing in terms of the state of a society as a whole. Remember what Fourrier used to say, that freedom for women was a measure of social change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reality is, however, rather different. In Afghanistan, most of the country outside Kabul is still under the control of warlords and regional leaders who continue to commit human rights abuses on a large scale, including torture and the disappearance of Afghan civilians. Women's rights, as has already been mentioned, are also consistently being violated.</p>
<p class="contents">Along with the detention of 600 people without charge or trial in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, that Mr Sakellariou mentioned, these are matters that we tend to forget, deluding ourselves that the problems have been and are being resolved. In Afghanistan, in the Herat province under the governorship of Ismail Khan, the situation has deteriorated. Whereas once there was a liberal, literary and cultural tradition, women are again being persecuted and barred from education, health care and the justice system. Even under the Taliban there was at least a semblance of central control that limited the excesses of these regional autocrats. Now many regions have reverted to a quasi-dictatorship and reconstruction funds are benefiting regional leaders who are committing human rights abuses politically and financially.</p>
<p class="contents">This must stop. UNAMA, the United Nations Assistance Mission to Afghanistan, must stop funding these offending warlords immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of us in the European Parliament recently saw a film by Jamie Doran, the Scottish film-maker, backing with hard evidence the existence of a mass grave in the Mazar-i-Sharif region which might contain the remains of 3 000 prisoners of war, killed and tortured by anti-Taliban forces. This is an atrocity that members of the American forces witnessed and did not prevent. I am glad the United Nations and the European Union have now agreed to investigate this alleged crime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The warlords still maintain their iron grip outside Kabul and women still wear the burka and have no rights whatsoever, for instance to education or primary healthcare. It is, in my view, right for the United States and the rest of the Western world to seek to destroy Al-Qaida and eliminate Osama Bin Laden, but so far they have failed. Much has been made of women's rights in Afghanistan, but as I said , nothing has changed.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Afghanistan is only the tip of the iceberg as far as the United States is concerned. Many commentators suggest that it is part of the strategy to ensure access to oil from the Caspian Sea. Now the question arises, how many fronts will open up after Afghanistan? The American administration is preparing for war on Iraq, with unpredictable consequences that no one will be able to control. They will of course have won control of the Iraqi oil wells, but Afghanistan is ignored. In a recent poll in England, 71% were against their government participating in a war without the approval of the Security Council. No doubt as soon as the war begins, other European leaders along with Tony Blair, will bend to the will of the United States, ignoring the views of the people, which says a lot about our democracy.</p>

Those who are trying to establish peace in Afghanistan have to give credible proof of their primary interest in stability and the establishment of democratic structures rather than in the pacification of the region, all the better to exploit its crude oil resources or to build pipelines to siphon off Central Asia's reserves of oil and gas.</p>
<p class="contents">Every departure from international law under the cloak of counter-terrorism inflicts grave damage on the legal heritage of the nations, thus imperilling 200 years of work on building a society that promotes civilisation. If the credibility of the international community in Afghanistan is to be maintained, the least that is required is independent examination of the accusations relating to the alleged massacres in Mazar-i-Sharif and the publication of the results.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I would like to thank the Greek Presidency for having made Iraq, and the preparations for war there, core topics, and also to Mr Ionitsis, the Foreign Minister, for having spoken on Afghanistan in very clear and definite terms today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore welcome the way in which the new Greek Presidency has made Afghanistan a priority issue or has the desire to do so. Despite the fall of the Taliban regime and the installation of Hamid Karzai as the country's president, the battle for a stable Afghanistan is far from being won. It is disconcerting to learn that Taliban warriors are again organising themselves, under the warlord Hekmatyar, with the intention of trampling the delicate bloom of constitutional democracy underfoot once more. It is a cause for concern that the authority of the interim Karzai government extends no further than Kabul's outer perimeter, and the news of resumed opium cultivation is disturbing. This is, in essence, a race against time, but, amid all our efforts, we must not abandon our support for the political timetable, according to which general elections will eventually be held in mid-2004. The balance sheet of events to date can be compared to the well-known glass of water, which is either half full or half empty.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of the day, we have to get used to the idea of having to provide, in the longer term, both financial and political support if democratic institutions are to have a chance of being established in this country, ravaged as it has been by war and civil strife that has lasted for decades. This will of course also require the extension of the mandate of ISAF, the International Security Assistance Force. I find it difficult to fathom the reasoning behind the announcement that this extension would run only until 2003, but we can welcome the way in which Germany and the Netherlands have declared their willingness to assume command of this force. What this indicates in general terms is that it is only with much hesitation that Europeans will commit themselves to long-term involvement, and do so in small stages. Even the many conferences in Washington, Kabul, Bonn and Oslo sometimes tend to give the impression of being sedatives, rather than expressions of an energetic policy aimed at stiffening the resolve<span class="italic"> </span>to establish democracy in this country.</p>
<p class="contents">The demand that the mandate of the International Security Assistance Force be extended, along with the area under that mandate, is a justified one. To date, alas, it has not borne much relation to reality. In addition, all the countries bordering on Afghanistan need to cooperate in preventing the Al-Qaida network from regaining strength in the area. A certain amount has been done about this. Nor should we entirely abandon the idea of a real reconstruction agency along the lines of that in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">Sending another delegation of this Parliament to Afghanistan early next year is certainly a worthwhile thing to do, but it will be meaningful only if policy reflects the insights gained from it. That policy must include, as a priority, political help with the passing on of administrative know-how. What is this about, first and foremost? This is about keeping civil and military power separate from each other, it is about preventing reactionary fundamentalist Islamic tendencies in the justice system, and, above all, this is about preventing humanitarian crises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was at that time chairman of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities and had listened to a representative of the Rawa organisation speaking about the position of women in Afghanistan. I was consequently able to put to the Afghan leaders the obvious demands that women be included in the provisional and permanent governments and not marginalised in the reconstruction work.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with non-governmental organisations, the committee arranged a conference for women from Afghanistan. We then presented the joint priorities in a resolution adopted by Parliament during the December 2001 part-session. On behalf of the committee, I requested that the Committee on Budgets introduce a special supplementary item concerning aid for the women of Afghanistan, something which the Committee on Budgets and Parliament in fact went on to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Why am I giving you this background information? It is because I see extremely few traces of it in the joint resolution. There is no mention of women and their human rights. It is the Afghan Government’s priorities, rather than women’s, that are mentioned in the resolution. Nor is there any requirement that all aid projects should be informed by the dimension of equality.</p>
<p class="contents">Women’s rights are quickly forgotten in the man’s world in which we live. The strong and pro-active Minister for Equality in the provisional Afghan Government was removed, and the role of Afghan women is now all but totally eclipsed, in spite of the fact that probably two thirds of the population consist of women and children.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to ask the Commission and the Council of Ministers how this is to be interpreted. Have women been forgotten again? Are no demands concerning women being made of the Afghan Government?</p>

It is as if many of the things we take very seriously when we make speeches are not really taken seriously in practice. Women’s rights and legal position are among these things. Others are international law and human rights. When the talk turns to Afghanistan, I find myself thinking automatically of those people, including European citizens, who are imprisoned in Guantánamo. What has become of their rights? What legal system do they come under? None at all. The United States does not respect international law – of that we are well aware – but nor does it respect its own law. I find it bizarre that we have a resolution by Parliament that takes no account at all of the fact that a number of European citizens are in a prison camp and that we do not know for how long they will be there, what their future prospects are and what legal system they come under. I also find this in stark contrast to the fact that, in other situations, there is a demand that international law be complied with. A very good example is Iraq, which we demand comply with international stipulations and UN resolutions. In that way, we give people the impression – in Afghanistan too – that there are two standards in this world, namely that which we demand that they themselves uphold and that which we, for our part, are willing to uphold, because it is we who have the power and thus, in our view, also the right to make demands.</p>
<p class="contents">Another area in which we face similar problems is in relation to the massacre in Mazar-i-Sharif. There is quite a lot to suggest that there were American soldiers present. Some people maintain that they took part in the massacre. There is much, however, to suggest that they were present. That being said, we are doing nothing to have this matter thoroughly investigated and have the people responsible brought to trial. I think these double standards are causing us problems. They make matters more difficult in relation to Afghanistan and the Afghan people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To arrive in Afghanistan or Kabul is to enter a world that is exclusively male. Men with piercing eyes scowling at women. Some men may have changed outwardly, but on the inside they are still the same. When you wander around the famous Chicken Street in Kabul, for example, you see women in dirty old burkas begging, children begging, men standing around chatting. We must not forget that there is still a culture of men who think that women should not be educated. Are there any solutions? Yes. In a country in which people have always fought each other, you must involve women, you must put women in a prominent position, and this must be enforced. After all, can we imagine a society in the European Union which provides healthcare without women, where there is education without women, for example? This is only one of many examples. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The community of nations has a duty to help one of its members regain full sovereignty, a member which for 30 years has suffered the most from all imaginable catastrophes; foreign invasion, civil war, the communist and Islamist yokes, drought, the implosion of the state and the installation of an international terrorist. The elimination of the Taliban revealed a country where all the structures of the national state have to be rebuilt, starting with those for guaranteeing external and internal security, that is, a national army and national police force, which are essential if the legitimate government is to exercise its authority in every part of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">In a period when the basic units of the army and police are being trained, in a country where the private militias have 30 times as many men as the Afghan army, it would have been prudent to extend the International Security Assistance Force’s mandate geographically, especially in the main opium-producing regions that support the warlords.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with France, Great Britain and Italy, who are actively involved in training the Afghan army, Europe is playing an important part in this reconstruction work, whose second priority is to rebuild a fiscal and customs administration and dismantle the system of sharing state revenue between armed groups that had come into being with foreign invasion and civil war. Our states must be active in this field, which is also a priority; they have all the necessary expertise, Mr President. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Orden (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, one year on we can take much satisfaction from what has been achieved by the Afghan people supported by the international community, but all this reveals the size of the mountain to be climbed. It is not going to be a quick fix for Afghanistan. It is likely that the democracies will have to maintain a commitment for many years to come. There will be reverses that will place this commitment under severe strain. We see the scale of the problem when we understand that the writ of President Karzai does not extend far beyond Kabul and a few other towns, and his personal security remains largely in foreign hands.</p>
<p class="contents">I endorse the presidency's congratulations to the Turkish armed forces, which took over the organisation and command of ISAF from the United Kingdom last June. There is a compelling argument for the international peace-keeping force to deploy to key locations outside Kabul until the Afghan National Army is in a position to assume its responsibilities, but such forces will be highly vulnerable.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that warlords continue to hold sway in many of the more remote areas, and their commitment to peaceful development and democracy is largely non-existent. They are interested in personal power and the fruits of criminal activity. They can be won over – but by anyone. Even more worrying, therefore, is the evidence of an Al-Qaida-Taliban resurgence in border areas with Pakistan, regrouping in camps on both sides of the border in alliance with local mujahedin. This is in spite of a large American-led counter-insurgency force which operates in parallel to ISAF.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment western military forces are operational in Bosnia, Kosovo and Macedonia, as well as in Afghanistan. There will be fresh demands, not only in relation to Iraq, but in other places as well. The fact is that all our countries need to generate more military capability and the willingness to use it in concert with America and other allies, along with other instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">Afghanistan's neighbours have been enormously affected by the refugee problem, but equally countries such as the United Kingdom have felt the impact. In recent years Afghans have been the largest single national category of those claiming asylum in the United Kingdom. In due course these people must go home. With this in mind I welcome the Council decision of 29 November to adopt the return action plan for Afghanistan, the first application of this programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Afghanistan is one of the most heavily mined countries in the world. This is a consequence of activities by the former Soviet Army and more especially by warring factions over the past ten years. In spite of massive international financial assistance, where the European Community in particular has been a major contributor, only a small proportion of anti-personnel landmines have been cleared and the casualty rate continues to be very high.</p>
<p class="contents">Landmines and their suspected presence are one of the greatest obstacles to reconstruction and return to any sort of normality. We need to find more effective, quicker methods involving local people to overcome the scourge of landmines, not just in Afghanistan, but elsewhere as well. This is not just a question of funds, this is a specific practical area where the Commission has a key role to play and needs even more focus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we are in fact debating is several decades of Afghan history, with Bonn as just one stage in an ongoing crisis and, as we take stock, we realise that there is good news and bad news. In cases such as these it is, in fact, the people who need to take stock, by which I mean that it makes no difference to the people whether the violence is perpetrated by the warlords or the Taliban. In this sense, our objectives must be to establish a stable rule of law with stable institutions that allow democracy to function and everyone’s rights to be respected. A great deal of costly work needs to be done; more to the point, a long-term strategy is needed. The question is: do all the forces operating in the area have a common strategy? We have talked about the European Union, be it of the 15 or 25, but we have said nothing about, for example, Russia’s, America’s or Pakistan’s plans for the area. Are they with us or do they have a separate agenda, in which case our common objectives may not be so common after all.</p>
<p class="contents">Under these circumstances, as we take stock, we see that there is a great deal of cause for satisfaction: the situation is not the same as it was a year ago, but we still need to worry on a number of counts; are we perhaps turning back the clock and will situations return which should not return? So it might be a good idea to take stock of a few basic facts, such as the increase in crime, the operational limits of the state, whatever form it takes, and where the European taxpayers’ money is going. Because, if memory serves me well, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, for example, said that 80% of the money was being used by non-governmental organisations working in the area in order to stay afloat and only 20% was going to the country. If this is true, the best thing we can do for institutional development, democratisation and stabilisation is to involve as many Afghan citizens as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A peaceful and stable Afghanistan is an important bulwark against the resurgence of extremism in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">One year after the Bonn Conference, it is an opportune time to reflect on the EU's contribution in restoring peace, stability and credible political structures.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Patten was right to emphasise the contribution that the EU as a whole and the EU Commission in particular have made during the last year.</p>
<p class="contents">EU funds have been used to finance health clinics and primary schools, the clearance of landmines, the return of key public service workers, the creation of jobs to combat the opium production that is spiralling in post-Taliban Afghanistan, the rebuilding of infrastructures, clean-up operations in 7 cities and support for the return of the 1.8 million or so refugees returning to the country.</p>
<p class="contents">This in an impressive list and the Commission, ECHO and the various aid organisations involved deserve credit.</p>
<p class="contents">However, on the general issue of aid, it is important to point out that, although the total aid from the international community may seem enormous when compared to other areas in crisis, Afghanistan is at the bottom of the pile when we look at aid given per capita. The average aid pledges to Bosnia, Kosovo, East Timor and Rwanda were approximately $250 per person, as against $75 for Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community should take note of this. As the Commissioner himself pointed out, investing money earlier is much more effective and more economical than spending money to pick up the pieces afterwards.</p>
<p class="contents">Given our strong record on aid, I believe we have the moral authority to put pressure on our international partners to translate their verbal pledges into money. We should also use our influence to ensure a proper balance is struck between providing short term relief and undertaking long term reconstruction.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has done a lot, but we cannot become complacent or allow the problems of Afghanistan to be sidelined by the prospect of war with Iraq or problems with North Korea. We have a moral obligation to create permanent peace and stability, tackle the problem of the warlords, improve human rights, especially, as other speakers have pointed out, women's rights, and establish real democracy in Afghanistan. Much still needs to be done. The holding of democratic elections next year, the establishment of a national army and the pursuit of good neighbourly relations are all positive steps in the right direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That became convincingly apparent to the first five-man delegation from this House, instigated by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, who recently visited Afghanistan – not only Kabul, but also up-country. The health care system is a disaster, and an Afghan woman dies, either as a result of pregnancy or in childbirth, every 20 minutes. That is the highest rate recorded worldwide.</p>
<p class="contents">The education system had collapsed utterly. Today, girls' schools are again vulnerable to attacks by fundamentalists. Most Afghan women are barred from taking up employment, and they have little or no share in political power or in the work of reconstruction. We had discussions with President Karzai and with many members of his cabinet, and appealed to them in unambiguous terms for the Petersberg resolutions to be implemented only with women participating in the proper way. The European Union is helping in so far as it is able. I want to reiterate that the Commission is doing excellent work on the ground, in that – as Commissioner Patten has said – its officials on the ground are playing a very substantial part in nation-building, and doing so with the greatest personal dedication, for which they deserve our especial thanks.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take a look into the future. I urge Parliament's Bureau to invite both President Karzai and the chair of the independent human rights commission, Dr. Sima<span class="bold"> </span>Samar, to Parliament with the prime purpose of our discussing with them the preparations for the elections and for the Loja Jirga that is to produce a constitution. The clear message to a democratic Afghanistan must be that this constitution must, without reservations, give women's rights a solid base.</p>
<p class="contents">It is difficult to get back to normality in a country in which, according to one American study, 70% of all Afghan women suffer from severe depression and 65% keep contemplating suicide. The subject of sexual violence is shrouded in strict social taboos. We heard complaints from women's organisations to the effect that their work, even in the international organisations, was made extremely difficult by restrictions on women's mobility, including their being prohibited from driving cars or even riding bicycles.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities has taken up this issue on many occasions. We had discussions with the Minister for Women, Mrs Sobrani – the deputy minister, as it happens – and she complained that she received no financial resources for her department. The lack of coordination leads to friction costs in the work of the NGOs and government offices. This is somewhere else where we must help.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unfortunate that there is still no banking system in Afghanistan, and this is another factor that continues to encourage corruption. It does, however, give me great satisfaction to learn that there is strong consensus here in this House, within the presidency and the Commission, that the position of women needs to be improved. Let us, then, set about improving the position of women, hoping for peace and stability in the region! And the message to our American friends must be: no war in the Middle East! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
