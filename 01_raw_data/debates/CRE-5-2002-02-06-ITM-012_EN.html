<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Musotto (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it must be pointed out that this report is being tabled before Parliament at a particularly important historical and political moment in European integration, namely just before the start of the Convention which is to lay the foundations of the new Europe, a Convention of which Commissioner Barnier is an important member. We are therefore especially glad that he can be here today.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be said from the outset that cohesion policy is a major success story in terms of Community integration. Indeed, it is, has been in the past, and will continue to be, one of the cornerstones of that process.</p>
<p class="contents">Consistently with the Commission’s second report, we have noted that between 1988 and 1998 per capita GDP in Objective 1 regions rose from 63% to 70% of the Community average – and this is a great success – moreover, the benefits of cohesion have not been limited to direct recipients of related funding but have also extended to countries which are net contributors in terms of exported goods and services.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the process has not yet reached its conclusion. Much still remains to be done and there are difficulties to address and overcome, including, in particular, the scourge of unemployment, which, I am sad to say, is affecting many regions where the unemployment rate has not dropped at all.</p>
<p class="contents">We need infrastructural investments in order to eliminate the marginalisation caused by geographical location and the remoteness of the islands and the most outlying regions; accessibility is a determining factor in terms of the competitiveness of an area and it needs to be improved, although without incurring excessive environmental costs.</p>
<p class="contents">In future, cohesion policy must be recast, first and foremost to cater for the changed circumstances which enlargement will bring for all of us, but it is also vital that the future regional policy should be based on the results of Commission documents, particularly the most recent document issued a few days ago, known as the periodic report.</p>
<p class="contents">I am afraid to say that the gap between rich and poor will grow as, after enlargement, one sixth of the Community population will have an income of barely 40% of the Community average. Preaccession instruments such as ISPA and the Sapard programme have been set up to assist the candidate countries, to enable them to prepare for the new situation of which they will have to become a part; these have been essential tools for the transition from candidate countries to Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we need to promote a genuine regional development policy. In this regard, I feel that the European spatial development perspective can serve as an important technical source of major integration and development.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two key objectives to pursue: solidarity towards the new Member States and avoiding penalising, indeed protecting, those currently benefiting from cohesion policies. A major effort therefore needs to be made in terms of solidarity – especially political solidarity ensuring that all the peoples are involved and are provided with the requisite information – in economic and financial policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The 'statistical convergence' must not be mistaken for 'real convergence' by the current beneficiaries, who will certainly not automatically become richer simply as a result of the accession of poorer regions. We need administrative methods which will improve efficiency; we need to streamline, clarify and facilitate the demarcation between the role of the Commission and that of the regional and national levels; it will be necessary to simplify procedures increasingly and we need greater subsidiarity and more decentralisation.</p>
<p class="contents">It will also be essential to rationalise the support instruments by reducing the number and size of funds and better coordinating Community policies and cohesion policies. Regions which continue to lag behind in terms of development, measured in terms of unemployment and other criteria in addition to <span class="italic">per capita</span> income, must be maintained under Objective 1.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly – and this is a point of contention which prompted wide debate – the allocation of financial resources must be increased or, at least, revised and brought up to a sufficient level: the threshold of 0.45% is an absolute minimum below which it is impossible to go. We hope that Parliament and the Commission will both call for a increase in the budget dedicated to the future resources of cohesion policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Further to them, though, I would like to elaborate, from my Committee's point of view, another issue which has almost been pushed into obscurity.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we have learned essential lessons from the difficulties we have had in raising poorer regions or suffering former industrialised zones to the level within the European Union; they should spur us on to improve things and should serve as a benchmark for the process of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">It is above all the poorer industrial zones in the future Member States whose need for massive restructuring measures causes me great concern. I refer above all to coal and steel regions; the steel industries in these countries are absolutely incapable of competing with our own, and the collieries are a potential problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to go at this juncture into what will happen if we are unable to give our new friends sufficient aid. I will only observe that, as the ECSC's expiry is imminent, we no longer have a suitable instrument in this field. I reiterate that now because the ECSC continued to be of excellent service to us in recent years, no cofinancing is needed and the system of financing could in any case have been adapted. We also have to make solidarity payments to the applicant countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I reiterate that now because the new States will not have adequate access to financing. I have touched on this issue now because the Commission played a considerable part in changing this instrument without envisaging the difficulties in the process of enlargement or even giving them some thought. Do something about this problem, Commissioner! The problem is not a small one. We do not have enough instruments suited to the processes of adaptation while enlargement is going on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">- firstly: cohesion policy, as defined in the Treaties, is a crucial pillar for the future of European integration and must not, therefore, be renationalised;</p>
<p class="contents">- secondly: the active promotion of a policy of equality between men and women is a prerequisite for achieving real economic and social cohesion;</p>
<p class="contents">- thirdly: the fact that disparities between the richest and poorest regions are predicted to double following the planned enlargement to a further ten countries and a significant fall in <span class="italic">per capita</span> income makes it crucial that the sum currently spent by the Union on cohesion polices is at least 0.45% of GDP, and for the sake of coherence, this amount must be increased.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to draw your attention to the objective laid down at the Lisbon Summit of achieving, in the European Union, in 2010, a 60% rate of female employment, because this increase in women working is essential not only in order to increase the European GDP, but also to finance the future of social security and to bring about an increase in tax revenues.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore ask the Commission to consider gender equality as an integral part of the Community polices that contribute to economic and social cohesion; to include the aspect of gender and equal treatment between men and women in cohesion policies and assess, on the basis of precise indicators and quantified objectives, the contribution that economic and social cohesion makes to achieving the Community strategy for equal treatment and opportunities between men and women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must look, first, at what conclusions we can draw on the basis of progress so far and, secondly, at the challenges facing us.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards what conclusions we can draw from the policies applied so far, what we can say is that we have clearly made progress, but that this progress has varied from one Member State to another. In some Member States there have been very positive results and a great deal of progress, while in others such as my own, unfortunately, the results have not been as positive as they might have been. This means that governments need to get the message, especially in the light of the new regulation now being applied, which is more decentralised than the previous regulation, and do what they can to bring about the results which other countries have achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the question of enlargement is now a factor, bringing with it even greater demands. Because numerous poor countries are joining, this will, as we all know, artificially inflate the income of numerous regions in comparison with the Community average. Because of the statistics, numerous regions will cease to be covered unless they take measures during a programming period. Consequently, 0.45% of the Community GDP earmarked for the Structural Funds must be the lower limit. We cannot drop any lower and have reliable policies. Many of my fellow Members disagree with this view and they do, of course, have every reason to put forward their arguments. But what we have to ask ourselves, especially those of us who really believe in the European Union and its prospects, is just how much money we are spending from the Member States' GDP in order to achieve the ambitious objectives set by the European Union. Is it because we are spending so much money that we object every time the Community budget increases? At some point we must realise that ambitious objectives cannot be achieved without the necessary funding. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like – and I think this might be permitted me – to say a word in praise of our own group, whose discussions, which were highly intensive and also sometimes rigorously conducted, produced uniform outcomes, something I consider to be very important in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to deal with those essentials that are of significance to us. The first point I wish to make, Commissioner, is that we join with you in rejecting the renationalisation of regional policy. That is for us of primary importance. Efforts are being made in certain Member States to reclaim this policy for the national level. We here are quite united in repudiating this. Cohesion policy makes clear European solidarity, which we do not want to lose, but rather to emphasise in the future. On this we, Parliament and Commission, stand shoulder to shoulder.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that we seek greater coherence – between regional policy on the one hand and, in particular, the common agricultural policy on the other. We could perhaps engage in a dialogue, even with Commissioner Fischler, on how we might manage this, without which our goals for rural areas, and the agricultural policy's goals for rural areas, will not always be found in the same direction, and this is something we must work on.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also beyond dispute that going below the 0.45% level imperils the cohesion objectives, so we just have to become more efficient, as has also been made abundantly clear by Mr Pohjamo's report, which we were discussing earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to my final point. We need to achieve a balance between the candidate countries and the regions we have supported to date. I think it is not at issue that we must make enormous efforts for the candidate countries, that there must also be a cohesion instrument to help them, and this was also mentioned in the interim report you presented last week. We must also, though, give thought to the need to continue to bring the regions we used to support up to the EU average. If we manage this balancing act, I believe we will gain Europe greater acceptance.</p>

<p class="contents">The measures to achieve economic balance have been insufficient: they have been heading in the right direction, but they have been insufficient. Regional and social differences in terms of prosperity have even increased in the present Member States. In future we must pay attention to strengthening rural vitality and diversity in regions which are unfavourable in terms of geographical location and natural conditions. Additional costs resulting from difficult conditions, for example in island regions and mountain areas, must be compensated for with combined efforts and precisely defined regional policy measures. Furthermore, the sharp disparities in unemployment rates and structural problems must be taken seriously in planning regional structural policy. The commitment of SMEs and skills and know-how to projects is an important priority. Aid action under the Structural Funds must also be better coordinated with national employment targets.</p>
<p class="contents">GNP alone is inadequate as a criterion in determining eligible areas. We have to equally consider permanent problems associated with climatic and geographical conditions. For example, extremely sparsely populated areas, long journey times, and cold and hot climates mean additional costs, which will also be there after enlargement. An effective cohesion policy requires that sufficient financing is safeguarded. There are actually rather different views in my group regarding how that can be addressed. Whatever the case, it is important to have improved coordination between the various forms of aid granted out of the funds available.</p>
<p class="contents">The enlargement of the Union requires a reinforced cohesion policy. Enlargement must not go ahead at the expense of the worse-off regions, but through joint efforts. It is important to ensure that all the Union’s resources are spent effectively, and that includes the most remote regions. We have to ensure together that the whole area of the Union is included in the single market and derives benefit from it. For that reason, cooperation with the peripheral areas is more important than ever. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I cannot, unfortunately, do that on this occasion, as the rapporteur did not succeed in developing a discussion in the committee that would lead to a common position by Parliament on the Commission's proposals, nor, indeed, did he make the effort to do so. I see this as a great pity, as a core report and a core position on the part of Parliament are just what is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greens, by contrast, have a clear position. They reject all attempts to protect vested rights and the exceptions to them. Solidarity between regions must remain the supreme imperative, whilst there must not be such a thing as first and second-class Europe. In consequence, the Structural Funds must primarily benefit the poorest regions, which just happen to be in the East. That means that a phasing-out is at the same time an important instrument, and it also cushions the present regions in receipt of support. Option 2 highlights the problems and offers a solution, and hence it is Option 2 that enjoys our full support.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time though – and this is my next point – our group objects to the Commission's tactic of involving the candidate countries in the management of the Structural Funds at too late a stage and then making a saving at the end of the day. Last week’s proposal strikes me as scandalous. It economises on the cohesion policy rather than introducing it earlier, in the pre-accession process. That is why we urge that a start be made now, with the candidate countries, on phasing-in, on setting up the payment agencies, on training in the management of Structural Funds, in order to make decentralised structural policy, rather than centralised project-based policy, the objective of the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Future coalition policy must be characterised by sustainable development and participation by local actors, and we must make a start on this now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report demonstrates, firstly, a balanced assessment of the disparities within the European Union, which continue to be marked, secondly, the challenge thrown down by enlargement, and thirdly, the need for improvements in the area of the EU's structural and cohesion policies.</p>
<p class="contents">I would very much like to highlight four fundamental points. The first is that there must be no renationalisation of Structural Fund policy. I can save myself the effort of justifying this, as Mr Duin has already done that for me. Secondly, a polycentric model of space would be a sensible approach to counteracting the disparity between the centre and the periphery. Thirdly, there is a need for improved coordination among the Structural Funds as well as of structural policy with the other Community policy areas, especially the common agricultural policy and fiscal and economic policy. Fourthly, consistent application of the bottom-up and partnership principles at every stage – planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation would not only promote closeness to the citizens, but also the subsidiarity principle.</p>
<p class="contents">What is imperative, quite apart from the need to continue with aid for the underdeveloped regions of the present Member States, is that the soon-to-be Member States of the European Union must enjoy our full solidarity with them, which means the involvement of these countries, with equal rights, in EU structural policy, without allowing the present Member States to fall by the wayside. Serious shortfalls in development make it, in my view, already perfectly clear that even 0.45% of Europe's GDP will not be sufficient to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">Provision of support and transnational cooperation in the border regions will be of great significance as enlargement takes its course. Justice has not, in my judgement, been adequately done to this in the report. The course for the Structural Funds, with their criteria and indicators for support, must be set in such a way that economic and social cohesion is also reflected in falling unemployment figures. My own country, the Federal Republic of Germany, is setting a bad example in this respect, for unemployment in the ‘Objective 1’ regions is rising dramatically. We have a rate of over 20%, but this figure is, fortunately, not as high in the more developed regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Personally, I feel that it is necessary to continue to pursue this objective with a coherent, continuing, sustainable policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The second report on EU cohesion presented by Commissioner Barnier depicts a situation which has improved but which has certainly not been resolved. It is clear that the progress made has not been uniform and that severe regional disparities remain which – as rightly pointed out by the rapporteur – are increasing rather than diminishing.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the objectives, I fully support the position of my fellow member, Mr Musotto. The criterion for deciding which regions are eligible for receiving aid lays down the threshold of 75% of average Community <span class="italic">per capita</span> GDP. My personal feeling is that, as of 2006, it would certainly be more appropriate to use the unemployment rate as a measure, for the entry of poorer regions which are in greater need of aid will certainly not raise the level of the regions currently under Objective 1. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Indeed, it is evident that when the candidate countries join, the current system will prove to entail too heavy a financial burden. This forces us to make choices. The Commission has already indicated a few options, but we must give this matter some more thought.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that, in some cases, a policy in support of economic and social cohesion that also supplements national policy is useful and desirable. The Structural Funds have a special and relatively broad task in this respect. The Cohesion Fund, on the other hand, pertains to one particular aspect of economic cohesion, namely participation in EMU.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, this should also be at the heart of cohesion policy: helping Member States meet the convergence criteria, both before and after enlargement, without drawing a distinction between old and new. In that way, not too much will need changing.</p>
<p class="contents">The reports of the Commission have also proven that the current system works. The Cohesion Fund is intended to provide economic stimuli on the basis of transparent, clearly defined criteria. As far as we are concerned, this is how things will remain, because otherwise we run the risk of losing our way in a structure of soft criteria, and the European and Monetary Union cannot survive on soft criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I have tabled a number of amendments to which an honest but plain approach is central. I hope that fellow MEPs will give this matter serious thought. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It feels that the indicators in euros paint a more reliable picture than the current measurement and eligibility criteria and also considers that the unemployment indicators are important because in some regions, only 44% of people of working age are in employment, although disparities in production are also significant. The Committee on Industry also takes the view that the concentration of the Union’s economy in a triangle which is twice or four times as productive as the outlying regions is one of the problems accentuating these disparities and making it difficult to correct them, and is of the opinion that future programming must make a qualitative assessment of the various indicators. With regard to enlargement, we must allow greater flexibility in the way funds are used, in line with the specific characteristics of each State.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Industry supports an increase in the Union’s financial effort for cohesion policy, specifically by making competition tougher and by adjusting the budgets of Community policies. It takes the view that any policy that is given greater financial resources than cohesion policy could neutralise it and that the most developed countries grant production aid that almost equals the Community budget. The lack of tough competition favours neither cohesion nor integration and is one reason for ongoing criticism within the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Industry urges the<span class="italic"> </span>Commission<span class="italic"> </span>to guarantee the creation of a European energy and communications market that respects universal service, prioritises energy efficiency and research, energy saving and the use of renewable energies. The Committee considers it essential to complete infrastructures in the fields of accessibility and transport in order to reduce the effects on the competitiveness of the current outlying regions, without which the efforts for cohesion that we have already made will suffer. The Committee wishes to draw attention to the effects on the price and the taxation of energy in the outermost and overseas regions. It recommends that endogenous energies should be developed as well as clean and safe technologies for the use of coal, nuclear energy and hydrocarbons. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like, in my contribution to this discussion, to focus on the future of regional policy. Reference has already been made several times this evening to the reconciliation of two fundamental needs with each other, which must be possible, with a high degree of solidarity towards the new Member States on the one hand, but also, on the other, solidarity with those regions that are at present lagging behind or undergoing economic transition. To put it another way, even if it is generally acknowledged that the regions in all the applicant countries must be supported as a matter of priority, the ‘Objective 1’ regions of the present fifteen Member States, which will, in the course of enlargement, lose their eligibility for support only because of their relatively high standard of living in an enlarged EU, that is, only by dint of the cosmetic use of statistics, should not overnight be excluded from any opportunity to be supported.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, it will be necessary over the coming months to discuss how to guarantee equal treatment of these regions, which have yet to complete the process of economic convergence, with the areas being embraced by enlargement. Political and economic considerations mean that future cohesion policy must not concentrate exclusively on regions whose development is lagging furthest behind, but it must also take into account the advantages and disadvantages in urban areas, in areas undergoing socio-economic change, in regions with permanent natural disadvantages and also the cross-border dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial means this policy needs must of course be made available. The present threshold of 0.45% of Community GDP must therefore not fall any lower – that too was mentioned several times this evening – in order that cohesion policy may not be jeopardised. At the present time, we have in any case not yet exhausted the possibilities open to us. Everything else must be tested by reference to the new financial framework and in the light of the results of enlargement. I therefore think it inappropriate to be already, as a precaution, articulating demands for the replenishment of funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Of course, our starting point is fundamentally contradictory. We want much greater enlargement, but without providing the corresponding funds and we invent lower and lower cohesion targets along the lines of "if the mountain won't come to Mohammed, then let’s take Mohammed to the mountain". Be that as it may, we face a very tricky problem and we are required to resolve it in less than optimum circumstances, while keeping up the fight to improve those circumstances. Obviously, we do not want a twin-track Europe, as previous speakers have stressed, but we want a multi-track Europe even less. So our objective must be to help the new regions where they need help, but without abandoning the old regions which also need help, when they need help.</p>
<p class="contents">So I think we need to state that 0.45% is inadequate and that the Cohesion Fund and other Community initiatives need to keep functioning as they have done so far, given that they have proven to be extremely efficient. And of course we must take a very careful look at the future of political cohesion, in conjunction with the policy of sustainable development and agricultural policy. It is our duty here to avoid stop-gap, hasty solutions which might prove to be the undoing of our farmers, whom we need for the countryside, for the environment, for our very existence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The overall thrust is quite correct. The purpose of Cohesion Funds is to counteract the natural centrifugal forces of a large single economic and monetary unit, which is what the European Union and the euro zone are, by helping the less advantaged regions come up to the level of the more prosperous ones. This is the point: if the less advantaged remain less advantaged, the Cohesion Funds will have failed in their purpose. But that is why, contrary to what Mr Mussotto and the Committee on Regional Policy demand, we should stick to the 75% of average Community GNP as a graduation point. Having reached that level the pump will have been adequately primed and the graduating region, with a suitable transitional process, should be well able to continue up the escalator to 100% and higher. Surely it is only reasonable that at that point these Cohesion Fund resources should be reallocated to those regions which lie further behind. That is why I will vote against recitals O and R of Mr Musotto's report.</p>
<p class="contents">There must also be financial discipline. An open-ended honey pot is not conducive to encouraging self-help and self-reliance. This is why I cannot countenance leaving open-ended the possibility of an even higher percentage of European Union GDP being committed to cohesion policies. 0.45% should be quite adequate and will make us hone our priorities and procedures, even in the context of enlargement. So the second half of paragraph 57, or any compromise of similar effect which leaves the amount be made available open-ended, is not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Given these small but significant changes I will be very pleased to support Mr Musotto's report as an important contribution to the future well-being of all parts of our European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would also like to make three brief suggestions to the Commission, for – like many other Members – I am convinced that cohesion is not a financial obligation but, first and foremost, a resource, and that if we do not have a Europe of equal opportunities we will never have Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, I will turn to the first two suggestions, which, moreover, have already been put forward this evening. I feel that it would be appropriate to reflect on the parameters, for the gross domestic product may well be in danger of becoming inadequate as an indicator of the real state of well-being or distress of our countries. We therefore need to assess other factors as well such as the rate of unemployment, the quality of infrastructure and the cost of labour.</p>
<p class="contents">My second suggestion is this: since I feel that politics should always prevail over arithmetic, I would call upon Parliament and the Commission not to concentrate on the effects of enlargement as portrayed by statistics, although I do believe deeply in enlargement. Indeed, we will strive to ensure that no government can see it as a handicap, for it will certainly be a great political asset for Europe. That said, we would like to avoid certain regions unexpectedly finding themselves in a state of wealth for purely statistical reasons. Politics must continue to take precedence over arithmetic in this sense.</p>
<p class="contents">Here is my third suggestion: we should reinvigorate the strategic profile of our cohesion policy, learning to invest in non-material resources such as training, knowledge and information. We feel that this is the road to take if integration is to have any practical meaning. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In committee we saw the discharge of the 2000 budget, with an execution of 56% of objective 1, 4.5% of objective 2 and 0% of Community initiatives. We are not talking about the cohesion funds. The Commissioner, as he told us, wrote a letter to the Presidents of the various countries, reminding them of the ‘n+2’ rule, that is, that funds may disappear after two years of not being executed. That is by way of a precaution, amongst other things, and I think it is correct.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposed 0.14% of the budget to solve the problems of enlargement. In any event, I am very pleased with the report by Mr Musotto, in which he makes an enormously positive assessment of regional policy and cohesion policy. It is a successful policy which is going to ensure that soon there will be almost no Objective 1 regions amongst the Europe of the 15.</p>
<p class="contents">The messages of Mr Musotto’s project are clear: procedures must be taken seriously. I am pleased that the Commissioner has maintained what Parliament proposed: that the programming period be brought forward two years to the next financial perspectives. He also sends a message relating to the quality of investments and participation, and the implementation of the partnership, which has not yet happened.</p>
<p class="contents">But the star has been enlargement: enlargement itself, the effect of enlargement on the other regions that currently receive aid and the absence of a reply to the four questions, Commissioner. An apparent absence of a reply, since you can give us a satisfactory reply through good work, which is easy if done with common sense and if we believe in cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I will end by saying to the Commissioner that Parliament trusts that the Commission will obtain that response which we all need. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is difficult to not repeat points which have already been made by other speakers at this stage in the debate. I will be brief. One: cohesion policy has proved to be a policy that works, and the report confirms this. It may not work as well as we would expect or like it to, but it is a policy that yields results. What is more, in many regions, for many of our fellow citizens, it is sometimes the only practical, positive, friendly aspect of the European Union that they see. This is an asset which increases the spirit of European citizenship and overall cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is a fact: we can try to postpone it, ignore it or put off dealing with the issue, but it is still a fact. In practical terms, enlargement will upset the balance and distort the statistics on which we have built this cohesion policy, for we have based it on what is certainly a statistic, the number of inhabitants and the average income disparity which will be created. I feel rather hesitant about advancing proposals on this issue, Commissioner, but I would invite the Commission to be less reticent. Starting to think about the way cohesion policy will have to change in the face of enlargement does not mean placing a question mark over the entire policy of enlargement. My suggestion is that this debate could, perhaps, focus on three factors: resources, as has been said, for it is unthinkable that resources should remain at their current level; the tools, for I feel, for example, that, while the Structural Funds are a tool which is suitable for a cohesion policy which differs greatly from region to region, it may be that the Cohesion Fund, which is less selective, should be rethought, at least in terms of the way its funds are allocated; coordination of the policies. In many cases, where there are no additional resources, coordinated policies could be of benefit such as, for example, tax discounts, which it is still not possible to apply to some regions because of a rigid Commission policy on State aid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a result of a recent competition policy decision, over EUR 1 billion of much-needed UK regional regeneration investment in poor urban areas and derelict sites has been cut by 75%. Following the conclusions of the Belgian informal meeting in October, the Commission must now undertake a review of the operation of state aids and regional regeneration policy. Can the Commissioner please state what follow-up action has been taken? Can it also reassure us that competition policy will not continue to undermine the legitimate efforts of regional and cohesion policies?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, unlike my Conservative colleague, Mr Purvis, I do not believe that we should take a rigid view of the reform of funding post-2006 at this stage. Poorer regions such as Merseyside in my region, and in the rest of the EU 15, may continue to need Objective 1 funding, but more importantly than that, today a delegation of trade unionists from Manchester came to Strasbourg to fight to save 650 jobs threatened due to industrial restructuring. Last year 9 500 jobs were lost in the manufacturing sector in the region alone. Can the Commissioner therefore tonight give his support for the continuation of a strong role for European assistance post-2006 for our urban and industrial restructuring regions as well as our poorest regions? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first idea is that if we want to have a viable European Union which has good prospects for the future, we will inevitably have to improve economic and social cohesion policy. Eastern Europe must feel the same level of European solidarity experienced by countries such as Portugal, Spain, Greece and Ireland following their accession to the European Union. Improving cohesion policy is necessary, however, not only to counter the huge regional imbalances that will result from the entry of scores of least-favoured regions in the current candidate countries, but also to continue to deal with the backwardness that still exists in the current Europe of fifteen countries, particularly in the outermost regions. This is all the more important because eastwards enlargement will probably accentuate the lack of economic and social cohesion in the current Europe of Fifteen, in other words, regional asymmetries could increase within the current European Union as a result of the dynamics created by the enlargement process, particularly in the relationship between the outermost regions and the centre of Europe. In other words, countries such as Portugal could become further consigned to the edges of Europe and the current centre and could become even stronger because it will then be the centre of a Europe which is economically integrated from its western almost to its eastern borders.</p>
<p class="contents">By this I wish to state that following 2006, we will need a cohesion policy which does not only look eastwards, but which also considers the still existing cohesion deficit in the current Europe of Fifteen and the new problems it will face as a result of enlargement. The reading of the second cohesion report demonstrates that the Commission is aware of this problem. We feel sure that the third report will provide appropriate and fair solutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

History commands us and we have commitments to do this. The fact remains, nonetheless, that there will be numerous question marks, when we realise that a Europe with 25 Member States will have 30% more inhabitants, 30% more territory, but only 10% more wealth.</p>
<p class="contents">Along with enlargement, Europe is therefore in need of greater solidarity. But how are we going to manage to show more solidarity with the same amount of money? It is impossible. There is no use in continuing to bury our heads in the sand. Europe must decide to provide the necessary resources for the radical transformation that will bring about enlargement and must reformulate the criteria for granting structural aid so that the poorest populations are not adversely affected.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore pay particular attention to the outermost regions, which are amongst the ten poorest regions of today’s Union. In this respect, I welcome the recent proposal by the Spanish Presidency to set up a permanent forum specifically for these regions.</p>

That is quite correct. We must hold an enlarged Europe together. I want very briefly to emphasise a number of points.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement is very important for the whole of Europe, and it is <span class="italic">not</span> the poorest regions which should pay for enlargement. There must therefore be sufficient budget resources for the whole of this process. At the same time, we must use the money in the most effective way, which is why the EU’s agricultural policy should be reformed and coordinated with regional policy so that it promotes rural development, that is to say promotes differentiated economic life in agricultural areas too.</p>
<p class="contents">Each Member State must also have its own policy of solidarity and cohesion, and all growth policies must effectively favour justice for the regions. That applies especially in the fields of education, research, employment and transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to say that future cohesion policy must pay attention to regions with pronounced, permanent geographical disadvantages, for example long distances and a sparse population.

The first point is about making sure that the poorest regions of Europe do not pay the price of enlargement. I disagree with what Mr Purvis said. Areas such as South Yorkshire and Merseyside in the United Kingdom must continue to benefit if they need it, and if they are shown to need it. The second point is to retain some kind of aid for areas undergoing industrial restructuring.</p>
<p class="contents">My question is about competition policy as well, and about coherence between competition policy and cohesion policy. I am getting a lot of complaints about the way competition policy is being applied, particularly, recently, about voluntary and community sectoral organisations being treated in the same way as private sector organisations and being told that for projects they cannot receive more than 50% in total in public sector intervention. I want to know whether it is Commission policy to treat the voluntary and community sector the same as the private sector. Does that apply to other public sector organisations? It is an extremely important point because if this is the Commission policy, a number of projects which are going ahead in some our most deprived regions will simply cease to go ahead. It is not what the Commission worked for many years. Regional policy pushed to put these projects in the hands of the voluntary sector and now they seem to be disadvantaged. I would like to know what the Commissioner's position is. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the proof that the European Union is not merely a supermarket where we quite simply rely on the laws of supply and demand and on fiscal transfers in order to ensure solidarity or to avoid a two, three or four-speed development. It is the proof that we have agreed that we should share our financial resources and redistribute them in a regulated manner, and also to work with greater coherence. This policy is the proof that the European Union is not merely a supermarket; that it will, one day, I hope, be a political power and that it must remain a community that stands together. This is the profession of faith that I wanted to give to you at the beginning of my answer.</p>
<p class="contents">In this spirit, I feel that Mr Musotto’s report is an extremely worthwhile and useful contribution, as you have all said, to the debate on the future of the cohesion policy that I unveiled to you in January 2001. And since I am speaking about a concept of Europe, I want to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that the debate on cohesion, which I launched a year ago and which I will be seeing through to completion, in a genuine and decentralised manner, with the Member States – you can count on me to do this – the debate will be part of the other wide-ranging debate on the future of Europe. Depending on how the Heads of State and Government respond to the question of cohesion, depending on whether we maintain, or even extend, the cohesion policy, whether we scale it down or take it apart, we will somehow answer this broad question – one of the subjects to be tackled by the Convention, which we will also be attending – on the future of Europe. What do we want to do together? I think that this contribution, Mr Musotto, is also important because it brings together the points of view of five parliamentary committees after an in-depth discussion has been held. And then, finally, you will adopt this report in a few days and only after the Commission has published the first interim report on cohesion, which I released last week. I will also be coming to present this interim report to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on 20 February, as I pledged to do.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, I am pleased – in spite of the criticisms or questions, which I feel are constructive – to note in your report, Mr Musotto, a genuine convergence between Parliament and the Commission, on four essential points at least.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, in the future, the main priority of the cohesion policy must be aid to regions that are lagging behind in their development, in other words, the poorest regions. On this point, there is agreement, including amongst the Ministers that I met in Namur during the Belgian Presidency, and you confirm this agreement, that the poor regions, which are lagging behind in their development, are located in the future Member States (and they make up almost all of the regions of the future Member States) or in the Member States of today’s Union. Therefore, our priority and focus is on the regions that are genuinely lagging behind in their development.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point of convergence is that cohesion, as many of you pointed out, is not an aspect of one single policy, but of all Community policies, which must, as stipulated in the Treaty, contribute to the cohesion between European countries and regions. This applies to the CAP, which has not been effective, to transport – Mrs de Palacio is here and she could explain this better than myself – to energy, competition, research, employment and many other policies. Each of these policies, even more than before, must contribute to increasing economic and social cohesion, if only because of the question marks that enlargement will raise, which, as we note in our second interim report, will increase gaps and inequality.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is that we must strive to have more than a minimalist cohesion policy and reinvent a policy which applies to all the territories of the Union that are experiencing difficulties. In other words, I note our consensus on the idea that the future regional policy will, after 2006, take into account all European regions, to varying degrees, of course, depending on whether the region is lagging behind in its development or is in a more prosperous region. This policy should contribute to the integration of all regions in the Community and promote territorial cohesion. To do this, it must be more simple, more decentralised and, at the same time, more specific (this is one of the questions that I raised in the cohesion report), specific, for example, on the urban question – half of European citizens will live, already live, in towns; specific on the regions that are undergoing industrial restructuring that you mentioned; specific on the regions that have lasting or definitive natural handicaps, mountainous regions or islands; or even specific on thematic objectives, such as the information society. On this issue too, I await your ideas, but I have explained my outlook.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth point of convergence is that we need resources in order to meet all these challenges and, for the next cohesion policy, resources which meet the needs of a larger Europe. The current threshold of 0.45% of GDP, which I myself quoted last year in reference, is the absolute credible minimum below which, I feel, it is impossible to go without jeopardising the very essence of the cohesion policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the fact that Parliament and the Commission are tonight giving a joint response to these four points is an important and worthwhile political element in the debate on the future of the cohesion policy. Not everyone, as yet, shares this ambitious vision. This applies to certain Member States, where some political leaders – whom I respect and to whom I listen – are talking of the deterioration of politics and one is talking of renationalisation. We therefore have to show, time and again – and I am thinking of Mr Izquierdo Collado’s earlier comments – the merits of the cohesion policy, we must aim to convince and to show that this policy has been worthwhile, that it has helped to bring about greater coherence, but that we still need more. I cannot prove this single-handedly. You can count on me to do this at Commission level, with the help of all my colleagues, but I will not be able to do this if the regions, the Member States and Members of Parliament do not contribute to this task.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also natural for us, at this stage, not to have total agreement on all the subjects raised in Mr Musotto’s report. There are points that we must debate or discuss, such as the instruments of the future cohesion policy, the place occupied by Community initiatives, that of the Cohesion Fund or a possible single regional development Fund. All this will, of course, depend on the level of our ambition towards this policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point of discussion is the choice of eligibility criteria. The Commission chose, and made this choice a long time ago, the criterion of GDP per capita and per region for determining which regions are lagging behind in their development. I think that this is a reliable, straightforward and transparent indicator that all the Member States accept, and it is so that we can maintain an objective approach and a certain impartiality that we are not, at this stage, proposing to add other criteria to the criterion of per capita GDP.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this does not mean, however, that the Commission will not listen to appeals by the regions which may be affected, either by enlargement or by the so-called ‘statistical effect’ that several of you have mentioned, by a mathematical decrease in the Community average of per capita GDP or the drop, also mathematical, of the eligibility threshold, which means that some regions that are still having serious problems (not only those in southern Europe, but also in East Germany, in England and elsewhere) are mechanically and artificially situated below this threshold, although they are still experiencing real difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">I will say once again that I am committed to proposing, at the appropriate time, a fair, Community-wide solution so that we can continue to assist the regions which are situated just below the new eligibility threshold.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, if we maintain a genuine cohesion policy, which does not only cover regions that are lagging behind in their development, we should be able to take into account other criteria and move, as some of you have pointed out, towards making greater qualitative investment in people, in training men and women and in the information society. I also note that, in the current programmes, – those that I approved and which have got off the ground – there are more programmes based directly on quality, rather than quantity, than in the previous period.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I am not forgetting and will not forget the particular attention that must be given (not only in accordance with Article 299 of the Treaty, but also because the real problems they face, and their unbearable levels of unemployment) to the seven outermost regions of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I hope that these brief clarifications may help to increase even further the degree of consensus between Parliament and the Commission, so that together we can preserve and promote the model of European society, the core of which is cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">One MEP touched upon the subject – and this will be my final point – of the appropriations that you were proposing to grant to the countries which will join the Union, most likely in 2004. I do not share the very harsh judgment that Mrs Schroeder expressed earlier and I do not think that it is fair. We proposed a phasing-in process. These countries already benefit from the Cohesion Fund, and they are experiencing (I regret that Mrs Schroeder is no longer in the Chamber to hear my response) great difficulty in using up the appropriations. And this is why I suggested, along with my colleagues, for this genuine reason, that we adopt a progressive approach to the cohesion policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not trying to trick anyone or create an effect. I do not want to see money that has been earmarked by Europe for the candidate countries, which will join the EU in 2004, to stay in Brussels or be returned to Brussels. That is why we are being quite ambitious and going further than the proposals set out in the Berlin Agenda for the first year of membership and why we are proposing more money. But we want to avoid a situation where this money cannot be used by the countries that do not yet have the necessary administrative structures in place to manage these appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall end here. Lastly, I confirm that the Commission is due to adopt the third cohesion report in December 2003 and that the report should set out the Commission guidelines for the next agenda. This should, therefore, be done earlier than usual, so that we can, as I said before, begin to turn the new programming period into a reality on the ground, as soon as the new Agenda begins in 2007, rather than two years after that.</p>
<p class="contents">We still have a few months to stimulate and make a success of the political debate on cohesion policy. If we succeed in stimulating this debate (and I need you to help me to do this), a decision will be taken, at the appropriate time, by the Heads of State and Government, which will not only maintain cohesion as the heart of a specific model of European society, but will enable the Heads of State to commit, on a budgetary and financial level, to fulfilling the political and strategic choice that they made when they decided to undertake reunification of the European continent, through extensive enlargement that will take place very soon.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall support the new Member States and I hope, personally speaking, that the Agenda, in 2007, will enable them to benefit, like all the other Member States, from every aspect of the cohesion policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
