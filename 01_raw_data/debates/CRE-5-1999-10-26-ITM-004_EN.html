<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, the Commission has today accepted a report to Parliament and the Council, assessing ECHO. The Commission’s assessment is based upon a report by consultants. This report has been prepared by professional people. I think that this is the correct way to go about things. When, in the future, the Commission assesses activities in my own area, this ought to be done on the basis of such modern, professional and open methods. The consultants’ overall conclusion was positive, and the Commission shares this positive view of ECHO. However, we are alert to the fact that there are a number of things which can be improved. </p>
<p class="contents">First of all, cooperation needs to be improved. We need to improve our cooperation with the multinational organisations, the UN bodies and the Red Cross organisations. The intention is to help the international community respond more effectively and in a better coordinated way in different crises. The fact that ECHO is such a big aid organisation means that we also share a more general responsibility for its effectiveness. At the same time, it means that we should also make larger demands in cooperation with, among others, the various UN organisations. We need to establish a broader and more activity-based approach to individual humanitarian crises. This should be done within the framework of the existing regulations. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the question of our management strategy. Improvements internal to ECHO should also be made. We should invest more highly in a concerted handling of the whole project cycle, which includes ensuring effective feedback. On this basis, we should to a greater degree be measuring results instead of input. There are also points on which we have disagreed with the consultants’ proposals. We do not, for example, wish to abolish ECHO’s logo. European taxpayers are entitled to know where the aid is going to, and there is no reason, either, to conceal from the recipients where the same aid is coming from. But ECHO’s visibility and its logo must not be permitted to hamper cooperation with our partners. </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there are the policy considerations. In the longer term, the Commission wants to develop a cohesive strategy for the grey area here, that is to say the area between real humanitarian aid and longer-term, more future-oriented development work. At present, a lively international debate, in which the Commission is also to be an active participant, is taking place about this so-called transition gap. What is more, the Commission’s internal resources are to be mobilised so that they can release the required humanitarian aid in individual situations when the time is ripe. The objective is to give ECHO the opportunity to define a meaningful exit strategy in connection with different crises. </p>
<p class="contents">Combining the two portfolios of development and humanitarian aid provides a better opportunity for this, not least on the basis of the fact that both ECHO’s sphere of work and the Commissioner’s responsibility for development policy are global in character. The plan is to present a report on this subject in June 2000. The Commission will also launch a debate about other important policy areas: conflict prevention, preparedness in advance of crises and catastrophes, and humanitarian aid which is based upon upholding human rights, that is to say which focuses to a greater degree upon the victims’ rights as human beings. Special groups include women (especially victims of rape), child soldiers, refugees and internally displaced persons. In all these areas, a connection with the Commission’s development policy should naturally be guaranteed. The plan is to report on these areas in July 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">And, finally, the conclusions. ECHO is to continue to retain its non-partisan character in all conflicts. This is important for the purpose of securing access to the victims of crises. ECHO’s presence in a wide range of countries, each with its own workers who have been sent out, is an important link in an effective policy of humanitarian aid. ECHO is an organisation with its own power to act and with motivated staff who are ready to implement the proposed improvements. In the midst of all discussion about changes, it is important to state that ECHO’s committed and loyal staff are the most important asset we have to build upon. I am looking forward to seeing the results of the changes. It is my intention to visit East Timor in the very near future. This will be a good opportunity to see some concrete results of ECHO’s work and for me to do what I can to establish fruitful cooperation with all our partners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He said there would be further discussion of this. Were there any proposals in the expert report as to the form this involvement of development aid would take or even of other development instruments such as PHARE or TACIS, for example, and has it been ascertained whether the problems are in the area of ecological aid and the programme there or in the area of other forms of aid?

One of them had to do with ECHO moving more into the area of development cooperation, in a sense staying longer in a post-conflict situation. I do not think this is how to do it – we will end up over-stretching the resources very rapidly because new conflicts keep coming up. So we need to have a balanced approach, drawing on the resources in our development cooperation in general but making sure that they go in when ECHO goes out.</p>
<p class="contents">It sounds easy but it is not that easy. In general it is necessary to combine these things and many are not able to do it. A very big problem is that individual countries although good donors do not have the resources to stay a long time in many conflicts. This is where the European Union has a special capacity and also special responsibility. It is extremely important that we, at a certain point, become very good at managing this transition gap. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly: can it be deduced from the Commission’s arguments here today that the funding of ECHO for humanitarian aid will mainly continue to be channelled through the programmes of different NGOs, or is any change envisaged in this regard?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: does the Commission intend to support the reform of the regulations which govern humanitarian aid? And, if that is the case, in what respect? Would such a reform be carried out in accordance with the codecision principle which is introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly: can it be deduced from today’s discussion that ECHO will retain its full role of channelling European Union humanitarian aid in crisis situations, or, rather, that the activity of ECHO and humanitarian aid itself will be progressively diluted within the Union’s general policy of cooperation for development? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We do not have a fixed, preconceived idea of who gets what. Concerning the NGOs, we have found very few changes to be necessary. We know that in practice, in daily operations, we will have to streamline procedures as much as possible but, in general, this has not been seen as a major issue in the whole evaluation process.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to the next question, on reforming or changing the regulation, I already made it clear in my opening remarks that we think it is possible to make many important and necessary changes within the existing regulation. We will come back to that. We are not closing the option of changing the regulation but this will be taken up in a much broader, long-term process – the one I mentioned concerning the policy part of our response. For the time being we will work on the basis of the existing regulation. We think this gives enough scope for the changes that are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the codecision aspect of this, in responding to the evaluation, I have deliberately avoided saying anything concerning that issue. How codecision will eventually be hammered out in terms of relations between Parliament, the Council and Member States in decision-making on humanitarian activities is something that needs to be discussed further and perhaps negotiated. But I did not want to open up a discussion on that because following up the evaluation is not a problem I have to deal with.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the identity of the operation, I distinctly mentioned the logo and the discussion. The consultants recommended that we should give up the specific ECHO logo. This is one point on which I feel we should not follow their recommendation. But we have to strike some kind of balance. To put it in a nutshell: visibility is fine, feasibility is better. There is, in some cases, a risk that pushing the logo too much creates friction and reduces the willingness to cooperate smoothly on the ground. Somewhere we have to find a balance. But I did not want to back down as far as visibility is concerned. We owe it to our tax-payers, the European public. Certainly there is no reason why we should hide from the beneficiaries who it is that is actually helping them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I want to say to Commissioner Nielson that his presentation was music to my ears. Three things, in particular, caught my attention. First of all, he promises openness and modernity; openness is incredibly important, since ECHO is among the highest-profile organisations of the European Union. Secondly, he also promises increased cooperation with the United Nations and the Red Cross; this is also important and has been needed for a long time. Thirdly, he anticipates too a more integrated view of humanitarian aid in foreign policy generally, designed to prevent conflict, which I believe is necessary. </p>

I should very much like to see open debate and open procedure. We can use any good ideas, and what we are trying to do with ECHO is precisely to mobilise Europe’s population, too. The fact that we are involved as active partners in these different conflicts and crisis situations is also a demonstration to our own citizens in Europe that Europe has a role to play in these places. That is why it is also necessary to involve citizens, and that is to say Parliament, and I am therefore very prepared for cooperation with Parliament and with Parliament’s committees when it comes to the next steps we are to take. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But when it is a question of constructing democracies in a number of countries, I also think we ought to be looking at how we can involve the members of the parliaments in these countries. We have no tradition at all for doing this through, for example, the UN machinery. We still scarcely have any such tradition through the European machinery. It is, for example, a fact that the NGOs have direct representation in the United Nations whereas members of the parliaments are only appendages of their governments, and it is only as such that they can offer any input. I am very much of the view that we could re-think this machinery and that we ought to be asking ourselves how we can guarantee better parliamentary cooperation with a number of developing countries and also with the Central and East European countries we are supposed to be helping. I am saying this not because the NGOs should not continue to be involved there but because I think it is a rather false picture we are giving of the construction of democracy if we say that it is only NGOs which can be actively involved. In fact, parliamentarians can also be involved and, in reality, were in fact originally involved in our own wealthy part of the world before the NGOs came on the scene. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The impression has been given that the abbreviation NGOs might almost be read as standing for <span class="italic">neogovernmental organisations</span>. But when we consider ECHO’s work, we are talking here about situations following wars and crises in which the societies concerned have fallen apart and in which, in general, it is a question of establishing structures in the societies concerned. I very much agree that members of the various parliaments are naturally important elements but, if we take countries like Somalia, Sudan and other such places, we are forced to take what there is by way of structures in the so-called civil society and try to help these structures become parts of a civilised society. In connection with our efforts as a whole in this area – and not just those involving ECHO and humanitarian aid – a lot of people have asked whether we have not got things the wrong way around in insisting that elections be held quickly. Cambodia was one example, Angola another. Some people think that, in these cases, we insisted too quickly that elections should be held and the formal structures of democracy created. On the other hand, insisting on these things has worked well in many cases, so I agree that we should be pressing for the outward and formal structures of democracy to be established. This is the way in which – as soon as structures of this kind have been established – parliamentarians become the decisive players, in civil society too. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the part of the question concerned with the role to be played in what we are doing by members of the parliaments concerned – and that is another way of looking at the question – I want to say that the debate itself, the very dialogue between the Commission and Parliament about the policy we are to pursue, is for me the decisive factor, and it is from there that we get the decisive inspiration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not see that anything we are suggesting here would actually endanger our capacity for quick action. We are not moving towards creating a rigid system and the special character, the ability to act and the identity of ECHO as such, are all something I find important in order to avoid ECHO, as a humanitarian relief organisation, becoming involved in the very cumbersome decision-making machinery of the Commission in general. We are not heading toward the kind of problems that you ask about here.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Sierra Leone, it is very difficult to say. The main thing is to what extent it is possible to mobilise enough donors; it is not just what we do ourselves. There must be a critical mass of donors who are willing and able to make a more long-term effort in a given country, so coordination is extremely important here. We have to be able to deliver our share of it and phase out crisis-based ECHO presence, replacing it with the post-conflict presence of a more long-term character of our development resources.</p>
<p class="contents">If others do not participate, it will not work, so part of the answer to what we have to do now is to be more active in the discussion from case to case – within groups of friends of Sierra Leone, to take one example – trying to organise a more coordinated response to moving away from the immediate crisis demands.</p>
<p class="contents">One case that illustrates where we should be careful not to end up is that the UNHCR is still today funding and managing primary education in Rwanda. Nobody else is ready to pay for it and that is why they are there. They are doing a respectable job but it shows that the international system and who does what becomes distorted if the normal donors do not demonstrate a readiness to play their traditional role. This is where we hope to be able to push the international discussion in a better direction than hitherto. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
