<p class="contents">At the beginning of the German Presidency, the European Union took a historic step when it introduced the single currency, i.e. the euro. In January, I declared here in the European Parliament that the Federal Government considered the rationale behind the introduction of the euro to represent further steps towards achieving full integration, and that Germany would spare no effort in attempting to bring this about. I said that we considered it important to make the structural and procedural preparations needed to transform a union of Western European countries into a truly pan-European Union which would, at the same time, have power to act in matters of foreign policy and security, and which must therefore be more democratic too.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, six months on, we can see that the progress made in these three main areas relating to integration has fulfilled our expectations. This progress is closely associated with the two crises that the European Union has had to contend with over the last six months. The resignation of the Commission, the outbreak of war in Kosovo and the European Council in Berlin all coincided, putting the EU"s power to act to the test in a dramatic way at a particularly critical moment in time. The EU Member States maintained not only unity and their power to act during this extremely difficult period, but also displayed considerable creative genius. They turned the crisis to good account as an incentive to achieve further integration. The reason for this is that the war in Kosovo served to highlight again that the essence of European integration is to establish a lasting framework for peace on our continent. This insight resulted in an awareness of the degree to which the national interests of individual Member States are interconnected, and in a readiness throughout Europe to take a decisive step forward in the historic task of bringing European integration to fruition.</p>
<p class="contents">In this way, the crisis has accelerated the process of integration. The step forward we have taken in the course of the last few months is above all a success shared by all Member States and European Union institutions. I should therefore like to thank the European Parliament today for fulfilling its responsibility to extraordinarily good effect during this difficult period.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should now like to take a few moments to sum up the main events of the German Presidency and then look at the prospects for the future. Firstly, there has been an increase in the ability of the EU to act in matters of foreign and security policy. The EU is now an international player holding considerable sway. Nothing rendered this more apparent than the Belgrade mission undertaken by President Ahtisaari and the Russian envoy to Kosovo, Mr Chernomyrdin. The contribution they made towards bringing the Kosovo conflict to a peaceful conclusion has enabled the civil might of the EU to take a major step in the direction of a common foreign policy. Unlike 1991/92, the EU pursued a common line in the Balkans this time, which can be explained by the fact that the European States had at last recognised that it was not just about moral duty or the future of a region on the periphery of Europe, but about their own security, indeed our collective security.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe, there is just one single, indivisible kind of security; that is, the logical conclusion we can draw from our experience of the tragedy in Kosovo. If we had stood idly by in the face of bloodthirsty, aggressive nationalism on our continent, then ultimately the fate of European integration itself, the greatest achievement in recent European history, would have been placed in jeopardy. We could not and would not allow this to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">The Kosovo conflict has propagated two important ideas in the EU. Firstly, South-Eastern Europe is now widely and unreservedly accepted as being part of Europe. This led to the Stability Pact being adopted, a subject I shall return to later. Secondly, the Member States have hardened in their resolve finally to give shape to a Common Foreign and Security policy. Against this background it has been possible to present a united front to China and the Near East in terms of human rights policy and many other difficult foreign policy issues, and ultimately to reach a number of important decisions in Cologne, which included adopting the first common strategy towards Russia and a timetable for achieving a European security and defence policy, as well as nominating Javier Solana as the best possible candidate for the post of Mr CFSP.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union"s importance as an international player has also become evident at the numerous Interregional Conferences such as the Latin American Summit in Rio, the Mediterranean Conference held in Stuttgart, a platform which can now gain considerably in importance against the background of a new peace dynamic, the ASEM in Berlin and many other meetings.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Berlin decisions on Agenda 2000 have secured the European Union the power to act for the next few years. If we had failed to reach agreement there, and consider what it would have meant, if the Berlin meeting had finished with no compromise having been reached at a time when the Kosovo war was just beginning and the Commission was in a state of crisis, then Europe would have been plunged into a serious, historic crisis. Agenda 2000 contained a sheaf of reform initiatives and huge national interests of a kind unknown hitherto in the history of European integration. The fact that it proved possible to reconcile these issues in one great compromise was because major Member States, not least of which Germany, refrained from pushing to achieve the most they could for their own countries, come what may, and instead made the further development of Europe a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly, the Federal German Government would have liked to have seen more progress in many areas, for example in agricultural policy, where, following the WTO Round, it will be soon be essential to take further reform measures. But, all in all, the compromise is still an excellent foundation on which to lead the Union into the 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Agenda 2000 will also foster opportunities for the enlargement of the European Union. The success of the Berlin compromise can in fact be measured in terms of the extremely positive reactions displayed by the Applicant States. The negotiations for Accession have also made good progress over the last six months. We now undertake negotiations in more than half of all the capital cities. Moreover, when we decided in Cologne to have a new Intergovernmental Conference on institutional affairs, we seized the opportunity that will enable us to soon overcome the second large internal hurdle facing the enlargement process. As a result, the historic project of enlargement has made considerable progress in terms of pace and quality.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, at the time of the dispute that led to the resignation of the Commission, the European Parliament fulfilled the responsible role expected of it by the people of Europe. I regard this as the beginning of a process that will lead to more a pronounced democratisation of the Union. The nomination of Romano Prodi as the new President of the Commission was a very rapid reaction on the part of the EU States to the resignation of the Commission. I should like, at this juncture, to wish Romano Prodi and the new Commission a great deal of luck and every success as they embark on the great tasks ahead of them.</p>
<p class="contents">In adopting the Code of Conduct the new Commission has already sent out an important signal intended to regain the citizens" trust, a good start. However, I should also like today to again address particular thanks to the old Commission and all its staff for their work. Despite any criticism levied at certain individuals, we should not forget one thing, and that is that without the Commission"s hard work and commitment, we would not have been able to solve the numerous and difficult problems, and not least those encountered during the German Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">My fifth point is that the Employment Pact agreed in Cologne makes it possible, at the European level, to pursue our goal of supplementing and strengthening national efforts to create more employment. The Pact improves the conditions necessary to achieve an active employment policy in both a national and European context. The macro-economic dialogue agreed on in Cologne, with the involvement of the two sides of industry and the European Central Bank, will make an important contribution to this process. We should therefore take stock of the situation for the first time at the Employment Summit to be held during the Portuguese Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, in the period that lies before us we should use the dynamic that has emerged over the last six months from the tension between the exigencies of crisis and those of reform, to take further steps towards integration. We must make progress in five key areas. The first of these is that our experience of the Kosovo conflict must lead to a speeding-up of the enlargement process. The agenda for the European Council in Helsinki includes decisions that will point the way. Two questions of central importance will be discussed, the first being which additional Applicant States the EU is to enter into negotiations with. It has been evident for a long time now that several of the States not yet at the negotiating stage have made considerable progress in terms of reform and this should be shown due appreciation in Helsinki. It should also be made clear that any candidate fulfilling the Copenhagen Criteria is entitled to enter into accession negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question which will need to be addressed is that of a target date for concluding negotiations with the first candidates. Numerous idealistic proposals have been made, but as yet we have no foundation worthy of consideration on which to base a realistic date. However, a foundation of this kind will be created for the first time in Helsinki, when the full results of the screening and the Commission"s new progress reports are made known. It is therefore my fervent hope that it will be possible to fix a date in December. Personally, I feel that we must fix the date in December. This would send out a signal of enormous importance in terms of the future dynamics of the reform process as well as those of the accession negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, it has not been possible, over the last six months, to bring about any substantial improvement in Turkey"s status vis-a-vis the European Union. Germany"s proposal to designate Turkey an Applicant State and to assess it in accordance with the same Copenhagen Criteria as applied to the other candidates, did not meet with agreement in Cologne, but this issue remains on the agenda. It is important that Turkey should draw up a timetable for implementing the Copenhagen Criteria. It is essential that Turkey fulfil these criteria if it is to enter into accession negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that if an enlarged Union is to retain its ability to negotiate then it is essential that the three institutional questions that remained open in Amsterdam, namely the size and composition of the Commission, vote weighting in the Council, and extending majority voting, are clarified in good time and comprehensively before enlargement takes place. In any case, this is in the interests of the Applicant States. We should therefore make every available effort to adhere to the timetable for institutional reform agreed on in Cologne and to complete the package of reforms in the year 2000 under the French Presidency. However this will require the will and support of all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the end of the fourth, and hopefully last, Yugoslavian war of succession in Kosovo and the agreement of the Stability Pact mean that for the first time in its history, South-Eastern Europe now has a real opportunity to break with nationalism and violence forever and draw closer to an integrated Europe. Reconciliation was able to take place in Western Europe after 1945 and so it can in the Balkans today, provided that it is possible to root out the hatred and violence of nationalism there too. For this to be achieved, it is important that the European Union should make the securing of peace in South-Eastern Europe a priority in peacetime too. Reconstruction in Kosovo and the EU"s central role in giving impetus to the Stability Pact mean that it carries more responsibility, also in material terms. Equally though, in the long-term this represents a major and exceptional opportunity for the Union and its national economies which we should embrace with determination.</p>
<p class="contents">Economic co-operation will be a decisive factor in the stabilisation of South-Eastern Europe. Germany supports additional proposals for creating a regional Trade and Customs Union with the aim of forming a free-trade zone which ought, if possible, to be linked with the European Union. A stable economic framework of this kind would also be of great benefit to outside investment. However, the most important goal is to create stable conditions for democracy and rule of law throughout the Balkans. The key to the lasting stabilisation of the region will be the democratisation of Serbia.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">This is a question which the Serbian people must decide for themselves. Nevertheless, as far as the European Union and its Member States are concerned, we must do everything to strengthen democracy in Serbia and weaken Milosevic. It is precisely at this time, when courageous demonstrations are taking place throughout the country, that we must show the Serbian people that they can count on the full support of the European Union when it comes to the democratisation of their country.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">Our experiences over the past few months show that Europe also needs to be better organised in terms of security and defence policy if it wishes to be able to manage future crises effectively by itself. The Cologne decisions on the creation of a European Security and Defence Union have far-reaching implications. This area of policy must be the European Union"s next large project for integration, after the Internal Market and Economic and Monetary Union. Consequently, the development of common options for action and the creation of the infrastructure necessary to achieve this will, in time, be the very first item on Europe"s agenda for the future. But in fact, this is not about militarisation of the European Union at all, but about developing it into an effective force for peace which has the ability to act, and which is able, as in Kosovo, to uphold the power of justice and the renunciation of violence, thus ensuring that war as a political instrument in Europe is forever a thing of the past.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">The future viability of the European Union depends on its being strengthened in terms of its legitimacy and credibility in the eyes of the citizens. The draft for a European Charter of Fundamental Rights agreed in Cologne should ensure that the fundamental rights of the citizens are accorded the same status at the European level as they are at the national level. This is a new process. The Charter should be based on a wide-ranging dialogue involving representatives of the European Parliament, the national parliaments, the government and the Commission. This Committee should present its report to the European Council under the French Presidency. I hope that the European Parliament will play a leading role in this process, building on the preparatory work that has already been underway in the Parliament for some time.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the progress that has been made in terms of political integration and enlargement raises an issue of central importance to the future of the European Union. How can a Union of 27, or with South-Eastern Europe in mind, in the long-term even 30 Member States, continue to work and have the power to act? How is the enlarged Europe of the future both to retain its cohesion and fulfil its obligations internally and externally? This question, which in terms of far-reaching implications goes well beyond the next Intergovernmental Conference, is very soon to have a considerable impact on the debate on reform within Europe, indeed it must impact on it. Democratisation and, ultimately, development of the parliamentary process within the European Union, must be central to this debate: the creation of a true union of citizens. It is only by following this path that we will gradually be able to overcome the decline in interest which manifested itself in the alarmingly low turnout at the European elections. Indeed, it was to the alarm of us all.</p>
<p class="contents">The democratic imperative has become evident from the conflict surrounding the resignation of the Commission, during which the fundamental issues of transparency, democratic control and the legitimacy of European dealings have been raised. However, this imperative is also a consequence of the European Union"s growing power to act, not least in terms of foreign and security policy. A Union that wants to have the power to act in crises and conflicts urgently needs its own chain of democratic legitimacy. It will therefore be essential, in the future, for the rights of the European Parliament to be extended beyond the new stipulations of the Amsterdam Treaty, but also for the national parliaments to have greater involvement.</p>
<p class="contents">At the beginning of the German Presidency, Madam President, I initiated a debate on the idea of a European Constitution. This debate will further strengthen the citizens" consciousness of their identity as European citizens. However, we should detach ourselves from a strictly legal understanding of the term Constitution and instead understand it to mean a combination of values and fundamental principles, the functioning mechanisms of European co-existence, and the way in which the European Union functions as a political construct <span class="italic">sui generis.</span></p>
<p class="contents">The two crises experienced over the last six months will have a long-lasting effect on the progress of European integration. The Kosovo conflict has caused us to focus again on the point of departure for integration; the setting up of a European framework for peace. The resignation of the Commission, on the other hand, has shown that we will need in the future to create a truly democratic Union with as many checks as there are balances. I feel that these two insights serve as a good basis for the Finnish Presidency, which I wish the best of luck for the responsible task that lies ahead of it. Thank you for your attention.</p>

I simply wish to point out that, as mentioned by Mr Fischer, the President of the Council, during the German Presidency – which has been a complicated and difficult Presidency – some of the great issues and challenges which were facing us have been resolved. I refer, of course, to the approval of Agenda 2000, which was an enormously difficult exercise in terms of politics, diplomacy and the balance of interests within the Union, and to all the consequences resulting from perhaps the greatest contemporary problem, given its repercussions within the European Union itself, by which I mean the Kosovo conflict and all the circumstances surrounding it as well as its resultant consequences for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">European security and defence have taken a step forward with the appointment of the person responsible for the CFSP. These steps perhaps demonstrate that foreign and security policy, in the aftermath of the Kosovo affair, continue to be the ‘Achilles heel’ of Community construction and still have a long way to go.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the European Employment Pact has also been given a great boost – with the implementation of the conclusions of the European Council of Luxembourg.</p>
<p class="contents">The outgoing Commission therefore congratulates the German Presidency. We believe it has been a very good Presidency. Very difficult problems have been resolved. This is all due, with no doubt whatsoever, to the talent, efficiency and intelligence of Mr Fischer, the Foreign Minister, with whom I have been very impressed, and I promise him that, in my new life, when I return to Spain, I will go jogging and eat bananas.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE)</span></span>  <span class="bold">.</span> -<span class="underline"> </span>(DE) Mr President, Mr Foreign Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I concur fully with your speech, Mr Foreign Minister, but unfortunately the German Presidency cannot be assessed in a purely positive light. That is why my words will be less genial in tone than those of the President-elect of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The German Presidency was one of peaks and troughs, and whilst we have recognised its successes, there were also serious shortcomings, failures and blunders. The German Presidency had to contend with the tragic situation in Kosovo, and the Berlin Declaration left nothing to be desired in terms of clarity. The German Council Presidency, together with the countries of the European Union of the Western Alliance took resolute action in order to oppose the Yugoslavian tyrant and dictator Milosevic. Such action was necessary and just. Our message on the threshold of the year 2000 must be: never again are people in Europe to be driven from their homes, from their homeland. Human rights, human dignity, the right to a homeland are the foundation of our European civilisation.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of our group, I should like, Mr Foreign Minister, to address a word of thanks and recognition to you on an expressly personal note, for having championed human rights with such dedication and commitment, even to the point of sustaining physical injury.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">But we in our group have often asked ourselves: what would have happened if our political friends had had your political responsibility? Had you been a member of the Opposition, would you have shown the same solidarity towards the Federal Government? That is why we want to say a word of thanks to our political friends in the CDU and CSU, and also to the Liberals, for showing such pronounced solidarity in their support of the Council Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">It filled us with horror, and we are as critical of this as you are, that the chairman of the post-communist PDS shook hands with Milosevic in Belgrade. What is more, this individual"s supporters are represented here in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Kosovo must now be reconstructed; that is one of the European Union"s main tasks. We must not repeat the mistakes made in Bosnia, when there was so much red tape and everything took so long, but rather the European Union must take rapid action that is free of red tape. In this respect, the Council of Ministers, Commission and European Parliament are called upon to take concerted action that will give the sorely afflicted people in Kosovo, in former Yugoslavia and the Balkans, hope for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Agenda 2000 was decided on in Berlin and it must now constitute the basis on which the first applicant countries will be able to join the European Union during this legislative period of the European Parliament, hence by 2004. The crux of the matter here is to anchor the European family in the principled society bequeathed by European civilisation, the expression of which is the European Union. This will promote stability and safety, democracy and peace. But we also say, and I know that we agree on this, that there are prerequisites to enlargement, namely the reform of the European Union. We welcome your endeavours towards a European Charter and we welcome your endeavours as regards a conference on the reform of the European Union. At the heart of this reform process must lie the long overdue acceptance of the majority system in the Council of Ministers as the fundamental decision-making instrument for this Parliament. For we want this to be a Union which has the power to act and which is rooted in the principles of democracy and the parliamentary system.</p>
<p class="contents">The Cologne Summit reached a decision on the Secretary-General, also known as the High Representative. We consider Javier Solana to be an excellent choice. But it is now a case of ensuring that this High Representative is given the authority he needs and that he works constructively with the appropriate Member of the Commission. Furthermore, we must prevent those areas of foreign policy where a common line is already being pursued, from degenerating into mere co-operation between the States of the European Union. We must take great care to ensure that the correct steps are taken in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">The Western European Union must be integrated into the European Union, which would be a welcome move. Should the Assembly of the Western European Union ultimately disappear, then, of course, in addition to the national parliaments, there must be parliamentary accountability at the European level. For this reason, authority in foreign, security and defence policy must accrue even more to the European Parliament, so that there is no sphere within the European Union escaping the influence of parliament and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to turn to less pleasant matters associated with the German Council Presidency. Firstly there is the appointment of the new Commission. At the beginning of the year, the Council Presidency advised us to issue the discharge for the 1996 and 1997 budgets, thereby giving us advice that was actually long out of date. The Federal Government was still at a stage of development which we were unable to fully comprehend. Then it came to the nomination and appointment of the two German Members of the Commission. Mr Foreign Minister, it is scandalous how this process has developed. It is scandalous how the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany has handled this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty provides for the Members of the Commission to be nominated on the basis of agreement between the President-elect and the national governments. We now know that an individual nominated by the Federal Government did not even have the opportunity to meet up with the Chancellor before the Chancellor"s discussion with Mr Prodi, which means that the Chancellor had no conversation whatsoever beforehand with the individual that he proposed. He then, as it were, imposed these two people on the President of the Commission, the President-elect of the Commission, which did Romano Prodi, the European institutions and the Federal Republic no service.</p>
<p class="contents">The list of mistakes of this kind goes on. Even before the German Council Presidency the Environment Minister travelled to London and Paris with the intention of breaking off Treaties. It was to be the first time since the War that Germany would breach international law in the French National Assembly. This was inappropriate behaviour of the worst kind on the part of the Environment Minister. The failure of the German President-in-Office of the Council and the Finance Minister to attend the launch of the euro is another case in point. The disappearance from office of the President-in-Office of the Finance Council is an event that has never before taken place in the history of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Chancellor"s order to drop the Directive on end-of-life cars from the Council of Ministers sitting is something unknown and unheard of hitherto in the European Union, and the order given by the Chancellor that the German Minister of Trade and Commerce should not attend the Council of Ministers sitting in Finland is also without precedent in the recent history of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Foreign Minister, I am sure that none of this was intentional, but from Konrad Adenauer, through Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt to Helmut Kohl the strength of German politics always resided in the fact that Germany"s partners trusted her. I hope, Mr Foreign Minister, that you will be able to safeguard this trust in the constancy and reliability of German European policy in the future, for it is of importance to progress within the European Union and to the future of our European continent.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hänsch (PSE)</span></span>  <span class="bold">.</span> -<span class="underline"> </span>(DE) Mr<span class="italic"> </span> President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, it is clear that Mr Poettering is keen to use the European Parliament as something of a platform for parading his national Opposition in Germany. But the performance you give here, Mr Poettering, cannot, nor will it ever match the real-life drama facing our Foreign Minister.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the European Union has passed the acid test during difficult times under your Presidency. You have quoted the important points here and I will not hesitate to say that in so doing a number of shortcomings and weaknesses have been glossed over. There is no doubt of that. But the decisions taken under the German Presidency over the last six months will shape the future of the European Union far into the next decade.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Poettering asked what would have happened if the decisions taken under the German Presidency had been taken under a Presidency of his political persuasion. I can tell you what would have happened, Mr Poettering. You would have rung all the bells here, lit a thousand candles and had the Te Deum strike up. Incidentally, that is the difference between Christian Democrats and European Democrats.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not going to start singing here but would simply like to thank the German Presidency for a successful period in office.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the fact that the European Council, under the German Presidency, has concluded the work on a European Employment Pact. We know that a European Employment Pact cannot replace national endeavours to create employment, but it can and must co-ordinate, focus and stimulate these endeavours. We also know that a European Employment Pact does not, at this stage, constitute European employment policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The governments of all the Member States must succeed in progressing from non-binding joint declarations to binding common policy with clear guidelines and agreed terms of reference. We don"t just need a Pact to stabilise the euro but also one which will create employment in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the decisions the European Council had to take in the area of common foreign and security policy will alter the European Union more profoundly than it is possible to envisage at present. For the first time in history, the European Union employed armed troops in Europe on a joint basis, showing remarkable resolve in the process. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we want you to show the governments of the Member States the same determination when it comes to promoting peace in the Balkans. NATO won the war, the European Union must now win peace. The Stability Pact for the Balkans is a just and necessary step but it is not yet a Balkans policy. The creation of offices and agencies should not be the sum total of EU policy in the Balkans. If you continue in this vein then very soon you will need an office to co-ordinate the co-ordinators, and that is not a Balkans policy.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point concerns the reform of the EU institutions. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in January, you made a fine speech here which was very forward-looking. However, the decisions taken by the Cologne European Council on institutional reform barely scratched the surface. We consider it too fainthearted to restrict ourselves to the reforms contained in the Amsterdam Protocol. It is certainly a good thing that you set the reform process in motion in Cologne, but, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we have an answer to the questions you raised here regarding the future prospects for enlargement of the European Union and the shape of our European Union in institutional terms, and our answer to these questions is clear: we want major institutional reform to be undertaken prior to enlargement. The price of a larger Europe must not be a lesser Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, a few words on the new Commission. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you spoke of the new Commission. May I remind you that there will only be a new Commission when the European Parliament inaugurates it by vote of confidence.....</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">.... but if Mr Poettering is going to shout it about that the Chancellor did not speak to a Commissioner-designate before the nomination was made, then in fact I must inform you, Mr Poettering, that former Chancellor Kohl often spoke to Mr Bangemann and you can see how successful that proved to be, i.e. not at all. Talk serves no purpose whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, again on the address from the other side of the House as regards the inauguration of the new Commission, we refuse, and on this matter I now speak on behalf of the Group of the Social Democrats, to make the procedure and timetable of Parliament dependent on the presentation of a report by a non-parliamentary group or a non-parliamentary committee. We will not accept any delay in the inauguration of the Commission. You may well bring this about if you have the support of the majority, Mr Poettering, but then you will also have to explain to the public why a Commission that resigned in March is still in office six months after its resignation. My group will not support these obvious delaying tactics<span class="italic">.</span></p>

<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">(UK) I would like to congratulate Germany on a broadly successful Presidency though I would venture to suggest that it might have been perceived as more successful had it been trumpeted rather less. Recent presidencies – Austria and Luxembourg with their low key presentation – can teach larger Member States such as Germany and the United Kingdom that the impact of a Presidency is sometimes in directly inverse proportion to its fanfare.</p>
<p class="contents">This has been a difficult Presidency. The Kosovo conflict started during the European Council in March. The news that Belgrade had accepted the peace terms came during your Cologne Summit in June; and the resignation of the Commission ten weeks into your Presidency cannot have made life any easier.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to concentrate my remarks on three areas – employment, enlargement and citizenship. Employment, Mr President, is a constant reminder of the failure of Western democracies to be inclusive and I would welcome some very good new ideas that came up during this Presidency. Allowing Member States to reduce VAT on labour-intensive services where there are no cross-border implications; a renewed emphasis on research and development and a more imaginative use of European Investment Bank money such as in the creation of the European technology facility; changes in work organisation and working time to share out better the work available. These are all ideas that came up and they deserve to be pursued.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret that less progress was made on Agenda 2000. The Presidency claims to have created the financial framework for enlargement to the east. I hope that is the case but I believe that the reality is that we backed away from the tough decisions on agricultural reform. That will lead to problems in transatlantic relations and to further delay in the integration of Central and Eastern European applicant countries into the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">But the most important progress has been in the area of citizens' rights. If we are to get this right, we need a new approach from the Member States. If we are to create an area of freedom, security and justice – promised to us at Amsterdam – then we will need transparency. It is a disgrace that important documents regarding the Third Pillar have still not been made public, but I would pay homage to the role of Mr Fischer himself in this particular area and thank him for his help. Amsterdam heralds a new dawn in the rights of European citizens. It was a brave decision of the German Presidency to table and to advance the idea of a charter of fundamental rights. Your pluralistic approach, your attempt to involve the European Parliament and national parliaments can only add to the likelihood of success. We as a Parliament, Mr President-in-Office, look forward to working with the Council and the Commission in securing the anchoring of fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms for the citizen in European law.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For example, is it not the case that the conduct of the red-green Federal Government regarding the Regulation on end-of-life cars has caused it to lose credibility and sacrifice an environmentally-friendly, sustainable policy to short-term opportunism? A rather different attitude can therefore be expected from a member of the Greens, when speaking of the German Council Presidency, not that we would wish to compete with the Opposition for their role, Mr Poettering.</p>
<p class="contents">The German Presidency faced extraordinarily difficult circumstances and we believe that it passed the acid test well; a faltering European Commission which had at last to face facts and which resigned, but which in so doing also afforded a clear view of Europe"s major institutional shortcomings. The staffing implications were quickly dealt with under the German Presidency with the appointment of Prodi, which was an important start. Unfortunately, the Council has failed to speed the progress of the institutional decisions with the same determination, but we wish to extend our particular thanks to Foreign Minister Fischer for his important initiatives, for his important work, in precisely this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Agenda 2000, an ambitious reform project, was to be put into action under the German Presidency in order to deepen European integration and to make the EU fit for enlargement towards the East by means of substantial reforms. Not all the decisions reached at the Berlin Summit were as forward-looking as we had expected. For example, whilst good compromises were reached in the area of finance, which will provide reserves for enlargement of the EU towards the East, only faltering steps have been taken in terms of agricultural reform. It was here that the opportunity to pursue a policy of environmental sustainability, which strengthens regional structures, was thrown away. The German Presidency was marked not least by the escalation of events in Kosovo. The decision to undertake military intervention, in order to oppose a policy of racism, nationalism and ethnic expulsions in a 21st Century Europe, met, as you know, with a variety of reactions in the Green Party. However, the German Presidency demonstrated great commitment to driving forward a solution, what is known as the Fischer-Plan, with the participation of Russia, Finland, and not least the UN. We must now strengthen the region by providing well-directed reconstruction aid in order to prevent renewed destabilisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The German Presidency played its part in strengthening this Europe of common interests. We hope that the learning processes experienced by all parties at this time will contribute towards the strengthening, democratic development and enlargement of Europe. However, the European Parliament also has its part to play now and must carry on the work in precisely this area, which involves strengthening the EU institutions and consolidating the democratic structures of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It remains for me to address a final word to Mr Poettering, without wishing to make reference to decisions on domestic policy, for I feel that as this is a European Parliament, there are other matters besides Germany that we should be discussing But I can assure you of one thing, Mr Poettering, which is that the Green Party did learn from Bosnia, and has now learnt from Kosovo, and we would have taken account of this responsibility today, even had we been at a different Assembly. It was not without reason that we had a great many discussions within the Party, and I think we have made enormous progress in this respect.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A little while ago, you made reference to the fact that your group is called the Christian Democrats and European Democrats. Unification of Germany took place almost nine years ago, and it would please me greatly if, after such a long time, you could at last bring yourself to respect the fact that there is a Democratic-Socialist Left in Germany which is now also represented in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, instead of an Employment Union we"re getting a Defence Union. That is the uninspiring outcome of the German Presidency and the inauspicious message it sent out. The hastily adopted Agenda 2000, which is to secure the financing of the Community and its enlargement, is a half-baked piece of work. Agricultural reform failed to open the door any further to the Applicant States of Central and Eastern Europe. Immediately after the Berlin Summit the Federal Government itself commented that agricultural policy would need to be reformed again in view of enlargement. Not even the nomination of Romano Prodi as President of the Commission was able to camouflage the poor results produced by this Summit. The German EU Presidency took no action to at least put a brake on the euro"s continued decline in value on foreign exchange markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The crisis facing the European Single Currency was not even on the agenda in Cologne. Not a single decision was taken on the taxation of international speculative movements of capital or the fight against tax dumping and tax havens within the Union. As a German MEP, it saddened me greatly that national egotism was to become the hallmark of the German Presidency. The crass way in which the European Directive on end-of-life cars was blocked solely to serve the interests of a German car company caused dismay, as did the overdue appointment of ex-Minister to the Chancellery, Hombach, as envoy to the Balkans and the lack of understanding of the goals and nature of French politics.</p>
<p class="contents">It became clear that in many Member States, people felt they had been duped by this lord of the manor approach to European policy. Our group is as emphatic in its appreciation of the Cologne Summit Decision, which it intends to actively support, so as to further strengthen the fundamental rights of the citizens in the future, as it is resolute in its criticism of the Employment Pact. Since unemployment continues to languish at a high level, this Pact does not merit its name. Indeed, that is one of the reasons why such a shockingly large amount of people stayed away from the European elections. The people of Europe do not understand why European employment policy should degenerate into sound bites. Binding and verifiable, quantitative goals must at last be agreed for economic growth and the fight against unemployment. We vigorously declare our support for a socially responsible Europe and that is why we will not tolerate people lightly putting the social cohesion of the Union at risk, preaching restraint in matters of pay and calling the social security systems into question.</p>
<p class="contents">During the German Presidency, the NATO war in the Balkans, which transgressed international law and dispensed with the authority of the UN, was actively supported by the European Union and its Member States, and at the same time the Community"s conversion to a so-called defence union was sealed. War as an instrument of politics was rendered socially acceptable again and the progress of this fatal course will be speeded further still by the incorporation of the WEU military pact into the European Union and by the build-up of armed forces for intervention. Disarmament, crisis prevention and the settlement of conflict by non-military means, in particular by strengthening the role of the OSCE, risk falling by the wayside. It was this kind of reasoning that led to NATO General Secretary Solana being nominated as the future Mr CFSP. Our group rejects this nomination.</p>
<p class="contents">The German EU Commissioner-designate Mr Verheugen said after the Cologne Summit that it would scarcely have been possible to achieve rapid agreement on the strengthening of a Common Foreign and Security Policy for the Union without the pressure of the Kosovo war. Put another way, war became the driving force and catalyst for European integration. That is disastrous, and looking ahead to the year 2000, a dangerous and misguided path to go down. Those who are now hailing the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe a great success would have done better to have refrained from squandering the money on bombs, rockets and soldiers and instead to have presented the Pact a few months earlier as part of a comprehensive political and non-military plan drawn up by the European Union for the region, and to have provided the OSCE with the necessary means. We give our staunch support to a policy that outlaws war and military violence, banishing it from the lives of all peoples.</p>

It seems to me that the massive and increasing abstention recorded in all of the European countries indicates the emergence and confirmation of a virtual Europe which is distancing itself more and more from European citizens. Another apparent sign of the increasing disinterest of the Europeans in European construction is the lack of interest in the euro, barely six months after its launch. It seems to me – and this is the second lesson to be drawn from the European elections – that an increasing euroscepticism amongst voters in numerous countries has been demonstrated, particularly in the United Kingdom and France, and I believe that by voting for the opposition parties in the large European countries, it is the Europe in which their governments participate that the citizens wanted to reject. I see an enormous paradox in yesterday"s election, on the part of the Right in this hemicycle, of a candidate who, however admirable, is a known federalist, when this does not apparently reflect the view expressed by the voters – particularly those of the Right – in the countries of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that the legitimacy mentioned by the German Foreign Minister can be achieved by reproducing, on a European scale, the party systems to be found in the European countries. This legitimacy can only stem from a Europe which has been ‘reforged’ on the basis of national democracies rather than trying to create a virtual Europe which is ever more distant from the concerns of its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">To return to the Cologne Summit and the consequences of the German Presidency, I will make three points. First of all, the Employment Pact which has been Europe"s old chestnut for a very long time. I believe that a certain German Chancellor whom we have still not forgotten, Helmut Kohl, used a phrase which seems to me to sum the situation up exactly. He said, ‘employment – in other words, unemployment – is and shall remain a national prerogative’. This is precisely the definition of this Europe which is seen to make plans but leaves the problems to the Member Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerning the German Presidency and the six months that have just passed is the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. It is clear that this reform has been and still is a precondition to the negotiations to be held with the World Trade Organisation, which, as we well know, is an instrument of the dominant economy, that is, the American economy. The recent developments that we have seen with regard to the WTO, the way in which the new negotiations will be carried out and, particularly, the appointment of the Director General preferred by the Americans for the first round of the WTO, are very bad omens with regard to European interests. It seems to me that this Europe, which was born of the idea of the Common Market, has become a Single Market and will end up as nothing more than a part of a great global market. That will effectively mean the defeat of the Treaty of Rome project.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the Kosovo affair has also demonstrated the impotence of the European Union and its total diplomatic and military dependence on the dominant military power of NATO. Furthermore, the appointment of the Secretary General of NATO as a representative of the European Common Foreign and Security Policy, appears to complete the picture, and brings to mind that phrase of a French diplomat who said that it is illusory to try to develop a European defence policy while building the European Central Bank in Fort Knox. I believe that the Kosovo affair and its favourable outcome have eclipsed the six months which have just passed. It is very important – for our group at least – that, in the course of the coming institutional reforms, a far greater importance is afforded to national democracies and national parliaments, instead of allowing Europe to sink deeper and distance itself even further from the citizens by creating the kind of democracy that I have described as virtual.</p>

It is now time to review the last six months and as well as assess the German Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">We now face a situation in which the German Presidency has in fact already assessed its own performance. According to a recent statement by the German Minister of State Mr Verheugen, it has been a very successful six months. We find these sentiments repeated in the speech by Minister Fischer. I think some questions are in order here at the very least.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the negotiations for Agenda 2000 produced an agreement that was only a watered-down version of the original ambitious proposals placed on the table by Germany. There is still the danger that whilst the agricultural sector is being reformed, there is no increase in opportunities for enlargement of the Union with countries from Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The nomination of Prodi as President of the European Commission and the recent events in Kosovo have also left their mark on the German Presidency. The rapidity with which Prodi was nominated was good, although it is certainly taking a very long time for the new European Commission to get up and running. Consequently, the European Commission"s work has been at a standstill for far too long. In addition, the war in Kosovo has greatly influenced the way in which the German Presidency has developed.</p>
<p class="contents">Chancellor Schröder also deserves praise for his work in this area, although of course the work of the United States and President Ahtisaari of Finland should not be forgotten. It has highlighted the fact that it is not easy to achieve one common European policy, but I"ve spoken on that subject before.</p>
<p class="contents">What really concerns us is the way in which the German Presidency in the Environment Council dealt with the draft Directive for the handling of end-of-life cars. Of all governments, we might have expected a green/red coalition to have taken the initiative here, rather than prove obstructive. After all, the German car industry doesn"t pull the German government"s strings.</p>
<p class="contents">The private chats between Germany, France and Great Britain also give cause for concern. For example, the posts of Prodi, Solana and Boisieur have recently been allocated during discussions entered into by these three big powers. If this is a sign of the way in which future posts are to be allocated, then this does not augur well for the small Member States. The Council of Ministers will have to become aware of this and adapt its policy so that it is possible to achieve an even distribution of positions across all Member States. As far as that is concerned, one of these small Member States, Finland, can endeavour to bring about change in the coming months. We shall just have to wait and see.</p>
<p class="contents">Preparations for the forthcoming IGC fall to the new Finnish Presidency. There are important items on the agenda for this and our group hopes that they will receive due attention.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The German Presidency was established within the context of the British leadership and the creation of the single currency. Thus, no judgment can be made regarding the outgoing Presidency without taking into consideration the low profile of the previous one and the hopes raised by the appearance of the euro, which were then dashed and now remain on the drawing board.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty of Amsterdam had not resolved the issue of the functioning of the institutions, and in the field of foreign policy the only step forward was the appointment of Mr CFSP who, however, was not yet in office during the Kosovo crisis, which, without waiting for the delays and continued absence of Europe, broke out like a scourge and set off a new spate of the crime of ethnic cleansing which had infected Bosnia.</p>
<p class="contents">The German Presidency was therefore left without sufficient tools at its disposal and the Atlantic Alliance was the only support suitable to confront Milosevic"s policy. Notwithstanding the ambiguous waverings of certain governments, the weight of the European Union was irrelevant for the purposes of military action and Europe was seen to have no autonomous will, even with respect to the Alliances. Was the Cologne European Council meeting a step forward? Perhaps, with regard to the intentions declared, but it all seems very hazy to contemplate setting a date by which the Union will be able to be an autonomous political entity with foreign and security policies. The responsibility of the national governments regarding the excessively delayed implementation of political union is huge and the German Presidency really does not seem to have changed the rhythm. The only positive point is that it included the common defence issue on the Cologne agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue on which the Presidency failed to make progress was that of employment. Having shouted from the roof-tops during the German election campaign that with the socialist rise to power everything would change and a shining path would be embarked on leading to the creation of large numbers of jobs and thereby reversing the negative trend evident in Europe for over ten years, no initiative was taken in this direction and no proposal was discussed with regard to the development of the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Without a concerted economic policy aimed at development it will be difficult to fight unemployment or create conditions adequate to stop the fall of the euro. Since the German Presidency did not do this, how is the Finnish Presidency going to manage it? And how are we going to be able to deal seriously with unemployment with the date for enlargement ever nearer? Political union, foreign policy, defence policy, common economic policy, the fight against unemployment – these seem to be the priorities that no Presidency can ignore. But the Presidencies talk about these issues, pass them, yet fail to implement them. The European Union loses momentum and the citizens continue to call for less talking and more action.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Council Presidency"s track record is questionable, and it is in fact only the Council Presidency itself which disputes this. Let us have a look at the outcome of Agenda 2000 for example. This is not a decent compromise, but a shaky foundation. It will not even withstand the onslaught of the first WTO negotiations. This holds true for the problems associated with agriculture as well, which are far from being resolved, and which have not provided any scope for enlargement whatsoever. All that was achieved was a worsening of the situation in terms of farmers" income. The promising attempt at a solution in the form of co-financing was allowed to slip out of sight at the very beginning, which was an amateurish way to proceed. At first, the German Chancellor stirred up the question of net contributions and the overhaul of the financial framework, particularly in the German public arena, and then, when it came to solving these problems, he failed miserably.</p>
<p class="contents">Institutional progress? Wrong! Everything has been postponed for the future and for future conferences. The single currency, Minister Fischer, which you have rightly claimed to be one of Europe"s great achievements, obviously wasn"t even important enough in the eyes of the Finance Minister, who had responsibility for this matter at the time, for him to attend the first important session. That is also something which should not be forgotten. And where exactly did the gossip concerning the independence of the European Central Bank come from, which was to contribute not least towards the weakening of the euro against foreign currencies, and to the fact that only now, much to our relief, is it beginning to pick up again.</p>
<p class="contents">This Council Presidency"s track record is problematic due, in particular, to the fact that like few before it, it failed to act in a way which was beneficial to the Community. A particular instance of this can be seen in the case of the withdrawn Regulation on end-of-life cars. This was not dealt with in a way which was beneficial to the Community, and it was left to Mr Trittin to play the role of the fanatic, a role which obviously comes very naturally to him.</p>
<p class="contents">No, this Presidency of the Council has forfeited the trust built up by many previous Chancellors over the years, and therefore it is particularly appropriate that we should examine the events of the last six months with a critical eye. We cannot talk in terms of success.</p>

Ladies and gentlemen, the challenges of the German Presidency showed very clearly just how difficult and complex the world we live in is. The news of tragic events in Kosovo held our attention in the spring, and it came as a great relief when the Finnish President, Martti Ahtisaari, informed the Cologne Summit that the Yugoslav authorities would approve a peace plan for Kosovo. It is now very much the responsibility of the EU to start to rebuild the region and stabilise the situation there. The situation in the Western Balkans clearly shows that Europe needs a more effective course of action to ensure stability in this continent. A vital part of that process is the Union"s enlargement to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The indisputable achievement of the German Presidency was the ultimate agreement that Agenda 2000 was vital for the issue of enlargement. It is important during the Finnish presidential term to get a clear indication of just how determined the EU is to make headway in the enlargement process. For that reason we must make a serious effort to introduce <span class="italic">inter alia</span> much-needed institutional reforms. The German Presidency, and now the Finnish Presidency, which has just begun, have been overshadowed by an administrative crisis which culminated in the resignation of the Commission. We all certainly hope the crisis is a prelude to a genuine series of reforms in respect of the way things are done, not only in the Commission, but in the Council and in Parliament also. However, we have to remember that no headway can be made without a new Commission which is functioning successfully. Obviously, Parliament must make full use of its consultative and monitoring rights in respect of the institutions, including the Commission, but it also has to be aware of its responsibility in this important situation to ensure that the new Commission may begin its work as soon as possible. We must be particularly careful that national political passions do not predominate over the common European interest. Unfortunately, I think there have been signs of this in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The citizens of the European Union, our own citizens, who were disturbingly passive in the European parliamentary elections, hope, above all, that the Union will improve the situation regarding employment. A healthy rate of employment is also essential for the equitable development of our societies. For that reason, we must embark on the practical implementation of the European Employment Pact, which was concluded at Cologne. It is also important to pay close attention to ensuring that the economic policies of the EU Member States are compatible, and to developing courses of action in order to bring this about. That will be vital in ensuring that the employment rate rises.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first six months of this year have demonstrated, once more, the need for European integration on the one hand and the need to continue the process of enlargement on the other. With regard to the latter, the war in Kosovo reminds us of the wisdom of the Copenhagen criteria which stipulate, amongst other things, respect for human rights on the part of all applicant countries as a precondition for their accession to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Cologne European Council, which unquestionably confirmed this double ambition, shows us the enormity of the task still to be undertaken and the additional efforts which are required in this area. The European Council meeting in Cologne, despite all the efforts of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council – to which I would like to pay particular tribute – still nevertheless raises some major questions. I would like to highlight two of them.</p>
<p class="contents">The first relates to point 53 of the conclusions of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council, and I would like to ask the German Foreign minister how we should interpret the mandate of the Intergovernmental Conference and particularly – and I quote – the possible use of qualified majority voting in the Council – end of quote – in view of the declaration of Belgium, France and Italy, annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam. I would like to ask you whether these three Member States who, in Amsterdam, made the reinforcement of the institutions an essential condition, and therefore a prerequisite, for the conclusion of preliminary accession negotiations, still maintain the reservations annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, or whether they have moderated their position in the meantime.</p>
<p class="contents">My second question concerns the common security policy, particularly with regard to defence. In my opinion, any European Union defence policy will overlook the basic problem for as long as the Member States do not accept the indivisible nature of security in the territory of the European Union. We are still not there. To this end, I would like to ask Minister Fischer if he envisages, apart from the conclusions of Cologne, a short or medium-term perspective on allowing accession to those countries which have not signed up to Article 5 of the amended Treaty of Brussels, that is, the mutual assistance clause which binds countries which are currently Members of the Western European Union. I believe that the subsequent and essential stages will depend on this question if we want to realise the contents of the provisions of Chapter J IV of the Treaty of Maastricht.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We envisage an important role for the EU as a non-violent civilian peace maker. For this reason, we regret that the German presidency did not follow the European Parliament"s recommendation to the Council to carry out a pilot study for a European civilian peace corps. We are also worried about the resolutions of the meeting in Cologne which have been interpreted around the world as important steps towards militarising the EU. The Swedish government has been forced to say that if more steps are taken in the same direction, a veto would have to be lodged. The Finnish presidency has requested clarification as to whether the Cologne resolution means that the EU would only be able to intervene following a UN mandate, or whether the EU, like NATO, would be entitled to take the law into its own hands.</p>
<p class="contents">Joschka Fischer now states that the resolutions taken in Cologne do <span class="italic">not</span> imply a militarisation of the EU, which all sounds very nice. But why then are Poettering and Goerens, who are now in the vanguard for a militarisation of the EU, so satisfied? Why is the WEU military alliance integrated into the EU? Why, according to the resolutions taken in Cologne, is the EU to create a military commission, a military council and other military institutions? I really do hope that Joschka Fischer is serious when he says that the EU will not be militarised, which would reunite him with the Greens" fundamental principles of non-violence. As a non-violent civilian body, the EU is indeed able to play a very important positive role. Were we, however, to become a military superpower competing with other superpowers for world hegemony, the EU would only contribute to power struggles, chaos and warfare, which I sincerely hope will not be the case.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With the approval of Agenda 2000, I believe we have produced an agreement between those people whose unfair and selfish motto is <span class="italic">'I want my money back'</span> and all those who, led by the government of my country, believe that the European Union is a political project with cohesion and solidarity as its cornerstones.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that the Presidency reacted quickly in the face of the resignation of the Santer Commission and found that ‘one in a million’ which Mr Prodi appears to be. It also seems to me that the appointment of Mr CFSP, after the image which we projected in Kosovo, demonstrates at least that the Presidency wanted to shake up the European Union"s lethargic foreign policy and give it a new impulse. And this new stability plan for the Balkans seems to me to be a positive thing.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Mr President, there is one thing which has reflected badly, very badly, on this Presidency. I refer to the reform of institutions. Mr Fischer, if there is one thing which all this morning"s speakers have agreed upon, it is the fact that the Cologne Summit does not form a basis for the reform of the Union"s institutions. We want the European Union to work, we want to maintain the principle of integration and we want it to be effective. The proposal of the German Presidency in Cologne, that is, to change the number of Commissioners, reconsider votes, perhaps to move in some areas from a unanimous vote to a qualified majority vote, is quite clearly insufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">I will go further. You do not understand the protocol of the Union"s institutions. If you believe that there will be enlargement to more than 21 Members, profound institutional reform is required. What you proposed to us in Cologne was a limited reform. And not only I myself, on behalf of my group, but also all the other groups in this Parliament, say that this will only achieve one thing: it will obstruct the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe, Mr Fischer, that we in this Parliament are bored of so much verbiage. You came to us and said, and I quote, ‘I praise the role of the European Parliament and the revision of the institutions’. Let me ask you not to praise so much and not to laugh so much. Take note of what we do. We have a resolution dated 19 November 1997 in which we propose a method for the reform of the institutions. We told you of it and you have not taken it into account. Well, we will meet again in this Parliament, Mr Fischer, and you will see that this Parliament will be unanimous in its rejection of any reform which does not guarantee the effectiveness of the Union and guarantee that it really serves the interests of the citizens.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am nevertheless extremely concerned by his speech, concerned because it expressed more than the fact that he represents the largest group and forged an alliance with the Liberals for the election of the President of this House. But if this pact is supposed to be one which is somehow intended to strike terror into the hearts of, or rather, create difficulties for, the governments led by Social Democrats, then Mr Poettering and his group should be made aware that this doesn"t just create difficulties for Social Democrat-led governments, nor does it only create difficulties for governments like that of Austria, which also includes a Conservative party and a Christian People"s party, but it causes difficulties for the process of European unification.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of my group I would also like to make very clear at this point that we will not be judging the Commission and the new Commissioners on their party political affiliations, but on the skill, clarity and correctness of their past and present stances, and we believe that these must be the only criteria by which to judge them.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to the fundamental aspects of the Presidency. In many respects, it was a successful Presidency, I would like to acknowledge that quite clearly, certainly as far as Agenda 2000 is concerned and the furthering of the enlargement process, and also concerning the difficult decisions relating to the Balkans and security policy. I would especially like to give my personal thanks not only to the Chancellor, but also to the Foreign Minister, to the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Fischer, who is present today, for doing everything in his power to bring us out of this difficult state of armed conflict. Opinions on whether the war was justified, or whether it could have been prevented, vary throughout this House, but the German Presidency, and I would like to make particular mention of the Foreign Minister at this point, managed to act on the basis of a clear position with regard to the crimes of Milosevic"s regime, but also on the basis of a clear position whose most ardent wish was for peace in the Balkans. It was handled well and properly, and that deserves distinct recognition.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, and since security policy comes up for discussion here again and again, I would like to clearly emphasise the following: security policy is not about militarisation of the European Union. It is about employing all the instruments of security policy to take whatever preventative measures can be taken, and I have said repeatedly that many opportunities for taking preventative action have been missed in past years, and no group, nor any Presidency can claim here that they did everything possible to prevent this war. Therefore, we must now support all the forces in Serbia and Yugoslavia which are striving for a new political system, which are standing up for democracy, for human rights, for respect for minorities. This is the only chance of success. The second thing, and this is extremely important, is that we must enable all of those who are returning – and thank God there are so many returning, it was also the right decision to keep the refugees in the region where possible – to get through the winter in conditions which are acceptable for human beings. That is why the money for this must quickly be made available, and the appropriate organisation must be established, so that the largest part of our work does not go on ensuring that there is co-ordination between one organisation and another, but is devoted to giving substantial help to the Balkans, so that the Balkans will finally become a peaceful region in Europe.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank all those who sang our praises and who gave us their support, and I would also like to answer some criticisms. Something that we never promised, and there was no way on earth that this could be done, was that in these last six months we could resolve every problem facing the European Union, problems which I too have dearly wanted to see resolved for some time.</p>
<p class="contents">On criticism of the institutional reforms; we tried to make progress with the institutional reforms, and when I made my maiden speech as Germany took over the Council Presidency, it was still not at all clear whether we would actually receive support for an Intergovernmental Conference. I am glad that it was possible to push this through. I see this as an important step forwards.</p>
<p class="contents">But this is where the critics got themselves into a terrible muddle, and sometimes, all logic went out of the window. To my colleague in the PDS who, on the one hand, criticised us for ignoring French sensibilities and also the aims of French politics and yet, at the same time, heavily criticised the inadequacy of the compromise on the agricultural commodities market that was worked out at the Berlin Summit, I can only say that these things go hand in hand, and you should look more closely at whether you have not, as it were, ended up getting yourself entangled in a knot of contradictions. It will become clear to you in the weeks and months to come that these things are very closely linked.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to those of you who are talking of the militarisation of the European Union, and this is an important point, keep your illusions. This would mean that in the areas of security and foreign policy, Europe would not be in a position to determine its own fate, that is, to follow its own path. During the war in Kosovo, I experienced just how much weight Europe can bring to bear in terms of possibilities for shaping situation by political means, and in terms of possibilities for pursuing a preventative foreign policy, a preventative peace policy, and for resolving a conflict when the conflict has worsened. I can only say that Europe must come together, also in terms of its security and foreign policy, otherwise decisions will be taken elsewhere. Here in the European Parliament or perhaps in any one of the Member States, it may be easy to sit back and allow oneself the illusion that we are not affected by such decisions. The reality is that these decisions are taken under completely different conditions and in a completely different place. This is exactly what I do not want, and I believe it to be a development in the wrong direction.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">The euro is showing that there are differing views on Europe, and we should not pretend otherwise. It is quite obvious that there are. My view is that of a convinced integrationist and I would like to see Europe become an entity which has the power to act politically, because there are two reasons which convince me that it will not work in any other way. The first reason is that in this age of globalisation, it will only be possible to maintain the European nation-state and that which we value and wish to preserve about the European nation-state, if Europe unites, because the magnitude of the traditional nation-state will only be able, in the conditions created by globalisation, to guarantee peace, security, prosperity and democracy for its citizens as part of an integrated Europe, in other words, if we have a European entity, a European Union which has the power to act.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason though, and this was clearly demonstrated again by the war in Kosovo, and perhaps the various lessons history has taught us also have a role to play here, particularly in central Europe, is that there can only be one form of security for this continent. We cannot permit nationalism, racism, and what amounts to a primitive and crude form of fascism, to take hold on this continent. Since 1992, we have tried everything in order to convince Milosevic to abandon this policy. I took part in the final stages of the talks at Rambouillet right through to the beginning of the military action and I did not meet anyone on the Western side, even amongst the Americans, who was behaving like a war-monger, but rather everyone was striving for compromise up to the proverbial last minute. The only party not interested in a compromise was Milosevic and the government in Belgrade. I personally had a two and a half hour long discussion with Milosevic, and for one of those hours there was no one else present. Should we have sat back? Should we have said that we would like to help, but we cannot, as it would offend our pacifist principles and we have no resolution from the UN Security Council?</p>
<p class="contents">The UN is stronger today as a result of this conflict, and this is one of the effects of Europe"s role during this conflict. The Security Council is stronger today, unlike after Bosnia, which weakened it. I think that we should acknowledge that...</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">....., that this is a result of the concerted efforts of the European Member States, of the European Union. We should not forget this. Let me tell you, I was in Bosnia, I saw the mass graves and I will not forget them as long as I live. It is our duty to complete the process of European integration, and this means peace, security and democracy for everyone on this continent. This requires our determination to oppose those who seek to carry out nationalist policies through violence, murder, terror and expulsion, and when all other means fail, to resort to military means if necessary. This integrated Europe must not accept nationalism.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">That is the most important point, although it was not included in the plans for our Presidency of the Council, because it gives a very strong message about the future of the European Union. I am firmly convinced that in essence, this must go hand in hand with progress towards integration, and above all with the process for further democratisation. This will be a very complex and complicated debate, but we must start this debate, which in France is summed up under the heading ‘Culmination of European Union’, and it will continue for a long time. Where do the outer borders of the European Union lie? What does the make-up of its constitution look like? What is the relationship between the European Union and its Member States, and the relationship between the institutions themselves? What will the future role of the Parliament be and how can its powers be strengthened?</p>
<p class="contents">These are all questions which will relate directly to enlargement, because we can already see what heavy weather a Union of fifteen Members makes of things. If enlargement occurs, the question of the Union"s ability to act will be absolutely central. This is the essence of the next great challenge; common security and foreign policy, deepening and, ultimately, enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a message for all those who speak in favour of a preventative peace policy, and there is a broad consensus in the national parliaments as well as in the European Parliament, in spite of all the things Dayton failed to deliver, and that is not a criticism of Dayton as presumably it couldn"t have been any other way at the time, and that message is that a strategy which will be effective in the long-term for bringing South-Eastern Europe up to the level of an integrated Europe and then bringing it into an integrated Europe, has now become a functioning policy. Life must now be breathed into the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe. Money is not the first and foremost issue here, for the issue is one of decisions about structures. We must bring about confidence there and we must establish a free trade area there. Trade and change must replace national aggressions and the necessary means must be put in place to achieve this. So I appeal to all of you who have spoken here in favour of a preventative peace policy, to fight for the long-term success of the Stability Pact, because that would indeed be drawing the right conclusions from the war in Kosovo, the Yugoslavian wars of succession.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like once again to thank everyone, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for your support during the German Presidency, and I wish you, the new Parliament, all the best, as I do the coming new Commission, once they have survived the difficult hearings. These are the Commissioners who have yet to be appointed in the torture chambers, and I mean this ironically and, of course, only in a rhetorical sense, of the freely-elected European Parliament. All the best! I would also like, if you would permit me to, to make a parting request of you, and in particular of the new majority: we should discuss national politics at a national level and argue intensely about them, and come to blows, but it is European politics that should be discussed at the European level, and this House should always uphold the subtle differences!</p>

I was going to say that he has been one of the few, if not the only, shining lights under this Presidency. Mr Swoboda mentioned the new majority, yes the new majority gives the profile and views of this Parliament clarity, and that is good for Europe, Mr Swoboda.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, I have no option but to grade the German Presidency as overall ‘unsatisfactory’ for the first six months of this year. The grandiose announcement of a new Employment Pact turned out in reality to be a castle in the air. When analysing the Cologne Decisions in detail, it is possible to see that not one new idea was added to the Luxembourg guidelines of the previous year.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the language and style adopted by the German Government over the last six months have at times caused me to feel ashamed in the European Parliament. This style has been of no use to Europe and it has certainly been of no use to the German Presidency. Mr Trittin"s loutish conduct in terminating the nuclear Treaties led of course to the German Presidency"s proposals being regarded with great scepticism. The shameful withdrawal of the sound proposal for co-financing in agricultural policy was also the consequence of a similarly ill-advised policy. And to cap it all, I might add that Chancellor Schröder said Helmut Kohl"s cheque book diplomacy must at last be brought to an end!</p>
<p class="contents">I do not wish to say any more at all on the nomination of the German candidate, which in view of the choice, was a resounding slap in the face, and so to conclude I shall express a wish. As long as the dictator Milosevic is at the helm in Serbia, neither a penny nor a euro of the European taxpayer"s money should go to Serbia. Democracy must first be restored there. That is the message the Council Presidency should take away with it.</p>

<p class="contents">I say this because in the first place, it has been unable to achieve any reform of countries" own resources, which should be based solely on the Gross National Product, the only fair, equitable and transparent basis for contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it has not reformed the Common Agricultural Policy, which was imposed in order to make us adopt an offensive position in the next round of GATT negotiations. Without wishing to denigrate the efforts of Commissioner Fischler, it was almost a reform which maintained the<span class="italic"> status quo</span> which had never secured the sought-after balance between farmers, regions and their cultures, in which farming in the Mediterranean was once again badly treated by the CAP. It did not guarantee, in any practical sense, the completion of the European Farm Model, almost nothing was done in this area to help small farmers and very little progress was made on the issue of rural development.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, this Agenda 2000 runs the risk of leading us towards a Europe which is less evenly-balanced and less united. I shall give you two examples from the country I know best, which is my own. Firstly, all the studies have shown that the Portuguese economy is the one which will be most affected by competition from the new Member States from Eastern Europe, but nothing has been done to support Portugal in this area. Secondly, nothing has been done to improve the situation of Portuguese farming, the one which is the most debt-ridden, backward and least-favoured by the CAP. Apart from the durum wheat quota, Portugal has gained nothing specific from this CAP unlike some countries such as Spain or Italy which have benefited from arrangements made specifically for them. It is true that we in Portugal suffer from a government which is incompetent and unable to negotiate successfully, but this does not justify all the treatment we have received. We need a more united Europe in order to move forwards.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is no castle in the air, but a long overdue, concrete attempt to go beyond employment guidelines and achieve co-ordination of economic policy within the European Union, particularly with a view to promoting growth. We need structural reform in the European Economic and Monetary Union, in the European Union. However, it is equally important to achieve increased and more rapid growth. That is our aim. In this respect, the national governments are right, as far as the European Employment Pact is concerned, not to delegate responsibility for employment policy to the European Union. However, they are aware that in this age of globalisation a common solution must be found, and that is right. There should simply be more concrete terms of reference and guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">But I should like to ask something of the forthcoming Presidencies. We also failed under the German Presidency to improve the democratic legitimacy of Economic and Monetary Union dealings. We urgently need there to be inter-institutional agreement between the Council, Commission and European Parliament on the essential features of economic policy. In addition, we need the guidelines on employment and economic policy to be integrated, and we need the institutional framework for the European Employment Pact to be modified, something which is of great importance. In other words, it is more democracy that we need and not for the European Employment Pact to increase the democratic deficit, and this is what this Parliament demanded during the previous legislative period.
