<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schmit,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, it has been agreed that the European Council of 22 March will focus on the Lisbon Strategy, which was the subject of our debate this morning, as well as on the Stability and Growth Pact, even if there is still a chance that this issue may be settled before the European Council meets. The Council will also discuss the sustainable development strategy and the Kyoto Protocol. In view of the fact that the Lisbon Strategy was discussed in this morning’s sitting, I do not intend to return to it again now. Instead, I will focus on the other two or three topics.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of these is the Stability and Growth Pact. The Council has been debating reform of the Stability and Growth Pact for some time now, and indeed there are those who probably feel that it has been debating it for too long. It was discussed on several occasions during the Dutch Presidency, and every Ecofin meeting under the Luxembourg Presidency has taken the issue as its central focus.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this in-depth debate and the changes requested by the finance ministers, on 8 March the Presidency presented a document to Ecofin aimed at finding a balanced solution that would meet the needs of all the Member States. It does so by proposing a compromise which is founded on good economic sense – an issue which was also debated by the House this morning – and which provides an answer to the real need for increased flexibility during difficult periods, as well as calling for tighter budgetary discipline during times of growth and prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Ecofin Council was unable to reach an agreement on a report to the European Council during its meeting of 8 March, the Presidency will continue talks with the aim of finding a solution that is acceptable to everyone and that can be presented to the Heads of State or Government. Another meeting of the Ecofin Council has been called for 20 March, or in other words two days before the European Council meets.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning I mentioned that a failure to reach an agreement would entail real and significant risks. It is an unfortunate fact that the current Pact would not simply be applied as though nothing had happened, and that failure to reach an agreement would not boost the credibility of the current Pact. At the same time, however, a compromise at all costs – a cut-price compromise, one could say – would be an equally poor solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, this is an area where Europe is under close observation, first and foremost by the citizens, who expect their decision-makers to be able to pursue economic and budgetary policies that sacrifice neither growth to stability, nor stability to a growth that is at best short-lived.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not yet resign ourselves to failure, however, as there is still every chance that a balanced and credible solution may be reached. If we achieve such a solution, which we very much hope to do, the Commission will be provided with a clear mandate regarding the improvements the Member States have agreed to make to the Pact, and the procedures necessary for a formal revision of the Pact’s provisions can then be set in motion. Revision of either of the two regulations will entail a Commission proposal and the involvement of Parliament in accordance with the rules set out in the Treaties, which are in fact different for each of the regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now move on to sustainable development and the Kyoto Protocol, both of which are obviously also closely linked to the Lisbon Strategy, given that this morning we came to the conclusion that the environmental aspect of the Lisbon Strategy should be retained or even given extra weight. It is therefore quite natural that the European Council should also deal with issues relating to sustainable development and the Kyoto Protocol. The Presidency believes that sustainable development should be an overarching concept, and one of the aims of the European Council will be to clarify how changes to the sustainable development strategy should be tackled in future.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, the guiding principles of sustainable development could be enshrined in a charter, one of the main components of which would be a series of relevant indicators to be used in the various policies in the future. The Commission could submit a proposal to this effect to the European Council to be held in June.</p>
<p class="contents">Time is short, however, and in our opinion it would be a good idea if the new sustainable development strategy were to be finalised and presented before the end of the year. We all agree that climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing humanity, and that it has a major impact in environmental, economic and social terms. We were therefore delighted when the Kyoto Protocol came into force, and we are also delighted that the Russian Federation has ratified the Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our firm intention to give new impetus to international negotiations. In order to do so, our first task will be to examine the options that exist for a UN-led post-2012 regime that would ensure that the highest possible level of cooperation was achieved from all countries. This week’s Environment Council will focus on this issue, and should come to some kind of conclusion. It will then be necessary to draft a long-term strategy for the European Union, the aim of which should be to stop emissions from exceeding the much-quoted 2ºC increase in temperature and to reduce total emissions from 30% to 15% against 1990 levels by 2020. Finally, a study should be drafted with the aim of achieving a good cost-benefit ratio for all of these measures. It should be plain to everyone that the European Council has a very full agenda; it will deal with issues that are of major significance for the future of the European Union, yet at the same time it will also reassure Europeans that this Europe of ours is concerned about their present and future problems.</p>

<p class="contents">I believe that, in this area too, the forthcoming European Council has a crucial role to play in implementing this ambitious strategy and we must not miss this opportunity. This European Council comes at a very important time, firstly because it is taking place just as a new Parliament and a new Commission are starting to find their feet and to set out their working methods for the next few years, and also because a wide-ranging debate on the ratification of the Constitution is due to take place, a debate that will focus on the type of Europe that we want and the type of Europe that we are capable of building for our fellow citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, we must demonstrate at the forthcoming European Council that the EU is actually working and that the EU is capable of successfully launching new initiatives that produce tangible results in the lives of Europe’s citizens. </p>
<p class="contents">Let me single out the two main deliverables for this European Council. First, there is the need to relaunch the Lisbon Strategy and to re-focus it on growth and jobs in order to bring our wider economic, social and environmental objectives within reach. This requires more than just words. People need to see a real commitment from Member States. That is why our new approach to working to support Members States in delivering on the Lisbon objectives is critical.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, we must ensure that a stronger Stability and Growth Pact emerges from the summit with its credibility reinforced. Both these goals are well within our grasp, and I would like to comment on each one in turn.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to Lisbon, I would simply emphasise the importance of giving fresh momentum to the process of reform. That is why the European Council should make a clear commitment to the new governance mechanisms, the new integrated guidelines and the national and EU Lisbon programmes, with simple reporting and better coordination of reforms at a national level. The launch and follow-up to the renewed Lisbon approach must be prepared via close cooperation between the Commission, the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now turn to the Stability and Growth Pact. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware that operation of the Stability and Growth Pact has recently experienced problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Differing interpretations of the Treaty and of the Stability Pact have led to uncertainties over the methods of budgetary supervision. We need an interpretation which can ensure the pact’s effectiveness and credibility, without the need to re-write the pact itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday’s ECOFIN discussions were inconclusive. The Presidency has opted to hold a further meeting of ministers prior to the European Council. Nonetheless, I continue to hope that the spring summit can unveil a renewed and more credible pact, based on a comprehensive, consistent and balanced solution.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue to fight for the principles it submitted, in particular for reform of the pact. The deficit and debt benchmarks set out in the Treaty must continue to be complied with as the cornerstone of the system. The preventive aspect of the pact can be improved, in particular by defining medium-term budgetary targets specific to each country.</p>
<p class="contents">When the economic situation is buoyant, budgetary policy must remain sound. Excessive deficits must be identified unambiguously and corrected rapidly. However, the timescale for the correction could take account of economic factors. As for the Commission, it will continue to make all possible efforts with the Presidency and Member States to reach an agreement – but not an agreement at any price.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council’s conclusions will also cover other important issues. On some of them, such as sustainable development and climate change, it is also vital to reach agreement if we are to use the Lisbon reforms to underpin sustainable growth. I await with interest the political impetus to come from the European Council towards a European charter for sustainable development, which the Commission will certainly follow up and support.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we shall certainly review the latest developments in the Middle East and Iraq, and shall examine the progress made in preparation for the next round of enlargement and any future negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will close by saying that this summit is an opportunity we cannot afford to miss. It must set the tone for future reforms by relaunching Lisbon and reinforcing the credibility of the Stability and Growth Pact. As we said this morning, the two are linked.</p>
<p class="contents">What is at stake here is our credibility, and the way we demonstrate to European citizens that we are seriously concerned for the future of Europe and determined to work towards that end.</p>
<p class="contents">The public, the electorate, would simply not understand if we were unable to achieve a breakthrough, or if the summit ended not with a success but with winners and losers. Any fine distinctions we may wish to introduce in areas such as which institution does what, or whether the new Lisbon strategy is more to the left, right or centre, will be irrelevant to the majority of our citizens. For them, the issue is Europe, not one particular institution or another or one particular aspect or another. It is therefore extremely important to send a consistent message and to show that we are really working together in the interests of our Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Projecting an image of disharmony between institutions or conveying a tentative or pessimistic message on the future of Europe would inevitably have a negative effect on public opinion, something particularly dangerous at a time when the constitutional treaty is going through the ratification process. However, I believe we have a first-rate chance of success. We have a competent and determined Presidency. We have a Commission which is making its very best efforts. We are achieving an important victory today by showing our shared determination to achieve a new Lisbon strategy. We have demonstrated today that it is genuinely possible to reach a stronger and dynamic consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore vital to show the European Council that we can assist Europe in moving up to a higher gear. We can launch the reform process and begin to mobilise opinion in favour of a European renewal. That is what is at stake at the spring meeting of the European Council – to ensure that our vision is translated into action.</p>

<p class="contents">For my own part, I remain convinced that the foundations of the Stability and Growth Pact must not be tampered with. The current threshold values – 3% for new debt and 60% for outstanding debt, measured in terms of gross national product – are so closely entwined with the euro’s exchange rate that they must be retained if the single currency is to be kept stable and solid. It is also fundamental to the Pact that a state’s budget should be considered as a single whole when assessing compliance with the criteria; this is not just prescribed by general budgetary law, but also enjoined upon us by sound human reason. A single, integral budget cannot be evaluated both with and without whole categories of expenditure. That is why we cannot have the situation in which categories of expenditure that some Member States regard as special burdens are excluded when assessing to what degree the stability criteria have been adhered to.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, the Pact – containing as it does also a substantial growth component – does make provision for the possible nuanced valuation of a national budget in the light of the country’s current position in the economic cycle. For that reason, the current procedures have to be retained, while making their detailed course and consequences dependent on the realities of budget policy, and this – as I told the House a few weeks ago – for the reason that the Pact is called a ‘Stability and Growth Pact’ and excessive stability must not be allowed to hamper growth rather than it being stimulated.</p>
<p class="contents">The ECOFIN Council has listed possible approaches to a more finely-honed evaluation of the nation states’ efforts at achieving stability. I very much hope that some of these will prove the key to bringing about a final agreement prior to the summit on 22 and 23 March.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now just say something else about the Lisbon strategy. The disappointing results at the end of its first half are, in essence, attributable to a too widely-dispersed range of goals. That is why, if we are to end up with tangible successes after the next five years, we need to concentrate on a number of essential objectives, and so I am in favour of an approach that relies more than hitherto on the nation states implementing the Lisbon requirements. This allows a certain degree of competition around what are termed ‘best practices’<span class="italic">,</span> that can in fact do nothing but good in terms of the strategy’s overall success. In future, we should cut the really big announcements down to size if it is not absolutely certain that they will actually be implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If I consider it as an economist – which is what I was trained to be – then there are many countries that make a success of things without stability rules; the USA is often quoted as an example. There are countries that strictly observe stability rules and achieve but little success, and the reverse also occurs. From an economic point of view, then, a variety of approaches are possible, but there are good reasons why we, having established ourselves as a community and now being desirous of creating a single market, should equip ourselves with a Stability and Growth Pact of this kind, the most important of these being the introduction of the euro. Despite the many prophecies of doom, originating not least from this House, we have ended up with a strong euro – it could even be described as too strong, and that is why now is very definitely the time to rearrange matters; not, though, by abandoning the Stability and Growth Pact, but by taking into account economic conditions in the individual countries.</p>
<p class="contents">What is needed is not special arrangements for Germany, but the recognition that special economic conditions can occur in any of our Member States. Once such a change is made, it does of course follow that every country – whether Germany or some other – must abide by the rules. Some account should also be taken of the fact that Germany is still the European Union’s main paymaster. With this in mind, I regard the Luxembourg Presidency’s proposals as very, very worthwhile, and I hope that they will prove to be a successful solution. I hope that the Commission and its President will be able to help us on our way to a real solution. Second only to that solution and to the boosting of the Lisbon process, we need two things: closer coordination of general growth and economic policy between the individual countries, and a solution to the financial perspectives, if at all possible before Luxembourg vacates the presidency. I know that a heavy burden rests upon your shoulders – not, perhaps, broad ones in terms of your country – but I do hope you will be able to sort this out. In any case – and I am speaking on my group’s behalf when I say this – we wish the Luxembourg Presidency much success. It has brought with it all that is needed to resolve this issue with, not least, a new and rational reform of the Stability and Growth Pact. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With unemployment at 9% in Europe and a growth forecast of only 1.6% in the euro zone, it is perfectly clear that the time for talking is over and we need to take fundamental action in order to relaunch growth and employment. We need shared budgetary discipline. We must reaffirm that clearly so that there can be no doubt in anyone’s mind. It is the responsibility of each Member State to control public expenditure, to act to reduce their deficit and to stabilise or even cut the debt burden. Failing this, future generations will bear the cost, and the more the Member States try to circumvent the rules which they themselves introduced, the more they will destabilise the system as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">If we have rules, we obviously need to ensure they are adhered to. If not, they serve no purpose. It is only when we have agreed on these basic, common-sense principles that we can open the debate on possible changes in the pact. Moreover, these changes must take account of the nature of economic cycles and the necessary distinction between an operating deficit and an investment deficit.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another and even more important question facing us: can we live in the longer term with common budgetary discipline while at the same time operating different economic policies? In my view, the answer is no. I believe we must urgently decide to coordinate our economic policies, failing which we shall never be able to generate our own growth.</p>
<p class="contents">We are fortunate in having a President of the European Council who is simultaneously the Eurogroup President. Let us, therefore, take advantage of it. The time is now ripe – it is now or never – to introduce economic governance which is so lacking in Europe and to take initiatives which will finally get things moving. We propose that the major investment for the future should be made on a European scale. I am thinking, for instance, of defence, research or major infrastructure investment. We are lagging far behind in this area and I think the time has come to change that – or at least to make an attempt to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">There you have it, ladies and gentlemen. Of course we will need ambition, determination and courage, but I am sure of one thing: none of us acting alone and in isolation can achieve it. If we want to create growth and employment, if we want to continue to implement an innovative social model, the only solution is to do more at European level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe we need to make progress towards greater differentiation of the national economies, particularly by reference to their debt levels and the demands placed on them. Therefore, we agree on an explicit list of factors which – to borrow Mr Prodi’s expression – would render a political and more intelligent assessment of the Stability Pact possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, reform of the pact still falls short of a European coordination of budgetary policy – Mrs de Sarnez just referred to this. On this point, I would say to the Council that the statement I read after the ECOFIN Council, in particular to the effect that an agreement reached within the euro zone by the 12 Member States would not necessarily be ratified by all members of the Council, namely by all 25 Member States, constitutes, in my view, an extremely worrying signal from a political standpoint.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point of view, the triangle to which Mr Juncker referred at the start of the Luxembourg Presidency when discussing the Lisbon strategy, the Stability Pact and the financial perspective, makes a lot of sense. I believe that interpretation of the Stability Pact should echo the readiness of Member States to make extra budgetary efforts in order to obtain a financial perspective and a European Union budget fit for purpose and able to deliver the objectives we should like it to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point of view, the political timing is not particularly good, since we are asking the spring meeting of the European Council to reach agreement on Lisbon and on the Stability Pact, while possibly postponing the debate on the financial perspective until June. However, I believe that this danger of a rift between the new Member States, in particular, and the old Member States is a political risk which should not be underestimated in this whole debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to sustainable development, I am quite surprised by, let us call it, the superficiality of the proposition. The European Commission has issued a report on the Community strategy for sustainable development which therefore concerns the Union’s sectoral policies. This report is highly critical. It is honest enough to be extremely critical. Therefore, if the major political impetus which Mr Barroso is expecting and which we, too, are hoping for from the Council consists merely of saying, ‘we plan to draw up a European chart of indicators’ – we would say: is that all? All you need to do is to look at the European Environment Agency’s reports and you will have your indicators.</p>
<p class="contents">We are expecting a great deal more; we are expecting much more restrictive targets to be set in the areas of transport policy, energy policy and the Kyoto commitments. It is no longer enough to keep going back to the question of the indicators saying, in the morning, ‘we want fewer indicators’’, and in the afternoon, ‘we want more’. What exactly do we want? We want successful policies and we want the Commission and Council to abide seriously by the Gothenburg commitments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The last, by the way, is an issue on which everyone except Parliament is taking action.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, instead, that these aspects should all be dealt with together. Indeed, social cohesion and growth in the number and quality of jobs have certainly not been facilitated by <span class="italic">laissez-faire</span> policies focusing on competitiveness, nor by monetarist policies. These have even been enshrined in the new Constitutional Treaty, the only case in history where a constitution includes a monetary treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">We are confronted by the paradox of a Europe with a very strong currency but a weak economy in a deepening crisis and a society in great difficulty. There is a growing number of factors that are likely to make the situation even worse, such as those implicit in the Bolkestein directive, in the European budget cuts and in the false flexibility of the Stability Pact, which some would like to see used only to downgrade pensions. That has all led to a Europe of social fragmentation, relocations and the inevitable decline in its social and cultural model.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to set off along a new path, one that breaks with <span class="italic">laissez-faire</span> economics and monetarism, is based on an upward harmonisation of rights and wage levels and provides new impetus for quality development. To achieve that, it is necessary on the left to break out of the Stability Pact straitjacket so as to invest within individual countries – but also directly as the European Union – in research, innovation and whatever else is needed to promote development. What we need, therefore, is a different Europe, a social Europe, the kind of Europe that we shall be demanding at the European demonstration in Brussels on 19 March. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For the first time, we can now see the list of the groups. It can be found on the Commission’s website or, even easier, can be downloaded from my website at bonde.com. Mrs Wallström, the Vice-President of the Commission, yesterday agreed that we can also have the names of the participants. Thank you. Now, we shall soon see whether those advising the Commission on smoking are from the tobacco industry or from groups working to combat cancer.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank the Commission for agreeing that in future we can find out about all the contributions from the Commission to the Council of Ministers and its working groups. Eighty-five per cent of all legislation is finally completed in 300 working groups and in Coreper. Until now, we have been excluded from the majority of this legislation. Now, we have been promised the greatest reform in openness to date. I am as happy as a little boy on Christmas Day, because I have been working towards such openness for many years. Thank you. It is almost too good to be true.</p>
<p class="contents">Now it is your turn over in the Council. My dear Council of Ministers, can the Luxembourg Presidency not ask that the 300 working groups dealing with legislation be laid open to Parliament? It is humiliating that elected representatives must always beg for the documents in a corridor or from a lobbyist or from a student at one of the permanent representations, or from the ambassador or from the actual minister. When we sit on the committees and deal with the draft legislation, officially we have only the original draft from the Commission, while the Council’s working group is sitting looking at edition 17 – which we cannot legally obtain. Officials and trainees sit behind us at the committee meetings with the latest edition of the draft legislation, but what about the members of the committee themselves? We have the electorate’s vote, but we lack the confidence of the Council of Ministers. Now we will get the Commission’s new drafts while the legislation is being discussed. When will we have the opportunity to thank you in the Council for what would be the most natural thing of all? In democracies, those exercising power are responsible to the elected representatives; in democracies, there is nobody above or equal to the electorate and their directly elected representatives. Thank you, Mr President, especially if the Council will give us a little more to say thank you for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This Parliament has often taken a very narrow viewpoint with regard to the future development of the European economy and the European social model, whereas experience should have taught us that each action we take has an immediate effect on other areas. Therefore, we can no longer speak of exclusively having a social model that works according to the old ideology of high taxation and high social protection. Likewise, there cannot be a simple free-market area, where everyone can do whatever they wish, without any restrictions. We need rules and regulations to ensure that Europe works properly not only for the consumer or business but, most importantly of all, for the citizens we govern. That is why the Stability and Growth Pact is a good thing, in spite of the faults and mistakes in its operation that have recently been highlighted. The fact that it remains in place is a good thing, as also that it can be altered and changed to adapt to changing circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would warn against making widespread changes or reducing the powers contained within the Stability and Growth Pact. Let us not forget that the Growth Pact itself cannot be seen in isolation: it must also be seen in coordination with the broad economic policy guidelines that are laid down. Action has been taken in the past against one government – the Irish Government – because of its so-called failure to meet certain criteria under the broad economic policy guidelines. The mistake was not that the Pact was there, but that it was not enforced against other countries that continue to breach those guidelines and fail to observe the overall policies on the proper management and operation of economies and fiscal policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Lisbon Strategy, which we voted on today, is a strategy for good governance, good economic growth and, above all, employment creation, which is the best tool for tackling poverty, social disadvantage and isolation. It will ensure that we in Europe can give the very highest standard of jobs, training and, most importantly of all, social protection to all our citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is, in itself, somewhat odd, of course, because we have known for some time that Turkey takes a rather casual approach to human rights and has for many years pursued a real policy of genocide against ethnic minorities and non-Islamic faith communities.

<p class="contents">I do indeed think that there are sufficient fundamental reasons for putting this issue on the agenda. I would like to repeat that Turkey is not a European country politically, culturally, economically or historically speaking, and I have not even mentioned the problem of Islam, although no one would deny that the possible enlargement to include a country of 70 to 100 million Islamists threatens to fundamentally change the nature of our society.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge the Council to revisit the Turkey issue as a matter of urgency, and also for internal and democratic reasons. I consider the way in which in the past few months, in all European countries, debate on Turkey’s accession has been made impossible and the way in which the verdict of the voters and citizens on this subject has been avoided, to be totalitarian and undemocratic. Our citizens are intelligent enough to decide for themselves on Turkey’s membership in a referendum. Anyone who denies them and us the right – and indeed, anyone who denies us in this House the right, let me say now – to address the Council at any time about this fundamental problem, does the European Union a disservice and brings us a step closer to a totalitarian European regime, something that we cannot tolerate under any circumstances.

I believe that Europe is currently standing at a crossroads. Europe could enter a crisis period if the Constitutional Treaty is not ratified either now or in a few years' time, that is, if we are unable to define Europe in a way that affirms our political and economic identity to the outside world. We need to be defining Europe now in line with the mandate of the current Commission and of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">To do that, in economic terms – which is what we are considering today – macro-economic stability is essential. The other minimum requirement is speeding up the Lisbon reform process in order to increase employment and productivity, and therefore competitiveness, which will narrow the gap between us and the United States and enable us to stand up to competition from emerging countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We discussed the Lisbon reforms this morning, so I am going to return to the importance of the Stability Pact. I feel that we need to be very honest with one another on this matter. We are going to reform the Stability Pact not because its internal logic has failed, nor the ideas underpinning it, but rather for the simple reason that too many countries have failed to comply with its terms, notably the larger countries. Since it is the larger Member States who are forcing us to revise the Pact, we need to know what they are willing to do – which is what we have just heard.</p>
<p class="contents">They are willing to accept reform of the preventative features of the Pact and to make an effort in the good times, simply because they know that no world power can force them to comply with the rules. In terms of prevention, they want to slacken and break the rules to the point where – as one German Social Democrat has said – there are no absolute rules.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two options – and only two – in this state of affairs: either we move towards economic governance, economic coordination, and an independent judge incapable of imposing any sanctions, or we maintain the existing automatic procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">We have not wanted to move ahead with economic coordination. The Intergovernmental Conference reversed all the tentative progress made by the Convention on the subject of coordination, leaving us in exactly the same position as before. Nor do we want to continue with the automatic processes. All that will happen in this Council and in future Councils is that we will move backwards. The question is how far will we backtrack, and at what pace?</p>
<p class="contents">The exemptions to the rules we set ourselves amount to weakening, to giving ground on the Stability Pact. How much you are willing to concede will determine our future credibility, our economic strength, and will affect whether or not we avoid the economic crisis I anticipate in the coming years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the agenda are the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy and the annual audit of the sustainable development programme. These two go together. Sustainable growth and competitiveness cannot be achieved without the highest possible levels of environmental and social protection. The mid-term review of the sustainable development programme undertaken this year must see the creation of an ambitious strategy that reaches far into the future. It should be directly linked to the Lisbon strategy and it should also serve to guide different policy areas within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The spirit of Cardiff needs to be revived and we should examine the sustainability of the European Union’s various policies more closely, confronting those factors that are leading in the direction of unsustainable development. Special attention needs to be paid to energy production, transport, land use and agriculture. New, more ambitious steps have to be taken to prevent climate change. We must look ahead to the time after the Kyoto Protocol and achieve targets for the year 2020 that we can keep to and monitor.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to put a price tag on sustainable development. We have to estimate how much doing absolutely nothing will cost. Now of course all attention is focused on what environmental protection measures will cost.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must continue to be the organisation that shows the way globally in environmental policy. Ambitious legislation linked to the right means of financial control is also a good combination for creating demand for the new environmental technology. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Different criteria cannot be applied to equivalent situations. One cannot claim rights, justice or different standards of morality when in Europe and, on the other hand, insist on a pragmatic approach based on financial practicality when in Spain or Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are truly committed to multilingualism, if we want the Castilian language to be used at all committee meetings, press conferences, etc, we must first be honest and safeguard everyone's linguistic rights, including those of the Catalans and Basques as well as, for example, the Welsh and Irish.</p>

I am a little disappointed to see that Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, seems to have disappeared, because he is going to hear a comment from a representative of the United Kingdom, which is the second biggest contributor to European Union funds.</p>
<p class="contents">To date, we have contributed some GBP 180 billion. We have received back around GBP 105 billion by way of subsidies of one form or another. Well, we believe that very soon there is to be a general election in the United Kingdom, and I think the voters are going to want to know what has happened to that GBP 75 billion deficit in our contributions. Is there going to be an answer from our current Prime Minister or Chancellor of the Exchequer? Is there going to be an answer from this House? When we remind them that the European Court of Auditors has, for the tenth year running, refused to sign the books because billions of pounds have gone missing, they might well put two and two together as regards what has happened to our 75 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">Have we got a Stability and Growth Pact or not? The Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, recently said to reporters in Brussels: ‘I am beginning to seriously consider the option of not changing the Pact at all’. He added: ‘We are not excluding the scenario of leaving the Pact as it is; that is now a distinct possibility. I have no goal of replacing a Pact that does not work well with one that seems to function but goes wrong later’. Previously he had said that the Pact was dead.</p>
<p class="contents">So what about this Stability and Growth Pact? Is it not ludicrous that countries that run up a deficit of over 3% are then fined enormous sums of money, making their position worse? Of course the Stability Pact is wrong. It is useless!

This reform is unfortunately enveloped in mystery. In fact, we go from general news about a possible nineteen points to make the Pact more flexible to the possibility of leaving the Pact unchanged. In that respect, all that remains is regret at the opportunity that Parliament has wasted through being unwilling for this Chamber to directly enter the debate on how to reform the Pact. The President of Parliament and also the main political groups are to blame for that.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems that we are reaching a possible compromise, as usual, characterised by tactical manoeuvring and political balancing acts. That is not what Europe needs right now. Instead, it needs bolder and more pragmatic approaches to the key objectives for revitalising the economy, that is to say investment in research, innovation, competitiveness, infrastructure and structural reform. That is also why I stress that I am baffled at the refusal by the Commission and the Luxembourg Presidency to consider applying the so-called golden rule, which could have done a great deal to boost our economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">We owe it above all to the younger generation to make a practical commitment to the future of our economy. In that respect, we need a genuine Pact for young people. The young need to be able to look forward to a future of stability, security and social cohesion, thanks to measures helping them to enter the workforce and to have access to credit, as well as measures directed towards the right to a home and a family.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I believe that the European Union needs to make a strong commitment to guarantee effective opportunities for Europe’s younger generations. That is what we are calling for, and that is what young people above all are expecting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have become victims of the EU’s self-chastisement and self-imposed captivity. This Stability Pact was brought into being for reasons that were very transparent, particularly in the case of Germany, which later turned out to be the country that had the greatest problems with it. I think one of the lessons we ought to learn for the future is that rushing these things is not the way to get them done, for the damage is now greater than the former short-term benefit. The whole thing is a virtual ruin and has precipitated another crisis of confidence in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">For the sake of the young and of all those who still, with a certain euphoria, believe in Europe, I really do hope you will manage to cut this particular Gordian knot. It will be very difficult, but a lot of trust has been lost – and it was that trust that the Stability Pact was originally intended to build.

This is a matter on which I have spoken on a number of occasions in recent weeks, and one that should be at the heart of the European agenda in the coming years.</p>
<p class="contents">I simply wish to emphasise the support of the European Democrats for strong action to reinvigorate that Agenda. We want to see a stronger commitment by national governments to real and enduring economic reform. The President of the Commission has our full support for an enterprising Europe, committed to growth and prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I also want to make it clear that we are concerned about some recent developments and emphasise the need for President Barroso not to weaken his stance on EU market liberalisation by in any way undermining the Services Directive, which is a fundamental part of the Lisbon Agenda that he himself redefined only recently. There is also the Working Time Directive: it seems to me extraordinary that there are still politicians and governments who consider that a level playing field is one in which all EU Member States are equally uncompetitive. It is fundamental to our vision of Europe that employers and workers should, as far as possible, decide on their own terms and conditions and working hours, and not have governments or the EU decide for them. It goes against the whole spirit of economic liberalisation and flexibility that so many of us believe in.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council will be considering other matters too, including the international situation. I wish to comment on one aspect of this: the reinvigoration of the transatlantic alliance. The visit of the President of the United States to Europe last month heralded a new chapter in the world's most important geopolitical partnership. There is a real prospect now of a fresh start to that relationship, which is crucial for world security. Some recent comments, including those by the German Chancellor, are of great importance and need to be taken seriously. His implication that NATO was no longer the pre-eminent vehicle for military defence is an issue which I feel needs to be further examined and about which I am concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">If Europe wants to be a serious partner alongside the United States in the fight against terrorism and the spread of WMD, then it must work more closely with our American friends. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope, and very much trust, that Mr Juncker, who will attend both this extra ECOFIN meeting and the summit, will be able to carry on his work. Indeed, it is with sorrow that I look upon the Pact’s reform being turned into a <span class="italic">Chefsache</span>. I fear that it will be reduced to common horse trading between Member States, particularly the large ones, something we have experienced all too often in the past. It is time our Heads of State or Government displayed real vision and leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">My group has indicated many times that it is in favour of the Pact being reformed, which would result in growth, without putting the euro’s stability at risk, and so I think it would be useful if a quality assessment were to be made of Member State budget spending. This was borne out this morning during the discussion of the Lisbon strategy. In Europe, there is too little investment in the education and research that will enable it to become the competitive knowledge economy we desperately aspire to be. The Pact should not obstruct us in those endeavours.</p>
<p class="contents">In industry, businesses would be out of the running if they failed to invest in the future. I should, however, add that in industry, investments are not written off over one year. So why do we do this in the Pact? What is stopping us from applying a longer depreciation period to the Lisbon investments too? This would involve a change to the substance, which would create space without putting discipline at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">Another change that must be made is for us to start thinking more along European lines. It is wholly acceptable that government influence should impact on the economy, provided that it is done at European, rather than national, level. It seems that the leaders at the summit predominantly want to create a catalogue of excuses which will help them escape discipline and which they can use for all possible kinds of policy. My group favours a strong role for the Commission and considers that the rules of the game and the assessments should be drafted jointly, from a European perspective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If the Council had stuck to its commitments, it would not be looking, as you did this morning and again this evening, for a new impetus to dispel Euro-pessimism, because Gothenburg showed the way and gave new hope by proposing that each year, in spring, a special summit should be held to track the progress made on sustainable development; Mrs Wallström knows what I am referring to. What have you done with the enthusiasm of Gothenburg to face up to the new threats and challenges worrying our fellow Europeans? What are your innovative, compelling and concrete plans to combat climate change and to counter the decline in biodiversity? In four years, what progress has been achieved and where are we with social harmonisation? Where are we with European public services?</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, you have distorted the objectives of the spring summits which were supposed to provide a response to all those questions and bring about a refocusing of policy. And now you are asking for a charter on the new criteria! Mr President, these criteria exist, and you have cast them aside, perhaps because they were too limiting, too troublesome. What about the biodiversity criterion, for instance: has the Commission kicked it into the long grass?</p>
<p class="contents">There is no need, Mr President, to go on reinventing the wheel day after day. Get back to the spirit of Gothenburg; restore this innovative project to its place at the heart of the spring summits, an innovative project long-awaited by our fellow citizens and which will pull Europe out of its state of stagnation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It calls for closer cooperation and coordination between governments and for them to be monitored, in order to overcome delays caused by their opposition. Consequently, new storms against grass-roots incomes and other grass-roots achievements are brewing at the spring Council. This is guaranteed by the final outcome of the first five years' application of the Lisbon strategy, with increased poverty, unemployment, inequality, uncertainty for workers and greater wealth for the oligarchy.</p>
<p class="contents">The leaders of the Member States will decide to proceed more aggressively and at a faster pace in making industrial relations more flexible, in cutting workers' incomes and grass-roots rights, with a new insurance system, with full liberalisation of the market and with across-the-board privatisations. At the same time, they will take decisions which will speed up the political and military presence of the European Union in more countries and they will seal the joint front of the United States and the European Union in the war against the peoples. These are measures which reduce social and employment rights in order to increase the profitability of European capital.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the mediaeval working environment which they are preparing, this is the policy of the European Union and its parties. They are calling on the workers to make sacrifices in order to make their lives worse. However, there are also sacrifices with the prospect of a better life, by which I mean the organised fight against the barbarity and exploitation of the European Union and the governments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Looking beyond the current compromises, inevitable hypocrisies and tiresome tactical manoeuvring between those who want rigour and those who want flexibility, between grasshoppers and ants, the essence of the debate on the Stability and Growth Pact still remains the golden rule, or how to introduce flexibility into the budget rules honourably, without resorting to opportunistic or artful means.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise that is emerging appears to be useful, but it will not solve everything. A golden rule applied <span class="italic">ex post</span> will do little for development, while it is liable to lose us our credibility and reputation. A clear <span class="italic">ex ante</span> strategy of deficit spending on objectives at a European level would be more useful, but we are probably not yet mature enough to make that kind of choice.</p>
<p class="contents">The same may be said for the review of the Lisbon Strategy. Redefining the objectives will be of little use if the toolkit still consists of subsidiarity, open coordination, peer pressure and moral persuasion, particularly during a slump. What is needed are direct-action instruments, such as European action plans, but we are not yet mature enough for those either.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel, therefore, that we need maturity in order to have more Europe, that is to say in order to be able to decide once and for all what kind of economic constitution we want for our Europe, over and above our selfish national interests. The challenges of globalisation really do not leave us much time any more. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The long list of major exceptions prepared by the Luxembourg Presidency, which would allow the deficit reference figure to be exceeded on a temporary basis, has obviously opened up a Pandora’s box of national requests.</p>
<p class="contents">If we continue like this, nothing will be achieved and we will resign ourselves to keeping the Pact as it is, as something more or less nonsensical. Instead, we need to follow the obvious path of having a single important exception, allowing the possibility of derogation only for precise, circumscribed European initiatives in the areas of training, research and major physical and intangible infrastructure networks. We therefore need to tie any flexibility in the Pact to real European added value through investment.</p>
<p class="contents">The experience of recent days also teaches us that the Union’s economic policies need to be properly coordinated. I have the impression, however, that the Member States’ governments are adopting a strategy of slowly and gently weakening the Commission’s role. We shall probably also be able to see this during the debate on the Financial Perspectives in June, when it is not difficult to foresee a fresh attack on the credibility of the Community aspect of the European Union.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A decisive effort is needed to boost competitiveness not only through good programmes but also in real economic activities, because sustainable development and more jobs can result only from more growth. We also need to enhance the credibility of this Union for entrepreneurs as well as citizens at large. Not only the governments but also these people need to be motivated to contribute actively to achieving the Lisbon goals.</p>
<p class="contents">One solution lies in opening up the EU market in services. If we really intend to enhance efficiency and motivation, then we must open up without further delay. This could prove to be one of the most important and productive reforms of this organisation. Conversely, watering down the Services Directive could deliver a devastating blow to the principles of equality and solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">It was said in this Chamber today that free movement of goods and capital without free movement of services is nonsense. In this context, the country-of-origin principle must be seen as an inseparable part of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I really hope that the new Commission will not weaken its stand on EU market liberalisation. Instead of waging battles to further conserve the present unequal status quo, we should concentrate on the benefits that free competition would bring to all of us, both old and new Member States, and benefits there clearly are!</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the European Council will show enough political will to make our citizens believe that Member States are serious about creating the conditions for dynamic growth. This will also be a test for the EU’s solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all of us know how great the difference in the standard of living is between the newly acceded and the older Member States. We also know that this difference is unacceptable, and we must strive to eliminate it. Among other things, the Lisbon Strategy was one of the most important guideline documents for us at the time of accession. It was hugely attractive that we could be members of a Europe which could envisage as a target increasing economic competitiveness, job creation and at the same time the spreading of the values of a social Europe across the whole of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">That set of views which sets growing economic competitiveness as a priority yet sees social dimensions as less important is not acceptable to the newly acceded Member States, where more than a third of the population lives in poverty. It is true that the best way to fight poverty is to increase economic competitiveness and job creation, but this must be tightly linked to social cohesion, education, research and development, and protection of the environment. Social questions belong among the responsibilities of Member States, but appropriate coordination among institutions at Union level is vital.

Let us admit, though, that in the background of this discussion, there will also be the question related to the financial perspectives that is linked to Lisbon and the Stability Pact – because in the end it is the financial means that the European Union will have for the coming years, which will determine whether and to what degree, we will be able to put into practice the vision of Europe to which Mr Barroso referred. This is where we have to remember that the new Member States still have a low standard of living when compared to the European average and, despite this, are still expected to implement the reforms required by the Lisbon strategy as well as by the Stability Pact. </p>
<p class="contents">We also have to keep in mind that the new countries are experiencing a certain degree of tiredness, a certain fatigue, from the continuous reform process. It is enough to say that they have been undergoing a reform process for a number of years – first to prepare to join the European Union and, now that they have joined, they are facing more reforms, this time having more of a budgetary and fiscal nature to prepare for the introduction of the Euro. As if this were not enough, we now have the reforms needed by the reform strategy, which amounts to a non-stop reform process.</p>
<p class="contents">This does not mean that the reform process should be stopped. Far be it from this case. It means, however, that there is a need for the new countries to feel that they are not being left alone on this road; to the contrary, they should feel that there is somebody helping them. This is exactly what the cohesion policy of the European Union could do, and this is why the financial resources that the European Union will have in the coming years will determine whether we really want the new Member States to be really integrated; if we really do want them to adopt the Euro and expand their economic development and create jobs as the Lisbon Strategy is telling us to do.

The only way in which the German public could be persuaded to part with the Deutschmark was with the explicit promise that there would be a Stability and Growth Pact that would draw on the tradition of the Deutschmark and maintain the currency’s long-term stability. Of course, it is particularly problematic when, out of all the Member States, it is the larger ones, such as Germany and France, who, having compelled the smaller countries – including those in southern Europe – to accept this Pact, themselves breach it, breaking its rules and even altering it when they get into difficulties. For that reason, I can only encourage the Luxembourg presidency to stick to its guns at the summit, and urge all the other members of the Council to do likewise.</p>
<p class="contents">Altering the Pact is certainly worth thinking about; here in this House, we have heard important arguments as to why it can be applied in different ways at certain stages. The worst option, though, is to alter the Pact precisely when one has oneself broken the rules and got away scot-free, and so the sixteen-point list that Mr Juncker has put forward is the right way to go about reforming it. Our position on this issue is that the Commission’s hand must be strengthened, and it must continue to be a player. It cannot be for the Member States to decide when and where this or that special rule should apply where the Stability Pact is concerned. What the European Council should bear in mind, when coming to its conclusions on 22 and 23 March, is that the Commission must be put in a stronger position, and that there are several changes we can talk about.</p>
<p class="contents">As this Council is meeting in a special international situation, let me add the final comment that, in the Middle East, among our Mediterranean neighbours, a lot of things are in a state of flux. There too, it is important that we should be alongside the democrats and supporting human rights. For that reason, I would like to see this Council – in contrast to what we in this House have heard from it so far – send, by the way it votes, a clear message concerning the activities of terrorists, of Hezbollah, and everything associated with them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was struck, in particular, by the comments of the last speaker, who gave us an encouraging message.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be extremely serious if the European Union, on an issue like the Stability and Growth Pact, should see divisions, for instance, between old and new members. I view that as something very dangerous. We must approach reform of the Stability Pact in a spirit which is also one of solidarity. Any division would, in my view, be extremely harmful and dangerous.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to return to an idea which was mentioned, in particular, by the last speaker, namely the importance of the institutional aspect. We must not weaken the Commission or the Commission's role in managing the Stability Pact, and there is no question as far as the Presidency is concerned of somehow withdrawing the Commission from its role in the area of budgetary surveillance. Thus, this aspect appears particularly important.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency’s proposals, on which agreement has still to be reached, clearly tend to introduce greater flexibility, because in some quarters greater flexibility is required. However, at the same time, they aim to create a more precise framework specifically to enable the deficit to be assessed. One deficit is not the same as another. I believe we are all sufficiently familiar with economic rules and laws to know that no two deficits are necessarily identical in nature. A deficit caused by consumer spending should not be considered as being identical to one resulting from productive investment, from investment in the future. I therefore believe that this is the framework which the Presidency would like to create, to enable a more precise assessment to be made, avoiding any risk of arbitrariness.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, I believe the pact has to be more closely related to economic cycles, and that it should still be possible to modify any instrument of economic policy in the light of experience. The rules adopted should be able to withstand the test of reality. When they are tested against reality, we may have to conclude, where necessary, that the rules are perhaps not always totally appropriate. Adapting the pact does not mean that deficits will be allowed to increase in the future. Those who think that deficits could be allowed to run unchecked without consequences are wrong, because deficits spiralling out of control would very quickly be punished by rising interest rates, which would have an impact on the investment urgently needed in Europe. We have also discussed the Lisbon strategy at length this morning – a strategy based, inter alia, on investment. It is clear, therefore, that we cannot recommend, on the one hand, a strategy based on investment and, on the other, encourage practices which would lead to an increase in interest rates, providing a disincentive to that very same investment.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that what we want is to have rules which are complied with – rules which can be respected by everyone; and so that everyone can comply with them, certain economic and political realities need to be taken into account. Without wishing to refer to any one country in particular, although one has already been mentioned, we have to acknowledge that some countries have experienced fairly exceptional events, and it would not be acceptable for such exceptional factors not to be taken into account, to some degree.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to sustainable development, I can say to Mrs Isler-Béguin that we have firmly insisted on maintaining the environmental dimension in the Lisbon strategy – not only on maintaining it but also genuinely incorporating it in all policies right across the board. Sustainable development cannot just be bolted on. It is something which must inspire the whole range of policies, and all policies must be assessed against a yardstick of sustainable development. Therefore, I do not believe that the Presidency is trying to neglect Gothenburg or consign it to oblivion. We continue to regard the strategy of sustainable development as fully valid. We recommend a horizontal approach to all environmental policy, as already set out in the Treaty and in the draft Constitution. On this point, we believe that a charter could be useful because it would give us a certain number of guiding principles to be followed when implementing the various policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to Kyoto, the Presidency is extremely keen to develop the Kyoto follow-up, and if there is sustainable development dimension, I believe it is based, in particular, on this aspect, namely preparing for the follow-up to Kyoto. On this point, the Presidency would like the European Union to take a lead, to be at the leading edge of progress and to have a key role in the defence of the planet.</p>

<p class="contents">This debate has shown the need for a coherent and consistent approach. We must ensure that the policies on the Stability Pact, the Lisbon Strategy and the Sustainable Development Strategy go hand in hand. During the debate this morning on the Lisbon Strategy you also made the point that the very concrete proposals we have been discussing for some time must uphold this balance.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall do all this in the European way, which is to ensure that the creation of growth and jobs does not happen at the expense of over-using natural resources or of social policy. We must ensure that our policies include all three of those elements and that they reinforce one another. Climate change is one example, as it is not only an environmental issue but also one with enormous economic and social consequences, meaning that our policies have to be designed accordingly. This is exactly what incorporating the dimension of sustainable development is all about. It brings the future and the rest of the world into the frame as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank all those who have raised issues concerning the Lisbon Strategy and assure them that the Commission will take due note of all these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bonde was the only person who said he was very happy. I am glad he is happy, because his comments related to openness and transparency, which are things very close to my heart too. I would remind you that we have enhanced transparency as regards expert groups in the context of negotiations on the framework agreement. There is a new article on expert groups, and a list of the expert groups, their composition, activities, agendas and documents will be made available. That is important.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, while some members of that Group put difficult questions, they have not stayed long enough to hear the responses as regards, for example, the Stability Pact, which is another important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">We sometimes seem to lose sight of what has been achieved through the Stability Pact. Just a few years ago, the economic situation in Europe was totally different. The Pact has helped us to re-establish financial stability in Europe and enabled us to cooperate rather than to drive our currencies against each other. This is an important point which should not be forgotten. At the same time, if we are prepared to increase the flexibility of our rules, we also need to take steps to improve the quality of our cooperation at European Union level.</p>
<p class="contents">The euro has brought our economies closer together, and national economic policies have become a common concern. If we want to maintain a meaningful fiscal surveillance system then we should also strengthen our institutional settings and provide greater incentives for cooperation and sound fiscal policies in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue to work in a constructive way with the Luxembourg Presidency to ensure it is possible for the necessary changes to be made, to modernise and to harness the progress made to reinforce our other policies. Thank you for the contributions to the debate on the Stability Pact, which the Commission considers does not need re-writing, but to be interpreted in a way that guarantees its effectiveness and credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will look into the details of creating a charter for sustainable development, which must include very concrete policies and actions. Indeed, nothing of what has been said about the Stability Pact, the Lisbon Strategy or sustainable development will lead anywhere unless we start to take action. The overall challenge for us is one of implementation: to maintain consensus, ensure best use of governance and secure the support of European citizens for what we are doing. Those three issues must guide us in ensuring a successful summit meeting and, hopefully, successful implementation of what has been discussed today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
