<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 1 by Marie Anne Isler Béguin (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-1999-0548_EN.html">H-0548/99</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Rail route across the Pyrenees</span></p>
<p class="contents">The route crossing the Pyrenees via the Aspe Valley and the Somport Pass has for several years been a subject of controversy within local communities and the public at large and the national authorities affected by the choice of mode. The road link is being modernised and expanded even though there is still an old partly disused railway line linking France and Spain. On account of various protests and environmental considerations, the road-works were halted, and the national authorities and the Commission began discussions and to reconsider the strategies in terms of modes, the idea being to treat the rail link as a future key trans-European network. That notwithstanding, the road-works resumed in the valley on 13 September. The Union, however, is already financing a feasibility study on the rail route, and the programme of the Presidency-in-Office states that revitalisation of European railways must be treated as a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Presidency say why the road-works have resumed? Has the Union entered into other financial commitments regarding the Aspe Valley route across the Pyrenees, apart from the above-mentioned study? Will not the Presidency take steps with a view to coordinating the positions of the French and Spanish governments so as to permanently rule out any road development project, since that option would remove the future need for the rail route, especially where freight carriage was concerned?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am therefore astonished that the Council is not up to date on this, given that several questions have already been asked on this subject. </p>
<p class="contents">I am equally astonished that you can speak of the trans-European Network whereas the Members concerned, France and Spain, do not consider this stretch of road to be part of the trans-European Network at all. If it were the case, I would immediately request that a study of the impact of this matter be made. I asked you this question because works have started again in Aspe valley. These are huge works just to make a small bypass around the small village of Bedous. They are having a considerable impact on the environment and we know very well that in the long run in France, the usual piecemeal approach will be adopted, like slicing a salami, and that tiny slice by tiny slice, we will end up with a motorway or a dual carriageway in the Aspe valley. </p>
<p class="contents">Today, then, I would like to see the Council ask what France’s real commitments are in this matter and what means for crossing the Pyrenees the authorities really want to put in place, and I am directing these words to the Finnish Presidency, which has committed itself to the rail crossing and which has spoken in favour of it. If you do not mind, I suggest that you launch an initiative to promote alternative means of transport to the road transport in ecologically sensitive areas, otherwise we will continue to ask you this kind of question and we will only be able to say…</p>

The Commission subsequently submitted to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, its communication concerning the European Union’s action plan for combating drugs during the period 2000-2004. </p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of the guidelines from the European Council, the work carried out by the previous country to hold the Presidency, the communication from the Commission and the contributions which the Member States and different working parties within the Commission have made to the Commission's communication, we have drafted a proposal for the EU's drugs strategy for the period 2000-2004. In so doing, we have taken account of the views of both the European Parliament and of the above-mentioned institutions and bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">This new anti-drugs strategy is needed now because the existing EU strategy will have run its course by the end of this year. Through the Amsterdam Treaty, a great many new opportunities have arisen which must be examined and utilised, both in the area of protecting people’s health and in the areas of legal cooperation and of cooperation with the police and customs. The purpose of this new strategy is to confirm that the EU’s fight against drugs in the future will be broad in scope. The new strategy includes measures to reduce supply and demand, together with measures at an international level. </p>
<p class="contents">At the special meeting of the European Council in Tampere in October, on the subject of establishing an area of freedom, security and justice, the emphasis was partly upon the importance of an overarching approach to tackling the drugs problem. New guidelines were also provided for future work in the fight against drugs. The European Council encouraged the Council to adopt the EU’s anti-drugs strategy for the years 2000-2004 before the European Council in Helsinki. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Council in Tampere urged that, in accordance with the Treaty, joint research groups be established without delay as a first step in the fight against the drugs trade, trade in human beings and terrorism. </p>
<p class="contents">It was also considered that, with regard to national criminal law, efforts to come to agreements regarding joint definitions, sanctions and bases for prosecutions should, at the initial stage, focus upon a limited number of sectors of special significance, such as the illegal trade in drugs. </p>
<p class="contents">The decision made in Tampere concerning extended powers for Europol, together with intensified measures against money laundering, will contribute to the European Union’s fight against drugs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I asked this question quite a long time ago, in fact before the Tampere Summit. I think that the questions concerning drugs were dealt with at the Tampere Summit in a useful, more integrated way and with a view to developing a future strategy, especially in regard to combating the drugs trade and adjacent areas such as money laundering. I am satisfied with the answer and can only hope that the process we have now set in motion through the Tampere Summit will continue and result in concrete measures so that we might together be able to tackle criminal behaviour of this kind and the major problem constituted by the drugs trade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Appropriateness of financing UNDCP programmes</span></p>
<p class="contents">The UNDCP has published the results of an annual survey of opium production, which show that estimated total raw opium production in Afghanistan has more than doubled in a year, rising from 2,100 tonnes in 1998 to 4,600 tonnes in 1999. The area devoted to opium cultivation has increased by 43%, from 64,000 to 91,000 hectares. 97% of opium production in 1999 is in areas under Taleban control and the number of Afghan districts where it is grown has risen from 73 to 104. Global opium production has increased from 3,750 tonnes to 6,000 tonnes B an increase of 60%.</p>
<p class="contents">For some years the UNDCP has been engaged in costly intensive programmes to eradicate the cultivation of opium poppies in Afghanistan, which are directly managed by the Taleban, who are known for the violent and segregationist system they have forced on the country. The EU budget provides funding for the UNDCP and its programmes, including the one involving Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Council not consider that the EU should suspend its support, including financial support, for the &gt;Taleban project= and carry out a thorough investigation into the effectiveness and management of the funds by the UNDCP?</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Council not consider that the use of EU funds by the UNDCP for programmes carried out by regimes which do not respect even minimum human rights constitutes a serious infringement of the principle of conditionality which inspires EU action?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its direct and indirect effect extends geographically far and wide. The country to hold the Presidency has decided that close monitoring of the situation in Iran and Afghanistan will be the focus point of the action it takes on drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">The negative effects on civil society, for example in Europe and Russia, Central Asia and Iran, cannot be underestimated. The European Union finds it alarming that the majority of heroin used in the Member States comes from the poppy fields of Afghanistan. The Union has noted the recent report by the UN drugs control programme, the UNDCP, according to which Afghanistan is, at present, clearly the largest global producer of opium. Its world share of production is 75%. In 1999 opium production grew by 100% on the previous year, reaching the highest volume so far, with a figure of 4,600 tons, which is partly due to the considerable expansion of the crop-growing sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council proposed an overall EU policy in an amended EU common position on Afghanistan, which was adopted on 25 January 1999. The main aims for Afghanistan are inter alia to achieve a lasting peace and promote an internal dialogue for Afghanistan by offering specific support for the key role played by the UN; in addition, to promote stability and development for the whole region through peace in the country, and to make the prevention of illegal drugs production and terrorism more effective.</p>
<p class="contents">Owing to the politically unstable situation in the country and the civil war, not one Member State recognises the Taleban government. A common position by the Union, however, urges Member States to maintain relations with all Afghan groups. The European Union has condemned the many violations of human rights that have occurred in Afghanistan, especially the continual and systematic discrimination towards women and girl children, executions carried out without trial and a system based on harsh discipline and tyranny.</p>
<p class="contents">Because the political situation in Afghanistan is critical, and conditions are not right for the creation of bilateral relations, it is difficult, in the opinion of the European Union, to participate effectively in drugs control activity in Afghanistan. The European Union has noted that the UN drugs control programme, the UNDCP, began its pilot programme in Afghanistan, one that made slow but steady progress, in 1998. The programme is based on the UNDCP’s commitment to financing development in special poppy field areas, to which the Taleban have responded by agreeing not to allow the cultivation of opium poppies in new areas, and to permit the UNDCP to control the opium poppy crop and commence action to prevent the illegal traffic of drugs and pull down illegal laboratories. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My question, however, was different and was about past results. Past results tell us that production has doubled. With the commitment of the common position of January 1998, the Council said that the Union would support all the efforts of the UNDCP in Afghanistan, and you have done this with your financing. The problem is the result of that financing. The result is that production has doubled. My question is therefore whether you are going to continue along this same ruinous path, that does not only affect Afghanistan: in fact, the problem is that the European Union is continuing to finance the UNDCP even on programmes such as the consolidation of penal codes in countries such as China and Burma, countries where simple drug addicts are condemned to die, and indirectly, we, through the UNDCP, are collaborating and financing this type of project. </p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, faced with a specific failure which is documented in these policies, the question is: are we going to continue to finance this type of project even though it actually makes totalitarian regimes stronger, regimes that are in fact criminal and oppress human rights? That is my question. </p>

The UNDCP is not financed out of the European Union budget. The European Union supports the work of the UNDCP on a general level, which it does in a well established and effective way in the area of drugs control, and it is also very satisfied with the cooperation that has taken place with the UNDCP in other areas.</p>
<p class="contents">As the honourable member stated, operations in Afghanistan are hampered by the lack of any broadly based government and, thus, a suitable and reliable partner in cooperation. The European Union is working with Afghanistan’s neighbours, mainly in Central Asia as well as Iran, to enhance anti-drugs cooperation conducted with them. The Union considers Central Asia to be strategically important in the control of drugs and is at present drafting an action plan for the region.</p>
<p class="contents">One cause of the critical drug situation is the lack of any proper border control between Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Khirgizia, Uzbekistan and Russia. The European Union is attempting to resolve the problem by promoting the TACIS projects implemented within the context of customs cooperation and of justice and home affairs. The projects aim, among other things, to make border controls more efficient between Iran, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, improve the training of customs officials, and increase drugs-related expertise in Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Khirgizia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Iran, the European Union has been informed that the UNDCP has just approved a drugs control programme for that country, and opened an office there. Member States are at present exploring ways in which they can participate in financing this programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must try, I believe, both in the Council and the European Parliament, as well as in other EU bodies such as Information Offices, to make the importance of providing information more widely understood. Our citizens would then have a better understanding of the need for increased legal and policing measures which are necessary on an international basis. We are certainly in agreement about that.

The Council would like to remind everyone of the conclusions reached on 25 May 1994 in this matter, which concern nuclear safety in the electricity industry in Central and Eastern European countries and the newly independent states, and in which the Council defines its approach to this question. In its conclusions, the Council reconfirmed its commitment to promote nuclear safety in the countries in question, and repeated that it was aware that the improvements spoken of must be implemented by means of reliable short- and long-term energy strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Council’s conclusions regarding nuclear safety in connection with EU enlargement, it was emphasised that the countries in question use reactors that are impossible to modernise at reasonable expense to comply with internationally approved standards of safety, and that strategies for the energy industry should include preparations to decommission these reactors as quickly as possible, in accordance with an agreed timetable for our accession partners, and in compliance with the agreements relating to nuclear safety bookkeeping. In addition, the Council has said it is ready to support the development of alternative energy sources with the means the EU and the Member States have at their disposal in order to replace the more unreliable nuclear power plants, at the same time taking account of the situation as a whole as well as each country’s special situation and needs.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years we have regularly taken into consideration the fact that the European Union’s neighbouring countries, whether they be the associated countries of Central and Eastern Europe or the countries in the European Free Trade Association, and those belonging to the European Economic Area, participate in important Community action concerning the development of the use of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency. The countries in question may participate in the ALTENER II programme, which is a programme to promote the use of new sources of energy, and in the SAVE II programme, which concerns energy efficiency. We should also point out that this opportunity has been exploited on a large scale in the SAVE II programme, participation in which has been decided by the competent Association Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Obviously, there is no fully standardised method of gauging them, but it is very clear that the greenhouse phenomenon has nothing to do with nuclear power, which does not produce carbon dioxide emissions and, that being the case, it is totally superior to coal or gas, for example. But I would like to point out that when nuclear power is used, it must be used safely in all respects. I would also remind everyone that in many EU countries nuclear power is used on a massive scale and, regarding my own country, Finland, I can state that we have two nuclear power stations with Russian-built reactors which, according to statistics, are among the world’s best in terms of efficiency and safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Where accession to the EU is concerned, it must be pointed out that this is always in the end a political decision. Each Member State must approve the accession of new Member States. Each country’s parliament must also ratify any such agreement. As I see it, there is, however, no special legal reason for requiring applicant countries to take measures such as those described, but political realities may be the basis for making certain demands. </p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the Commission must take account of problems which may arise if, for example, reactors are used which may present a danger to health.

During the first half of 1999 the web site was visited by more than 35,000 people. Within six months it held information relating to 43,000 documents. The register is proving a reliable and effective tool, which the public can use to acquire information on Council documents. Consequently, the number of requests for documents has considerably increased. It is now more than double the figure for 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">The document register has thus been on the Internet at the disposal of the public since the start of this year. At present, the Council is looking into ways of improving how the registers work, for example, so that other than confidential documents would be available to the public directly from the Internet. Let it be noted that so far the Council is the only institution to have made an open register of its documents available to the public, according to the recommendation of the European Ombudsman. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If you boast about 43,000 documents I wonder if you have actually visited the Internet site? This is a very small mouse that you have managed to produce so far. Forty-three thousand sounds like a lot. But anybody can produce 43,000 documents. It is what they say that matters. They are very slow in arriving. You cannot find out how votes went in the Council.

That is a very disappointing reply. I was asked to raise this question by the Penzance branch of Amnesty International, which has taken under its wing a particular prisoner of conscience, Thet Win Aung. I mention his name because he is a very good example of what is happening in Burma. He is a student leader who was recently sentenced to 52 years of imprisonment, and this has now been increased to 59 years. He was arrested in October 1998. His place of detention is not known and his family is being put under terrible pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">My question to the Council is, given this awful background, is it willing to consider putting pressure upon Burma to declare a total amnesty for such political prisoners and, very much to the point, has the Council ever discussed the possibility of economic sanctions against Burma until it adopts a more humane policy? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council would remind everyone that the European Council in Luxembourg stated that Turkey would be assessed according to the same criteria as the other applicant countries. The European Council furthermore reminded everyone that, in order to strengthen relations between Turkey and the EU, there would be a need for political and social reforms, such as respect and protection for minorities, the creation of satisfactory and stable relations between Greece and Turkey and support for the talks being conducted under UN protection on a political solution in Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware that decisions on enlargement taken at the European Council in Helsinki, which will be made with reference to the Commission’s annual report will have a powerful impact on relations between the EU and Turkey. Although we cannot predict the outcome of the talks in Helsinki, and although there is still much scope for improvement with regard to Turkey, it seems reasonable to reflect on the many important areas of progress that have been made, which should be taken into consideration. The outcome of the informal meeting of foreign ministers at Saariselkä, which was set forth on 13 September in the conclusions of the General Affairs Council, and Foreign Minister Cem’s presence at the General Affairs Council’s lunch are, in the opinion of the country to hold the Presidency, signs of a constructive new beginning in relations between the Union and Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">Improved relations between Greece and Turkey, not just as a result of the earthquakes, but as an issue in itself, and a discernible change in attitude in Turkey with regard to legal and constitutional reform, human rights and the Turkish Kurds are very welcome steps forward, as are also the commitments and recognition of realities contained in Bülent Ecevit’s letter to Chancellor Gerhard Schröder last May.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, I would like to take the discussion a little further. At one point, he referred to a number of things Turkey must still do. “there is still much scope for improvement with regard to Turkey”, the Minister said. How much scope for improvement is there in Turkey? Is Turkey really ready to be granted applicant status on the basis of what it has done today and the declarations it has made? As regards fundamental issues such as the Greek-Turkish dispute over the Aegean Sea, should the criteria not be for Turkey to recognise the opinions of other countries, but for it to respect international law, to refrain from using violence or threatening to use violence and to refer any disputes it may have to the International Court in The Hague.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I expressed the Union’s clear position on the unsatisfactory situation we see regarding human rights there. I would like to say, however, that a constructive attitude to Turkey is likely to be a much better policy for the Union than would be the case if Turkey turned its back on the Union entirely and did not even try to embrace those principles that we have incorporated as conditions of membership in the Copenhagen criteria or in other decisions we have taken. I firmly believe that if Turkey were accorded applicant status in Helsinki, it would increase Turkey’s willingness and its efforts to put its own house in order relatively quickly, especially with regard to human rights and the police. We must remember that, before a state can join the Union, the human rights situation in respect of those living there obviously has to be impeccable.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to point out that the Cyprus question is naturally an important part of all of this. I believe that this perspective on membership has contributed to the fact that talks will probably very soon begin on how to solve the Cyprus problem. It is my understanding that Rauf Denktash has promised he is ready to come to the negotiating table in New York, and this would obviously be a very positive sign. I believe that we will achieve better results through constructive cooperation than by cutting the ties of cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Minister Sasi, perhaps you should have said that this was more of a political debate and that a conclusion would be reached in Helsinki. Instead you addressed many different issues under the same heading and no clear conclusion can be drawn from what you said. I would like to ask a question. You made the particular point about Turkey being judged on the basis of the Copenhagen criteria. If Turkey is therefore accorded applicant status in Helsinki, are we then to assume that it has fulfilled those criteria? Please answer us that. We should not be bothering ourselves with all these other factors. Instead, we should try to talk some sense here. I am saying all this, Mr President, because I believe that when the Council comes here, it should have more respect for this institution. We are parliamentarians after all! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Turkey’s justification for this has been foreign policy factors connected with Turkish security, meaning they have felt themselves entitled to take discriminatory action on the grounds of national security by virtue of Article 3 of the OECD regulations on transfers of capital. It goes without saying that the Union cannot accept these justifications by Turkey in any respect.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union has been active in this affair, and immediately after the decision of 17 November 1997 we sent a letter to the Turkish permanent representative in the European Union. The Turkish delegation at the time indicated on the telephone that it had no intention of replying to the letter. After this, representatives of the Commission raised the matter at the joint committee meeting of the EC/Turkish Customs Union on 16 February 1998. The Turkish delegation did not, however, agree to discuss the matter in that connection, saying it was a matter of national security and that the customs agreement did not cover it.</p>
<p class="contents">The next time the country to hold the Presidency of the Council raised the matter was in the other business of the agenda at the OECD’s MTC meeting on 23 – 24 April 1999. The Turkish delegation did not agree to discuss the issue in an official meeting of the committee, as it was a matter of national security, and not an economic matter. This being the case, the MTC held an informal meeting on 24 April 1999. The Turkish delegation said that special practical matters could be discussed later. The MTC stated in connection with the other business of the agenda that there had been bilateral discussions on the matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know that the Finnish presidency has had mental health as one of a number of topics in its programme.

How does the Council intend to deal with the problem of brominated flame retardants? Does it intend to seek a ban at EU level, and if so, when? Would a unilateral Swedish ban on brominated fire retardants be regarded as hampering the free movement of goods and thus as an infringement of EU law?</p>

I perhaps understand why the answer was as it was, but this business with fish in the Baltic is just one example of how brominated flame retardants can cause problems for the environment and for people’s health. We know, you see, that these flame retardants have been used quite freely since the beginning of the seventies in electronic equipment, TV sets, computers etc, and they have just proliferated. This is an enormous problem because Swedish studies, and other studies too, show that we are going to see precisely the same thing happen as we saw happen with PCBs, namely that these chemicals will find their way into the food chains and it will gradually emerge that a big problem has arisen. </p>
<p class="contents">I should like an answer to the question of whether Sweden would be able to take a decision to prohibit these substances by the year 2004 and whether the EU would be able to agree to this; that is to say, would the precautionary principle prevail? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 15 by Ioannis Theonas (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-1999-0585_EN.html">H-0585/99</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Ban on fuel supplies and looming humanitarian disaster in Yugoslavia</span></p>
<p class="contents">The European Union=s opposition, expressed notably at the meeting of EU Foreign Ministers in Luxembourg, to providing fuel and emergency aid for the inhabitants of Yugoslavia to enable them to face the coming winter and the final decision to export heating oil B a plan called Energy for Democracy B to two Serb cities, Nis and Pirot, which are under opposition control, has provoked strong reactions. This decision not only condemns the inhabitants of Yugoslavia to spend the winter entirely deprived of essential heating fuel, following the massive damage inflicted on state infrastructures by NATO bombing, but it is also an insult to the pride of an entire people who are the victims of extortion and who are facing annihilation because the West does not approve of their political leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">The Danish Foreign Minister, Mr Petersen, recently stated that this decision sends the right message that democracy and a desire for reform are rewarded. Does the Council consider that statements of this kind reflect the position of the European Union and the so-called international community as regards respect for fundamental democratic freedoms and values? Does it consider further that the blackmailing decision of Luxembourg is a message which promotes democracy, in view of the fact that it seeks to bludgeon a people and its political representatives into adopting anti-democratic practices in order to survive, instead of ensuring that the institutions function in a smooth and democratic manner in the forthcoming elections?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition, it said once more that the Union was ready to offer reconstruction aid to a democratic Serbia. The General Affairs Council noted with satisfaction that the first deliveries of heating oil for the two cities of Niš and Pirot under the “Energy for Democracy” programme would take place before the end of November. It requires the projects to be swiftly implemented, and the Council reconfirmed its readiness to consider extending the initiative to other communities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council also reminded everyone of its readiness to continue to help destitute Serbs and of the humanitarian aid granted by the European Community and the Member States for this purpose. The ‘self-help aid’ granted by ECHO to Serbia will total EUR 62 million, which the Council welcomed at its meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the elections to be held in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Council thinks that, under the present circumstances, the idea of free and honestly conducted elections is impossible. Police attacks at peaceful demonstrations, which were carried out repeatedly in Belgrade in October, clearly show that the basic values of democracy, such as freedom of speech and opinion, will not be respected in Serbia as long as Milosevic and his government are in power there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But in reply I would say that, at present, circumstances in Yugoslavia, taking into consideration, for example police action and the aggressive attitude towards demonstrations, as well as the Milosevic administration’s attitude towards the press and freedom of information, are such that the conditions for holding free democratic elections in Yugoslavia do no exist right at present.</p>
<p class="contents">The basis of Union policy is that it has no desire to support the Milosevic administration in any way whatsoever. As the Union considers humanitarian factors to be very important, however, and does not accept that the deeds of leaders should mean that ordinary citizens have to suffer, it has embarked on a trial project, whereby heating oil will be delivered on a trial basis to Niš and Pirot, but possibly later on to other places as well.</p>
<p class="contents">We await with interest that the Yugoslavian government and administration approve these aid measures, as at present we do not have any good experience whatsoever of the government.

In October, with this purpose in mind, the General Affairs Council invited representatives of the Serbian democratic opposition to a meeting, and the Yugoslavian situation was discussed with them. We also heard their hopes regarding what sort of action the Union might take in this matter. Among other things, sanctions were discussed, but there was also much discussion about freedom of the media and press, which at present is restricted, meaning that they cannot operate in a democratic fashion in the country. It is also possible that there will be contact between the Union and the Serbian democratic opposition in the meeting that is just starting in Istanbul.</p>
<p class="contents">Our bottom line – and there is complete consensus on this, as far as I know – is that a democratic administration should be established for Yugoslavia, and Serbia in particular, as soon as possible, one that the people have been able to elect in their own free elections, without pressure or restriction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Financial Instrument of the OCTs (Overseas Countries and Territories)</span></p>
<p class="contents">One of the objectives set by the Amsterdam Conference for the Council was to increase the effectiveness of the financial instrument of the OCTs. The EDF mechanism no longer seems to be able to meet the needs expressed by the OCT authorities. The main criticisms voiced are that they do not receive sufficient funding compared with the ACP countries, and that the procedures are excessively bureaucratic and totally untailored to local structures. Parliament had called specifically for the establishment of a European Development Fund for the OCTs (OCTDF) in its resolution of 11 February 1999.</p>

This declaration exhorts the Council to examine by February 2000 the association system of the OCTs in compliance with the provisions of Article 136 of the EC Treaty. One of the aims of this investigation is to improve the effectiveness of the financial instrument of the OCTs.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of a resolution passed on 11 February 1999 by the European Parliament, the Commission, on 25 May 1999, delivered a communication to the Council, which formulated three possible ways of improving this financial instrument. They are OCD aid eligibility with regard to Structural Funds, a revised EDF, or a fund specially intended for OCDs in the Union budget. The Council noted these possible guidelines, but did not say it favoured any one of them at this stage. The Council will be debating the details of an improved financial instrument for OCDs once it has its possession, in the near future, the awaited Commission proposal on a definition of the new association system for OCDs to be applied on 1 March 2000. Obviously, the Council will take account of the resolution passed by the European Parliament on 11 February 1999 when it debates this proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
