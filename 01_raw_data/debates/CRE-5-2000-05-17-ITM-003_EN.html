<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pomés Ruiz (PPE-DE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, I am very happy to reiterate your closing words in the debate on subsidiarity or coordination. I agree with you, Commissioner, when you say that there is no contradiction between these two terms, and that they should both be perfectly achievable. Perhaps this debate, on the 11 stability plans presented by the countries participating in the euro and the four convergence plans, is a good time to review the harmonisation between the subsidiarity and coordination required by the introduction and future of the single currency.</p>
<p class="contents">This, therefore, is the flip-side of the debate which we have just held on the report by Mr Katiforis, and we must firstly begin to think about the instrument. This is the first time that this Parliament has debated the 15 plans presented by the Member States. I suspect that, in subsequent versions, the report will not be a single whole, but rather a detailed study will have to be made of the solutions, the weak and strong points, which this Parliament detects in the economic policies proposed by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore going to ask for more detail in the plans which are submitted, in the structure of expenditure and also of income, paying particular attention to investments. We would ask that the projections they make in the medium and long term take account of different scenarios relating to the development of interest rates, demographic development and other variables affecting the stability of our accounts in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">We also ask in this regard – and I am returning to the debate on subsidiarity – for greater political commitment from the 15 national parliaments. We believe that this is a task which falls to everyone, and not just to the European Parliament. Some Member States have subjected the stability and convergence plans to internal debate in order to seek political support for this idea of jointly building economic unity, and we should ask the Member States who have not done so to debate these programmes in their parliaments in order to try, firstly, to persuade those states and parliaments to participate in this common task and, secondly, to provide political support for the commitments which are agreed to regarding the necessary coordination of economic policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the report’s proposals to the House, I am very pleased to note that all of the budgetary objectives established in previous programmes have been met, and even exceeded. However, this cause for satisfaction is counter-balanced by the fact that, aside from the possible criticism that the objectives could perhaps have been more demanding and rigorous, we are seeing that the objectives have been achieved, not as a result of the interest and efforts of the Member States, but simply to factors such as the favourable development of interest rates or greater than expected tax revenue.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore believe that, although budgetary consolidation must continue to be a priority, the economic environment – which has improved a lot – must offer us the possibility of speeding up consolidation and, at the same time, undertaking structural reforms in the medium term. It is not acceptable for this relative economic boom to dissuade the Member States from making decisions – sometimes difficult decisions – on structural reforms. These include, firstly, labour reform, which we discussed earlier. It is clear that not all the states have implemented the labour reforms which we consider appropriate. The improved performance of the labour market – which is clear – has been based on satisfactory economic growth, and not all the Member States have made the rigorous reforms that they must make, more radical reforms, to resolve the unacceptable problem of the high rate of unemployment in the European countries in comparison to other countries and which is not only an economic blight but also, and above all, a personal and family blight which cannot be permitted in the modern Europe of the 21st Century.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also crucial that we liberalise the telecommunications and energy markets, and not all countries are doing so in the same way.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to tax reform, we should welcome the reduction in the high level of taxes in France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain, and we should bear in mind that the high rate of unemployment often relates to the fact that we have high levels of tax.</p>
<p class="contents">In the long-term reforms, we should also include the serious problem of population. In the programmes presented to us, we note that particular attention is given to the ageing of the population. Perhaps it is time that we insisted that Member States resolve the demographic problem at source, through a suitable approach to both tax revenue policies and social expenditure, in order to protect families with children. This is the way to tackle the problem at source, and not only its effects. This is the only way we will prevent the old Europe from becoming a decrepit Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why this report is so important, and in the light of the rapporteur’s reference in his explanatory statement to the fact that Greece’s programme is not dealt with in detail in his document as it will form the subject of a special report, then, on behalf of my Group, I am bound to say that it will be too late for the special report as far as we are concerned, because matters are not being handled as they were during the debate on the candidate countries two years ago in 1998. We also adopted the convergence reports in April of that year, and held the accession debate in May. Since the next item on the agenda is a debate on Greece’s membership of the euro zone, and we are to take a decision on it tomorrow, our Group has tabled several amendments, so as to enable us to be even-handed in our approach.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">This is why I would very briefly like to go into the fact that Greece has not yet completely fulfilled the criteria pertaining to public debt, and that the sustainability requirement, which we set great store by, as far as the inflation rate is concerned at any rate, is viewed by the ECB, as well as the Commission and ourselves, with some concern. Hence we would emphasise that whilst we welcome Greece’s participation in the EMS since 18 May 1998, and its achievements, the criteria must be applied in full to all candidate countries. </p>
<p class="contents">We have noted that, according to reports by the Commission and the ECB, Greece is currently fulfilling the convergence criteria, – when they are given a liberal interpretation, as happened in 1998 too – although one cannot help but have some doubts on the sustainability front. This relates to the inflation criterion and we would demand a further reduction in the level of debt and the implementation of a programme. We are also calling for a concrete action plan to further privatise Greek state enterprise and implement the single market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why it is right that the European Parliament should take these reports seriously, and go so far as to examine once again not only whether monetary union has created an internal market, with no currency fluctuations or attendant negative effects on growth and employment, but whether the Member States have actually kept their promises; i.e. those that belong to the euro zone and those that are to submit convergence programmes.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">After all, monetary union is actually laid down and provided for in the Treaty of Maastricht as a Community of stability. Only States that have demonstrated their ability to maintain price stability and financial solidity, and that can help to make the monetary union a real Community of stability, are able to join monetary union. Exactly the same applies to Greece. We will have further debates on this. To Mr Karas I have to say that the requirements we make of Italy and Belgium, for example, regarding debt reduction, will, of course, apply to Greece as well. We will also keep an eye out for overly optimistic data being submitted in this regard. Greece must be able to make the grade in this respect too.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">It is evident from the annual exercise concerning the stability and convergence programmes that the EU Member States are seasoned partners that are able to withstand criticism. They must allow their partners to scrutinise their economic and budgetary status quo, and accept and act on their conclusions. Hence, the second round will be far more important than the current one, because, for the first time, actual criticism has been voiced. We have yet to see what effect this will have on future programmes.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">One matter of regret to my mind though, is that the EU Finance Ministers are not yet using the working method of the Luxembourg Process on the employment guidelines as a benchmark. It is also regrettable that, consequently, it has not been possible to add to the progress made on the stability and convergence front, because the programmes have not been compared in terms of quality. I therefore believe that if these points were to be taken up, it could further enhance harmonisation, both in the context of the development of the internal market and of the euro zone. The same applies to coordination of the taxation systems. Tax coordination worthy of the name must at last prevail within the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It lays out and highlights both the achievements and the shortcomings of the Member States in the way the stability and convergence programmes are applied, which, as I mentioned in my previous intervention on the Katiforis report, have brought satisfactory results for the whole of the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this current satisfactory situation must not mask a series of shortcomings and must lead to the implementation of the series of recommendations which the rapporteur, Mr Pomés Ruiz, correctly makes in his report.</p>
<p class="contents">He mentioned one of these recommendations in his speech: the need to take advantage of the current favourable situation, the healthy state of public finances – which on the other hand are disciplined by the stability and convergence programmes – in order to reduce the deficit, and possibly remove it completely, as well as to reduce debt levels, even to below the limits set in the convergence programmes. This would mean that we could make far-reaching tax reforms which would contribute to a more favourable environment for our economy, for business initiative, to freeing up resources and promoting them by fiscal means in an area which is one of our priority commitments: to be up-to-date and competitive at the most advanced levels of the information society and in the application of new technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by arguing – and I believe this is one of the conclusions we must draw from Mr Pomés Ruiz’s report – for greater coordination between the Member States with regard to the implementation of these programmes. I would therefore like to insist once again on the need for a genuine direction for economic and monetary policy at European Union level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it is very clear from this report that other Member States besides Austria failed to adhere to all aspects of the Council regulation in question. Our current Finance Minister, Mr Grasser, had to work under pressure of time when compiling Budget 2000, and it is this budget that fulfilled significant criteria of the Council regulation, the measures pertaining to pensions for example. The Member States’ efforts to overhaul their budgets will only prove successful if there is a clear reduction in the taxation and social contribution burden within the EU.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">It was, and still is, a serious mistake to maintain that high taxation and social contribution levels guarantee high tax receipts at the same time. The opposite is true. Japan and the USA are living proof of the fact that countries with low rates of taxation can be successful. The tax burden in the USA averages 30%, as compared with 46% in the Union, and the USA has a budget surplus in excess of USD 250 billion at present. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur complains that the objectives are more the result of higher than expected tax revenues and the favourable development of interest rates than of the Member States’ own efforts. This perception betrays a rather narrow-minded budgetary policy. In my view, there is nothing reprehensible about being able to achieve balanced budgets through development rather than by imposing fasting and prayer on the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">To try and balance the budget solely by cutting expenditure, while, at the same time, wanting to reduce taxation, is something which goes beyond economic restructuring and the spirit of the Stability Pact, at least in my understanding, to limiting the involvement of the public sector in the economy. It is something in addition to the Stability Pact. This trend can also be seen from the reference to the fact that tax and social contributions in Europe account for approximately 46% of GDP, while in the USA and Japan they only account for 30%. But they are higher in Europe because we have a social state. If Mr Pomés Ruiz’s group wishes to change the policy on the social state, it should table it clearly and not tack it on to the Stability Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">I did not find one single reference in the report which justified Greece’s being singled out, as Mr Karas has done, but I should like to say the following, now that the subject has been raised: it is irresponsible to say that inflation in Greece has only fallen over recent months. Inflation has fallen over eight years from 18% to 2%, thanks to constant and unstinting effort. I had hoped that we warranted more generous support for this tremendous effort, which has required sacrifices on the part of the Greek people.</p>
<p class="contents">To say that Greece will be unable to sustain the criteria, I am sorry, but that is prejudging the facts. How do we know that they cannot be sustained in Greece but they can be sustained in so many other countries of the European Union? The Greek people are determined to apply the criteria and they will show their determination in due course.</p>

However, we feel that, precisely in consideration of these undertakings and in the light of the current situation, the precise nature of any interventions cannot be identified in advance just for the sake of efficient budget control. </p>
<p class="contents">In fact, in a context where there are varying degrees of interdependence between States, there are too many variables at work to be combined to produce more general indicators. I refer to the constant pressure with regard to restricting welfare expenditure, structural reform of the labour market and privatisation of the telecommunications and energy sectors. On the other hand, we are aware of the need for a more effective convergence process, for economic cohesion and, therefore, also for the approximation of the single currency, whose oscillation is no longer virtual but is in line with prices and taxes; the need, of course, for more harmonious tax and fiscal policies, but also pricing policies; for more harmonious investment policies as regards both research and the closing of infrastructure gaps, including within the individual States, but also for greater homogeneity in the action of public administrations. The most representative variable is certainly the time frames and contents of the Treaty reforms and the process of constitutionalisation of the Union, i.e. of a greater or lesser European political presence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solbes,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I understand that it is not always easy, in a debate such as this, to differentiate between those aspects of our policy which we normally raise in the broad guidelines for economic policies, the stability and growth pacts or the references to the convergence reports, which will be the subject of the third debate this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">In the debate we have just held we rather confused the three elements. I would essentially like to refer to the one which seems essential today, that of the stability pacts, although I will mention certain other points which have been raised.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I share Mr Pomés’s view that we need greater coordination, which is not incompatible with subsidiarity, but I am also interested in his additional demands that we work in more detail on expenditure and income, the existence of different scenarios or greater commitments in terms of national policies. However, I would like to remind him that, within the framework of subsidiarity, it falls to the Member States to define their own stability and growth programmes. The Commission must judge them, but it is not our job to give instructions on this point. Nor is it our job to give instructions on the stability programmes or structural reforms, which you have mentioned. These structural reforms in fact fall within the broad guidelines for economic policies.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is a point – the third which you referred to – which lies between the world of structural reform and the tax obligations relating to the deficit and, above all, the stability of public finances, in particular with regard to debt. I am referring to the demographic problem and specifically the ageing of the population. It is true that this is much more than a purely financial problem, but this is the concern which we highlighted in Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say that, in this case – as in the case referred to by Mrs Randzio-Plath, of the need to compare the quality of programmes and greater harmonisation, or the reference by Mr Gasòliba i Böhm, for example, to deepening tax reforms – in our current thinking there is the reasonable prospect of fulfilling the objectives of the stability and growth programmes, and we believe that we must pay more attention to what we call the sustainability and quality of public finances.</p>
<p class="contents">We will present a report in May on this specific point, in which we intend to consider not only the nature of income but also the nature of expenditure as well as how the reduction in public deficit has been achieved and what instruments have been used. These are instruments of a permanent nature which have the same characteristics in each of the Member States. We will also tackle the issue of our future obligations. In many cases the Member States have obligations which are not classed as debt, but which do, in fact, constitute debt in one form or another. All of this will allow us to hold the debate which you have mentioned. I believe that that will be the time to carry out this type of comparison in more depth.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, I am grateful for the effort you have made to assess the work we have done. I believe that the problems of stability and convergence are basically characterised – as you have correctly highlighted, Mr Pomés – by the fact that, firstly, the objectives set have been met; secondly, because we are following the same line. However, that fulfilment of the objective, especially with regard to the reduction of public deficits, has been less ambitious – surely as a result of an improved economic situation – and we must take advantage of that improved economic situation so that we do not move backwards, but that we make progress in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">I said that I wanted to make a couple of additional comments on two points that have been raised concerning issues which are not strictly related to this report, but with the previous report. Mr Karas referred to the Greek problem and the problems of sustainability with regard to convergence criteria. In the case of Greece, exactly the same criteria were applied as in previous assessments. I understand that concern, mentioned in the Commission’s report, about the sustainability of inflation, but I would also like to provide some information which may clarify the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the latest figures of the harmonised CPI – published on 15 May and concerning the month of April – Greek inflation is improving considerably in comparison to the previous situation: it has decreased from 2.8% to 2.1%; and the unharmonised index also shows better figures for April as compared with March. Therefore, I believe that these concerns about Greek inflation are sometimes excessive.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, you will have to debate the problems relating to the amendments which you wish to raise in the Pomés report. I will simply say, with regard to two amendments by your Group, that in one of them there is a small error relating to Greece’s entry into the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. In my view, in Amendment No 4, it would make more sense to adopt a more positive approach with regard to the Greek government’s future obligations than it would to adopt an approach which raises doubts as to its capacity to fulfil its obligations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
