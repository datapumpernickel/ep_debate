<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Diller, </span>  <span class="italic">Council. – (DE)</span> Mr President, so that the Minutes are correct, I should like to point out that the last letter of my name is an ‘r" and not an ‘n".</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, I have already had the opportunity of presenting the Council"s views on the 1997 discharge procedure to your Budgetary Control Committee on 19 April. The Council recommendation to give discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the 1997 budget is being made in spite of the fact that the Commission has already resigned. As we know, the immediate cause of its resignation was the report of the Committee of Independent Experts on the responsibility of the Commission and individual members of the Commission for cases of fraud, mismanagement and nepotism which had occurred over a number of years.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to state explicitly before Parliament that combating fraud is a matter of great concern to the Council. The comments accompanying our recommendation to give discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the 1997 budget make this crystal clear and leave no room for doubt. In Vienna, the European Council reaffirmed that it attaches great importance to the efficient fight against fraud, corruption and other criminal activity affecting the European Union"s financial interests. It expressed the wish that the Council – together with the other institutions – should successfully complete its examination of the proposals on the table before the Cologne European Council in June.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to confirm that our presidency is trying to have the so‐called OLAF regulation – which we have in fact just been debating – adopted by the ECOFIN Council on 25 May, and is doing so in extremely close cooperation with you, the Parliament. This cooperation – and this has been highlighted by all the speakers – has further intensified in recent weeks because this is a problem of which the general public is aware and it needs to be resolved swiftly.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the Council, like Parliament and the Commission, is making every effort to combat fraud, including in particular outside the context of the discharge procedure. If I may, I will now return to the actual reason for my being here, the discharge for 1997. It is true that the Court of Auditors" report contains a whole host of negative comments on the implementation of the budget – some of which I will be addressing shortly – but it would be over‐simplistic to lay the entire blame for the shortcomings which have arisen at the door of the Commission. They are partly the result of structural deficiencies to which the Member States have also contributed.</p>
<p class="contents">In making our recommendation, however, we also wish to acknowledge the efforts which the Commission has made so successfully in many sectors to tighten up financial management. In the midst of all the criticism, this should not be forgotten. Nevertheless, I should like to address a few points where there are particular grounds for criticism.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I should like to stress how important it is to ensure that the internal organisation of the Commission is conducive to the efficient management of programmes. For this to be the case, clear objectives need to be set which allow the efficiency of Community actions to be assessed accurately. The Council is also very concerned about the fact that appropriations for general information measures and measures to provide the public with information about the European Union are still being utilised without a legal base.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Council is unhappy that there are still numerous irregularities associated with payments made under the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund and for structural measures. Nor is it justifiable that, contrary to the Financial Regulation – and I stress, contrary to the Financial Regulation – it is common practice in the field of research in particular to pay advances before the number of participants or the costs of the activities concerned are known. Finally, it is regrettable that only a small proportion of the payment appropriations for external aid – and in particular for the priority programmes – has been used.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the statement of assurance is concerned, the Council is deeply concerned that the Court of Auditors still has not been able to make a statement of this kind because a large number of mistakes are still being made with the implementation of payments. Hardly any improvements can be noted on the previous financial year. Having made these criticisms, I should also like to make a few more positive remarks. The amendments made to the Financial Regulation in November 1998 have enabled financial control to be modernised, in particular as far as the release of unutilised appropriations is concerned. But like the European Court of Justice – and probably also Parliament – the Council attaches great importance to the Financial Regulation being thoroughly modernised and completely recast. We urgently request the Commission to table proposals to this effect.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to draw attention to the measures taken under the SEM 2000 initiative, thanks to which it has been possible to tighten up financial management considerably. As the rapporteur for the 1997 discharge procedure, Mr Brinkhorst, emphasises, administrative cooperation both between the Commission and the Member States and among the Member States themselves needs to be stepped up further, given that a large proportion of the budget is implemented by the Member States. Of course, this does not alter the fact that the Commission bears the responsibility for implementing the budget. When it examined the 1997 annual report of the Court of Auditors, the Council also took into consideration all 25 special reports drawn up during 1998. On some of them it jointly adopted specific conclusions, which have been included in the recommendation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to emphasise that the budgetary authority and the Member States need to ensure that taxpayers" money is not only accounted for properly but also used as efficiently as possible. The Council is firmly resolved to work towards further improving the financial management of the Community. This is a long‐term task for all those who are responsible for managing Community funds.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to mention a few points which played a part in the discussion with your Budgetary Control Committee, Mrs Theato. It was suggested that we should hold a trilogue, or at least a dialogue, with you before the Council adopts its recommendation to grant discharge. I am sorry, but we are rather hesitant about this suggestion. We believe that the Council should first carry out the task which it is assigned in the Treaty of scrutinising the documents, and that only afterwards should we discuss the results with you.</p>
<p class="contents">We do agree with you, however, that the questions which have been raised need to be taken into account during the forthcoming reform of the Financial Regulation. Your suggestion to further step up cooperation between national financial experts and between them and the Commission is something which we view favourably.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that further suggestions will now be made in the debate which I will then be able to pass on to the Council. Thank you for your attention.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Elles </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span><span class="italic">rapporteur. ‐</span> Mr President, I rise to conclude what has been a historic discharge process where nothing has gone according to plan. I hope that we will be able to conclude our deliberations on this report this week. In doing so, I should like to make a few procedural and substantive points and then some concluding remarks.</p>
<p class="contents">On procedure, I would like to thank those colleagues in the Committee on Budget Control who have contributed towards this whole discharge process. This discharge is, after all, one of many, and I happen to be the general rapporteur. In December last year the majority of this House refused to grant discharge and it was referred back because there were problems in procedure which have now been sorted out by changing our rules to be in line with those of the Treaty. We should now therefore move to a decision on this item.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen during this process that some people have disapproved of having a discharge which was a political process. I understand that particular problem. I understand less those who have caused problems in this discharge process because it has been dealing with problems of substance. Most of us now realise that it was the right time for this Parliament to refuse to grant discharge because that triggered all the rest of the events which happened in the months afterwards. Yet today we see an amendment by the Socialist Group refusing to follow this definitive decision to grant discharge because it still seems to want to continue this process. Have they learned nothing from this whole procedure? We should close it down today.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving to substantive items in the report which I submitted and which should now be an annex to this resolution, there were three major items which we highlighted, all of which have been confirmed by the report of the Committee of the Wise Men. Firstly, lack of democratic accountability and access to information. Secondly, real concern – and it is interesting to read it now after these months have past – about irregularities with Commissioners, and one in particular who, by her inability to resign, caused the resignation of all. Perhaps the central feature was the weakness in management structure which was made very clear in paragraph 19 of this attached document which says: ‘Weakness in management organisation led to operational distortions in implementing policies". Who knows, perhaps acting President Santer could have saved the Commission if earlier he had stopped running programmes for which he did not have staff.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me look also at one other substantive item in the original report of the 1996 discharge: the reform programme, which the acting President Santer took on board on 11 January in his reform programme of the Commission. What has happened to these items now: the codes of conduct we asked for, the revision of the Statute, the nomination of A1 and A2 posts so as to make sure we have high quality at the top of the Commission and the screening report? All these things seem to have come into some murky area somewhere because one or two of the resolutions we have passed recently have failed to be specific on the requests we are putting to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to see these things at least clarified, perhaps by the Commissioner, so that the new Parliament will be able to dispose of these documents.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking ahead, there are two conclusions I would draw from this. Firstly, so far as the Commission is concerned, we have a number of ideas which have been part of this reform process. Fortunately, in the report on the 1997 discharge, which my friend and colleague, Mr Brinkhorst, will be introducing shortly, we shall see a number of those ideas presented. Secondly, I hope that this document will be available to the new Parliament and the acting Commission, and its new President designate, Mr Prodi, so that parliamentarians in a new Parliament have the information they need to ensure the nomination of commissioners is done effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not want to leave the feeling in the Commission with this whole 1996 discharge that we do not rate highly the vast majority of the Commission officials. I used to be one myself. I am perfectly well aware of the high quality of people there, but we want to make sure that it is always high quality. We should not condemn the whole system just because of one bad apple.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it has actually been Parliament above all who has campaigned on this process. It is not, I am afraid, the Council. It granted discharges. It was Parliament coming of age, and it will have to be proven in the new Parliament that we are capable of meeting our responsibilities.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Brinkhorst </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR), </span><span class="italic">rapporteur. ‐</span> Mr President, it is clear that the conclusions of this report for 1997 are very specific and very clear, namely, a postponement of discharge on institutional grounds.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank all colleagues. The Committee on Budgetary Control wanted to go further. It did not want – in terms of the 1996 discharge – to waste time. This is not possible. We should go beyond that. And it is against that background that the Budget Control Committee voted the document which you find as an annex. In a sense it is the history after 1996. It is also the political nature of this report to put the discharge procedure in a broader perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">As the President‐in‐Office of the Council just indicated, there are a number of novel features which should be taken into account in future. We should not just criticise the past, we should look to the future. That is the significance of this particular annex, on the discharge procedure itself, on the information to be given in future. There are comments on what has led to the situation just described by my colleague, Mr Elles, a new staffing policy, questions on the BATs, the Committee of Experts' report and also some guidelines for the Commission reform. That is why the report consists of more than simply the statement that we should refuse a discharge at this particular time.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased with the comment of the President‐in‐Office of the Council because part of this report is also oriented towards the new partnership between the Commission and the Member States as well as the cooperation between the Member States themselves. I welcome the statement by the Council that it will not fall on deaf ears. As the Council executes about 95 % of the budget it is necessary that more action should be taken. I hope the time will come when, like in the Committee on Budgets, we will work much more closely together with the Council on budget control. We find some specific recommendations on that particular point.</p>
<p class="contents">The Annex basically has three purposes. Our purpose is to state from the point of view of Parliament where we stand at the present time. It is also an account of what happened after the 1996 procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as Mr Elles has already said, it provides an indication – though we should never seek to govern beyond our grave, certainly not a rapporteur who is leaving this Parliament – to the new Parliament about the kind of issues which can be used to judge the new Commission during the hearings. That is an important point in itself. It is not binding but it is an indication. For that reason it is a contribution from the Committee on Budgetary Control and will not be voted by Parliament as such.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we want to be a constructive Parliament. As Parliament acquires more responsibility and power it should also be a partner, not only in criticising, but also in helping the Commission to carry out its tasks independently but with accountability. It is therefore also an element of the work programme for the future Commission which we hope will be taken on board.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me clear up one misunderstanding. I had the opportunity of discussing this with Commissioner Liikanen at an earlier stage but I would also like to say it in public. It cannot be the role of the Court of Auditors to replace the Commission, nor Parliament. Some requests to the Court of Auditors to participate in certain studies should not be seen as taking away the responsibility of action by the Commission or by Parliament. But the Court of Auditors has played a very important and useful role in this process between Parliament, the Commission and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">It is against that background that I would like finally to say that it would be useful if the Council itself reviewed its procedures as regards interaction between the Court of Auditors and the national bodies. I hear too often that national courts of auditors have a different role, that they cannot fulfil a function within the Community system. As we move into a new phase, a new situation where it is not the Commission <span class="italic">or</span> the Member States, but the Commission <span class="italic">and</span> the Member States, I would call on the President of the Council to study this particular issue of activities between the Court of Auditors and the national auditing bodies in future.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Fabra Vallés </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (ES)</span> Mr President, we shall now move on to the discharge of the so‐called ‘other sections", starting with the first section: Parliament and the Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">In respect of Parliament and the document before us, the large number of cancelled appropriations is striking. I should like to make it clear that the reason for this was the delay affecting the D−3 building in Brussels and IPE 4 in Strasbourg. Since we are reviewing 1997, which is in the past, I should like to emphasise for everyone"s peace of mind that there was a steady improvement in the number of appropriations cancelled in subsequent years.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards aid to democratically elected parliaments in Central and Eastern Europe, 30 % of initial appropriations were not used. This, too, may seem surprising, but the reasons for this state of affairs and possible improvements are clear.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like to take the opportunity provided by the 1997 discharge document to draw attention to the fact that the necessary resources should be made available to the Committee on Budgetary Control to allow it to monitor the appropriations granted to the political groups and the expenses incurred by the secretarial services.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, it is worth emphasising that we are continuing to call for a regulation on the legal status of the political parties in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we request that discharge for 1997 be granted where Parliament is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to the Ombudsman, the 82.1 % implementation rate is of note. I do not wish to imply that this is due to a shortage of staff. The department in question is constantly requesting additional staff, but it is certainly worth emphasising that this is a new institution; after all, we are still referring to 1997. It is clear that the budget allocated to the Ombudsman is being used more and more effectively as the years go on. Discharge should also be granted in the case of the Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of the Court of Justice, it is important to mention the advantages resulting from the leasing arrangements concerning the annexes to the Palais. As regards the earlier payments of ECU 50 million, I would like to remind you of a concern we had at the time in relation to the commitments made to Parliament by the Luxembourg Government. Back in 1997, we were not certain if these commitments would be fulfilled. We really did not know what problems could arise. However, in the light of events in 1997 and later, we must now thank the Luxembourg Government for the excellent work it carried out. We propose that discharge also be granted to the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the Court of Auditors, I would simply like to say that in 1997 the usual problems of budgetary inadequacy were satisfactorily resolved, and almost without effort. This was due to the favourable movement in the conversion rate between the euro – then the ecu – and Luxembourg"s currency. Similarly, we are in favour of granting discharge to the Court of Auditors.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Committee of the Regions is concerned, it should be pointed out that budgetary forecasting needs to be improved. In particular, the haphazard programming of activities should be tackled because it means we are constantly being called on to make significant transfers. Nevertheless, we are in favour of granting discharge to the Committee of the Regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is the Economic and Social Committee, the only area where we do have a problem. As you are aware, discharge for the Economic and Social Committee is still pending, awaiting a report by UCLAF. Discharge for the Economic and Social Committee is therefore conditional on the findings of the report on its activities which UCLAF – the fraud prevention unit – is due to present. We therefore propose that discharge for the Economic and Social Committee be postponed.</p>
<p class="contents">Since this is a joint debate, I do not wish to conclude without stating that my delegation – my delegation and I myself – have already made our position on the 1996 budget discharge quite clear. Further, the resignation of the Commission cannot now be used as an excuse to disregard the commitments made by Mr Santer. These commitments should be honoured by the incoming President, Mr Prodi.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Blak </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DA)</span> Mr President, I am going to talk about the ECSC accounts, and I would like to say that this has developed into a success story. When I took over the accounts, we had a mass of problems. We were swamped with the usual stories. Everything was in chaos. Who can forget the interest subsidy which ran for ten years, and which we could not end because of foot‐dragging? There was a mass of corruption. There was the case of the purchase of apartments when the Commission moved into fine premises in Paris. In brief, there was a great deal of confusion, and there was disorder and chaos. Then we took matters in hand and we sorted them out. I am glad to say that we in the committee have decided today that we are pleased to give a discharge in this area. When I look back I think of how, for example, we stood on the verge of possibly losing billions in connection with the Channel Tunnel. This appears to have been resolved, and now it is a success story. In Denmark, we had a case concerning the Great Belt bridge, where the loan was rather too large. There were a few billion to play with, but that case too was sorted out. All this is thanks to positive cooperation, and because we were able to obtain information and because we could talk with an excellent Commissioner. I would like to commend Mr Liikanen. It was possible to talk to him. Every time there was a problem, we went to him and we always got the problem solved.</p>
<p class="contents">So there has been good cooperation in connection with the accounts of the European Coal and Steel Community. But there have been problems in another area, the granting and uptake of loans in Europe, which I have been concerned with as part of Mr Brinkhorst's report. Here we see some obstinate people who talk down to us – I shall refrain from mentioning the name of the President of the European Investment Bank. Year after year, we have pointed out that we have a right to come and inspect the Bank. ‘It is not your concern', he says. ‘We have some small private shareholders, and out of consideration for them you cannot enter, and in any case everything is going well with us.' In my capacity as rapporteur, I have received a piece of paper which says that the Bank has in fact lost billions on failed investments and that the money is hidden in the accounts or has been offset. That is unacceptable. It led to me recommending that we should not give a discharge for the 1997 accounts. We are sick and tired of lies from people who sit and hide things from Europe's taxpayers. We will simply not put up with it. Last year, we had problems with the accounts and I refused to give a discharge. The committee supported me. Then we reached an agreement whereby the Commission intervened and made it possible for us to reach a sensible solution, enabling us to monitor the taxpayers' money. More than 80 % of the funds in the various institutions in the European Investment Fund is our money. So what did they do when we gave a discharge? They short‐changed us, so to speak, and backed out of the agreement, in spite of the fact that we had goodness knows how many meetings and spent goodness knows how much time setting it up. That cannot be allowed to go on. Let us give a clear signal from this House to Sir Brian Unwin: we are no longer prepared to listen to lies about how everything is perfect. This is going to be cleared up now. We want to know how DKK 4 to 5 billion can disappear in the accounts. It is quite simply an outrageous scandal. It may well be as they say that the money is not lost because it may return, because they have not sold bonds. We do not want to hear such stories. We simply have to say quite bluntly that it is over. They cannot have the accounts approved if there is no audit whereby we can go in and check up on the Community's money. So let us end our cooperation with them. It cannot be right that we have to pay for everything which they sit and play with, and that they can then play with the profits afterwards. We have no wish to see examples of how bond purchases, amongst many other things, are placed with various friends in various places for far less than can be got back. This is a real scandal. If the Commission can be brought down for as little as it was, these people should have been thrown out long ago so that they never have any chance of returning. So here we need to have a powerful Commission which can really go in and check, and we need some people who are willing to cooperate, as Mr Liikanen has cooperated with us, so that we can get this cleared up.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say that I was moved to tears when I heard the Council speak about all the things they would like to do. But why do you rubber‐stamp the accounts every single year and say that you are making recommendations? You have never applied the brakes. I think the Council should take a look at this area, and the new Commission should get to grips with these things. There really is something to get to grips with here.</p>

I have to admit that not all the debates have been as exciting and as exhilarating as this one. However, these two first‐generation agencies are a good example of how control can be exerted by Parliament. The Committee on Budgetary Control is very much helped by the European Court of Auditors – and I should like to thank them for their two special reports on these two agencies. I should also like to thank the Council which has latterly – and I emphasise <span class="italic">latterly</span> because in the early years this did not happen – been putting forward considered recommendations to Parliament to grant discharge.</p>
<p class="contents">One also has to admit that these agencies are small and therefore easier to control, but the cooperation on control really does work. Far from resenting control, the agencies welcome the European Parliament's involvement. It would help, though, if the second‐generation agencies could be treated in the same way. Again, I appeal to the Council because Parliament, together with the Commission, has put forward considered amendments to the statutes which would make the situation of the new agencies the same as the old.</p>
<p class="contents">The reports are not long because there is no point in finding fault where faults do not exist. The European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions had a memorandum of understanding with the Agency for Health and Safety to avoid overlapping, because one of the things Parliament insists upon is that the work of these agencies should not overlap.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome their attempts to reduce mission expenditure. It is rather funny because if you look back a year or two you will find that the Court of Auditors was criticising officials from Dublin who used the weekend as part of their mission – obviously people like to have a trip home at the same time. But now they want the members of the agency to use the special pex tickets which are only available over weekends because a Saturday night has to be involved. It is just a change of opinion within the Court.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very happy to recommend discharge for the European Foundation in Dublin.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to CEDEFOP which has finally got over that tragic move from Berlin to Thessaloniki. I am not attacking Thessaloniki in any way; the fact is that if the Council look up the minutes, they will find it was a mistake to consign CEDEFOP to Thessaloniki in the first place, and the poor Commission and Parliament have been trying to pick up the pieces. However, the new building should be ready for occupation in July. I wish them well in their new building. I can see that the various staffing arrangements are now properly in place and I understand that out of all the staffing of the centre only two A grades remain to be filled. I have no hesitation at all in recommending discharge also for CEDEFOP.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I look forward to the day – and I do not think it will be long ahead – when the Court of Auditors is able to give these two agencies a certificate of assurance for ‘keeping their noses clean" so to speak and for getting good reports from the Court.</p>

<p class="contents">Appended to the motion for a resolution which you will be invited to vote on tomorrow, ladies and gentlemen, is a working document which enumerates the points that need to be clarified by the Commission, to enable the Parliament that will be voted in following the June elections to grant the discharge for 1997.</p>
<p class="contents">This working document is being held in trust by Parliament to be handed on to the new Parliament. I would like to raise one of the points mentioned in this working document, which concerns the famous Regulation 3245/81. This was a joke regulation in the sense that it was adopted, it entered into force, was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities, but it was never implemented in practice. This regulation provides for the establishment of a European Association for Cooperation to take on the work of a Belgian private law foundation. It was never implemented but, despite this, for a number of years it was referred to in Community budgets as the legal base for capital to be made available from the Community budget to fund the activities of this Belgian private law foundation.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, I hope and I believe – or rather, I am sure – that the structural changes that are currently being made to the organisation and operation of the Commission will make it easy for the next Parliament, which will have the backing of the Commission and will not have to put up with what we have had to put up with over the last three years, to provide explanations and come up with solutions. I wish it all the best.</p>

Governments have repeatedly signalled, before taking up the Council presidency, that they might be able to support integrating it into the budget. Later, however, numerous reasons have been found for postponing this decision after all. One of the committee"s specific criticisms of the 1997 budget is that large amounts are transferred from one Development Fund to the next. The suggestion is therefore being made to simplify the management of appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the appropriations for cofinancing, the committee also criticises the fact that individual projects take too long to complete and that the supply of funds in particular often causes huge problems for the non‐governmental organisations. The Court of Auditors and the Development Committee are waiting rather anxiously to see whether the new structures which the Commission is now introducing will prove to be effective here. That is why the Committee on Development and Cooperation requests that a report should be submitted to it next March on experiences with the new structures. The committee also takes the view that the response to the procedural shortcomings criticised by the Court of Auditors should be for a minimum degree of competition to be required, in particular in the tendering and award procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the committee agrees with granting discharge for the 1997 Development Fund. Development cooperation is not one of the areas which voters immediately see as an essential part of European policy. We are therefore all the more dependent on financial resources being used transparently and in a way which people can understand.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Tappin </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, speaking as the coordinator for the Socialist Group, I want to address my remarks to three of the reports before us today.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall begin with discharge 1996. My Group can see no reason not to grant discharge for the 1996 budget. In the course of the discharge proceedings and in the light of the Court of Auditors' report, we asked a series of very searching questions of the Commission. I am sure that colleagues here are aware that the Commission came back with a series of responses to those questions which, to my Group, were satisfactory enough for us to grant discharge. The five questions put down were answered.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be said that from our side we believe that the rapporteur is playing petty party politics with the whole question of discharge for 1996. It has taken a great deal of effort to persuade the rapporteur to bring forward a report closing the accounts for 1996 so that we can proceed with the 1997 discharge.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not agree with the wording in paragraph 1, and we wish to delete the word ‘definitive" from that paragraph because no vote was ever taken in Parliament on the question of the 1996 discharge, which was recommended by the Committee on Budgetary Control to this House. The report was withdrawn and referred back to committee in the light of other events. If no vote was taken, we cannot have a definitive report. If one good thing has come out of the 1996 report, it has been the access which the Committee on Budgetary Control has had to persons and papers. If we are to continue to be an effective Budgetary Control Committee, this must continue in an unfettered way.</p>
<p class="contents">On a more pleasing note, let me move on to my second set of remarks on the 1997 budget. My Group will support the report put forward by Mr Brinkhorst, the rapporteur, to postpone discharge. We agree entirely with the reasons for postponement; that is there is no Commission in place to receive that discharge. In the committee, we have had a long series of discussions on the substantive questions we want both the DGs and the new Commission to address. These are reflected in the working document.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to commend Mr Brinkhorst on the detailed work he has put into this. I hope that when the Commission comes back to us in the new Parliament it will take on board and use as a blueprint those questions which are asked in the working document, especially on staffing policies, TAOs, Leonardo and the way in which PHARE and TACIS is operated. This is so critical for us to function as a parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">On the comment that Mr Brinkhorst makes on the question of the decentralised agencies – which Mr Kellett‐Bowman has picked up – it is essential that the Council address that question, which both Parliament and the Commission have agreement on.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to the report by Mr Kellett‐Bowman. Again, my friend, and I should like to say colleague, has produced two excellent reports on Dublin and Thessalonika. He says he has drawn up 15 reports in his time. This may well be the last report that Mr Kellett‐Bowman draws up on the decentralised agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to put on public record the high esteem in which I hold him as co‐rapporteur on the Committee on Budgets for the satellite agencies. He has taught me and has been an excellent colleague, very thoughtful, critical and precise. As a lasting memorial to his work, I should like to see the Council now, in recognition of the work he has done, agree to the changes in the statutes for the second generation agencies – changes on the own‐resources question, changes on financial control and changes on discharge that will allow Parliament to carry out its responsibilities properly. Let that be a lasting testament to his work.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Theato </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control. – (DE)</span> Mr President, this evening we have a veritable marathon of a debate to complete on discharge reports. Six reports are on the agenda. I will not comment on all of them, but will turn to the first, Mr Elles"s report, which is not actually a discharge report because it proposes closing the accounts for 1996, and I believe that this is right. We need to find a way to bring this process to an end, although I do believe that discharge was not given here, because if we look at the result of December"s vote, it is clear that the points made previously in support of the decision, the positive decision put forward by the Committee on Budgetary Control, were rejected by the plenary. That means that no discharge was granted. Our Rules of Procedure were awry. Now they have been amended, and there is no need for these matters to arise again.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a precedent for not granting discharge, the 1982 budget, for which the accounts were subsequently closed in 1985. That is how we should proceed here; we should, however, also bear in mind all the consequences which this has had politically. That is why it does not make any sense from a political point of view to grant discharge at this stage, because we do not have a Commission in office any more. It has resigned. Nevertheless, there will be no need for us to condemn everything that the Commission has done and neither do we wish to do so. Nor have we ever implied that Commissioners were guilty of being directly involved in criminal activities. No, but we have established that there is a need for restructuring and that new areas need to undergo a series of reforms which will make us in the European Union fit for the next millennium.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, this crisis, which began with the discharge or refusal of discharge for 1996 and the continuation for 1997 – for which we are not recommending discharge either this week, but postponement of discharge – was a necessary crisis, if we think of the positive lessons which we have learnt from it, and which we would have liked to pass on to this Commission, Mr Liikanen. But that is not how it has turned out. We all know what has happened.</p>
<p class="contents">In both reports, Mr Elles"s report, and here I am also bringing in our rapporteur for 1997, Mr Brinkhorst, two points really do need to be emphasised: we have not voted on conditions for giving discharge; we have annexed working documents. This is an unusual procedure, but I believe that it was the right approach to take, and these documents contain the suggestions – and indeed the demands – which we are passing on to the future Commission. I hope that the new Parliament and the new Commission will make use of them.</p>
<p class="contents">With your permission, I will just add a word to our rapporteur, Mr Fabra Vallés. He has produced a very accurate report for the other institutions. I do think, however, and here I also have the support of the rapporteur, that we must carry out the same controls here and apply standards in our own House which are just as tough as the ones we have imposed on the Commission. That is why the Council and the Commission, but also Parliament, must abide by the decisions we adopted in the Tsatsos report, for example on party financing, and we must also act properly where filling posts and promotions are concerned. We owe this to everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you, Mr President, for giving me the floor once more, and I should also like to thank all the other rapporteurs, whose reports should go through smoothly.</p>

I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their excellent work. Four reports propose that the discharge should be granted, one that it should be postponed, and one that it should be refused.</p>
<p class="contents">The discharge process for the budget this year has become an immense political task. So it was too last autumn and winter, in connection with the 1996 budget, which led to the Commission"s resignation. Although the process has led to many improvements and positive settlements and solutions, there is a danger that the assessment and discharge process will become inappropriately broad in scope, since the EU"s instruments state that Parliament must give a discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget. The wording stipulates that giving discharge is the aim, with any obstacles being removed beforehand. Discharge is thus the object of the exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">Discharge as a vote of confidence in the Commission is, however, too broad an interpretation, in my opinion, and there are two reasons for avoiding this. Although discharge, as it reflects the rules on accounting, is required be granted, Parliament must always be able to intervene in the work of the Commission if it so wishes. Giving discharge cannot be allowed to act as a barrier to intervention. Furthermore, in the present situation we can see a backlog starting to build up, with the discharge processes relating to several separate years remaining uncompleted. Good administration needs to be clear and systematic, and that applies to Parliament also. The decision on discharge must not be too ponderous or broad in scope, and it should not lead to a situation in which no one dares to give discharge.</p>
<p class="contents">With these observations I wish to say that the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party supports Mr Brinkhorst"s report as it stands and without amendments.</p>

We are now at the end of a very eventful and stormy period during which the Commission tarnished its image and lost its credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">And yet we must continue, and to continue means to look to the future and take stock of the task in hand so that where there has been defeat, failure and negativity, tomorrow there will be success, transparency and confidence. Contrary to what the Council has done lightly and thoughtlessly, we will not grant discharge to the Commission today since, as Laurens Jan Brinkhorst so well explained, discharge will not be granted to a resigning Commission that can no longer advise the European Parliament on future guidelines. Postponement is therefore the most appropriate solution technically speaking and in political terms it constitutes something of a peace gesture towards the new Commission. However, it does not dismiss the need for us to remain as vigilant as possible or the need to act with a certain resolve.</p>
<p class="contents">The future message we should like to give to the new Commission involves what we no longer want at any cost and what we do want at all costs. We no longer want a weak Commission that is non‐existent politically speaking and that is incapable of controlling and managing its administration. We do not want a Commission where the Commissioners are transformed into shepherds that follow their flocks. We do not want a Commission where some officials, who perhaps head an agency with a particular status, turn out to be true petty tyrants of the organisation, imposing their wishes and desires on their Commissioner, who then admits his ignorance of and lack of interest in the issue even when it concerns an amendment to the Community budget adopted by the European Parliament whose implementation does not present any budgetary difficulties or problems relating to the legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">We had the misfortune to experience such a Commission and it is precisely what we do not want to see repeated. I have reread President Santer"s speech and I remember that during his investiture in January 1995 he committed himself, in front of this very House, to a genuine culture of financial management. In the light of recent events, it is all too easy to see the irony in that today.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that nothing has been done. The Commission"s only reaction has been to take several subsequent measures aimed at filling in the gaps and appeasing Parliament, but nothing has been drawn up or thought out and no ideas have been formed. There have been no reforms; the Commission has simply limited itself to promises, preferring rhetoric over action. The truth is that the Commission was able to identify the problem of the financial mismanagement of European Union policies, but it was unable to come up with any solutions that it could turn into specific actions. The example of SEM 2000 and the installation of the new ROLEX system to manage all external contracts are good examples of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Another example of inefficiency, this time in the area of Community transport, is the computerisation of transit procedures which has met with many delays. A final example is that of the technical assistance offices which, as everyone knows, have caused many problems in recent years. However, in spite of the European Parliament"s insistence, the Commission still appears to be continuing to entrust the TAOs with the preparation of invitations to tender and the lists of projects to be retained. The Commission is not to decide on the projects to be retained, but is to ratify the list drawn up by the private consultants, which, in my view, is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">So, in short, this is what we do not wish to see repeated. On the other hand, we do want a Commission that takes full responsibility for its actions and choices, that is transparent in its institutional dialogue and that takes on the role of monitoring the operational policies that the services are responsible for implementing. Since the Court of Auditors has been drawing up the Statement of Assurance concerning activities financed from the general budget of the European Union, the statement has been negative. However, we hope that a new Commission that is politically consistent and responsible will enable the Court of Auditors to finally draw up a positive Statement of Assurance for the first time.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as everyone knows, we must not be too quick to criticise those who are coming to our aid. Let us hope that the new Commission will be able to learn from recent events so that it can successfully complete its mandate and so that today"s failure opens the way to tomorrow"s success. We are eagerly awaiting Mr Romano Prodi"s arrival in the hope that something good will come of something bad.</p>

The first one concerns the granting of discharge for 1997 for the Commission and for the Economic and Social Committee. It does seem natural to me that this be carried over to the next parliamentary term. However, as rapporteur on the discharge for the Economic and Social Committee for the 1996 financial year, I must stress that discharge cannot be granted until UCLAF has delivered its conclusions on the irregularities detected. There is no doubt that efforts have been made to correct these irregularities, even to the extent of altering certain working methods, but this does not justify ruling out UCLAF"s intervention. Parliament considered at the time that this intervention was essential for granting the discharge and the Council itself has also recently repeated that this is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">The failure to complete the 1996 discharge clearly means that the 1997 discharge is being delayed. I will not go into the discharge procedure for 1996 and the Commission, as I feel that the facts of the matter and the responsibilities assumed speak for themselves. Moreover, parliamentary history will do the rest. However, I do want to underline my dissatisfaction with the final solution which some are insisting on recommending in order to complete the procedure. It seems to me that this is completely at odds with the facts and the incomparable importance this procedure has assumed.</p>

From our group's point of view, it is clear that we cannot close the Commission's accounts, since there are still some unresolved cases concerning which the Greens have tabled three amendments. It is of course still the case that a sum of nearly EUR 40 000 was paid to a visiting scholar in breach of the Commission's conditions, and this must naturally be looked into.</p>
<p class="contents">Certain unclear points in the Commission's accounts therefore have to be explained before the accounts can be closed. We have thus tabled Amendment No 1, in which we give the alternative wording: ‘takes note of the following data established by the Commission in order to close the accounts for the financial year 1996'. However, we cannot close the accounts.</p>
<p class="contents">I am surprised to see that the Socialists are tabling an amendment which would do away with paragraph 1 of the Elles report, which is the vital one, stating that we recall our definitive decision not to grant discharge to the Commission in respect of the 1996 financial year. It should be clear to everyone that this paragraph must remain.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Brinkhorst report, the same thing applies, namely that discharge cannot be given until a great deal of missing information is supplied by the Commission. The Greens have tabled a number of amendments relating to this report as well.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Dell"Alba </span> <span class="bold">(ARE). </span>‐<span class="italic"> (IT) </span> Mr President, since the post‐war years an insidious practice has grown up in Italy, resulting in even illustrious lawyers justifying the distinction that is made between the constitution as written and the constitution as applied in practice. Following a philosophy which can be traced back in particular to the culture of the Communist Party and to an idea of the sociology‐inspired left, it is said that, although written texts exist, they can be amended if so desired by the majority or by a dominant group in politics or public opinion. This is still considered acceptable: written texts can hence be spirited away because at the end of the day theory takes second place to practice.</p>
<p class="contents">In countries with an Anglo‐Saxon legal system, where there is no constitution, it seems to me that the rule of law is the cardinal principle which governs these countries, and indeed governs them much better and has protected them from the type of vision which at any point allows the majority to decide whatever it likes: there are laws, there are texts but that does not matter, you can say something completely different as long as this is what the majority wants. And this is indeed the principle which in many countries has led to totalitarianism, intolerance and ‘people"s democracies". Liberals, who have always taken the rule of law as the cornerstone of their political action, have always based their arguments on the principle that there can be no objection to the texts themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, in our regulatory texts, leaving aside the amendment of the regulation we will be voting on tomorrow, the way in which the budget discharge procedure is regulated is set out in black and white for all to see; one may disagree with it but that is the way it is: if a text is tabled in this House and the proposal to which it refers is rejected, the proposal is referred back to the committee responsible. It is extremely serious that this Parliament"s final act should be to vote on a text which says something erroneous, or rather states – and in a forum which one might expect to respect the rule of law – that after referring back to committee, in other words rejecting, the proposal by Mr Elles, the rapporteur on the 1996 discharge procedure, that discharge should be granted to the Commission – actually meaning that the European Parliament would not grant discharge – we are today voting on a text which says something entirely wrong. On a political level, there may have been the resignations and there may therefore be a majority as far as the form is concerned but that is an entirely separate argument. I will fight and vote against asserting something which quite simply is not the case.</p>

<p class="contents">More than a year ago, on 31 March 1998, the European Parliament decided to postpone the decision to grant the Commission discharge for the financial year 1996. We must not forget that following on from this, at the beginning of December, the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Committee on Budgetary Control decided nevertheless to recommend to the House that it grant discharge for the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">On 17 December 1998, the majority of the House fortunately allowed common sense to prevail and refused to grant discharge. Given the seriousness of the irregularities and the examples of mismanagement, we immediately sought to take appropriate action and proposed that a motion of censure should be tabled. The motion was then tabled on 11 January by 70 Members from all the political groups, who at that time were heavily criticised with no right of reply, and I am thinking, in particular, of the chairman of the Group of the Party of European Socialists. However, 232 Members decided to match their words with actions by supporting the motion of censure against the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, a committee of ‘wise men" was set up as part of a manoeuvre that was designed to overturn their decision. This committee naturally confirmed what the majority of Members had suspected. We welcome today"s calls by our colleague James Elles for the situation to be clarified once and for all and for the discharge to be refused outright while the accounts are adopted. We expect Parliament to support him and to do so openly.</p>

We have of course also drawn up a number of special documents on this discharge, in other words on Mr Brinkhorst"s report, and I have to say that I am rather irritated that we have not received any response at all from the current Commission to documents which will soon be three months old.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that this Commission has only been an acting Commission for some time. However, I am assuming that individual Commissioners might perhaps also wish to belong to the next Commission. I think that precisely from the point of view of political understanding, it is very important to realise that Parliament cannot be treated like this! Of course, we do not always expect results of investigations down to the last detail, but we do still have unfinished business to complete. The chairman of the Budgetary Control Committee, Mrs Theato, has already referred today, for example, to the fact that we still have to accept that the cases which were submitted to us of officials being involved in instances of fraud have not yet been presented in a form which we can understand.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the ECHO case is concerned, we have to take it that this affair could assume even greater proportions, but there is not even any information available on the events relating to 1997 – and it is the 1997 financial year that we are dealing with here. The same applies to the points which we have touched on concerning agriculture which various other colleagues are also working on.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made a great deal of effort with the new anti‐fraud authority. Of course this has involved the application of a little friendly pressure, in particular on the part of the Council presidency and our own House, to make the Commission finally understand that it cannot simply deny facts which are on the table. Otherwise we will have to deal with these matters in another forum, and that would be before the European public. I do not wish to threaten anyone, but we have to state clearly what we as a Parliament expect of the Commission in terms of accountability, in particular if any of its Members also wish to be in the next Commission!</p>

<p class="contents">I said in the debate on the 1996 discharge back in December that I was actually disappointed by our arrogance – as reflected in the Treaties – in not even allowing for the possibility of discharge being refused. Mrs Theato pointed this out, and the Rules Committee of this House has now rectified the situation at last. Now, of course, I should also like to invite the Council to continue its work, so that it too will finally meet the conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group has been consistent in its position; it is also thanks to the stubborn and tough stance deliberately adopted by our rapporteur, Mr Elles, that ultimately the whole House has gone along with this approach, and today we have a success for which we in principle have only one person to thank, the rapporteur, Mr Elles, with his report on the 1996 budget discharge.</p>
<p class="contents">Discharge will not be granted for 1996, the accounts will be closed, and discharge can only be given for 1997 if – as you have just quite rightly said, Mr Bösch – the deficiencies are ironed out; the fact that they have not been has of course just been criticised by us both. A working paper and work programme have already been included in the Elles report; no one has yet reacted to them. There was a report from the Committee of Wise Men, and this in fact only confirmed what we had already established ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we are in a state of uncertainty which will drag on until September if the Committee of Wise Men presents a second report, and I do not believe that anyone in this House is happy about being in limbo in this way. But to avoid overburdening the 1998 discharge procedure with these problems as well, the 1997 discharge procedure has to be brought to a conclusion. If it is not, we shall never be finished with this matter and I will probably be affected by this personally in the 1998 budgetary procedure. That is why I wish to invite the Commission – whoever wishes to take the responsibility for this – finally to take the measures which we have demanded.</p>
<p class="contents">I am already worried, Mrs Cresson; your work with Leonardo concerned the 1998 financial year. At the time, we were accused of confusing 1996 and 1998. No, the problem is that this came to light in 1998, and I should like to ask you, Mr Liikanen, to tell your colleagues that at that time, in the summer, we sat upstairs on the seventh floor – things were really pleasant and friendly then – and made you an offer: be open, admit your mistakes, show us where the faults lie, and we will be prepared to compromise. That did not happen, and now you will have to find a way of dealing with the severity with which you are now being treated. But this is also significant for the 1997 and 1998 discharges.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the House itself. Since the very member of the Socialist Group who has been the most cooperative towards us is sitting here, I will actually avoid criticising the Socialist Group; otherwise I would have said that the dilemma facing us today is in fact the fault of the Socialist Group.</p>

Let me say that it is deplorable that the Member States did not appoint a new operational Commission long ago, because the acting Commission is in a state of paralysis and has chosen to be unwilling to take any kind of initiative to rectify errors or omissions. Obviously, in such a situation we cannot give a discharge. But even more important are the real political problems which remain unresolved. There has still been no reform of staff policy and still no improvement has been made in the administration of the various programmes. Especially in connection with the Central and Eastern European countries, with which I have worked a great deal, it is disastrous that people are incapable of turning the budgeted amounts into concrete projects, that the rules on open tendering and on concluding contracts are not being observed, and that no results can be shown in connection with the programme for the safety of nuclear power stations, to mention but a few specific examples.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a better structure, a better administration and greater transparency. That is the crucial message to the Commission as a condition for even considering approving the accounts for 1997.</p>

A sense of accountability, according to the report, is a pre‐condition of democracy. The report states how abuse was not investigated in the Commission, or, if it was, it was investigated too late and too long. Furthermore, the penalties were too lenient. The same is true of the conclusions on the matter now in hand, which was the basis for refusing discharge. The Commission resigned, but from the point of view of the Commission this resignation was very obviously an advantageous decision. I read in the ‘European Voice" that on their resignation, the Commissioners would receive a three year severance package. If they had been dismissed such an arrangement would not have been made. Commissioner Van Miert had thus suggested that they should resign as one body, thus guaranteeing the implementation of the severance package. In my opinion, it is wrong and unfair that they should be rewarded so well for the work they have done so badly.</p>

<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, throughout the debate about reforming the Commission, I have supported clear principles, and today these same principles once again form the basis of the amendments I have tabled to the Elles, Brinkhorst and Fabra Vallés reports.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, responsibility must be seen to be accepted. That is why the accounts for the 1996 financial year cannot be closed straight away, for example while there has been no reimbursement in areas where nepotism has been established.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the greater the transparency, the less need there is for controls. As long as the Commission still does not respect Parliament"s right to have access to information, the institutions cannot trust each other, and nor will they win the increased trust of the general public. That also applies to a Commission which has resigned.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Parliament"s criticism of the Commission will only be credible in the eyes of the general public if it adopts the same critical attitude towards itself. As long as documents in connection with proceedings against SEL are withheld from me and the Committee on Budgetary Control, discharge should not be granted for Parliament either. I hope I have made it clear that where discharge is concerned, my group is guided by its own principles, which indeed apply to both the Commission and Parliament.</p>

<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Liikanen, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. ‐</span> Mr President, firstly I should like to reply to Mr Elles' questions concerning the preparation of the different documents which were based on the programme which Mr Santer presented in January and which was referred to in many of the discharge reports. The preparatory work on the code was very far advanced by mid‐March. The code of conduct for officials was ready in the Commission but it went to negotiations with the staff organisations. It is available from the Commission. Also, the first drafts of the code of conduct between the cabinets and services have been drawn up and, as far as the nominations are concerned, that was under way. At the same time, the Commission has taken a decision to freeze all nominations of A1 and A2 level until the new Commission is in place. A decision was taken to freeze all the nominations until the code of conduct was accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as far as the Staff Regulations reform is concerned, there was the famous David Williamson report which was presented last autumn. The technical consensus‐seeking negotiations with the staff organisation have started and also the first political consensus‐seeking sessions have taken place. The position of the Commission was that the Williamson reform serves as a good basis except in one area. The Commission would like to have more open options for disciplinary procedures. There was a clear opinion that more independent disciplinary procedures should be envisaged. At the moment disciplinary procedures are always internal. They are based on joint opinions. There has also been a strong opinion that outside, independent, experienced people with experience in judicial procedures should be involved. That part has been most open.</p>
<p class="contents">All this work has been done and now it is for the next Commission to take the political initiatives. It will help the new Commission that this preparatory work has been done and the new Commission can make a political choice on the codes of conduct. If the Committee on Budgetary Control in the meetings in June wants to hear about these preparations I will be available on a personal basis. It has been understood by the Commission that to take clear and strictly political decisions which tie the hands of the new Commission at a time when the Commission has resigned is a question which must be considered on a case‐by‐case basis.</p>
<p class="contents">For the rest, the Commission takes note that the discharge procedure for 1996 is about to reach its conclusion on the institutional legal side which is being discussed here today. I refer to discussions which we had earlier here on the basis of the Fayot report. As to the discharge reports for 1997, the Commission takes note of the fact that the Committee on Budgetary Control has proposed postponement of the discharge on institutional grounds connected with the Commission's resignation. On the guidelines contained in the working document annexed to the motion for resolution, it will therefore be for the next Commission to take the appropriate initiatives. Mr Bösch put a question here but the Commission has replied to those issues. I am sure that Mr Brinkhorst can confirm that we have had a great number of discussions and meetings. We have also sent documents to the Committee on Budgetary Control even though it is difficult for the Commission to make a political commitment for the next Commission. That is excluded. However, if you want to clarify things, I am available as are other Commissioners as along as we are in office. Our responsibility is to work, but undertaking a commitment to changes of a political character is for the next Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also stress that the guidelines presented by the rapporteur are part of a major reform movement. The Commission has started reforms of SEM 2000, sound financial management. I disagree to an extent with Mr Giansily. There have been achievements as well as failures. It is very important to analyse what went well and what went badly in order to progress further with reforms. In the area of the structural funds the new regulations are clearer. The eligibilities for different funds have been agreed. The possibility to use financial correction is there. There have been issues where Parliament and Commission have agreed and there has been progress.</p>
<p class="contents">But there has been a problem, I can admit that when we have taken decisions at political level which are clear and in the right direction, the ability of the Commission to implement the decisions in all its services in the same way has been weak. They have been implemented in some services but not in all. That is the issue the new Commission must pay a lot of attention to. It is important to take the right decisions but it is equally important to have a system to guarantee that all will be implemented to the very end.</p>
<p class="contents">In the MAP 2000 area there have been improvements in decentralisation towards the separate DGs and cutting down the red tape so that all the officials could be directly responsible. Much remains to be done. And the design of the Commission for tomorrow is being prepared for the next Commission. It is very important that the new President has all the elements on the table when he takes his decisions on the portfolios and, in that context, on the structure of the services.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with three major conclusions of the rapporteur. One is that there must be an improved partnership/management of Community actions. It is very important that the Commission and Member States act together and that the rules and responsibilities are clear and are shared and that we know how to correct things if they go badly. We have already made an effort and I am sure we can continue. I was happy to note that the rapporteurs of the Committee on Budgetary Control were at the sessions with the Member States last time. Both sides found it very useful.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the issue of decentralisation and devolution of Commission action especially in the field of external programmes is extremely important but we need very strict rules for the delegation of the management of Community policies and that must always be actively pursued. In that context there has been an area where the problems were bigger than expected. For those who came into this House in 1995, I am referring to the area of the external offices which were performing many tasks for the Union. Thanks to cooperation with Parliament we have been able to agree now the budgetary framework so that there must always be budgetary commentary. As you know we have drafted a vademecum on the issues which can be given to external sources and on what rules must be respected. But it is very clear that this work must continue. That has also been discussed in the reports by Mr Elles, Mr Brinkhorst and Mr Bourlanges.</p>
<p class="contents">The third area which is very important is the global reform of financial regulations. There also the first communication has been done. Mr Dell'Alba was the rapporteur. Discussion continues. We are waiting for the financial decision of the Court of Auditors. It is extremely important to try to put all these small reforms in one clear global financial regulation where the roles and responsibilities of each player in the implementation of the budget within the Commission, namely the authorising officer, the financial controller and the accounting officer, will be clearly defined. That is extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it has been a painful year and obviously this will be the last time we have an open debate on the issue. It is extremely important that all of us who care about the future of the Union, care about the good execution of the Community budget, care about the value of the taxpayers' money try to utilise all this to achieve deeper reform which has clear objectives and a strong capacity of implementation which can lead to results. I say that only because I know that in the House there are also people who are very worried and rather disconcerted because of this public debate. It is not the fault of any of us but we must take that into account. We hope that the painful experience of this Commission can be used by the next Commission so that it will strengthen and not weaken the process for reform.</p>

I thank him for the information he gave us on a number of these codes of conduct. However, there is one report which I referred to in my speech which relates to paragraph 7 of the January resolution. In the absence of any Socialist member of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I think I should do it on everyone's behalf. It says: ‘Looks forward to the report of the President of the Commission preparing for the Cologne Summit of the internal reform of the Commission. We plan to hold a major debate in this May session". Could I ask the Commissioner to provide this report when it is available to the new Parliament so that we will have all the information at our disposal.</p>
