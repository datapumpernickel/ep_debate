<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Harbour (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Madam President, it gives me great pleasure tonight to be able to present my report on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market to the House on universal services and users rights relating to electronic communications. This is a further element in what is a most crucial package of legislation that is now being considered by Parliament to create a single regulatory framework for electronic communications. It is so important for the future of the European economy as a whole that we get this package right. It has been a privilege for me to have been able to work for the first time in my parliamentary career here on a major codecision text like this.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a complex text and the procedure for review has also been complex. I would like particularly to thank the rapporteurs of the three committees who provided me with opinions, Mr Papayannakis, Mr Aparicio Sánchez and particularly Mr Caudron, where we worked together under the Hughes procedure and where the amendments that were passed by the Committee on Industry were received by my committee. We did not vote on any of them, they were accepted by us in our report.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the various committees I worked with for providing me with so much support. Indeed, the final text before us has been the result of a lot of work by many people. I am not proposing to accept any further amendments to the text, even though a number have come in rather late in the day from the Socialist Group. I believe we have reached a good agreement on the text and I am not proposing to support any additional amendments in the vote tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say a few things about the text itself. It is a very comprehensive text because it contains four distinct measures. There are the provisions relating to universal service itself, how it should be delivered, how it should be funded in an open and transparent way that does not distort the market place and a whole series of measures on users' rights, including some important new measures reflecting the new technology which is coming our way. It has a number of crucial measures related to market intervention and the ability of Member States to intervene very directly in the market place, and to set retail pricing for example. Finally, it also has some measures related to digital television, particularly a package of obligations related to "must carry" provisions for public service broadcasts.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not have time this evening to go through all of those in detail but I would like to observe that I have specifically asked the Commission in the text that we will receive at second reading to mark out more clearly those four aspects of the text. At the moment it is quite complex, particularly the market intervention measures which are regarded as transitory measures by the Commission, a view that I share. They are there for the time in which the market is still being directly regulated, but this whole package envisages a time when the entire market will operate under normal competition aspects. Those transitory measures should be clearly identified because hopefully we will not need them in a few years' time.</p>
<p class="contents">My approach in considering this text has been to give strong support to the strategy behind the directive. The Commission has not sought to enhance significantly the scope of the universal service remit and that is absolutely right. In my work I have sought to clarify the text, to improve it in some aspects, but to be very selective about new provisions. In the area of users' rights it has been important to strike the right balance between a text that will be agreed centrally at European Union level and detailed work that should be done in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Believe me, colleagues, I have had no shortage of people wanting to complicate this text, wanting to add extra provisions. I believe I have the balance right, particularly in the light of the fact that these provisions will apply to the applicant countries, where the technological base from which they start will be much lower than that envisaged at the moment. I am confident that the proposals I put before you tonight are balanced and will stand the test of time. They anticipate technical development. They will be good for consumers because they sustain and develop competition. They provide essential rights for consumers but they will allow a sector that is changing very fast to thrive and develop in the future without unnecessary and complex interference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Some of the amendments contained in our opinion have been incorporated into the text, as he has said. Others, however, have not been accepted, but have been accepted for voting in plenary by Mr Medina Ortega. They are intended to improve the text from the point of view of electronic communications being considered as a general interest service.</p>
<p class="contents">The model of society developed by the Treaties has enshrined the predominance of competition and the market, but the thing that makes us proud of Europe, the thing that makes our social model unique in the world, is the compatibility of these principles with two irrefutable values or circumstances: our high degree of social protection and the strength and breadth of our general interest services.</p>
<p class="contents">People operating a communication network or service on the market are not dealing with any old product, but with services which have a high added value from social and cultural points of view. Their universality and ease of access to them involve principles which affect democracy and human dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Culture’s amendments have several objectives: to further develop the obligation to transmit to electronic communication networks, to impose information and transparency obligations on the companies providing these services, to increase the protection of disabled people, particularly the visually and hearing impaired, as users of these communications and, finally, to separate, from a legislative point of view, infrastructures and content in the audiovisual sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the rapporteur and his group will be generous enough to accept these amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I think that we should not be too optimistic when it comes to competition. Competition fosters – and it is only logical that it should foster – reductions in costs, consumer choice and discrimination depending on the customer's status. We all know the ways of the market. </p>
<p class="contents">That is why, without wishing to embark on general theories, Madam President, Mr Harbour, I should like to say that the series of amendments which we have proposed is designed mainly to protect consumers not from threats from others, but from competitive conditions per se. In other words, we want a universal service which is accessible to all and of the same standard for all. For example, a service which allows everyone to get on to the Internet at the same speed anytime, anywhere, without discriminating between customers depending on where they are. Without discriminating between customers depending on how they want to pay their subscription. We have seen it happen. We have also called for proper consultation with consumer associations when reviewing the conditions under which licences are granted. </p>
<p class="contents">We also want terms in contracts to be simple, familiar, comprehensible and comparable and for this to be compulsory so that customers really can change suppliers. We already have competition. If a customer is to be able to change supplier, he must know in advance of any changes in price for example, so that he can opt out in time. He must be able to keep his telephone number, which the Commission is quite right to propose, and he must be able to change company without incurring charges. Account must also be taken of the need to warn customers about the dangers, for example, of mobile telephones. Customers' rights must be clearly set out somewhere and they must be able to read and use them. </p>
<p class="contents">All this is not intended merely to make the Commission's life difficult, nor do we believe that it should be left up to each individual Member State. We need general principles which specifically protect consumers because that is the way to make better progress here.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I must say, however, that I regret that this text, which is, after all, an integral part of the Telecom package, has been withdrawn from the competency of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, to the benefit of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which, in my view, seems to be becoming an extremely bad habit.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that, even if they are included in the same directive, universal service and consumer protection are two areas which are, admittedly, related and important, but they are different.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumer protection requires guarantees, clarity, simplicity and, above all, therefore, transparency. The amendments voted in committee are a step in this direction. Other amendments could have gone further still, if a majority in the committee had wanted this to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">Universal service is a much wider concept which has many other more complex goals. Universal service requires a definition at a given time, but it also requires the means and mechanisms to ensure its development over time. It of course requires planned funding. Lastly, I would reiterate that it is independent of the legal nature of the company that provides it.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcomed the European Commission’s text, but I remain convinced of the need for a framework directive for all European universal services.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish with a personal comment, by reaffirming that universal service cannot and should not be what could be called the fading leftovers of liberalisation. It has, for me and for my colleagues, a value and an objective in itself, which is one of the conditions of social cohesion, which provided the basis of our Europe. It should, therefore, be desired, defined, affirmed and chosen on its own merits. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Velzen (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to thank Mr Harbour on his sterling report, but also Mr Caudron on his excellent contribution on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, this is a report of extreme significance, for it regulates the rights of citizens in relation to the duties of companies. Certainly at a time when everything develops so fast, it is of crucial importance to have such a report. Allow me to make five observations.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, it is essential to have a level playing field. That is why, of course, Article 13 is of major importance. It stipulates quite emphatically how alternative funding can be found for universal services if they were to create an additional burden for operators. I believe that to be of crucial importance, certainly in cases where operators are in dire financial straits, as many currently are.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Article 16 is important and, on that score, I am completely dumbfounded at the fact that the Socialist Group should table an amendment to confine the whole issue of number portability to the fixed network. If there is one thing which has promoted, and has to promote, competition among operators, it is, of course, the possibility of number portability, and I would make an urgent appeal to our fellow MEPs not to adopt that amendment under any circumstances. That would seem wrong to me. I wholeheartedly agree that interventions in the market or in the price structure, such as we carried out with regard to international roaming, must form an exception. But if you, the citizen, have to pay over the odds and are not given any information about prices for international roaming, which allows payment to be made between one country and another, then the only option available is legislation. And it is precisely because we have threatened legislation that operators are now prepared to drop their prices, and that is, I believe, what this is ultimately all about.</p>
<p class="contents">A third fundamental point is caller location information where 112, our European emergency number, is concerned. That is important, but I should urge you to mainly use this location information for relevant cases. The protection of privacy is of crucial importance, and I am pleased, therefore, that that has been provided for in Article 22.</p>
<p class="contents">You may be surprised to find someone from the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy raising the following point, namely that, from the point of view of cultural policy, Article 26, with its ‘must carry’ obligations, is of major importance. But once again, I am astounded that our Socialist group would like to extend that ‘must carry’ obligation to cover commercial broadcasters. In my view, that is a complete misunderstanding, and I truly hope that they are prepared to retract that amendment, for we must reserve the ‘must carry’ obligation for public broadcasters only.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Madam President, you and I enjoy watching all kinds of programmes, also using set top boxes, and if we then fall victim to, let us say, one large consortium, then it is no longer possible to do that. Set top boxes must be compatible with each other. A common interface is required for that purpose. This is legislated for excellently in Annex 6. We must pledge our support for this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nothing could be further from the truth. We fully accept a process which contains of good number of progressive perspectives. One of them is that, when a sector is liberalised, the greater the number of companies amongst which the market is distributed, the more the concentration of economic power is being limited, and this is a progressive objective which these benches fully accept.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot agree with monopolies which offer goods and services of lower quality and at higher prices than if they were offered within a competitive system. But, while public monopolies are unsatisfactory, private ones are totally unacceptable and unbearable. We therefore believe that services must be provided within a competitive system, but that that system must be subject to corrections in order to prevent a situation where the only people who have access to the services are those who, as a result of their levels of income or place of residence, are viable for the providers of the service, leaving out those who cannot pay the price for the services however basic they may be, or those who live in areas which are not viable for companies.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore necessary to impose universal service obligations, but naturally the discussion on the size and conditions of the universal service will have a high ideological content. The Right insists, and always in defence of companies, that these universal service obligations should be as limited as possible. The progressives must insist that the greatest number of services must reach all the citizens at accessible prices. These considerations are reflected in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Its rapporteur, Mr Harbour, has done a magnificent job, but I must not forget that he is a member of a political group whose positions seem more orientated towards defending the interests of companies than towards the operation of the market. That is to say that, to use the American terminology, he belongs to a political group which is more ‘pro-business’ than ‘pro-market’. It is true that the report has positive aspects, and we are going to support those positive aspects without any doubt, but in other respects, it contains proposals which we find unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">To remove the reference, as in Amendment No 2 of the report, to the concern about the dominant position which the former monopolies maintain within liberalisation processes, seems unacceptable to us; to remove the Commission’s phrase that lays done that services must be provided at an accessible price, does not seem acceptable. Neither does it seem to us acceptable to vote against, as happened in committee and which has been said will happen now, certain amendments which propose, for example, that a change in telephone service provider should not mean a change in the customer’s number and that, if it does happen, it should be done without cost to the user and at a more than accessible cost. It seems as though, in these respects, the desire is to hinder competition and the appearance of new economic operators, in other words to defend the interests of monopolies and that is something we cannot agree with. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In most cases I believe we have succeeded in creating a certain cohesion between the committees and also with the previous reports on the same issue which were also mentioned earlier. I also believe that the rapporteurs have tried to achieve such cohesion, particularly with regard to creating a bridge between the previously approved reports and this report. That is excellent, but on certain points I believe we have not succeeded in this yet. This is particularly true with regard to the TV standards which appear in some of the amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also fought a great deal over the term “co-regulation”<span class="italic">.</span> In this case I find it easier to and will accept what the rapporteur has put forward, but it does not sound quite as good translated into many of the other languages. Co-regulation meaning an authority which in the final instance oversees the balance is acceptable, but some of the translations of the report talk loosely about common provisions, and that is not as descriptive.</p>
<p class="contents">Balance in this report is important. I believe that, when voting tomorrow, we should ensure that there is a balance in the provisions between, on the one hand, ‘must carry’ obligations and financial compensation for those required to follow them and, on the other hand, compensation for the telecommunications companies which have obligations under the other regulations. I also believe that tomorrow we must ensure that there is still a comprehensive directory service, something which we can only achieve if there is a financial benefit to operating such a service. We must not forget this when voting tomorrow or in the coming Directive on the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report is excellent and, by tabling constructive proposals and also holding intensive negotiations with colleagues, Mr Harbour has really managed to strike a good compromise, which met with broad support in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Single Market and will – I am sure – also find favour tomorrow in the plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">Much has already been said about the content of the directive and I only wish to focus on what I feel to be the essential points. The first is the scope of the universal service obligations. Firstly, the fact that the universal service is to include simple but not broadband Internet connections is to be welcomed. In some parts of the Community it will not be possible for the infrastructure required for broadband connections to be rolled out or upgraded to the necessary technical standard in the next few years. In addition, in some places there is still insufficient demand for these kinds of connections. It should in the first instance therefore be left to market forces to offer these connections without there being any regulatory pressure to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Competition on the local network and thus in providing Internet access has been made possible by the regulation on unbundling the local loop. It is now important to apply this directive consistently as quickly as possible so that a sufficient number of broadband connections can be made available quickly and at a reasonable price. The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has tabled one amendment, Amendment No 9 on Article 4a), which unfortunately, in my view, takes us in the wrong direction, namely by including high-speed Internet access in the universal service obligations after all. It states that the Member States should prescribe particular data transfer rates based on the latest technology. For the reasons which I have stated I feel that this amendment goes too far.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the inclusion in the directive of a future European regional code '3883'. I believe that this is an information measure which will also promote our internal market. I also welcome the provisions on number portability in the mobile sector. This too has already been mentioned by Mr van Velzen. I can only hope that Mr Harbour's report meets with broad support tomorrow. All in all it is a really good piece of work! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We all know the importance of the entire Telecom package for the future competitiveness of Europe. This report demonstrates a keen understanding of these fast-moving markets, their technologies and how and where they are developing. In addition to this demonstrated technical and commercial know-how, Mr Harbour has included a number of amendments on behalf of an often-overlooked group of users in our society, the disabled.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased to see the amendments put forward in relation to the disabled, which the Commission warmly welcomes. The Commission shares the view that universal service is not just about getting geographical coverage right. It is also about ensuring coverage of all groups in our society, including people with disabilities and special needs. We are now working on a recommendation on web accessibility guidelines, which will help disabled people to use Internet services.</p>
<p class="contents">Due to limited time I will try to focus today on a few issues of special importance. First, on the scope of universal service: the Commission supports the Harbour report on the proposed scope of universal service. The key issues here, for example regular review of the scope of universal service and the financing of net costs using transparent and competitively neutral mechanisms, accord with the Commission's own approach to these key principles.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 4, 6, 8, 10 and 15 are genuine improvements. However, the Commission cannot agree to add "effective" to "Internet access" as proposed in Amendment No 9, because of varying interpretations which could lead to market distortions. The Commission welcomes amendments for the chapter dealing with the regulation of SMP designated operators, but cannot support provision such as "at least annually imposed on NRAs" in Amendment No 24. The framework must remain flexible and NRAs must be in a position to react to market conditions as they develop.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission finds persuasive the innovations suggested put forward in Amendment No 26 that persistent market failure to satisfy requirements of users and consumers may be addressed by retail remedies if wholesale remedies are ineffective. However, the Commission would link any intervention to the general objectives of the package rather than to well-justified complaints.</p>
<p class="contents">With respect to the chapter on users' interests and rights, the Commission welcomes the support for the provisions of the directive and endorses Amendment No 31 to require operators to include prevailing tariffs in contracts with subscribers. With respect to the implementation of a European telephone and numbering space, the Commission has already carried out a study. We found that a European regional code would allow companies conducting business throughout Europe to use a single telephone number. This would introduce competition between operators as well as create pan-European services and markets. Therefore the Commission cannot support the proposed Amendment No 31, which makes the implementation of ETNS subject to completion of a further study.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals in Mr Harbour's report relating to "must carry" provisions reflect the importance and sensitivity of the area. His suggestion for remuneration of network operators is a welcome balance of the interests at stake. However, the Commission believes that other amendments to this article duplicate other provisions in the package and are therefore not necessary. Amendments Nos 45 and 46 are welcome in principle.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, therefore, as far as amendments in the report are concerned, the Commission can accept in full Amendments Nos 4, 6, 8, 10, 15 to 20, 22, 27, 29, 36, 38, 39, 46, 49, 53, 57, 58 and 60. The Commission can accept in part or in principle Amendments Nos 2, 5, 7, 9, 11 to 14, 18, 21, 23 to 26, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 37, 41, 42, 44 to 47, 50, 52 and 54. The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 3, 34, 40, 43, 48, 51, 55, 56, 69, 61 and 62.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the fact that the Commission accepts 50 of the 62 amendments in full, in part or in principle, indicates a most agreeable parallelism of thinking between Parliament and the Commission, which is reflected in the discussions that are taking place in the Council. This convergence between the three institutions follows from a sense of a shared vision and commitment to which the European Parliament has an opportunity to make an important contribution in its vote tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
