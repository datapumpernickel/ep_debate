<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Aparicio Sánchez (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, we are dealing with one of the few, but nevertheless serious, problems resulting from the removal of our internal borders.</p>
<p class="contents">From the very beginnings of the single market, it was established that the free movement of goods had to be compatible with the protection of the artistic and cultural heritage of each of the Member States. It was, and continues to be, within the competence of each State to define its national heritage and its protection. Since 1 January 1993, however, measures became necessary, such as the harmonisation of requirements for sales and the uniformity of the control procedure for extra-community exportation. To this end, in 1992 and 1993, the Regulation and the directive which we are discussing today were adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">The philosophy of the Regulation can be summed up as follows: each Member State is obliged to control the exportation not only of its own heritage, but also of any heritage which is located within its territory, but which originates in one of the other fourteen Member States. Nine years later, except for a few minor amendments, the text and the approach of 1992 are still in force. It must also be pointed out that the problem of the illegal trafficking in cultural goods and its impunity are more serious than ever. The forecasts are even more pessimistic if we bear in mind that, when the rich heritage of the candidate countries is incorporated into the single market, the current legislation may still be in force despite being shown to be insufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1993, the Commission committed itself to monitoring the progress and the degree of effectiveness of the two regulations in force every three years, as well as proposing corrections where necessary. It tried to do so in 1996, but, when it requested information from the Member States, it received no response from the majority of them. In some cases, the delays in incorporating the Regulation into the legislation of each Member State were scandalous; in four cases the Regulation did not enter into force until 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in 1998 the Commission obtained certain data, opinions and experiences and, on that basis, has produced the report which we are discussing today. It is a purely informative communication, that is, it does not contain any proposals for new measures or amendments of the current ones. It is a voluntary report, which lacks sufficient data to make objective measurements and also, in my opinion, lacks the criteria necessary to propose any improvement to the current procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">We can, however, draw certain conclusions. Some of these conclusions, though fewer in number, are positive, such as the fact that the very existence of the two regulations has been sufficient to increase the awareness of administrations and public opinion and to bring about extrajudicial solutions. There are, however, a larger number of negative conclusions which can be summed up in one: the general practice is still that a Member State authorising the export of a cultural item does not check with its State of origin whether the item’s provenance is legal or illegal.</p>
<p class="contents">In the majority of cases, the administrations of the Member States have not properly cooperated with each other, in particular the police and customs departments, that is to say, the units that are part of the Interior Ministries. It is here that I would like to point out one of the cruxes of the problem; on the one hand, these units of the administration have other border priorities relating to organised crime. On the other hand, this cooperation falls under the third pillar, which is so difficult to achieve, as you well know.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the situation is serious in two respects; the increase in the intra-community clandestine trade in historical and cultural goods, and also the increase in their exportation beyond our external borders. The explosion in the activities of organised networks, the unrestricted proliferation of antique dealers without sufficient professional standing or control and the practically universal impunity of the people responsible, either because the crime has been only recently defined, just a year ago, or because the mere allegation that a buyer has acted in good faith is sufficient cause for a case not to continue,<span class="bold"> </span>are some of the reasons for this serious situation.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, our report expresses the view that it is crucial that legislation is improved and that a qualitative change is made to the Community’s approach. We believe that this is a cultural issue, which the Council must deal with through the bodies responsible for culture in each Member State. These are crimes or failings which must be detected by Community operational units specialised in artistic and historical heritage; the Commissioner for Culture, rather than any of her colleagues, must make a diagnosis and propose a way of dealing with the situation. All of this should go hand in hand with the integration of the various teams of the departments responsible for trade, the police and customs, but, I repeat, this must be done from a predominantly cultural point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">Our report also identifies certain difficulties, such as the existence of an unknown heritage in the possession of institutions such as the church. We propose certain specific measures considered to be very urgent – such as the use of the Internet to publish pictures and details of stolen objects – and we request that the Commission, under the direction of the Commissioner for Culture, produce a Green Paper describing the current situation, assess the effects of the Regulation and the directive, carry out a comparative study of the definition of heritage in each Member State and, above all, propose specific measures to improve the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner for Culture, whom I have admired for years, has for some time adopted a lively and decisive approach to future tasks while remaining cautious and indecisive about the present ones. She has sufficient capacity and resources for this not to be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Through this report, Parliament seeks to express its anguish and alarm about the current situation which, despite being the result of the removal of internal borders, which is so beneficial in all other respects, is not being sufficiently addressed by the Community authorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are unable to make such an assessment largely because of the delays in Member States transposing these instruments into their national legislation. All the indications suggest that, in the meantime, the illegal trafficking of cultural objects has increased, particularly of those that find their way onto the art market. The whole situation calls for the Member States to obey the principle of strictly respecting the integrity of national cultural heritage and the whole situation calls for the measures designed to prevent and eradicate this form of trafficking to be made more effective.</p>
<p class="contents">We also face other problems, however. Even here, within the very confines of this Parliament, not long ago, we all had the opportunity to see an exhibition of the wanton destruction of the cultural heritage of Cyprus, which was perpetrated under the complacent gaze of the authorities of a country which also happens to be a candidate for the Union’s enlargement. The measures now being proposed can, therefore, make a valuable contribution to improving the legal instruments available and the system as a whole. Every nation’s cultural heritage is of undeniable importance to national identity and to European identity. There must be closer police and judicial cooperation in this field between Member States. We must make it more difficult for cultural objects that have been stolen or unlawfully removed to move around freely. In this field, cooperation and the coordination of actions between the Commissioners responsible for culture, for the internal market, and for justice and home affairs are of fundamental importance.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission ought to issue a communication on the illegal trafficking and trade in these goods, with an assessment of the current situation in this field, listing and identifying objects that are continuing to be recovered and studying the consequences of the way in which the 1992 Regulation and the 1993 directive have been implemented. The communication should assess the foreseeable effects of the candidate countries joining the Union and recommend a multilingual form with details of goods that have been unlawfully removed. It should also conduct a public information and awareness-raising campaign, making all the necessary information available on the Internet. If we are to achieve all of this, Mr President, I feel that we must vote in favour of this report, and once again, I congratulate Mr Aparício Sánchez for having taken the initiative with it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And since time immemorial, the travelling man has – legally or illegally – taken souvenirs from those other cultures. We only need to think of Lord Elgin or Napoleon, who both believed in the ‘finders keepers’ rule of thumb. It is evident that the cultural heritage of the country visited suffered damaged as a result of that.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore to be welcomed that Europe is curtailing this practice. The important role which trade is playing in this cannot be underestimated. If we consider that art thefts from museums and churches are often by order of traders, we should indeed devote attention to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Although, in my opinion, this is mainly a matter for the Member States themselves, coordination at European level in all fields is essential, particularly so, as Mr Aparicio Sánchez pointed out, in the field of police and customs cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">A first step to prevent theft is to draw up an inventory and detailed description, possibly with photographs, of the artefacts which belong to public and private establishments. But also the requirement to provide cultural goods with a certificate of origin has a preventive effect.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that a universally accessible digital network at European level would be priceless. I should therefore like to express the hope that this will be set up as soon as possible, especially in the light of the stolen goods and of those which have not yet been found. We should not only restrict our catchment area to Europe, but should involve the entire world via the United Nations. That is, after all, quite possible via the Internet. We need to start in Europe, however. I would therefore call on the Member States not just to protect their own cultural heritage, but also that of other countries. I am pleased to say that the Netherlands has already taken a step in the right direction. I hope that the other countries will follow suit, so that the illegal trade in cultural goods can be brought to a close. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The debate in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport on the implementation of the regulation on the export of cultural goods and the directive on the return of cultural objects unlawfully removed from the territory of a Member State was wide-ranging and exhaustive, although the absence of a direct personal contribution by the Commissioner responsible for culture, Mrs Viviane Reding, was regretted, as were the gaps and inconsistencies in the report from the Directorate-General for Education and Culture.</p>
<p class="contents">The bitter truth is that the defence of this immense cultural and artistic heritage has been left to the individual national authorities – in my country to one brave <span class="italic">carabinieri</span> officer, General Conforti – without any incisive coordination that really works being in place at Community level, thereby at least applying the general principles of the UNESCO Convention. All this is in the face of a massive offensive by organised crime and the shadiest traffic, like money laundering and tax evasion. All this damages the serious and honest antiques trade, a victim of unbridled competition from speculators and the great trading combines.</p>
<p class="contents">To mention only my own country, Italy, immensely valuable works of art have been stolen, illegally exported or simply vanished: <span class="italic">The Nativity</span> by Michelangelo Merisi di Caravaggio, <span class="italic">La Madonna dell'Orto</span> by Giovanni Bellini, <span class="italic">Ecce Homo</span> by Antonello Da Messina, at least two masterpieces by Cima da Conegliano. Meanwhile the plunder of the archaeological heritage advances at an increasingly rapid pace. These days you only have to go to the Sablon quarter in Brussels to see, impudently displayed in shop windows, dozens of splendid second century oil amphorae, marble bas-reliefs recovered last year – actually last September – from the bottom of the sea by alleged scientific expeditions, almost always from the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">For these and other pressing reasons Mr Aparicio’s report represents a historic change in direction for Union cultural policy. This first thoughtful document will hopefully be followed by others and acceptance, if belated, of responsibility by the Council and the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As far as I can see, the main reason for this is because the capitalist system commercialises culture and because huge interests, which may appear to be legal or which are downright illegal, are therefore involved in the sale of stolen cultural objects.</p>
<p class="contents">Culture is a collective creation by society and no one has the right to appropriate a work of art and deprive society as a whole of it, let alone remove it from the environment in which it was created. It is not just a question of illegal trading; renowned auction houses are also involved and many a reputable museum owes its wealth to illegally acquired exhibits. Greece is one of the countries whose cultural heritage has been plundered on a massive scale and a host of works now reside in English, French, German and other museums, as well as in private collections. I should like to take this opportunity to ask the Commission if, having merely indicated its serious intentions, it now plans to take action to facilitate the return of the Parthenon marbles.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by Mr Aparicio Sánchez contains numerous positive comments and interesting proposals and I should like to congratulate him on that. I should also like to thank Mr Graça Moura for raising the problem of cultural objects plundered from occupied Cyprus. However, I fear that, because of the commercialisation which I referred to earlier, it will be impossible to make any significant headway with this problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission is devoting particular attention to this question in the enlargement negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">I note that the motion for a resolution calls on the Commission to examine the problem of illegal trade in cultural objects. I would point out that this goes beyond the scope of the Commission's reports on the application of Regulation No 3911/92 and Directive 93/7. I would, however, underline the multidisciplinary and inter-pillar nature of this problem, as highlighted by Parliament's Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs. In view of the powers attributed to the Community by the Treaties there is a danger that focusing attention on the cultural policy aspects of the problem of illegal trade in cultural objects may reduce the effectiveness of any Community action in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to assure Members that the Commission has already taken measures aimed at improving administrative cooperation between the Member States with a view to protecting their cultural heritage. Those measures are drawn up by the Advisory Committee on Cultural Goods and the Forum on the Prevention of Organised Crime. The Commission would like to ask Parliament to give its backing to those moves. As a collegiate body, the Commission will continue to examine the problem of illegal trade in cultural objects and accord it the priority which it deserves.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, in answer to the question put by Mr Alyssandrakis a little while ago, the Commission has constantly launched initiatives aimed at contributing to the fight against illegal trade in cultural objects. Perhaps I may give some examples of initiatives launched by the Commission. Firstly, financing of an Internet website project allowing information on cultural objects to be exchanged. Secondly, the launch of a study on the traceability of cultural objects. Thirdly, the creation of a working party within the Advisory Committee on Cultural Goods whose task is to draw up guidelines for administrative cooperation. Fourthly, and lastly, an examination of the problem of cultural objects under the Forum for the Prevention of Organised Crime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
