<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Winberg,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, honourable Members, today’s debate shows that the European Parliament, the Commission and the Swedish Presidency have a common interest in animal welfare and animal ethics. It also provides us with the opportunity to exchange thoughts on these important matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Man’s relationship with animals is increasingly a matter of discussion in today’s society. During my time as a member of the EU’s Council of Agriculture Ministers it has been clear that matters concerning animal welfare have come up on the agenda with increasing frequency and taken up increasing amounts of time. In this respect, the year 1995 is not like the year 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">When we discuss issues concerning animals, however, in recent times these have mostly been concerned with diseased animals and with occurrences within agriculture that have had catastrophic consequences. The issues concerning the protection of animals dealt with by the Council, primarily concern technical provisions, but I believe that it is high time that we also discussed matters of principle concerning man’s relationship with animals and how animals are to be treated. The ethical aspects of livestock farming must guide our decisions in the area of agricultural policy to a greater extent in future. Ethics is not about labelling things as good or evil, or good or bad; rather they are a tool to help us as we make difficult choices. We must dare to ask why animals are regarded merely as products in some contexts and why we allow animals to be treated poorly in certain cases.</p>
<p class="contents">When unsatisfactory states of affairs are revealed, we tend to react with demands for stricter provisions, but it is not possible to prevent the cruel treatment of animals through legislation or control measures alone. How animals are treated is also a matter of people’s attitudes and values.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Council of Ministers in May, I took the initiative for a debate on ethical aspects of livestock farming. The purpose of the debate was to highlight the matter at a level of principle, starting from the fact that, in the future too, we will have a society in which animals are in the service of humans.</p>
<p class="contents">All the Member States felt that the ethical aspects of livestock farming are important. These must be integrated to a greater extent into future decisions concerning livestock farming. The Member States pointed out that animals are sentient beings that must be treated well. Several countries stated that knowledge concerning animals and animals’ needs, as well as training measures for people who deal with animals in their everyday work, are of crucial importance.</p>
<p class="contents">My conclusions from the debate included the fact that animals are sentient creatures with an intrinsic value. They must be treated with respect, and consideration is to be given to their health and welfare. In my conclusion, I pointed out that the statements made must not just remain fine words; rather, they commit us to take practical measures in respect of the protection of animals.</p>
<p class="contents">The scientific conference, Food Chain 2001 was held in line with the Swedish Presidency’s emphasis on a holistic view of the food chain. I think it is important to note one of the conference’s conclusions in particular. Improved animal welfare which guarantees healthier animals often has crucial economic benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">At the informal meeting of ministers in Östersund in April, the EU’s future agricultural and food policy was discussed. Here, it was clear that changes must take place. In their contributions, many of my colleagues highlighted the crisis that agriculture is currently in. Mad cow disease, foot-and-mouth disease and unacceptable animal transport are just some of the matters that make the need for change clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Another of Sweden’s conferences during its presidency was Ethics and Animal Welfare 2001, to which Parliament was also invited. The aim of this conference was to bring together representatives of industry, animal welfare organisations and public authorities and to conduct a discussion on animal welfare and ethics.</p>
<p class="contents">The participants agreed that the exchange of experiences and an open, continuous dialogue are a prerequisite for improvements in the area of animal welfare. For example, it is important that provisions that are adopted are also implemented in practice. I am pleased that discussions on animal welfare and animal ethics have been conducted in so many contexts, but in order for improvements to animal welfare to come about, tighter provisions are also needed in many areas.</p>
<p class="contents">During the period of Sweden’s Presidency, the Council has dealt with several proposals in the area of animal welfare. One of these dossiers is the Commission’s report on animal welfare during transport. The report was presented and discussed at the Council of Ministers in January. One of the report’s conclusions is that every Member State must earmark further resources for the implementation of existing provisions. It is also important for the Commission to come up with concrete proposals for improvements in the legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency is also working to bring about adoption of a resolution on animal transport at the Council of Ministers in June, that is, next week. The purpose is to ask the Commission to provide suggestions for provisions to improve animal transport. Naturally, the Presidency needs great support if such a resolution is to be decided on.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the most urgent matter is for the provisions that already exist to really be implemented in the Member States, but that is still not happening. This is shown, in particular, by film and video footage that has been recorded in various countries, often in secret. Such footage clearly shows that provisions are not being implemented and are also a source of disgust on the part of our citizens. It is important to implement the common decisions that we have taken in each country. It is also important that the periods for which animals are transported are shortened and that export subsidies for live animals are abolished.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately enough, during the latter part of this spring the Commission submitted a proposal within this area. The proposal concerns improved ventilation in the road vehicles used for transporting animals for over eight hours. The Presidency has initiated discussion of the proposal in the Council’s working party.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency has worked very intensively on the Commission’s proposal for a new directive on the welfare of pigs. As you already know, the proposal involves improved conditions for pigs. We very much appreciate the rapporteur’s, Mr Busk’s, work on this proposal. I believe it is very important that we in the Council are able to arrive at a decision on improvements in pig keeping as quickly as possible. This of course requires an opinion from the European Parliament. I therefore hope for your understanding of our desire for a fast procedure. This should allow a clear signal to be given by both the European Parliament and the Council that we see animal welfare as a priority matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Detailed provisions are important, but they must be based on a fundamental position concerning our responsibility for animals. Within the EU, we have decided that we must take animals’ needs into consideration. This is clear, for example, from the Treaty of Amsterdam, which establishes that animals are sentient beings and that animal welfare is to be taken into consideration in the drawing up and implementation of the Community’s policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, we will continue to show consideration for animals because our legislation demands it. Moreover, it is my personal conviction that our human dignity bids us accept our responsibility for animals. Man is in a unique and special position and therefore also has a moral responsibility to show consideration for animals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<tr><td width="70" align="center" valign="top"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="photoframe_blue"><tr><td><img alt="MPphoto" src="/doceo/data/img/photo_generic.gif" align="right" width="50" height="63" /></td></tr></table> </td><td width="5"> </td><td align="left" valign="top">

It is a measure of the importance attached to animal welfare by the Presidency, and by Minister Winberg in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">The past several months have seen a sharp rise in interest in animal welfare issues at Community level. There have been several discussions on the issue in the Agriculture Council and a major conference was also organised in Stockholm late last month, as Mrs Winberg has just told you. I was pleased to represent the Commission in all these debates and discussions. Of course, this presidency is not yet over and there will be further opportunities to address animal welfare issues.</p>
<p class="contents">This Wednesday I will address Parliament's intergroup on animal welfare for the second time this year. In a little over a week there will be a further discussion in the Agriculture Council. This discussion is intended to lead to a resolution helping to set the future policy agenda. A cynic might argue that all this discussion amounts to hot air and is camouflage for a lack of real progress. I am satisfied that this is not the case.</p>
<p class="contents">These discussions are genuinely worthwhile. It is important to build up a solid consensus on the need for more action on animal welfare. We should not forget that until very recently animal welfare was a neglected issue on the Community agenda. This is changing fast. Moreover, I am convinced that it will become even more important in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason for the higher profile of this issue is not hard to see. People care deeply about the treatment of animals. They are increasingly intolerant of mistreatment of animals and insistent that our systems of agricultural production must ensure better treatment of animals. These sentiments are also feeding into the market. There is a much greater demand from consumers for information on the conditions in which animals are reared. The public demand more and better information on products and foodstuffs: how and where they are produced, under what conditions and with what ingredients. It makes good business sense to respond to these demands.</p>
<p class="contents">I recently received on my desk the results of a reputable survey on consumer attitudes towards key animal welfare issues. The survey results include the interesting information that up to 85% of consumers are prepared to pay more for food produced in accordance with the highest welfare standards. Even if these results are not fully reflected by consumers in their shopping behaviour, there is a clear potential for the market to give greater prominence to higher standards as a competitive tool. These trends will continue to grow and there is no reason why they cannot be accommodated. We already have a system in the EU for the identification and traceability of each individual cow. There is clear potential to use this system to provide information on other important factors, such as the breed of the animal concerned and the conditions in which it was reared.</p>
<p class="contents">This argument should also be considered in relation to the global dimension of the trade in animals and animal products. It is essential to share our knowledge on animal welfare with countries outside the European Union and to create a consistent approach towards the issue. In this context, I was pleased to learn that the World Organisation for Animal Health, the OIE, adopted last week at its general session a five-year work programme that includes animal welfare questions. This is the first time that a broad-based international forum, like the OIE, has decided to address this question. The Commission strongly supports this initiative and intends to actively participate in this future development.</p>
<p class="contents">This House is, of course, very aware of these concerns. There is an ever-increasing postbag of letters from the general public and from Members of Parliament on animal welfare issues. A disproportionate number of written and oral questions to the Commission are also on this subject. It is our duty and responsibility to reflect on these concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, however, to sound a word of caution on a number of fronts. There are increasing calls for more Community action on animal welfare, but we should be careful that this does not distract attention from the responsibility of all parties to promote higher standards. I spoke at length on this in Stockholm recently. The Commission can ultimately only play a subsidiary role in relation to animal welfare. Certainly, within our area of competence, we must take our responsibilities very seriously. However, Member States continue to have the most important role to play since animal welfare requirements are adopted as minimum standards in European legislation. In addition, Member States are responsible for the day-to-day enforcement of Community legislation in this field. They also have the personnel resources to carry out this role, which the Commission clearly does not have.</p>
<p class="contents">A second qualification relates to the role of farmers and the livestock industry in general. There is a danger of stigmatising the very large number of people who work in farming by associating them with images of mistreatment of animals. This is unfair, untrue and counterproductive. Ultimately, farmers are the persons in closest contact with animals and are the most conscious of their needs and behaviour. The vast majority clearly treat their animals in a good and humane manner. We can either choose to work with the farming community on these issues or risk alienating them. I know where I stand on this: work with the farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to more general issues, I would like to signal some clear Commission orientations. First, animal welfare questions need to be integrated more fully into food policy. I reject the argument that animal welfare has nothing to do with food safety. I insist that it is an issue which should be included in the policy agenda of the European Food Authority. This applies in particular as regards scientific advice and information, which the authority should provide to the Commission on all matters having a direct or indirect impact on consumer health and safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, there is the need for further Community actions. There are a number of important initiatives already before the Council and Parliament, for example the proposal on improved welfare conditions for pigs reared in intensive rearing systems. This proposal includes provision for the abolition of individual sow stalls, a major and legitimate demand of welfare activists. The presidency is very anxious to reach final agreement on this proposal. This, however, requires an opinion from Parliament and I hope that you will be in a position to respond favourably to the request for the urgent adoption of this opinion this week. That would provide a very positive signal of Parliament's own commitment to animal welfare.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a proposal for improved humidity and ventilation systems on trucks transporting animals. The Commission is also awaiting an opinion expected in October from the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare on densities and travelling times. This opinion will help shape our future policy on animal transport, which will be discussed in depth in the Agriculture Council later this month.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, I intend to continue to focus on the global dimension in the issue of animal welfare and animal products, including the World Trade Organisation. There is a common misconception that this is a protectionist agenda. This is unfair. Europe is progressively implementing higher welfare standards. We have a duty and a responsibility to press for recognition of these standards both on purely ethical grounds in recognition of the need for the humane treatment of animals and in recognition of the higher costs which these standards entail for producers and consumers in the European Union. These are legitimate issues which deserve to be discussed on the international stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission will continue to press for improved respect of existing Community legislation. I repeat again my frustration at the repeated reports from my officials of continued non-respect of Community provisions on animal welfare. Equally, the single biggest immediate and practical measure to promote animal welfare would be the strict implementation of existing legislation. This is just a brief outline of a complex and sensitive issue. Thank you for your attention and I look forward to hearing your views on the issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Over the years, it has been the transport of livestock in Europe and overseas which has understandably upset the public most of all. The consumers and the animal rights activists do not understand why there is still a need for it.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the question is not so much 'why' but – quite rightly – 'how'. How are the animals transported? This has been discussed for many years at European level, so it is not a new issue. Commissioner Byrne, I have been a Member of the European Parliament for 12 years, and we have been discussing this issue throughout these 12 years. We have already produced vast quantities of papers and resolutions. Why, then, are we making such slow progress?</p>
<p class="contents">Animal welfare is now given far greater priority, and the focus is no longer solely on costs and competition. In contrast to earlier debates about animal welfare, the agenda increasingly includes ethical issues as well as technical aspects. To use a metaphor: we are all broadly in agreement about the destination of our journey, but the path is very rocky. I say this: through their shopping behaviour, consumers could have made a very significant contribution to setting a new course in the past as well. Prices were a key factor then, and I would argue that the final prices paid by consumers will be a key factor in future too.</p>
<p class="contents">In its report, the Commission emphasises its plans to improve the implementation of existing legislation. I greatly welcome this statement. The licensing of transport companies, transport plans and the Member States' inspection reports must all be coordinated far more effectively, and I completely agree that Community standards should now be introduced for third countries as well. The definitions of the animals' fitness for transport, but also vehicle standards, densities, travelling times and rest periods, etc. must all be brought into line with current scientific knowledge to a far greater extent. I am in favour of animal welfare, and let me assure you that farmers are too. They have been for decades – in their animal husbandry, breeding and transport. Mr Byrne, thank you very much for stating this so clearly today. Let me conclude by saying that what I am opposed to are the different definitions of the animals' wellbeing. Given the great many directives in force, this diverges widely in the Member States. Happy hens in Germany will have to feel different from perky pigs in Holland or contented calves in Denmark. We cannot have that. It leads to distortions of competition, and I really must oppose it, also in the interests of farmers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Community's obligation to take full account of animal welfare requirements within the framework of its agricultural policy is anchored in the Treaty of Amsterdam. The question which now arises in this context is whether this is sufficient for the Community or whether there should be European framework legislation on animal welfare in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, animal welfare is not understood the same way everywhere. Laws are one thing; the actual treatment of, and attitude towards, animals are another. The responsibility for animals as living creatures falls exclusively on humans. For this reason, it is important to start teaching children how to treat animals responsibly when they are still very young. Anyone who goes on to handle animals in the course of their work, who farms them or transports them, must have a certificate proving their suitability and skills.</p>
<p class="contents">Animal welfare also has an impact on farms' competitiveness, however. There will have to be restrictions on livestock farming for economic purposes in future too. Demands for optimum conditions, which often stem from emotional responses, cannot always be translated directly into practice. Viable solutions must be devised. The classification of animals as farm animals, breeding animals and pets is not an arbitrary one, after all. Economic considerations and global competition ultimately compel us to adopt specific conditions of animal husbandry, thus limiting the scope for truly animal-centred livestock farming.</p>
<p class="contents">However, these farming conditions must be shaped in a way which ensures that animals have the maximum scope for natural behaviour. Political decisions on animal welfare can now be based on comprehensive scientific knowledge of the different species. The laws on animal welfare should only be developed and improved with the involvement of those concerned. In a holistic view of animal protection, the animals' natural behaviour and needs should be compatible with environmental concerns and consumer protection, but also with the expectation of profit. Our society's high standards of hygiene must also not be compromised. After all, more consumer protection ultimately leads to better conditions of animal welfare. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Pets are cherished, but cattle is often still treated abominably. Intensive cattle farming has elevated animal abuse to a methodology. The policy is unilaterally focused on cheap production. Animals have degenerated massively into commodities you eat or which earn you money, instead of living creatures with an intrinsic value.</p>
<p class="contents">It is high time that animals were no longer adapted to suit their environment, but the environment to suit the animals. Drastic improvements are required in terms of their accommodation. For example, pigs and calves must be kept in groups and must be given plenty of straw. The castration of pigs, bobtailing and the cutting of teeth must be banned. Laying hens must be kept exclusively in spacious, free-range bird houses. The artificial, fast-track breeding of chicks and turkeys must be discontinued. Cows must regularly be led to pasture again and geese must from now on be spared torture for the sake of their tastefully prepared livers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is sheer madness that pigs are dragged across Europe for the sake of being able to label them ‘Parma’. Long hauls with live cattle must be abolished. In my view, four hours, or 250 km, are the maximum. The inspection of cattle transports must be tightened considerably. International trade should be conducted in meat and not in live animals. Proper slaughterhouses must be set up everywhere, so as to restrict transport. Cattle markets must be abolished.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent disasters may well be the salvation of future animals, but only if we gain the awareness that animals are more than mere production factors. Until such time, animals will suffer, and people will suffer from a lack of civilisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome all the statements concerning this issue of the protection of animals and animal welfare. I would like to thank the Swedish Presidency which, for the first time ever, has succeeded in bringing about a public debate on animal ethics in the Council of Ministers. This is therefore progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Animal ethics is about much more than mere rules. It is about attitudes and knowledge of animals and about how animals must feel well. Nonetheless, it is very important that the legislation and rules of both the EU and, especially, the Member States are followed.</p>
<p class="contents">On 8 March, the Greens held a conference on animal welfare here in Parliament, at which, I am pleased to say, Margareta Winberg was also present. At this conference, it emerged that there is no overall supervision whatsoever of the EU’s animal transport directives, nor any checks on whether they are being observed. Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, animals are being transported the length and breadth of Europe under terrible conditions without anyone intervening. The provisions that exist on the transport of live animals are well known, for example, the limits on time in transport and requirements of veterinary certificates. However, there is no functioning supervisory apparatus.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we have been given an answer from the Commission to the question that I put. The Council too has also stated that the transport of live animals must cease...</p>

This may not always be obvious in the case of people, but in the case of animals, I would say that that is a matter of fact. Welfare for people can even harm animals’ well-being, particularly if we consider the pursuit of profit. However, what is more important to us is that animals should also be accepted as God’s creatures. Without putting them on a par with people, that means that we should be proper stewards. Unfortunately, cattle species in particular have been reduced to production factors in our economy and, let us be honest, the consumer is all too happy to benefit from the low prices which this entails. Legislation on animal welfare is mostly very detailed in certain areas, but lacks a coherent vision. The enforcement of that legislation is, at the same time, a great cause for concern, and it often amounts to nothing but rules on paper. In fact, it is telling that, in a totalitarian regime such as China, the concept of animal welfare does not even exist in the language. We welcome initiatives which considerably restrict the transport of live cattle. It is really beyond me why slaughter cannot take place prior to transport instead of afterwards. In that connection, I consider breaks in the journey to be a stopgap. The maximum period of transport for live animals should make these redundant.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, if we really take the well-being of animals into account, then it will be obvious that agricultural policy cannot merely be based on economic measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was due to European directives which, in principle, prescribe a slaughter policy without vaccination. Ring vaccinations are permitted in exceptional cases but with such far-reaching implications for the exports of the Member States involved that, in practice, that also involves removal. The European Commission recently decided to allow exports of meat from Uruguay back into the EU without guarantees as to whether the meat concerned originated from animals vaccinated against foot-and-mouth. It must be the ultimate in bureaucracy for meat from animals vaccinated against foot-and-mouth from outside the EU to be allowed on the internal market, but for that from within the EU not to be permitted. Now is also a good time for the Council to make drastic changes to legislation on controlling foot-and-mouth, also in the light of unnecessary animal suffering. With the imports from Uruguay, the market argument not to vaccinate against foot-and-mouth has been laid to rest for ever. If the Council takes European farmers and citizens as seriously as the farmers from South America, now is the time for action. I should like to persuade the Commissioner and the Council to repeal the non-vaccination policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to mention a second point, namely the large discrepancies in terms of animal welfare among the Member States. I would concur with the remark made by my colleague, Mrs Keppelhoff, on that point. Animal welfare is still too often an element in the distortion of competition among the Member States. What is also striking is that, in these matters, the Commission’s and Council’s ambition certainly leaves something to be desired. For that reason, Parliament is very likely this week to make the directive on the welfare of pigs stricter but, at the same time, to present an initiative proposal on animal transport in September. It is crucial, in this connection, to consider the role of consumers and the possibility of introducing a green tax system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This seems to me to mark a turning point in how this Parliament debates these matters, because it sets out here a coherent, ethical framework by which we should all subsequently be judged.</p>
<p class="contents">Animals are not merely products, nor are they simply commodities. One of the most appalling things I heard in my own country came from a trader concerning the spread of foot-and-mouth disease: "They are commodities. I take them around. I trade them here, I trade them there." They are not stocks and shares. They are not speculative metals. They are sentient creatures. Because of that I believe, with the Commissioner, that the way in which animals are kept reflects on us morally, but also practically, in that bad conditions for animals affect the health and safety of humans as well. The Food Safety Authority will need to address this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner is right to say that consumers would be prepared to pay more for ‘ethical food’. Another thing they want – but do not always get – is follow-through in the area where animal welfare is promised, but not always delivered. Like everyone else in this House, I hope and expect that the sow stalls proposal will go through on Thursday. It will certainly have our support.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to feel that at the same time we are looking at other issues which, because they are cherished in some Member State or in some particular group or community within the European Union, are shrugged aside. I have seen recently that the Italians have tackled the issue of how <span class="italic">foie gras</span> is produced. Others have begun to raise the issue of the cruelties involved in the breeding of animals for the fur trade. Now we are coming to the point where, in the testing of chemicals, perhaps we ought to have an absolute assurance (and I know Commissioner Byrne has gone some way towards this already) that we will minimise – and I use that word advisedly – the number of animals sacrificed in the validation of chemical testing. Those things seem to me to be enormously important.</p>
<p class="contents">Against such a backdrop we can begin to persuade the WTO that these issues are humanitarian, not protectionist. Then, perhaps, we will able to fashion the means of arriving at a food system in which people matter, but animals matter too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

More specifically, I should like to talk about the transport of live animals. I have asked you a question in this connection. It is clear to me: animals intended for slaughter should not be seen as products. Meat can be transported over long distances; animals cannot. That is my guiding principle.</p>
<p class="contents">You stated that you need to monitor this long-haul transport in the Member States. It is evident that the means are desperately lacking. You responded to me by saying that you have no more than four inspectors at your disposal, that those four inspectors have carried out twelve inspections, only six of which covered animal welfare during transport. That translates into less than five percent of the inspection assignments. You will understand that we are not satisfied with this.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, this has led to results, for two infringement procedures have been instituted against Member States and, in three cases, there was a serious lack of animal welfare during transport. I believe that those figures illustrate adequately that more inspections need to be carried out and that legislation needs to change, but, more than anything, that monitoring must be stepped up in terms of compliance with legislation, so that we can be certain that animals are no longer tortured during transport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my view, some progress has already been made in the past. After all, we have been discussing this issue for a long time, and have addressed problems of animal husbandry, animal breeding and animal welfare on numerous occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">If we examine the process regarding the cage-rearing of hens, for example, we – Parliament and the European Union – have already made significant progress. If I look at consumer behaviour following the debates in recent years, I can already see a change. Nonetheless, I would caution against taking the Commissioner's statement – that 85% of consumers are prepared to pay more for food produced in accordance with the highest standards of animal welfare – at face value. This figure is wrong. If I asked any member of the public: 'Would you be prepared to pay more for animal welfare?', naturally he is going to say: 'Of course I would!' However, when he is at the counter buying his steak, he has a rather different view. Then it is quality and price that count, and nothing else matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, we must try to reconcile the status of animals as a means of production – we have to accept this, it is a fact – and animal welfare concerns. There is no point in lashing out at the food producers and blaming them for everything. The only way forward is to do what the Council has suggested – I think this is very important – namely to concentrate on raising public awareness and fostering sensitivity to animal welfare issues. This is a very important point. This brings us to issues of education and training within the family. In other words, a very wide sphere of activity must be included.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards animal health – an issue which has also been raised today – I am a little doubtful. A healthy animal is not always one which has been reared correctly in optimal animal welfare conditions. Animals can be healthy even without these conditions, as we know from practical experience.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish this House every success in the next few days, also in debating the new directive on the agenda. I hope that this will take us a further step towards better animal welfare in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert asked the very important question – not why, but <span class="italic">how</span>. I still think that we must ask both questions – not only why, but also how. For example, why do we dispatch animals to third countries? Why do we send calves from Sweden to Holland? Clearly there is an answer to these questions. The answer to the first question is that it is profitable, because export subsidies can be paid when animals are sent from the EU to a third country. Young calves are sent from Sweden to Holland, for example, because it is more profitable. In Holland, they are reared by a different method than in Sweden. We must also ask whether all this transportation really has to take place. Fortunately, more and more people are now asking this question, and fortunately more and more of them are also answering ‘no’.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of speakers have mentioned the matter of price. Naturally, we must realise that if we want to have good animal welfare – and if we are to have quality rather than quantity in future agricultural production and policy – then there will be a price to pay. We cannot have the cheapest food in the world and, at the same time, have the best animal welfare and the best environment in the world. Someone has to pay. The question is simply: who? There is also cause to think about this as we gradually draw up a new agricultural policy. Who is to pay for animal welfare? Who is to pay for the countryside? Who is to pay for the wetlands, for biodiversity, and so on?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Kindermann spoke about the responsibility that man has. I share this opinion. We have a special responsibility for these matters precisely due to our status as human beings. We have a special position in respect of animals and it is only we who can accept that responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr van den Bos provided the most far-reaching contribution of any of us here. It is of course easy to put forward all these demands, but we must also remember that it costs money. These things do not come about of their own accord. For example, if we demand that international trade must not be in livestock but in meat, we must also remember that there is a connection with the economic system in agricultural policy. In other words, we would then also have to reject all types of export subsidies for these animals.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Schörling, like several others, spoke about supervision. Allow me to say that we cannot just demand that the Commission or the Council bring about improvements in respect of supervision, for the prime responsibility for supervision lies at national level. I believe that each and every one of us must go home to his or her country and question that country’s supervision, for it is only when a country is not taking care of matters that the Commission steps in. The Commission has a responsibility to ensure that supervision in the various countries is good. It does so through the office in Dublin.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr van Dam spoke of the restrictions on live animals, and I share his opinion. Unfortunately, in the report, animals are defined as commodities. Opinions may differ on this, and I think that we should have a different starting point.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Maat talked about vaccination and exports. Allow me to argue that it is not just because of exports that we have this non-vaccination policy. The main reason is that there is not simply one single vaccine for one type of foot –and mouth disease. The day we find a marker vaccine is the day we will be able to start mass vaccination with a view to prevention. We have not yet got that far, but research is in progress. A conference will be held under the Belgian Presidency, once the crisis is over, to allow us to draw conclusions from the policy that has been conducted in this area. This will then concern not just vaccination but also other aspects which may even have encouraged infection with foot-and-mouth disease. This conference will hopefully be held during the autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Whitehead spoke about the fact that animals are not just products and commodities. In this respect, I refer to my earlier answer – animals are sentient beings. He also addressed the matter of chemicals policy. In this connection, I would remind you of the Commission’s White Paper on this issue, which states, for example, that it is hoped to develop test methods that minimise the number of animals used in animal experiments. I think this is a very good ambition.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Maes spoke about the inspection trips. In this respect, I refer to what I said concerning the responsibility for supervision. This responsibility devolves in the first instance upon the various countries themselves, and then the Commission supervises the countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Schnellhardt gave the example of chickens and said that we had achieved something. Yes, we have achieved something, but there still remains such an incredible amount to do. He does not believe that people are prepared to pay. No, perhaps they are not prepared to pay through higher prices. This takes us back to the relationship between animal welfare and cost. If we want to have good animal welfare and a good environment, it will not come free of charge. We must then also design an economic system that ensures that those who provide good animal welfare and a good environment get paid for it, possibly in a different way than through higher prices.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me once again stress how important it is that the European Parliament produce an opinion in respect of a new directive on pig keeping, and I am very pleased to have Mr Whitehead’s support on this matter. It is important that we are able to make a decision as early as next week, because we have been working on this matter for a long time. Although I understand the concern that exists in respect of the economic consequences, I nonetheless hope that good animal welfare will pay off, and I am really hoping for Parliament’s support in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank you very much for the fact that we were able to have this debate. It is important that it is kept alive so that the matter of man’s relationship with animals develops over time. We have a moral responsibility to treat animals well. Cruelty to animals is unworthy of us humans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, Mrs Winberg, ladies and gentlemen, I thank everybody for their contribution to this debate. I have taken very careful note of the views expressed and will take them into account in the formulation of policy and in bringing forward legislation in due course.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me deal with a number of the individual issues that were raised by many of you. First of all, there is the question of animal transport. This is an issue that will get further attention from the Commission on production of the Scientific Committee's report in October, when consideration will be given to the important issues of density and length of time of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">I should issue a word of caution to those of you who have a strong desire for, or who expect, the elimination of live animal transport. Some people made the point that carcass transport should replace live animal transport. There is a very large trade in animals for breeding purposes and it appears that a very significant percentage of animals are transported for breeding purposes rather than for consumption. I have asked for more details on this but I am told that is the position. This issue will be considered in the light of the advice given to us by the Scientific Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue of considerable concern is the loading and unloading of animals. I expect that the scientists who advise us will also focus on that issue, maybe seeing it as even more important than the length of time over which an animal is transported, so long as the conditions under which the animal is transported are humane. I would remind you that legislation is already in the pipeline on the upgrading of the vehicles used for animal transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Maat then asked me about the consequences for trade arising from the vaccination policy in the foot-and-mouth disease issue. I would repeat what Mrs Winberg said, that there will be a conference on this issue during the Belgian Presidency. It is an issue of particular complexity. We were very clearly advised that the most effective way, certainly in the middle of the crisis, of eliminating further spread is the culling of the animals concerned rather than the use of vaccination. Moreover there are at least seven strains of foot-and-mouth disease, all of which require a separate and distinct vaccination. The vaccination administered is effective for only six to nine months. If we were to vaccinate all of the animals in the European Union that are susceptible to foot-and-mouth disease, this would result in vaccinations being administered to 300 million animals every six months against seven different strains.</p>
<p class="contents">A really successful vaccination policy will only come about when science has developed a form of marker vaccination. That means that where a marker vaccination has been administered, a subsequent test will be able to identify whether an animal is a vaccinated animal instead of an infected animal. At present such a distinction cannot be made once a vaccination has been administered.</p>
<p class="contents">In those circumstances, the other trading blocs in the world are concerned about trading in animals which are vaccinated but may also be infected, thereby increasing the risk of spreading the infection in their own countries. This is not an unreasonable apprehension. We hope that science will develop this market vaccination for us and we will then be in a position to take further strides forward on this issue. This is something that will be discussed, however, and considered in the context of the conference before the end of the year, together with other issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The importation of vaccinated animals and the exportation of meat from animals that are vaccinated is governed by the OIE rules. They apply equally to exportation out of the European Union as they do to importation within the European Union. It is quite incorrect to say that different principles apply or that some discrimination operates against traders within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Maes referred to the resources available and it is correct to say that there are four inspectors involved in this work. They draft reports, which are published of course, and forwarded to me for consideration as to whether infringement proceedings should be initiated or not. The present position is that infringement proceedings have been initiated against Greece and Belgium in relation to the implementation of Directive 91/628. The opening of infringement proceedings against Italy is also being considered. Furthermore, infringement proceedings are under consideration for the following Member States that did not comply with Article 8 of the directive, concerning the transmission to the Commission of their annual inspection report for the year 1999: Austria, the Netherlands and Portugal. I have given instructions to my staff to pay close attention to this issue. If there is a clear and persistent failure to comply with the legislation on animal welfare, infringement proceedings will be initiated against the Member State in question.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of price and standards and taking into account consumer concern for animal welfare, I am happy to tell you that Commissioner Fischler and I have initiated a debate at European Union level, and with all the Member States, on the question of food quality and the part that animal welfare plays in that context. This initiative, draws together a high-level, round table advisory group made up of primary producers, food processors, retailers and consumers. The group intends to visit all the Member States to discuss these issues. We have already visited Sweden, Ireland and Germany and we are scheduled to visit France, Belgium, the United Kingdom and Austria in the very near future.</p>
<p class="contents">We held an Internet chat last Tuesday, where we were asked in excess of 2600 questions in a period of two hours. By any calculation that is an extraordinary response which reflects people's enormous interest in issues relating to food quality and animal welfare. Many of the questions that were raised in that Internet chat were directed at the issue of animal welfare.</p>
<p class="contents">You can see from this that the Commission is taking this issue very seriously, it is constantly on the Commission's agenda and I look forward to bringing further proposals back to Parliament in due course on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish by quoting what Mr Whitehead said in his speech calling for a food system in which 'people matter but animals matter too'. I fully agree. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
