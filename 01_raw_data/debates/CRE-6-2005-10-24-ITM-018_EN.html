<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Johannes Blokland (IND/DEM), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, as rapporteur, I am pleased to be able to say that Parliament has, at second reading, reached agreement with the Council on the waste shipments regulation. Of the 90 amendments that were adopted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the Council has accepted 50 in full; 17 amendments have been replaced by 12 compromise amendments and the other 23 amendments lapsed as a result of the overall compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a result to be proud of, in my view, certainly if we bear in mind the fact that the Commission’s position on the legal basis means that unanimity is required in the Council. I would like to thank the Council, and the British Presidency in particular, for the constructive and pleasant working relationship. That certainly also applies to the shadow rapporteurs of the other groups. I am delighted that a compromise package has been achieved in such a short space of time which enjoys such broad support from the groups.</p>
<p class="contents">In the latter stages of the negotiations, we mainly talked about the two key components, namely the enforcement of the regulation and the dismantling of decommissioned ships, on which two topics I should like to expand.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to enforcement, since 1993, there has been a regulation in place for the shipment of waste. It appears, though, that this regulation is not being observed properly, as many illegal waste shipments take place. You are probably familiar with the example of the British undertaking which, in March of this year, was caught illegally exporting no fewer than 60 sea containers full of rotting and foul-smelling household waste to China. The forged documents indicated that the shipment concerned waste paper recovery. Last week, the British Environmental Agency admitted that following the inspection of sea containers, 75% of the waste shipments appear to be illegal.</p>
<p class="contents">In June 2005, it even transpired in France that 100% of the inspected waste shipments were irregular. From this, we can conclude that, instead of the odd enforcement campaign, clear rules on waste transports are absolutely vital and that they need to be enforced in a structurally sound manner. The compromise package now stipulates that Member States are required to inspect the paperwork and the physical shipments. They must also work in tandem with each other in order to prevent and trace illegal waste shipments.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Council agreed that personnel from the Member States should be deployed permanently in order to ensure that this cooperation actually takes place. With this, arrangements are put in place in order to back up regular physical inspections of the actual shipments. I would like to ask the Commission to continue the enforcement campaigns in the framework of the IMPEL network and to embed them structurally in the organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say a few words about decommissioned ships. All groups have expressed their concern about the way in which these are dismantled. Since, in the next few years, an unusually high number of ships will be decommissioned as a result of single-hulled tankers being phased out, global measures to prevent dumping in places such as Asia are of paramount importance. Sadly, the strict measures taken unilaterally by the European Union to ensure the safe and environmentally-responsible dismantling of ships can be circumvented simply by, at the end of a ship’s life, changing the flag over to that of a country outside the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the ILO and IMO must set to work in order to draft compulsory conditions that provide an effective solution to the problem of decommissioned ships. The Council has declared it will extend the capacity for dismantling ships in the European Union. Moreover, the Council has pledged its 100% commitment to concluding the previously mentioned global agreement on the dismantling of ships.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I have a great deal of sympathy for a number of amendments by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, as rapporteur, I must advise against their adoption in the light of the agreement that has been reached with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to make an urgent appeal to the Commission not to resort to legal action again on account of the legal basis. I do not believe that a legal battle between the European institutions would benefit the environment; it would hamper the progress of the implementation of this regulation. I hope that the Commission also realises that the review of this directive serves a greater purpose and I am relying on the support of the Commissioner for the Environment, Mr Dimas, in this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One of the main objectives of the proposed new regulation on shipments of waste is to ensure that the European Union aligns with international requirements for shipments of waste, both at OECD and United Nations level, in other words with the Basel Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">The other main objective is to address the problems which arise during the application and administrative management of and the imposition of compliance with the existing regulation. Consequently, the new regulation also seeks to contribute to greater clarity and better lawmaking on shipments of waste.</p>
<p class="contents">The relevant discussions in the Council were held during the Italian and Irish Presidencies. At first reading, the Commission amended the proposal and approved 43 of the 103 amendments proposed by the European Parliament in full, in part or in principle. The Council's common position incorporated 41 of the amendments of the European Parliament. The common position is an important step forwards, as far as improving the clarity of the regulation and its provisions is concerned, in keeping always with the objectives set.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out that our aim is to close this particular dossier as quickly as possible. We need this new regulation in order to improve the clarity and application of the rules governing shipments of waste and in order to achieve compliance with the European Union's international commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission did not accept the common position as regards three specific issues, which it reasoned in a statement through an announcement to the European Parliament on 1 July 2005. These issues are the legal basis for the regulation, the objections of the Member States on shipments of waste intended for recovery and a provision on the exemption of animal by-products from the scope of the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety voted in favour of 90 amendments to the common position. The Commission considers that 74 of these are acceptable in full or in principle, but is unable to accept 16 of the amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Maintaining the internal market is a question of fundamental importance to the Commission. Today, waste for recovery is moved freely between the Member States, provided that it adheres to strict environmental protection rules and the principle of proportionality.</p>
<p class="contents">A robust European recycling market helps to reduce the environmental impact caused by the use of natural resources. The free movement of waste for recovery has already been established in the existing regulation on shipments of waste, the provisions of the Treaty of the European Communities on the free movement of goods and the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities.</p>
<p class="contents">The changes which the Council's common position proposes would create serious obstacles to the internal recycling market and are not acceptable to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 35 might prevent possible problems on the internal market. It makes provision for maximum deadlines for formulating objections to shipments of waste for recovery on the basis of national standards. Such objections can only be raised up to the day on which specific Community legislation enters into force and no later than four years after the present regulation enters into force. If the proposed amendment is approved, it will address the concerns expressed by the Commission about the recycling market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on the great effort he has made, which has enabled us to achieve certain compromise amendments which have been accepted by the majority of the political groups, and this is going to enable us to reach an agreement at second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I would like to point out that though we have accepted the compromise amendments, we have certain reservations with regard to the change of legal basis. We preferred the Commission’s proposal, which did not eliminate the legal basis of international trade policy, Article 133. Whether we like it or not, waste is merchandise, and that is how we must treat it. Furthermore, more than 50% of the text relates to the transport of waste outside of the European Union. That does not prevent us from also taking account of the issue of the environment, since that is a very important issue. Neither do we agree on removing our proposal on tacit consent. I believe that we must give the administrations reasonable time to respond to requests for shipments of waste or, otherwise, to apply what is known as ‘administrative silence’ or ‘tacit consent’.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has expressed its concern about the problem of ships which are exported for scrapping and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is pleased that the Council is going to make a statement indicating that it is the Member States with a voice in the International Maritime Organisation that must promote the adoption of rules at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that my political group cannot accept any of the amendments presented by the Verts/ALE Group and, in particular, the one which refers to animal by-products. We already have a regulation that deals with them and that, furthermore, is much stricter than this regulation; we cannot therefore increase the bureaucracy gratuitously.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say to the European Commission that, within the framework of better legislation, it is important, in a future modification of the framework Directive on waste, to revise all of the definitions, such as that of recycling, for example. We cannot carry on relying on the judgments of the Court of Justice in order to interpret your own directives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Large quantities are needed to make the processing of waste worthwhile and a certain quantity is needed in order to process it profitably. As a result, waste markets have started to transcend borders and that is why common rules are desperately needed.</p>
<p class="contents">The first question is: what legal basis we choose? As I see it, it is clear that what matters most here is the protection of the environment. It is not the intention to strengthen the internal market, and I am pleased that the Council has adopted Parliament’s opinion. I am also pleased that the Council recognises that there is a problem with the dismantling of ships. It would be all too easy to abandon ships for scrapping in countries where the environmental rules do not amount to much.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unfortunate that waste processing is still a sector that is, right or wrongly, known for its illegal practices. In the interest of the waste sector, illegal practices must be tackled. Waste processing is a normal and respected activity, and of vital importance to society, the economy and the environment. We should therefore treat it with the utmost care, and while Member States must stand united in banning illegal transports and practices, there is, of course, nothing to be gained from raising the bar too high.</p>
<p class="contents">No complex procedures are needed for minor waste shipments, such as waste that originates during travel. Moreover, it must be possible for entrepreneurs, in the framework of manufacturer responsibility, to recover components without having to negotiate a mountain of paperwork first. On this we can all readily agree. The Socialist Group in the European Parliament supports the compromise package that was tabled by Mr Blokland and we will not in any event be backing the amendments of the Group of the Greens/European Free alliance on animal waste.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there are still many areas in the waste sector that lack clarity. European legislation is still fragmented. We need framework legislation that promotes waste prevention, reuse and recycling. Legislation that gives clear guidelines to entrepreneurs and spells out the long-term goals. Legislation that also provides clear definitions and, above all, promotes innovation in all the Member States. Legislation that will also promote employment in the waste sector, for we need that as a matter of urgency. Let us hope that the proposals for framework legislation will not be too long in coming. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That, I can assure you, is not very conducive to engaging in long debates, especially since the House – understandably so – is almost empty. I will therefore confine myself to making the following brief comments and I hope I will not be testing your patience too much.</p>
<p class="contents">A regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on shipments of waste is a very important piece of legislation which is much needed and is, unfortunately, long overdue. The subject-matter is always controversial: it is very often in the public eye and is close to the heart of the ordinary citizen because it matters so much. Consequently, it is the paramount responsibility of Parliament, the Council and the Commission to get things right.</p>
<p class="contents">It is noteworthy that the European Parliament has put a lot of effort into working through and streamlining this regulation. This is evident from the fact that, at first reading, the European Parliament adopted no less than 103 amendments, and, on this occasion, 90 amendments have been adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.</p>
<p class="contents">In dealing with the Council’s common position, the rapporteur of this recommendation for second reading, Mr Blokland, has shown much wisdom and determination, for which he is to be congratulated and supported. In my view, the most important item in the common position and recommendation for second reading is the choice of environment as the single legal base, thus highlighting that the main aim of the Council is the environment, not – as some wanted and tried hard to achieve – the enhancement of trade in waste material. This is what I am hoping for, and I would like to add my voice to those who urged the Commission not to challenge this in court.</p>
<p class="contents">A point of difference with the Council has been the total exclusion of animal by-products from the scope of the regulation. I feel this is unjustified. I agree with the rapporteur that animal by-product waste should be included in order to ensure that such waste is shipped in an environmentally and hygienically correct and responsible fashion.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I, along with most members of the Committee on the Environment, I am sure, hope that the Commission will facilitate this regulation by coming forward in due course with sensible and stringent proposals on the waste framework directive and with a strategy on waste prevention and recycling. I also hope, as the rapporteur just mentioned, that ways will be found to deal effectively with the ever-present problem of application and implementation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For example, waste should only be shipped where truly necessary and unfortunately the proposed regulation is not as strong as it should be on this.</p>
<p class="contents">A particularly important case here is that of persistent organic pollutants. The regulation implementing the Stockholm Convention does not deal with a shipment of POPs as or contained in waste, so the waste shipment regulation urgently needs to do so. This would help to avoid shipments of POPs in waste from countries that could and should deal with the waste themselves. If this provision had been in place two years ago, the export of the so-called ‘ghost fleet’ – dilapidated US navy ships full of PCBs sailing from the US to the UK – could have been stopped on legal grounds. Regrettably, the compromise does not cover this issue. Neither does it properly address dismantling of ships. Large numbers of EU ships will soon need to be scrapped following the recent and welcome decision to accelerate the phase-out of single-hull tankers, but there is a very real danger that they will be dumped on Asian beaches to be dealt with under very poor conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons my Group will be abstaining and not voting in favour of this package. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Obviously, we should also have liked to have got more out of the compromise with the Council. We have chosen not to put our names to it because we should have liked it to have had still more force to it but, at the same time, it is extremely doubtful whether a conciliation really would have been enough in order to achieve a result better than that achieved in these negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the legal base, we definitely want to defend treating these matters as environmental. The aim must be to deal with the serious environmental problems that arise in connection with the trade in waste. We think that it is quite absurd to view dangerous waste as a commodity like any other, and we therefore believe that Article 175 should be the sole legal base.</p>
<p class="contents">In his introduction, the rapporteur discussed the lack of compliance with the existing rules. We can no doubt anticipate the new rules too being broken to some extent. Everything should therefore be done to ensure that they really are complied with. In that respect, the regulations before us could have had more bite to them, but the fact that they do not means that the Commission has that much more responsibility for really ensuring that these rules are implemented in practice. We must hope that you will apply yourselves to this matter instead of bringing the legal base into question.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree that, where the scrapping of ships is concerned, significantly stricter international regulations are required, and that is an issue to which we need to return as quickly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The aim of the directive is primarily to protect the environment, rather than to facilitate trade in waste or to support ‘waste tourism’, whereby waste businesses export waste to countries with the most lenient legal regulations. This directive is of special importance for smaller Member States and, in particular, for new Member States that often lack the resources and facilities for handling dangerous waste. We must prevent them from becoming “dumpsites” for larger states. What is needed is the harmonisation of rules governing the interstate transport of waste, because waste knows no borders, and in case of accidents or disasters it can be dangerous not only for the country of final destination, but also for the transit country. It is equally important to require the consent of the country of destination and to apply a system of notification in writing. I believe that we need strict, clear and transparent rules that will enable control and monitoring of the types and locations of waste. The country of destination must be notified in writing of the transport of waste in sufficient time to be able to decide whether it will accept the waste or not. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are, however, a number of things in this proposal to which I would like to return. Not only is the proposal that waste law should also cover animal by-products lacking in any kind of logic, but it is also dangerous. Regulation 1774/2002/EC already contains stringent rules on animal by-products; it is a <span class="italic">lex speciali</span>s prescribing in very precise form the manner in which animal by-products are to be collected, transported, processed and used, specifying, for example, the way in which vehicles and containers are to be disinfected and cleaned. That makes this regulation more stringent than the legislation on waste. As is required in the Council’s Common Position, animal by-products must generally be excluded for the sake of legal clarity.</p>
<p class="contents">This attempt at including them is also dangerous. The fact is that we overlooked something in Regulation 1774/2002/EC. One of the exceptions provided for in it is that dead animals may also be buried as waste. One consequence of that was that officialdom, in several places, banned animal cemeteries and required people to bury their dead animals – covered as they were by waste legislation – in landfill sites. The fact is that this sort of confusion is quite unacceptable, and so it is vitally important that this should be removed from this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I have just a couple more points on shipment. A compromise has, to be sure, been reached, and we have yet to see how it can be implemented, but, before it is, we must ensure that waste management is not removed from the internal market and that the shipment of waste is not excluded from it. To do so would be wrong. One consequence of it that we must prevent – and this is my second point – is something for which there may be some enthusiasm in some countries, namely waste management becoming, again, something for municipalities to deal with, thereby using their own plant to the utmost and preventing waste from being shipped. Rules must be enacted to prevent such a thing. If they are, the compromise will be a good one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, as has been said, the Verts/ALE Group has tabled amendments that reflect our position on a number of specific issues that we needed to reiterate.</p>
<p class="contents">Waste, and particularly hazardous waste, should only be transported where there is no alternative; the legislation has to be effective and enforceable to that end. Waste should include all types of waste, including animal by-products, and we should be very clear as to our definition of waste ships. As other Members have already said, since the EU decided to phase out single hull tankers, this issue has become more important. We know that we do not have the capacity within the EU to treat the waste ships ourselves, but it is urgent that we stop the dismantling of European ships in Asia under terrible social and environmental conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">We already have international agreements governing aspects of waste policy. It is very important that there be consistency between those agreements and new European legislation so that the very highest standards are adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The more developed countries’ inability to recycle has also produced paradoxical situations of economic dependence on certain resources. One example is ferrous metals. It first happened in relation to eastern Europe and then in relation to developing countries. These countries have learnt to create new wealth from the waste, although often at the expense of serious harm to the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Blokland report is – quite rightly – concerned about the environmental soundness of transporting waste, which is an operation that cannot and must not be managed according to free trade principles.

<p class="contents">The report marks a step forwards in limiting, if not eliminating, environmental fraud; in improving notification of the hazards of transported waste; in improving environmentally sound disposal processes; and in upholding the principle of the sovereignty of individual countries, guaranteeing each one the right to accept waste or not. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The latter was adopted by Parliament, the Commission and the Council in 2001, and aims to ensure that the best possible legislation is produced and that the regulations adopted are beneficial and clear. In my opinion, however, the draft report contains superfluous provisions that impose unnecessary restrictions on this sector of the economy and hinder its development, instead of improving the transport of waste.</p>
<p class="contents">This is yet another example of overregulation and the production of legislation that fails to take account of the actual state of affairs. In order to limit the movement of waste, the rapporteur has proposed banning the export of any waste that can be dealt with at the point of its generation. It would be impossible for the new Member States to implement this provision, since it is hardly likely that thousands of new plants would be built at locations where waste is stored and generated.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in favour of unrestricted trade in waste within the common market. Some of the provisions that have been drafted are evidence of a worrying trend, since they bear the hallmarks of overregulation and unnecessary legislative duplication. Relevant examples of this include the addition of ships and aeroplanes to the list of hazardous wastes, and the ban on the export of ships and aircraft intended for scrap. I would note that such issues are regulated under conventions adopted by the International Maritime Organisation and the International Civil Aviation Organisation. Both the Member States and the European Union are signatories to these conventions.</p>
<p class="contents">I also fail to understand why it is necessary to tighten up regulations on the export of household waste. Once again, this issue is regulated under the 1999 Landfill Directive. The same applies to trade in animal by-products, which is covered by the Veterinary Directive currently in force.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the regulations should be harmonised and made more detailed in the light of international conventions. This proposal should not serve as an excuse to lay down new standards and to move the goalposts where environmental protection is concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission was very pleased to see the importance which the European Parliament’s Committee on the Environment attaches to the environmental consequences of end-of-life ships and ship recycling and we fully share the concerns expressed by the committee. However, the proposed amendments would, in our view, not be the right way forward for the following reasons. Work is currently being done to address these issues within the fora of the International Maritime Organization, the International Labour Organization and the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Waste. Progress has been made within the IMO towards an international agreement on the subject. It would therefore be appropriate to agree at international level on the solutions to these important problems before changing our internal European Union regulation. On the other hand, we would support a recital referring to the work of the relevant international fora, in line with the Council’s conclusions on ship dismantling of 24 June 2005. We could therefore fully support the compromise proposal on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, there are a number of amendments concerning further restrictions on the free movement of waste for recovery which would, in the Commission’s view, not correspond to the objective of creating clearer and better regulation. The Commission, on this basis, could not accept the proposed amendments 4, 27, 30, 31, 33, 37, 54, 56 and 68. The Commission maintains its statement with regard to Article 12(1)(c) in the common position to which Amendment 31 is linked. However, we could support the compromise proposal on other points.</p>
<p class="contents">The question has been raised of coherence between the waste shipment regulation and the waste framework directive, which is now coming up for review. We can confirm that we will ensure that full coherence is maintained between this regulation and the planned revision of the waste framework directive and, of course, we will ensure consistency with regard to definitions in the thematic strategy on waste.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to animal by-products, the Commission’s proposal fulfils the same environmental objectives as Amendment 91. Our objective is to ensure that the necessary environmental safeguards are in place for the shipment of animal by-products. Therefore, our proposal says that the stricter of the two regulations should apply. However, the Commission does not want both regulations to apply at the same time to the same shipment and therefore we cannot accept Amendment 91.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I am pleased to say that the Commission can accept 87 of the 113 proposed amendments, fully or in principle. These proposed amendments include strengthening the enforcement of the regulation, clarification of its provisions and further alignment with the Basel Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">I will provide Parliament’s Secretariat with a complete list of the Commission’s positions on the amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
