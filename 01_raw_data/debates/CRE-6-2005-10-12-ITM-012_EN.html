<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Douglas Alexander, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, this morning and this summer has seen an unprecedented level of irregular migration across the Mediterranean into the European Union. The tragic loss of life of those drowned at sea and those seeking to cross the European Union’s borders illegally has sharply brought into focus the problems we face in managing migration flows and tackling illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">Although attention is focused on the recent events at the Spanish-Moroccan border in Ceuta and Melilla, Malta and the Italian island of Lampedusa have also faced serious problems in recent months. The Member States that border the Mediterranean suffer a disproportionate burden in providing support for those in need of international protection whilst at the same time being responsible for intercepting and returning illegal immigrants who have no right to enter the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Dealing with these issues in a firm but fair way which meets our international commitments is a shared concern for the European Union. Member States must shoulder this burden together. I do not propose in the course of our debate this afternoon to comment on the specific issues in Spain, Italy or Malta. The Commission sent a technical mission to Ceuta and Melilla earlier this week and is reporting on its findings to the Justice and Home Affairs Council today. I am sure that Commissioner Figeľ will speak in more detail on these matters in a moment or two.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that we realise that these events are the symptoms of a wider problem which requires a long-term solution. In recent years the European Union has made substantial progress in adopting common minimum standards in asylum and immigration legislation and in working together on joint border operations now in the framework of the new European Border Agency, Frontex. However, this has clearly not been enough. To respond to regular migration requires us to work more effectively with countries outside the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is right that the European Union is seeking to engage its collective weight to enhance cooperation on migration with source and transit countries. The Commission and Member States have made substantial technical and financial support available to third countries to help improve their management of migration flows. This is happening through European Union funded programmes and through bilateral projects. There are real outcomes such as strengthened border controls and improved capacity to manage migration, including to protect refugees and displaced persons. In addition, the European Union has stepped up the pace of its negotiation of readmission agreements, with an agreement now finalised with Russia, an important transit country, and negotiations ongoing with Morocco. This work needs to continue.</p>
<p class="contents">Last month, Justice and Interior Ministers discussed migration issues with North Africa and Africa as a whole at their informal Council in Newcastle. They gave a strong endorsement to deeper European Union engagement. This is a priority for the UK Presidency and we will pursue a genuine partnership with Africa on migration, including through EuroMed and the African Union. An important example is the European Union’s current work to enhance migration cooperation with Libya on border management and asylum protection. The June Council described this as ‘urgent and essential to avoid humanitarian disasters and prevent further loss of life’. Since then there has been joint training with Libya on border guards and work on improving on search and rescue techniques.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally important is cooperation with Morocco, which has signed up to a joint paper with the Spanish and French setting out measures to combat illegal immigration, including early warning and aid for victims of trafficking. Ideas from this paper will be taken forward at the EU-EuroMed Summit in November.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the European Union must work together with countries of origin and transit to build capacity for refugee protection in these regions. Here we are making concrete progress. The Justice and Home Affairs Council and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees are today discussing the implementation of regional protection programmes. These regional protection programmes are designed to create the conditions for people to resettle and integrate closer to their regions of origin, or in countries that they transit through.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s policy on migration and asylum needs to be carefully balanced and indeed carefully considered. Migration is a complex issue and issues of border control, illegal immigration and the protection of refugees should not be confused. However, public support for managed migration and the welfare of migrants themselves depends on firm action against illegal immigration and the organised crime that all too often supports it. That is why the UK Presidency feels it is important to push ahead with European Union cooperation with third countries to avoid further human tragedies in the Mediterranean and to establish managed migration that works in the interests of the European Union and indeed of its neighbours. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ján Figeľ, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, today is a special day. This morning we had a meeting of the two Commissions – the European Union Commission and the African Union Commission – and this issue was part of the complex agenda and strategy discussed between these two important organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission recalls that since the Tampere European Council in 1999, the European Union approach towards migration and asylum issues has been a balanced one. On the one hand it protects and enhances the right of those who reside lawfully or are in need of international protection, and on the other side it combats abuse and fights illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">The Hague action plan confirmed and strengthened this approach to migration management. The set of measures adopted by the Commission on 1 September in this field bodes well with this approach. A series of measures on integration of third-country nationals has been proposed which aims to improve the rights and status of legal migrants within the European Union. At the same time it adopted a proposal on return which will contribute to a more effective fight against illegal immigration, while preserving full respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">This important course of action will also be accompanied by other initiatives dealing with the external dimension of our policies and the impact they may have on the development and protection capacities of third countries. Later this year the Commission intends to adopt a policy plan on legal migration which will constitute an important further step towards this balanced approach.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent tragic events mentioned by some of you and by Minister Alexander which occurred in the towns of Ceuta and Melilla remind us once again how important it is to find a comprehensive and forward-looking response to migration issues. Failing this, migration may well turn into a humanitarian tragedy, the consequences of which are difficult to predict.</p>
<p class="contents">In the immediate aftermath of these events, Vice-President Frattini has decided to send a technical mission to Morocco and to Spain to get a first-hand assessment of the current migration situation and to explore ways in which the EU might assist the countries concerned in addressing this serious situation.</p>
<p class="contents">At tomorrow’s hearing in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Vice-President Frattini intends to provide more details on the findings of this technical mission. He has asked me to convey to you his sincere apologies for not being able to take part in this important debate today but, as many of you probably know, Vice-President Frattini is today taking part in the Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting in Luxembourg.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that it is urgent to do more to tackle the problem of illegal immigration. Our aim should be to work with all countries concerned with a view to avoiding further loss of life and human suffering. We need to develop a comprehensive approach which includes a variety of instruments ranging from law enforcement to development assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Fences alone are not the answer to this human tragedy. Fences will not stop desperate people from risking their own lives in an attempt to enter the European Union. The Commission fully understands Parliament’s concerns, as clearly indicated in the recent report on the reception conditions of irregular immigrants in Lampedusa.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be stressed that this problem does not concern Italy alone. Recent reports from non-governmental organisations and individual complaints have highlighted that several Member States, not only those particularly affected because of their geographical situation, may face problems in providing adequate standards in the reception of asylum seekers.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the entry into force of the directive on minimum standards for the reception conditions of asylum seekers, which came into force on 6 February this year, the Commission is currently examining the national measures for the transposition of this directive. Vice-President Frattini will provide more information tomorrow about the way in which the Commission intends to proceed on this issue in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware that Parliament also intends to carry out several visits to other reception centres following the visit to Lampedusa. The findings of the European Parliament will be taken into due account in the report to be prepared by the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Mayotte, Malta or Lampedusa, and all over the place, we can see streams of refugees, but the new Member States in the East of the European Union have also recorded constantly increasing numbers of people who have no legal right to be there.</p>
<p class="contents">The only reason why their problem has not been exposed to public view is that the images are less compressed and pack less of a punch. All these images, though, represent human beings with their individual fates, and they put us on the spot. One of the tasks of politicians is to prevent certain abuses from occurring in the first place, and instead to give help as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">What we see at present are the consequences of sins of omission and of action on the basis of false premises. Addressing the symptoms alone is no sort of solution; we also have to face up to the underlying causes. Both now and in the future, we will have a great deal of pressure from migration to cope with; managing the flow of migrants is one of the European Union’s most pressing tasks. Any European immigration policy must have as its objective the management of legal migration, the provision of humanitarian aid in accordance with the Geneva Convention on Refugees and, at the same time, the prevention of illegal migration. It follows that any European immigration rules must guarantee not only the security of our external borders but also the consistent combating of the practice of smuggling and trafficking in people, and a clear returns policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Carting people off into the desert is inhumane and an admission of defeat in the face of all the things we have not yet dealt with. Nor, though, does it help to let a few hundred or a few thousand illegals in Ceuta and Melilla into the EU in the belief that we have thereby solved the problem. According to the UNHCR, there are 4.6 million refugees in Africa. Non-governmental organisations work on the basis of estimates according which 20 000 people are waiting in Morocco.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, unfortunately, no single solution to this; what we need is a package of solutions. The EU must lay down unambiguous rules for migration, while, at the same time, giving more aid to the countries from which migrants come and through which they pass, but it must also be equally consistent in ensuring adherence to the rules applicable to the crossing of our external borders. That will involve not only a consistent policy on return but also the conclusion by the EU of readmission agreements with countries of origin and of transit.</p>
<p class="contents">These are all things that we must resolve together; one cannot always pick out the bits that fit the passing moment and win public approval. This is our task, and we must face up to it!</p>

Moreover, we have all been very alarmed over the last few days by the way in which would-be immigrants have been abandoned in the desert and by the violence to which they have been subjected.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about women and men, often accompanied by children, who have taken the painful decision to leave their countries. They are fleeing extreme poverty, destitution or violence. All that they want is to live in peace and dignity, and our present European asylum and immigration policy has not been able to come up with proper responses. Our asylum policy needs to match our values. I would remind you that respect for human dignity is the subject of the first article of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the proper response to the current challenge lies in European solidarity. It is unacceptable that we should leave countries situated on the borders of Europe to manage these situations on their own. We need to equip ourselves with the resources to combat the forms of destruction threatening the planet: war, terrorism, poverty and under-development, not forgetting those other forms of destruction including contempt for human rights and the growth in intolerance linked to xenophobia and to issues of national and ethnic identity.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us say out loud that, if we have the will and if we use the political tools available to us, we have the ability to help curb the phenomena that now appear most to threaten our human destiny. We already have the answer. There is a close link between consolidating peace and eliminating poverty. Individual financial security is a basic component of culture and peace. Eliminating poverty is basically about developing human resources and distributing them fairly, and it must be accompanied by education. There can be no peace or controlled immigration unless poverty is reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortress Europe does not exist. It is a fantasy. We must understand, and quickly too, that it is necessary to show solidarity with developing countries and that it is necessary to promote peace and prosperity everywhere in the world. That is not a fantasy and it is not utopian. Will is required, as are the resources for giving expression to that will. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many are hungry and weak after their journey through the deserts and mountains of Africa. They struggle against disease, violence and the exploitation of criminal gangs. Now we learn that they are dying at the fences which separate poverty from prosperity, or that they are left in the desert without food and water. Many of us remember such scenes from Bible study. The difference is that this Exodus will not be solved by divine intervention – only by political action.</p>
<p class="contents">Africa is Europe’s backyard: our near neighbourhood. We cannot fence ourselves off from it, closing our doors and our eyes to its social and economic problems. In the words of the poet Thomas Gray, we must not ‘shut the gates of mercy on mankind’.</p>
<p class="contents">The flood tide of migrants along our southern borders is upsetting our cosy calculation that inequality can be sustained without cost. With developing countries, remember this: the hungry vote with their feet. So either we accept their produce and allow their economies to prosper or we accept their migrants.</p>
<p class="contents">Our futures are interdependent. Sustainable economic, social and political development in Africa is a common concern, essential to Europe’s future. We recognised this in 1995, when the Barcelona Process enshrined multilateral relations across the Mediterranean as the new strategic reality. Ten years on, Spain is negotiating a plan with Morocco to tackle immigration and promote cooperation with the countries of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">Partnership is certainly the way forward. However, until Morocco’s border guards stop shooting unarmed refugees; until Morocco stops dumping them near its borders unable to fend for themselves, the European Union cannot, and should not, offer support for these proposals. Most of those affected today are not Moroccan nationals: they are third-country nationals who entered the Union via Morocco and who deserve the protection of our laws.</p>
<p class="contents">Up to now, plans for a European consensus on migration policy have been buried at the bottom of the political inbox. Why? Member States cannot agree on any one approach the European Union suggests. But that does not stop them demanding European action when they face specific immigration problems of their own.</p>
<p class="contents">The problems facing Melilla and Ceuta are not just Spain’s problem: they are Europe’s problem. The challenge in Lampedusa is also Europe’s problem, however much Italy seeks to hide it from visiting MEPs. No wonder the southern countries of the Barcelona Process have run out of patience.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to think bigger and to recognise, as Kofi Annan said, that ‘migrations are necessary’. We need a consensus on economic policy. We need Doha and Hong Kong to bring results to help Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">When Commissioner Louis Michel outlines his strategy for Africa later today, I hope the Member States will heed his message that it is time for a European consensus on development and immigration that respects the values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My group would like to extend heartfelt thanks to the Commission for the prompt despatch of a delegation to the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta. The situation there is indeed a tragic one, and concerns the whole of Europe. I would like to hear from the Commission, though, whether it has also been to take a look at the border region between Morocco and Algeria, which is where a huge number of migrants are being abandoned without food or drink in the desert, in no man’s land.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst the Spanish Foreign Minister is behind the idea of bussing people back to their countries of origin, the big problem is that, very often, they never arrive at their destinations. We in this House cannot refuse to check where people are taken. We owe it to ourselves and to the people of the European Union to know where people are taken and whether people perish in the desert.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to know whether the delegation has looked into the legitimacy of Spain transferring migrants to Morocco. As far as I know, the bilateral readmission agreement only allows Spain to extradite Moroccans to Morocco, not people from Ghana, Liberia or Mali, as is the case here. Is that acceptable? Among those migrants, are there also people who have applied for asylum? Is that being looked into or are we talking about a kind of wholesale deportation? In fact, why did this delegation only contain people who are mainly involved in border control? Did it also comprise human rights experts and did it examine how people are treated by the local authorities?</p>
<p class="contents">Here in the European Union, we are always delighted when people seize opportunities, develop themselves or look for new prospects, but whenever those who do this are people from outside the European Union who try to seize opportunities within it, they are treated as virtual criminals. I share Mr Watson’s view that it is time we looked for a legal migration channel. Have we given any consideration to the kind of people that are involved? It is mainly young men who have learned a trade and who know that there is no future for them in their own countries. We all need to set down to develop a legal migration channel. That would benefit not only the channelling of illegal migration, but also the dynamism of our European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me close by saying that the European project has to do with civilisation – a civilisation that should not be for Europeans alone. It is really high time we rolled up our sleeves and focused, not merely on stricter border controls or tighter rules, but rather on the opportunities we can offer people who desperately want to enter the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Only two days ago, a delegation from our group was able to see for itself the barbaric nature of this place: a militarised border, a terrifying spot that acts as a great divide between hope and death.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a sort of reactionary utopia to think that one can curtail the free movement of men and women with the barbed wire separating two continents. It is a selfish folly to create a physical barrier between prosperous and comfortable Europe and the relentless desperation of those fleeing hunger and war who, instead of being welcomed and assisted, are pelted with the rubber bullets of the Spanish <span class="italic">Guardia Civil </span>and the Moroccan army.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spanish Government bears joint responsibility both for the mass deportations carried out by the Moroccan Government and for the deaths in the desert of dozens of people. On that point, the accusations made by many non-governmental organisations operating in Ceuta and Melilla are serious, and on behalf of my group I call for a committee of enquiry to be set up immediately to find out the truth and who was responsible for what happened in Ceuta and Melilla, as well as to investigate the way in which immigrants are received in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unacceptable in political and legal terms, as well as in ethical and human terms, to have mass expulsions from European territory. The immigrants who have climbed only the first barrier at Melilla, without managing to get over the second, have been expelled from European territory without any kind of recognition, without any attempt to find out their origin and without any check as to whether they might have been entitled to refugee status.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s conduct with regard to what has happened is unacceptable: confining itself to preaching the protection of human rights, it is behaving like the three monkeys: it does not see, it does not hear, and it does not speak about the many violations committed by the Member States. Spain has acted as Italy did when it carried out mass deportations from Lampedusa to Libya, with immigrants being abandoned in the desert as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">It is deplorable that the Council is talking today about enhanced cooperation with Libya when it should be demanding that Libya ratify the Geneva Convention. All this, however, is being swept under the carpet. The Lampedusa and Libya incident, which was considered to be a highly serious irregularity, is now becoming usual practice. This Parliament, which condemned Italy and its government for the criminal act of deportation to Libya, must now act consistently, which is the reason why we are calling on the groups which voted with us for the resolution on Lampedusa to now draw up a resolution condemning the events in Ceuta and Melilla.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot accept a principle whereby Europe grants the rights guaranteed by international and Community treaties only to the strongest and luckiest immigrants who have succeeded in climbing over the second barrier as well, since such rights should not be governed by a natural selection mechanism. That would lead to Europe becoming – as Thomas Hobbes said – a state of nature. The right to be received should be an inalienable right. A decent and humane reception should be provided at the Melilla processing camp, which would, unfortunately, be in contrast to the reception provided on Lampedusa. We were able to ascertain – as confirmed by an investigative report by the biggest Italian weekly paper – that human rights are being systematically violated on Lampedusa.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that it is not possible to build Europe with barriers and barbed wire: what we need to do, instead, is to try to open the borders to ensure that Europe has a future and a hope of success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All the left does is talk about human rights, without proposing the steps that need to be adopted to combat those that traffic in illegal immigrants, uprooting millions of people from their own countries. That is what we would like to hear from anyone who upholds human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Lampedusa has been spoken of as if it were Guantánamo. That is simply ridiculous and, in view of the fact that I am one of the group of MEPs that went to Lampedusa, I can confirm that I personally heard someone say: ‘It is too clean, there is something not right here’, because the reception centres in other parts of Europe are all much dirtier and more disorganised.</p>
<p class="contents">We should therefore give credit to the Italian Government – which is spending tens of billions of taxpayers’ money – for what it is doing on Lampedusa, where medical assistance is provided 24 hours a day, in contrast to the provision for European citizens. It is shameful that certain newspapers are trying to besmirch the work of Italian volunteers and the <span class="italic">carabinieri</span>, who should be held up as a model for the whole of Europe for the way in which they conduct themselves on Lampedusa and on the sea aiding illegal immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what the gentlemen of the left ought to ascertain, instead of pretending to be unaware of what the Zapatero government is doing, when in fact it is firing on illegal immigrants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will ask Mr Watson, instead, to verify his information before talking about the conduct of the Italian Government, so that he can avoid talking rubbish in this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, Mr President, in the light of recent events in Ceuta and Melilla, I hope that all the Member States are finally becoming fully aware of the fact that illegal immigration is a European problem and that rigorous and concerted action on the immigration issue cannot be put off any longer, even for a second.</p>
<p class="contents">I note with pleasure that the Commission, with a view to reinforcing the European area of freedom, security and justice, intends to allocate, for the 2007-2013 period, significant resources for the management of migratory flows, laying down specific measures to combat immigration and promote integration. I hope that, with the sums allocated for the strengthening of the external borders and for the creation of a European fund for refugees and another for those who are repatriated, an assessment will also be made of the possibility of upgrading reception centres along the model of the Lampedusa centre, which has been unfairly attacked by the left.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately I do not have the time to dwell on what Mr Zapatero has done in recent days, but it is true to say that, with a few rare exceptions, the left has not expressed itself on this subject with the same vehemence.</p>
<p class="contents">Italy, which is already spending exorbitant amounts on repatriating illegal immigrants, can no longer bear the burdens and costs of these waves of immigration by itself. EU funding is needed to upgrade and set up new centres and to foster cooperation with the countries of origin, which is the most effective way to avoid cases such as Lampedusa, which is too often forced to tackle such severe overcrowding that it is almost impossible to manage.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, and this is my final point, we should give our warm thanks to those who work at the Lampedusa centre – civilians, the forces of law and order, the police, the <span class="italic">carabinieri</span>, religious workers and volunteers – for the humaneness and professionalism they display and the sacrifices they make every day.</p>
<p class="contents">We should appreciate the fact, however, and for this I would like to thank the President, that Parliament has been willing to dedicate this time – which was not programmed – to such an important and sensitive topic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is laughable, actually, that Louis Michel, like a number of other Commission spokespersons, thinks and says that a policy of limited legal immigration could solve the problems. It is not because we receive a few dozen, a few hundred or even a few thousand doctors or engineers that the immigration of unskilled people from Developing World countries will drop off. Quite the contrary, in fact, we must move in the direction of transparent policy, with illegality not rewarded but resulting immediately in forced return to the countries of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">Our refugee policy should be based on three pillars: firstly, the reception and processing of asylum applications not by us, but only in the countries or the regions of origin; secondly, the compulsory readmission of bogus asylum seekers to the countries of origin, if necessary on the pain of loss of development aid, and thirdly, the complete overhaul of development cooperation, because development cooperation should no longer help potentates to stack up billions of dollars in their Swiss bank accounts.</p>

We are facing an horrendous crisis that neither this Parliament nor the European Union can ignore. We are calling for more communitisation of all migration issues and a global and broad view of issues such as integration, asylum, legal immigration, illegal immigration and international protection.</p>
<p class="contents">We are facing a crisis of management, a complete failure on the part of the Spanish Government. What is the immediate cause? There are several: mass regularisation, the ‘call effect’. We are facing a humanitarian crisis, a flagrant violation of human rights, a violation of Spanish and Community borders. The army, mistakenly at the border, humiliated at the border, with no preparation and no ROAS. Overflowing internment centres, overflowing social services (I would like to warmly applaud the NGOs and the governments of the cities of Ceuta and Melilla). Moral crisis: a democratic government that is complacent and submissive towards another country that does not respect human rights (a new statistic: 67% of Spaniards say that the government is too tolerant with Morocco). Crisis of responsibility: nobody is taking responsibility for the tragedy. Confusion, premeditation, lack of information and transparency, double attitudes and double language: first they are allowed to come and allowed to mount an assault on the border, then they shoot at them, displace them and abandon them to their fate in the desert; we do not know where they go and we do not know where they are taken. The use of the tragedy as a bargaining chip: they are sending us this message: ‘if we want to stop it, we can do so, but you must pay and you must look the other way and, what is more, you must not criticise’. Mr Solana is right: there must be no aid without commitment, without honest cooperation, without respect for others, without respect for human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the solution? It is difficult, but there are a few of them: more communitisation, more information, more demands, more external borders agency, more cooperation, more common aid, more common controls, repatriations with respect for human rights and the identification and sanctioning of untrustworthy countries. Morocco must respect human rights, offer credibility and trust and use the aid possible: otherwise the necessary neighbourliness will not be possible. And a final comment, Mr Catania: the Spanish delegation in the Group of the European Peoples’ Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports your proposal to create a committee of inquiry.</p>

<p class="contents">What we are witnessing at the moment is a situation that demonstrates that we are facing a drama of biblical proportions, because, as Mrs Klamt has said ― and I believe she is right ― there are more than four million displaced people in Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">We have GPS systems that show the precision of bombings; we could be looking at what is currently happening in the Sahara, in the Sahel, where, as a result of the drought, of famines, of locusts, of the destruction of crops that we protect, hundreds of thousands of people are on the move: this is the biblical drama that we must deal with. There is therefore no place for the lamentations of a former Director-General of Police who, right here today, is owning up to his failure, his frustration and his lack of patriotism.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are proposing in a very concrete and direct form has also been proposed by the British Presidency: to take a step forward with regard to Africa. This means — I believe that the Commission has approved it today — a Marshall Plan for Africa which takes account of people’s right to live in dignified conditions. What we cannot do is pass our problems on to our neighbour.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday in Rabat, Minister Moratinos and Minister Benaissa made an appeal to the European Union to which I believe we must respond: we are calling for a conference with the European Union, with the European and African countries affected, with the United Nations and with the Organisation of African States, in order to deal with this problem and, as the Presidency-in-Office of the Council has said, in order to jointly manage migratory flows in a humane fashion.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the solution we must support. We have the support of Thabo Mbeki and of Kofi Annan; we need the support of the European Union; let us see whether we can achieve it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What we are now experiencing was accurately described and predicted more than a full 35 years ago by the think-tank known as the Club of Rome and by its leader, Mr Aurelio Peccei, who said that the South would undoubtedly make its way north.</p>
<p class="contents">There can be no effective and lasting policy on a purely national basis. The odd attempt at prevention or occasional measures to promote security and respect for human life are not enough. The moment has therefore come for making policy on migratory flows an urgent European priority. We therefore propose setting up a conference involving European, African and Mediterranean countries. This could be held in association with, or even under the joint authority of, the UN and the European Union. The conference should develop an emergency Marshall-style plan at UN and EU levels and in relation to the following two areas.</p>
<p class="contents">With famine, health issues and the protection of human life in mind, we need firstly to provide ourselves with the resources for dealing humanely with the refugees who at present die in the desert or are shot when they try to cross areas barred to them or who, in other cases, drown in the Atlantic or Mediterranean, for such things do happen. Then, and as our main task, we need urgently to mobilise the international financial institutions to create economic activity in the countries of the South and, in particular, to offer stability there to those young people who wish to work in their own countries and to remain there. Basic efforts are required to promote policies on education and economic stabilisation in order to prevent the populations concerned from migrating. Subsidies, which in any case give rise to corruption, must be halted. The two international bodies – the United Nations and Europe – and, of course, a third body – the Organisation for African Unity – need to tackle this problem without delay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Tijuana or in Brindisi, in Lampedusa or Ceuta, women and men in this world of ours are now on the move. Naturally, our Spanish friends or my Moroccan friends cannot by themselves resolve this problem which, at present, has a global and not only European dimension. As long as men and women are thirsty and hungry, they will start walking, however high the barbed wire fences are built.</p>
<p class="contents">What, then, can be done? The fact is, a four-square model of humanitarianism needs now to be proclaimed. That is to say, food, water, medicines and vaccines, as well as education, need to be global public goods. This is no longer simply a European matter, but a global one. It is now no longer a question of pooling coal and steel, as in 1950. It is a question of sharing water, vaccines, food and education globally. The day that that happens, the people of our planet will no longer need to pass beyond Gibraltar or to cross the Sahara or Arizona deserts or the Rio Grande. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are two approaches: one has also been seen in this Chamber, in a slightly different way from what has been reported in the press; the second can be observed in national events, in the press and in political actions.</p>
<p class="contents">I endorse the statements made by the Council and expressed in other ways by the Commission. What is more, I visited Lampedusa together with all my colleagues in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and I will go to any other European centres that we decide to visit. There are, however, some aspects of the statements that I believe should not be emphasised. I also agree with the position expressed by Mrs Buitenweg and, in part – for once – also that of Mr Catania, although I do not agree with his statements regarding deportation by Italy or journalistic action, which can certainly do nothing to aid such an important cause.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this is an issue which should concern the whole of the European Union – just now someone referred to a ‘planetary problem’. Currently there is no EU policy on immigration and there are countries which are not capable of tackling the problem by themselves. Italy and Spain are large countries – Spain is even getting the army to intervene – and some countries, such as Italy, have outposts in the middle of the sea, such as Lampedusa. Other countries, however – such as Malta, which has a population of barely 400 000 – find themselves under enormous pressure and are not capable of dealing with the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, one can talk of Lampedusa as much as one wants, one can use it for one’s own ends to one’s heart’s content – I refer to Mr Catania – but Lampedusa remains a small island in the middle of the sea, with only 5 000 residents, which is not able to tackle the situation or to create a Hilton hotel for the thousands and thousands of people arriving there. We should thank, as Mr Borghezio and Mr La Russa did, all those who are working on the island, including our friends from Malta who are also doing all that they can. We will visit Malta in January.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, it is important to establish a policy in this field once and for all, which is the one sketched out by the Council Presidency, but this policy must be undertaken in a committed fashion. The Council must take responsibility for it and the Commission should formulate a specific proposal. We must set up a common immigration policy – Mr President, I am just finishing – so that, in addition to human tragedies, in addition to the needy, hungry people who need work, other aspects are also borne in mind, such as those who operate boats to carry illegal immigrants, traffickers in human beings and above all the terrorists who may benefit from these situations to infiltrate Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We expected greater clarity, in particular, since immigration requires joint, coordinated measures for European policy, focused not on the need and the means to protect ourselves from immigrants, but above all on the capability to ensure respect for the human rights of immigrants, their human dignity and agreement among the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Such a policy demands, above all, courage and truth, which is why I will just dwell on an omission in the speech by Mr Alexander which I believe to be particularly serious: he did not make a single reference, not a single word, to what has happened in recent days on Lampedusa. I would therefore like to put four quick questions to him and to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Council aware of the fact that the temporary holding camp on Lampedusa has been transformed in fact – but not by law – into a detention centre, a place where rights do not exist and where ill-treatment and violence are the order of the day?</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Council aware of the fact that an official delegation from this Parliament was taken for a ride by the Italian Government, which, on the day prior to our visit, had the centre evacuated?</p>
<p class="contents">Is the UK Minister aware that his Italian counterpart, Mr Castelli, the Minister for Justice, this morning hastily dismissed events on Lampedusa as a load of rubbish made up by the journalists?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, is the Council aware that the current cooperation agreements with Libya provide not only for the monitoring of the borders but also for non-EU citizens who have been turned away and deported to be interned in refugee camps in the Libyan desert that are not further identified?</p>

<p class="contents">We agree with the proposals for the future and the initiatives taken over recent months by Vice-President Frattini on the issue of illegal immigration, asylum policy and combating illegal immigration trafficking.

<p class="contents">As an MEP I intend to bring pressure to bear on the Council, because the image of the torrent of migrants assaulting the enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla symbolises our future demographic and political relationship. As an MEP, I will also denounce the manipulation of the truth which took place during the visit by the delegation from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs to the Lampedusa centre and the shameful conduct revealed by the journalists’ investigative reports.</p>
<p class="contents">My friends at the Commission, you will have Parliament’s support if you proceed more swiftly.

On the one hand, all this is another demonstration of how we need, as the European Union develops, to move closer towards common rules on asylum, Schengen and other aspects of policy on legal and internal affairs. I see this as being a matter of urgent necessity if we are to be able to take action more quickly to deal with these things.</p>
<p class="contents">This, though, given the way things stand, would be no more than tinkering with symptoms, for, as various Members have described today, the forces at work are quite different. If people are in such dire straits as to think it worth risking death, then our best efforts will avail nothing unless the causes are removed. We have to bring about a situation in which these people again have something to look forward to.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are dealing with is a continent in its death-throes, for we can see how Aids is cutting a swathe through some of its countries, how climate change has meant that people no longer have any means of feeding themselves, and that we have not always given the right sort of aid, or in sufficient quantities. There is also the issue of trading conditions, which are not always fair. If people there are to be given hope, we need to adopt an approach that is different – not only in going deeper but also in having a broader scope.</p>
<p class="contents">It must also be clear, though, that blame is not to be attached to us alone, and that we are doing the things that good people should do. It is every bit as important to recognise that these countries are ruled over by elites and dictatorships that threaten their own people with armed force, oppressing them and making any kind of development impossible. We must overcome the dictatorship in these countries that mete out such inhumane treatment to their own people.</p>
<p class="contents">All these things fit together if we want to deal with these things successfully, and also gain the approval of our own people. What is clear from what is going on now is that we can also present this as a matter of our own self-interest, which is best served if these people, in their own homelands, are given a chance and a prospect of a better life. We have to make it clear that the two are interlinked; it is a vital lesson to be learned if there is to be a change of approach.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We have known all this ever since the 1970s, ever since the reports by Edward Heath, Willy Brandt and others, in which all of this is to be found. None of these things are new; all we need is the strength to put them into practice.</p>

Member States such as Malta are being affected to a disproportionate degree, creating in the process an alarming situation, especially when the size and population density of the island is taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to record here my appreciation for the initiative taken by Commissioner Frattini. Whilst I recognise that individual Member States have to take part ownership of this problem, I feel that the Union has not treated this tragic reality with the urgency, concreteness and effectiveness it deserves.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that we are still far from implementing the burden-sharing policy. The Union has to take immediate and urgent action and provide the necessary funds, know-how, intelligence and diplomatic support needed to tackle this global concern effectively and humanely.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an international problem and therefore necessitates an international solution. In the long term, a joint endeavour by Europe and the United Nations could go a long way towards resolving this issue in a more holistic manner, especially where non-EU countries are concerned. In this respect, I very much welcome the ‘Marshall Plan’ as recommended by Mr Barón Crespo. This is the kind of EU solidarity that EU citizens, Member States and immigrants would really relate to and appreciate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The events which are taking place again and again, mainly in southern Europe, demonstrate, however, that the European Union is not tackling this phenomenon of our time with sufficient determination.</p>
<p class="contents">Too many people believe that this is a problem that concerns only Italy, Spain or Malta. That is not true. Europe has a duty to take responsibility, politically and economically, for what happens along the length of the shores of the Mediterranean, because they represent the external border of the south of the Union. The EU must not, therefore, remain deaf to this appeal, but ought to increase the number of initiatives to tackle the immigration emergency.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why it is not enough to tackle the issue by thinking about inevitable and necessary public order initiatives. Although these are important, we have to do much more. Agreements with countries of origin are needed, and we need to go further along the path that was begun in Barcelona and increase investment and initiatives for development. This is why we are increasingly convinced that immigration ought to be one of the European Union’s responsibilities in the future. The words of Commissioner Figel and the initiatives taken by Mr Frattini give us cause for hope.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the events of recent days it is impossible for us not to forcefully denounce what has happened in Ceuta and Melilla. The Zapatero government was not capable of dealing with the situation, and was not able to tackle an emergency while respecting the human rights of the immigrants who were pressing at the borders. We do not want to see any repetitions of the scenes that have been shown on television in recent days: so many innocent victims, killed through a total inability to tackle the emergency and to know how to combine security and respect for human lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, any comparison – and this is my final point – between what happened in Ceuta and Melilla and what happened on Lampedusa is totally unacceptable. The Italian Government, the forces of law and order and the NGOs did not cause anyone to be killed or deported into the desert, but they continue every day to save the lives of dozens and dozens of immigrants who are victims of traders without scruples and pedlars of dreams that turn into tragedies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Maltese authorities have been dealing with this problem for years, but the last couple of years have seen an increase that has made it very difficult to control. Logistically it has become very hard – nearly impossible – to accommodate these illegal immigrants and at the same time ensure their privacy and dignity as human beings. This year alone about 44 boats have entered our territorial waters – a small number you may say, but when compared to Germany, for example, that would mean the equivalent of 830 boats – carrying 1600 illegal immigrants. Compared to Germany again that would be the equivalent of almost 300 000 people, a situation which I am sure no European government would like to have to face.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately the situation is a reality on our island and I urge the Commission to act as soon as possible to find a lasting solution. Let us work together to adopt a common policy on migration that would befit the principles of a united Europe. The problem we are facing is critical, but nevertheless I am sure that the Maltese authorities will continue to do their utmost to aid and protect these unfortunate people who in the vast majority of cases flee their countries for political, social and economic reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">We will continue to do our best but we need assistance, because this is not just a Maltese, Italian or Spanish problem: it is a problem that concerns the whole of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Douglas Alexander, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, thank you for allowing me to reply to what has been an important and timely debate. I shall respond to a number of the remarks that have been made.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me begin by agreeing with Commissioner Figel’ that migration requires, as he described it, a balanced approach to protect the rights of those in need of protection and to combat illegal immigration. Mrs Klamt and Mrs Roure rightly expressed concerns about reports of migrants left in the deserts. This is clearly unacceptable and underlines the need to cooperate with and assist third countries to provide better migration management.</p>
<p class="contents">In a powerful contribution Mr Watson drew attention to the proximity and importance of Africa to the interests of the European Union. This matter was also brought up in the contributions by Mr Barón Crespo, Mr Cavada and Mr Brok. That of course is the case; it is a sentiment with which I wholeheartedly agree. That is why it is for me a matter of immense pride that in the course of this year the European Union has shown such leadership. This was shown ahead of the Gleneagles Summit – when decisions were taken effectively to double levels of bilateral international aid provided by European Union Member States; then once again at the Gleneagles Summit itself, where there was further action to secure multilateral debt write-off for many of the world’s highly-indebted poorest countries; and then as recently as September at the Millennium Review Summit, where leading European nations were seen to work in concert to ensure an agenda that was progressive in advancing the interests of the United Nations as we look ahead to the challenges of the coming century.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Catania criticised the Council’s engagement with Libya, but on this point I am afraid I have to disagree with him. The Council does not share his view. The migration dialogue with Libya underlines the European Union’s expectations of Libya in areas such as human rights and we believe it is important to influence Libyan behaviour and commitment to human rights by comprehensive engagement.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall try and draw my remarks briefly to a conclusion because I am conscious of the constraints of time. As I said earlier, it is important that we realise that the problems faced by Spain, Italy and Malta are shared by the European Union as a whole. They are also problems for Europe’s neighbours like Libya and Morocco, and for countries in sub-Saharan Africa where the pressures of illegal migration are perhaps greatest.</p>
<p class="contents">The long-term solution lies in working in partnership. In the past the European Union’s engagement with countries outside the European Union to combat illegal immigration has frankly not been effective enough. That is now changing and the European Union is beginning to engage its collective weight to enhance cooperation and migration with source and transit countries. This will be a priority for future work under the United Kingdom Presidency, including when Foreign Ministers meet to discuss the issue this coming November.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I warn against over-simplification of the migration issue. The European Union’s policy on migration and asylum needs to be carefully balanced and carefully considered. It should not confuse the objective of stronger border controls that stop illegal immigration with the objective of protecting refugees, which is a fundamental value of our European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We should push ahead with EU cooperation with third countries. This is the only way to avoid further human tragedies in the Mediterranean and establish managed migration that works in the interests of both the European Union and our neighbours. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a question which touches on many other related issues: not only development, but also external relations and the future of Europe. I would like to express my gratitude to the Members of the European Parliament, not only for their speeches, but also their valuable suggestions and ideas for further action.</p>
<p class="contents">Migration has many causes. We have to look into, and deal with, these root causes and we need to act much more than we have until now. This phenomenon is not only growing, but is having an increasing impact on our current situation. Just to remind you that many years ago – 60 years ago or more – people from Europe were fleeing to other continents. Now Europe is an attractive place. We should not be apathetic to the results of integration. We should be active in sharing solidarity and justice, as the cement of our European house, with the people around Europe. I believe that respect for human rights, the culture of human rights and the mainstreaming of human rights in all other policies with our partners, with countries of origin or of transit, should become a permanent part of our relations or criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a comprehensive approach which brings together development policy, economic cooperation, humanitarian policy and, of course, justice and home affairs. The Commission promotes such an attitude and will promote it further together with the United Nations. I am sure that in November, on the tenth anniversary of the Barcelona Process, the same approach will be expressed even more deeply and intensely. It is an important time for reflection on the future of this region.</p>
<p class="contents">This House will discuss later this evening the Union’s strategy on Africa. Today, the EU donates 60% of the total amount of aid to Africa. This is by far the highest volume in comparison with other countries and organisations in the world. We will help to overcome many problems – and as was mentioned, enable people to see a future in their countries – not only with aid, but also with policies which promote basic values, education and better living conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by assuring you, Mr President, that we will discuss the issue at the hearing tomorrow in the European Parliament. We are increasingly interdependent and, as Mrs Buitenweg said, the European project is really about civilisation: civilisation not only for us, but for the world in general. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
