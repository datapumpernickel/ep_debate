<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Martínez Martínez (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are talking about the activity of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in 2000 and this is perhaps a rather different type of report to those produced in previous years on this issue. Firstly, because specific events occurred in 2000 which have had an effect on the workings and even the very identity of the Joint Assembly, but also because we deliberately wanted to give the report a somewhat innovative approach. In addition, therefore, to the traditional reminder of hard data on the activity of the Assembly for that year, we opened a more politically-charged debate on the role of the Assembly itself and, what is more, on how we should view the role of the Members of the European Parliament in the Assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to any formal or legal considerations, we feel that as Members of this Parliament who are also members of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly, we are not there as individuals. We are delegates and therefore our activity within that forum must be guided and then judged by our Parliament. We therefore believe that, from a democratic point of view, it is crucial that this annual report on what has taken place in the Joint Assembly should cease being a largely routine and bureaucratic process and become a balance of accounts presented to the European Parliament by its delegates. Similarly, the debate on this annual report should be an opportunity for Parliament to guide the work of its representatives in the Joint Parliamentary Assembly over the coming months.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at the events of 2000, what marked the year was the approval, following extremely lengthy negotiations, of the Cotonou Agreement, which ratifies the legitimacy in law of the Assembly and brings it up to the category of Joint Parliamentary Assembly. Above all, 2000 marks a turning point in the European Union’s cooperation with the ensemble of the 77 States from Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific that are already associated members. The effective implementation of the Treaty is also, undoubtedly, the most significant development this year for the Assembly. The catalogue of events is described in some detail in the report. There was the Abuja Summit in Nigeria in March and the meeting in Brussels in October, together with the new designation of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly. Important events took place at those meetings, such as the general report on globalisation, the hearing on AIDS and the notable presence of President Josselin and of Commissioners Lamy and Nielson. An unfortunate problem was also encountered, however: the presence of representatives of the European Parliament in plenary, and especially in the working groups, was lower than we had hoped for.</p>
<p class="contents">Amongst the challenges that remain, the Treaty provides for the mobilisation of civil society, which is the collaborative fabric required for its very implementation, and here we need to consider how we can ensure that this is achieved efficiently and without confusion, putting each person in the right position for him or for her.</p>
<p class="contents">Another challenge is to exploit the Assembly’s huge potential for coordinating positions of the associates of the ACP and the European Union, in order to make the process of cooperation and development and the Treaty itself more effective and perhaps also to establish positions of consensus for approaches in other forums such as the WTO, for example. One of the prime conditions for achieving this is for the European Parliament to assume full responsibility for work in the Joint Assembly and to give this work the priority it deserves.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude by saying that in the report’s conclusions, I included a few lines on how I think the Joint Parliamentary Assembly should operate. Of course, decisions on this fall to the Assembly itself, but Parliament has the responsibility to state its criteria in order to guide the work of its Members in this Joint Assembly. These guidelines coincide almost entirely with the proposals that have been agreed in the Assembly’s own working group on how it should operate.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would add that our motion for a resolution includes many amendments by Members of various groups, which all make a valuable contribution, as well as two further amendments, which were tabled in the debate in Parliament by the European People’s Party. I would ask you to vote in favour of the former. The latter seeks to remove a paragraph that was added to my initial proposal in an amendment by Mr Van den Bos, of the Liberal Group, which was approved in committee. I think that this paragraph addresses a series of important issues which could be debated by the ACP-EU Assembly’s own committees and I do not think it would be useful to remove it at this stage. It does not hold us to anything and does provide a range of interesting ideas. I would therefore ask the PPE Group to withdraw this amendment and, if they do not do so, I would ask you to vote against it.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I wish to thank the secretariat of Parliament’s Committee on Development and Cooperation for their considerable cooperation. I should also like to thank my fellow members of that committee and all of you for your attention and for your votes, which I hope will be favourable tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Howitt (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, in congratulating Mr Martínez Martínez on his report I reiterate that our major achievement in the last twelve months has been to support the signing of the Cotonou Agreement, a huge restatement of Europe's commitment to development against a backcloth of globalisation and liberalisation elsewhere in international relations. Our task now is to act as the watchdog to ensure that those mutual commitments on trade and aid are fully realised.</p>
<p class="contents">On trade, it remains a concern that the European Commission failed to get common agreement with our ACP partners in the run-up to the Seattle WTO meeting. The Commission failed to consult, through the joint EU-ACP trade committee laid down in Cotonou, in recent discussions on "Everything but Arms", whilst the long-running problems over the banana regime remain unresolved. Trade access is the key to development for our ACP partners, just as it is the acid test for Europe's genuine commitment to put development first.</p>
<p class="contents">On aid, it appears that the good principles for civil society participation have not yet been realised during the first programming exercise under Cotonou. The lack of mechanisms for civil society negotiations in some ACP countries poses real problems. The Commission, through its quality support group, we in the Joint Assembly, and not least the beneficiary governments should all uphold our responsibilities in this respect. This is not just an issue of support for non-governmental organisations; it is also about our support for the whole principle of good governance.</p>
<p class="contents">On this question, there is much in the resolution to commend in relation to promoting the role of directly-elected parliamentarians within the Joint Assembly. But just as we often debate in this Chamber problems of abuse of human rights and of conflict, let us also give positive recognition to continuing moves towards peace and democracy in many African countries. This includes, for example, recent welcome moves to national dialogue by Joseph Kabila in the Congo, the democratic alternation of power in Cape Verde, the tentative maintenance of the peace agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea and, as we saw for ourselves in the Joint Assembly last year, the entrenchment of democracy in post-Abacha Nigeria.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on a lighter note, much of this may seem to be remote to Europe's citizens whose support is essential to our partnership with Africa. So it is with great pleasure that I tell you that in my own country – the UK – this Friday, a biannual awareness and fund-raising extravaganza for Africa, called Comic Relief, will see otherwise serious citizens don red plastic noses to raise cash and a laugh in solidarity with Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">I, myself, will be serving quaint British cherry Bakewell tarts to users at the Suffolk Learning and Resource Centre in Bungay and will then go on to sell handshakes at 10p each to schoolchildren at the Highwood Infant School in King's Lynn, Norfolk. And yes, I will be donning a red plastic nose in common with everyone else.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only should the European Parliament congratulate everyone involved, we should underline that through such creative public exercises our electors show us that they back the political commitment to development, embraced in our partnership with Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific and marked by tonight's debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This means that only democratically elected representatives, without exception, have the right to participate and to express their views within the Joint Parliamentary Assembly. But a single representative for each ACP country prevents opposition representatives from gaining access and expressing their views and hence obscures political pluralist expression in these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the principle of one vote for each country in the ACP group as opposed to one vote for each person on the European side is not a fair one. The very structure of this Assembly is therefore unbalanced. The European Parliament is an institution in its own right. The ACP group does not have an existence outside its appearance at the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and does not have an organisation in the form of political groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Joint Parliamentary Assembly has taken on a new role, but decision-making powers are not everything. It does not have the right to use European Development Funds; it does not participate in the procedure to ratify the Cotonou Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">We will therefore vote for the report by Mr Martínez Martínez with conviction because it highlights these shortcomings. But the Assembly must continue to reflect on its composition, its function and its powers so that, in 2001, it can become a joint, fair Parliamentary Assembly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I sincerely thank the rapporteur, not just for his report and the way he has presented it tonight, but for the very hard work he does both in the ACP and in the Development Committee. I have prepared this report twice. I know how hard it is to find fresh ideas and yet he has come forward not only with fresh ideas but with extremely good points that we have now tried to incorporate in our rules for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The past year has been a watershed for the ACP/EU partnership. There was a lot of resistance about going to Abuja, in Nigeria last year. But I felt that it was vitally important that we were seen to support this fledgling democracy. That turned out to be one of the best Assemblies we have ever had.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Howitt has just said, it was very much a look back at the past and a debate about future partnership agreements. But the real benefit of visiting these developing countries is not just the Assembly, it is speaking to people involved in development work there and speaking to those who are helped because we in Europe give that development aid.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Assembly in Brussels we took the first steps towards realigning the Assembly to fit the Cotonou Agreement. As co-president I am determined we will have a workshop and not a talking-shop from now on. We have built many of Mr Martínez Martínez's ideas into the new rules. We are now a parliamentary assembly. We can involve civil society – this is desperately important. I want to see standing committees that do real work rather than the workshops that we have. I want to see a real North-South partnership leading to poverty eradication and I want to see the assembly take a leading role in conflict prevention and conflict resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This evening I will be driving back to Brussels and flying out tomorrow morning to learn about our host country and do some political work there. I look forward to a frank and open exchange of views with the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and I agree with the rapporteur that this exchange of views should be more than just rhetoric. I also think that the efforts of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly in these last few years have been aimed at that.</p>
<p class="contents">2000 was a significant year in many ways, not least because with the signing of the Cotonou Agreement in June we entered an exciting new phase of partnership with the ACP states, one that will last for the next twenty years. It is therefore fitting that the Joint Parliamentary Assembly should begin to reflect on how it will adapt to the changes introduced by the next agreement, particularly in promoting increased dialogue with our development partners on such topics as peace-keeping and good governance.</p>
<p class="contents">We are raising the level of ambition in the new Cotonou Agreement and everybody is looking at this with great excitement. The rapporteur suggests that in this new context the Joint Parliamentary Assembly is now ready to take its place as a true parliamentary authority and welcomes the changes introduced by the Cotonou Agreement to strengthen the Assembly. The Commission clearly supports the Assembly's wish to take on a more politically ambitious role. This is very much in line with what we would like the Cotonou Agreement to contribute generally in North-South relations and giving that a parliamentary accent is also very desirable.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with the rapporteur on the role that political dialogue can play in the ACP regions and countries, which can often be characterised by a climate of instability. It is therefore important to take advantage of the possibilities for peaceful and constructive exchanges of views as part of a process of dialogue within ACP regions and countries involving government and civil society. The report also contains many other useful suggestions that can only make the Assembly's work more interesting and efficient and the Commission awaits with anticipation the implementation of these changes. This is a meaningful and necessary meeting-place between North and South in the world. As Europeans we can be proud that we are able to play this role. I am looking forward to the cooperation within this framework. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
