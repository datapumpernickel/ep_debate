I would also like to thank the President and the members of the committee for its expeditious examination of this proposed regulation. This will enable the European Community to pass a clear signal to the AIDCP at its Annual Meeting beginning on 13 June 2005, that with the adoption by Parliament of this proposal from the Commission, the European Community is well on the road to completing the necessary internal procedures to becoming a full member of this organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to accept a number of amendments suggested by Mr Freitas, notably Amendments 2, 3, 5 and 6. In particular, these amendments will increase the transparency and simplify the understanding of the content and reasoning behind the need for this Council decision, which will enable the Community to fulfil its international obligations to become a party to regional fisheries organisations where they exist and to defend Community interests in the global fisheries. This will also enable the Community to be at the forefront of these organisations and enhance the leading role that it has constantly played in the operation of regional fisheries organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not, however, in a position to accept the remaining proposed amendments, with the exception of Amendment 4, which I can accept provided that the phrase ‘and its certification scheme’ is deleted. I will comment on the certification scheme later with respect to other amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I find difficulty in accepting the other amendments for the following reasons. This proposal relates to the approval of AIDCP, whereas Amendments 1, 9, and 11 focus heavily on a secondary issue of the AIDCP, namely, the tuna tracking and verification system, which is already EC law. Amendment 10 requires that future changes to the tuna tracking and verification system regulation follow a certain process, in contradiction to the appropriate comitology provisions within the regulation. This regulation is already in force and changes can be made to it as and when necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments 7, 8, and 12 relate to the issue of AIDCP certification and consumer information. Again, such amendments are not helpful in this instance since the issue of whether the Community accepts AIDCP certification is still being considered by the Member States and, pending such a consultation, the Commission has not adopted any fixed position. The inclusion of any reference to certification is premature and could prejudice the internal debate that still has to be concluded. Furthermore, the issue of certification is not one of the objectives of the AIDCP, nor is it included in the general measures of the AIDCP Agreement, nor in the application of the AIDCP Programme itself. This is a secondary commercial economic interest that is a consequence of the implementation of part of the AIDCP, and not a core element. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Duarte Freitas (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have suggested a balance that I believe can be struck between the conservation of eco-systems and the social and economic interests of the fisheries sector. Although such a balance will be difficult, it is often an attainable target, as evidenced by this compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur of this proposal for a decision on the conclusion by the European Community of the Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Programme, I was delighted to see that it is possible to coordinate strategies that can meet the interests of fishermen and of all of those involved, while ensuring that eco-systems can be preserved.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme on which this Agreement is based, and which the Community intends to conclude, has three key priorities: firstly, to monitor the abundance of dolphins and levels of dolphin mortality linked to tuna fishing in the area covered by the Agreement; secondly, to study the causes of dolphin mortality during fishing operations, whilst at the same time promoting fishing techniques and gear capable of minimising these effects; and thirdly, to study the impact of various fishing models on various species of fish and other creatures in the pelagic ecosystem.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to accomplish the objectives, the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC), which is coordinating this programme, is proposing to put in place a range of measures, among which I should like to highlight the implementation of sustainable fishing quotas for tuna caught in the Agreement area and the presence of on-board observers during each fishing trip. As they are aware of the importance of conserving fishing stocks, the vessel owners and fishermen have developed fishing techniques that are less harmful to the target species and to the by-catch concerned. It is important to emphasise that the efforts led to a reduction in the by-catch of dolphins in the Agreement area as a result of purse-seine fishing from around 150 000 in 1989 to 1 500 in 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as playing an important part in preserving dolphin communities in this region, this Agreement has also helped to preserve the ecosystem as a whole by preserving communities of other species in addition to dolphins, such as sharks, turtles and other aquatic animals often killed, thanks to the use of different fishing gear specially designed to catch these species of tuna. This demonstrates the high level of selectivity achieved thus far and goes to show the value of this programme that the Community is seeking to sign up to.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the technical measures involved, the programme encompasses a ‘dolphin-safe’ certification scheme for products caught without any harm being done to dolphins. Let me stress the point that this certification can only be awarded to products where no dolphin – or other species not being fished – is harmed. The issue of certification has been extensively debated in the UN’s Committee on Fisheries and Food and Agriculture Association and in the European Commission, which, as I understand, is in the process of drawing up a communication on the issue of eco-labelling. This is a very important subject, which is worthy of debate, because in the case of tuna there are a number of non-governmental organisations that have, sometimes less than transparently, influenced the trade flow of processed tuna products in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore feel, Commissioner, that following discussion in the Committee on Fisheries, this was an important time to raise awareness among the Commission and all of the members of the Committee on Fisheries of the fact that the European Union needs to regulate the issue of eco-labelling, and it was to an extent with this in mind that some amendments were tabled. I feel that there must be a public body in charge of this process, although private firms and non-governmental organisations can be partners prior or subsequent to this process. For the entire certification process to have the highest possible credibility, however, there must be a public body in charge.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, and in line with the guidelines of the common fisheries policy, I believe that this programme deserves a favourable opinion from Parliament with regard to the conclusion of this Agreement by the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to point out that this report was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Fisheries, and I am grateful to the members of that Committee. I also wish to thank the scientists, the organisations, the Commission, of course, and non-governmental organisations such as the World Wildlife Fund, which attended a mini-hearing that I had arranged. I feel that this mini-hearing helped to convey the importance of this programme and to show that it is possible to have Agreement between fishermen, scientists and politicians on such an important issue. It might also serve to show the EU’s future role, as I said, in a good light, as regards this Agreement, by safeguarding its content, and throughout the eco-labelling process in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we know, it concerns the 2 billion dollar tuna industry. We all eat tuna and we are all familiar with the wide range of dolphin-friendly labels that appear on tuna cans and jars. These labels have, until now, been unregulated, confusing and often misleading. This initiative seeks to change that. The Freitas report shows why the governments of 15 countries in Latin America and Central America have joined with the EU and the US to support the Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Programme (AIDCP).</p>
<p class="contents">The eastern Pacific fleet targets large, mature yellow-fin tuna that swim beneath schools of dolphins, sometimes 20 000 strong. If any dolphins are caught in the tuna nets, up to half a dozen hardy fishermen with diving equipment jump into the nets to herd the dolphins to one end, where they jump to safety over the cork lines. Only when the last dolphin has been freed is the net hauled on board. There is no by-catch of any kind associated with this method of tuna fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">Trained government observers are on board every tuna boat; vessels are licensed only if they have no record of violations; skippers must be trained and qualified; and by utilising that exhaustive system, dolphin deaths in the eastern Pacific have been dramatically reduced from 350 000 per year in the 1980s to fewer than 1 600 per year at present. Of an estimated population of over 10 million dolphins in the eastern Pacific alone, this is really insignificant. That is why Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund support this fishing method in preference to others where there is a large by-catch.</p>
<p class="contents">EU support for the AIDCP label has posed a significant threat to some NGOs, which have hijacked the international tuna industry and become its de facto regulators. One Californian NGO, in particular, has become enormously rich by receiving a payment for every can of tuna carrying its dolphin-friendly label. The fishing method that this NGO supports may well be dolphin-friendly, but it causes the death of tens of thousands of sharks as well as leatherback turtles and even young, immature yellow-fin tuna, which are tossed dead back into the sea.</p>
<p class="contents">It is outrageous that this organisation now holds the international tuna industry to ransom, threatening to blacklist on their website any supermarkets that refuse to sell cans of tuna carrying their dolphin-safe labels. Members of this House have even received hostile, threatening and aggressive e-mails from the organisation this week. Their days are now numbered. The AIDCP label received unanimous support in the Committee on Fisheries and I believe that it will be supported by the majority of Members of this House today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that dolphins would vote for it if they could!</p>
<p class="contents">The goal of the AIDCP is progressively to reduce incidental dolphin mortalities in the tuna purse seine fishery in the Eastern Pacific Ocean. The aim is to reach zero levels through the setting of annual limits and the long-term sustainability of tuna stock in the agreement area.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the fact that the WWF and Greenpeace are supporting and promoting the agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Programme because it is a legally binding instrument that consolidates the results of an effort of interested governments, the tuna industry and the environmental community that, in less than 20 years, has led to a dramatic reduction of the mortality of dolphins in the Eastern Pacific Ocean. More than 100 000 dolphins were killed in 1986 but thanks to this scheme fewer than 1 500 were killed in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The AIDCP has established two systems: the tuna tracking and verification system, and the dolphin-safe certification system. Many of us like to eat tuna and European consumers consume over 530 000 tonnes each year. Most consumers would like to know that the tuna we eat has not resulted in dolphin by-catch deaths. The accuracy of some supermarket dolphin-safe labels has been questioned and according to the WWF the AIDCP systems for tuna tracking and dolphin-safe certification together represent at present the only programme that can guarantee consumers that the tuna labelled as 'AIDCP dolphin-safe' has in fact been caught without killing or seriously injuring dolphins.</p>
<p class="contents">These outstanding results are obtained mainly through a system of independent observers on board, which is the only system that guarantees the coverage of 100% of the fishing trips by large tuna purse seiners in the Eastern Pacific Ocean and a set of stringent technical and operative requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">The new label which will be introduced in the EU now guarantees consumers that no dolphins have been killed. People's purchasing power has won the day. The international fishing community has now woken up to the fact that consumers will not accept unnecessary deaths or damage to our environment in the food and fisheries industries. I urge colleagues to support this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Industrial tuna fishing threatens not only tuna fish stocks but also other species, of which the best known is the dolphin. The Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Programme came about because a very great many of our people wanted to prevent dolphins from dying as a result of bad fishing methods.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that we are making sure that the agreement is implemented in our legislation, it is important for these objectives to be attained. As my fellow MEPs have described, the work has so far been quite successful. Amendments 9 and 11 – tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance in the committee, where they were supported – are important for ensuring that consumers are not taken in by labelling. A reference to Article 3 of the Regulation of 2003 is important for also informing everyone who fulfils the conditions about the correct labelling requirements and ensuring that no one can fecklessly take advantage of these. This is something to which Mr Stevenson referred. We cannot forgo mentioning that, for this is Parliament’s opportunity to express its will to you as you continue to negotiate.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also evaluate the dolphin-safe methods, which can be improved so that they do not harm other species. Log sets kill sea turtles and many other species. I know that the AIDCP has embarked upon work to improve these methods. It is important for us constantly to monitor developments and use the best possible methods. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us consider the facts.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is the body whose common fisheries policy has created massive iniquities. Take the unfair treatment of United Kingdom fishermen, now, thanks to Brussels, struggling to survive, while Spanish fishermen, for example, seem able to flout the rules at will. Consider, too, the appalling depletion of fish stocks in EU waters as a direct result of the CFP. Then there is the fact that one million tonnes of dead fish are thrown back into the North Sea every year. Not only is it hugely wasteful, it is also damaging the ecosystem. Evidence, indeed, of the law of unintended consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has also concluded unfair and immoral fishing agreements with many third world countries in Africa, which allow European factory farming boats, not unlike the ones that pose a threat to dolphins, to come down and plunder African seas of all their fish. So badly has that hit the local economies that local fishermen have now turned to hunting in their hinterland, destroying local wild animal stocks. These debt-ridden countries have little option but to accept grossly inadequate sums of money for this presumed privilege. It is therefore no surprise to me to see the EU attempt to sign up to an agreement that has been condemned by dolphin conservationists. Why, after all, should the EU listen to experts?</p>
<p class="contents">Vessels participating in this programme are allowed a dolphin mortality limit. Explosives and speedboats are commonly used to scare dolphins and the programme even allows the deliberate killing of these animals, with over 1 400 observed dead last year, according to the Earth Island Institute’s ‘Dolphin Safe’ programme. If the EU were genuine about this sort of issue, it would adopt the position taken by the United Kingdom and ban pair trawling. After all, we in Britain have made some good decisions. We stayed out of the euro zone, our Prime Minister has probably dealt a mortal blow to the proposed Constitution, but, instead of following good practice, the EU seeks to sign up to a questionable agreement, simply to attempt once more to justify its own dubious international status. It shows, yet again, that if the EU is the answer it must have been a very stupid question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

May I also take this opportunity to congratulate Mrs Fraga on her report on the Mediterranean. These are thorough reports which respond to the current situation, in order to ensure that we shall have seas with fish in them both now and in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">May I also take this opportunity, while we are debating dolphins, to mention an incident which took place in my country. What happened is that, after a storm at sea at the end of May, a kilometre-long net was found abandoned in the northern Aegean, which had been tossed around by the storm for 10 days and which, when it was noticed, had already caught dozens of dolphins and dozens of rare cetaceans which are threatened with extinction. This was an ecological disaster which came to light and was discovered, because there are others which we know nothing about.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out that the area of the northern Aegean is a rare and important marine habitat, because the River Evros flows into it, the waters come from the Dardanelles and, within the framework of protection for all seas, we must also pay particular attention to the Aegean.</p>
<p class="contents">This unfortunate incident proves yet again that the environment has no borders. Broken nets spread death and this should worry us. I should like to say that it is our duty to protect the environment and the report by our honourable friend moves in that direction, which is why we should all vote for it.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to express to everyone a view which should prevail among us. It is our duty to protect the marine environment. Our children have a right to be able to fish in it also. We have an obligation to leave fish in our seas for future generations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I would like to express a few humble opinions that may be a little discordant but which I believe may add some things that have not been said. Firstly, the main reason for the European Community to be involved in the IATCC and the AIPCD stems from the presence of the European or, if you like, the Spanish, tuna fleet in the Eastern Pacific, where it has been fishing since 1975.</p>
<p class="contents">I say this because, in the explanatory statement in Mr Freitas’s report, the justification appears to be based on other reasons and not on the presence of our fleet in the Eastern Pacific. Our fleet fishes in the Eastern Pacific and it has, of course, never fished with dolphins, because a Community Regulation prohibits it: Council Regulation No 850/98 of 30 March 1998, Article 33.</p>
<p class="contents">Since I believe it may be useful to this House, I would like to say that the AIPCD has been created as a result of a specific problem involving the United States fleet, and subsequently the Mexican fleet, the Venezuelan fleet and the Colombian fleet, the only ones which, together with El Salvador, currently fish with dolphins. I believe that this is something that we, as Europeans, can be pleased about.</p>
<p class="contents">We, who have been fishing in that area –– as I have said –– since 1975, participate in the AIPCD despite the fact that our activities have nothing to do with the true objective of this agreement, because we do not fish with dolphins. The EU signed this Agreement, the AIPCD, on 26 April 1999, it communicated that decision to the trustee of the AIPCD, the United States of America, by means of a verbal note on 8 June 1999, and at that time, the Council considered that signature and that provisional application to be the first steps to its subsequent approval by the EC.</p>
<p class="contents">Although, for technical reasons, the Community could not join the IATTC, the Council authorised the Kingdom of Spain to accede to the IATTC Convention on an exceptional basis. That accession took place in Guatemala in 2003. The decision foresaw that Spain would participate in IATTC decisions in line with the Community position and in close cooperation with the Commission, which guaranteed the Community’s effective participation in the IATTC.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore of the opinion –– and this is an opinion –– that the report must call –– perhaps the Commission could enlighten us in this regard –– for the definitive ratification of the AIPCD by the European Union, and not its accession to this Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to make a comment on Amendments 11 and 12. At no point does the Regulation talk about the ‘dolphin-safe’ label; that label, as such, does not exist. What Article 3 of the Regulation does contain is a series of definitions which include what is understood by ‘‘dolphin-safe tuna’.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate the rapporteur once again and I believe that we perhaps need to be a little more realistic about the issue we are discussing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The objective is a shared one. It is important for the Commission to enhance its role in regional fisheries organisations in supporting conservation measures that are put in place not only in European but also in international waters. Membership of the organisation will help us attain higher standards as regards by-catches of cetaceans. Since the establishment of the AIDCP, the by-catch of cetaceans has dropped from 150 000 to 1 500. This in itself is a great success and worthy of support.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur and other speakers raised the issue of eco-labelling. Firstly, the option of the AIDCP ‘dolphin safe’ certificate by the Community is currently being examined by the Member States. In addition, the Commission will be adopting a proposal on eco-labelling within a couple of weeks, which will clearly feed into the process of considering whether to adopt the AIDCP certificate. The communication will set out three options for consideration: retaining the status quo, having a mandatory Community-wide label or setting minimum criteria. At this stage, the Commission is leaning towards the third option, and we look forward to a constructive debate with Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I wish to assure you of the Commission’s and my own personal commitment to continuing to work towards minimising discards and by-catch, especially of cetaceans. I count on the support of this House, so that we can work together in achieving improvements in our current practices and methods.</p>
