Everything which is said only reflects the position of the Committee on Petitions and not that of any political group or of me personally. The Chairman, Mr Libicki, asks the House and the committee to excuse his absence.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate this evening, moved by the oral question tabled on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, touches the very core that many people have in mind when they talk of a Europe of the citizens or, more specifically, of European nationality.</p>
<p class="contents">The right to petition, as enshrined in the Treaty, implies obligations for all the European institutions, not just Parliament. Every citizen has the right to petition Parliament within the framework of the activities of the European Union and to expect a satisfactory response; to expect that, where there is infringement in matters which touch on the competences of the European Union, there will be reparation.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate on the petitions relating to the Lloyd's affair seeks an honest reply from the Commission, as the guardian of the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">If a European law has not been applied correctly by a Member State for a great many years; if, indeed, incorrect application has also resulted in serious personal losses and, in certain cases, pushed people to the point at which they end their lives; if it is true that the petitioners in the Lloyd's affair in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany and numerous other countries in the European Union suffered huge financial losses because the First Non-Life Insurance Directive was not applied correctly, then this matter must make all of us think about how Europe operates.</p>
<p class="contents">Citizens have the right to expect that, when the Council and Parliament adopt legislation, it is applied correctly in the Member States of the European Union without exception. It has come to our attention that the petitioners in 1997 in the United Kingdom have stated that the Community Non-Life Insurance Directive was late being introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">On this subject, after a long interval, Parliament took exceptional measures, approving the report by Mr Roy Perry in September 2003 by 358 for, no votes against and 35 abstentions. Long and detailed enquiries followed by the Committee on Petitions and yet, despite all this, the petitioners are still waiting for a clear answer to the questions raised in the Perry resolution, so that they can finally proceed with their case before the courts in Great Britain and seek compensation for the losses which they have sustained.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Parliament needs to refer the European Commission to the Court of Justice of the European Communities, because it failed to reply to our question and because it failed to render proper account to the European Parliament, then I believe that we should do so without fear, Mr Libicki says.</p>
<p class="contents">The question at issue is a question of the European Commission's rendering proper account to the European Parliament and, consequently of the European Parliament's rendering proper account to the citizens, more and more of whom are filing petitions. Is our usual legislation good enough and is it correctly applied? Is there free movement of goods and persons and recognition of professional qualifications? Do European citizens have rights? That is the substance of this evening's debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament is waiting for the European Commission to decide if European citizens have rights and to investigate if the United Kingdom has applied the laws on the proper regulation and control of the insurance market over the last two decades and if solvency requirements existed at that time. Reply please, Commissioner; not you personally, of course. Remember that your predecessor only went into action when he came under pressure, instituting infringement proceedings which were later withdrawn when the United Kingdom complied. Reply, on behalf of your institution, before Parliament; reply above all on the question of compliance by the country in question over this specific period. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Charlie McCreevy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, the question of the regulation of Lloyd’s and the application of the First Non-Life Insurance Directive in the United Kingdom has been debated before in this Chamber. I refer to Oral Question B5-0010/2004 by Mr Perry, which was debated by Parliament on 12 February 2004, and to the answer given by the Commission on that occasion.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has always expressed the greatest sympathy for the thousands of individuals – including the petitioners – who have suffered as a result of the Lloyd’s affair. The Commission’s views and concerns relating to the pre-2000 UK legislation were set out clearly in its letter of formal notice of December 2001, which is now a public document.</p>
<p class="contents">The UK authorities informed the Commission that new legislation had been enacted to replace the former regime and answered further Commission questions relating to that new legislation. The Commission then announced that it was satisfied that those aspects of the regulatory and supervisory regime for Lloyd’s under examination were compatible with the requirements of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has no doubt that once it had established the compatibility of the new regime for Lloyd’s it had no basis for continuing the infringement proceedings it had begun with the letter of formal notice in December 2001 in relation to the old regime. The Court of Justice’s jurisprudence on the purpose and conduct of infringement proceedings is quite clear. The Commission has always stressed to complainants that any action seeking damages for alleged incompatibility under the former regime must be undertaken exclusively before the United Kingdom courts.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to help them in their litigation in the UK against the UK Government, the petitioners and many correspondents seem to seek a ruling from the Commission on the compatibility or incompatibility of the former Lloyd’s regime. However, only the Court of Justice can give such rulings. The Commission voiced its concerns in its 2001 letter of formal notice but this was only the first step in a long process of argument and counter-argument that might ultimately, if it had been continued, have led to a formal hearing and ruling at the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is fully aware that it is a subject of great regret to many that the legal proceedings begun with our letter were not pursued to their ultimate conclusion, but it has no doubt that its decision to discontinue the proceedings was the right one and was fully in conformity with the constant jurisprudence of the Court in the matter of infringement proceedings.</p>
<p class="contents">I have taken note of the motion for a resolution tabled for the purpose of winding up tonight’s debate on this question. The Commission believes that the points addressed to it in Mr Perry’s report, to which the draft resolution makes reference, have all been answered. The Commission made its views on the UK authorities’ responses to the letter of formal notice public when it decided to close the infringement procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the access to documents retained by the Commission, I stress that these are governed by Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001. The conditions for gaining access to these documents are set out in that regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the third question in Mr Perry’s report about possible shortcomings or omissions in the UK regime, I reiterate that the Commission raised a number of questions in its letters of formal notice. I stress, however, that these were only questions. Such questions do not, in themselves, constitute an opinion or judgement. The answers provided by the UK authorities satisfied the Commission and led it to decide that there were no grounds to pursue the infringement procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My family has been associated with Lloyd’s for over 200 years in one form or another and I therefore understand the marketplace and how Lloyd’s functions.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no specific animus against Lloyd’s in any way, shape or form. Indeed, arguably, I strongly support the organisation. But equally I support the principle of this question, which dates back – as many colleagues now know – to 1997 in terms of the petition and far longer in terms of the substance. This is about the fact that the question tabled by Roy Perry and now by the Committee on Petitions has not been answered properly. It is a measure of that concern that there is unanimity in the Committee on Petitions, even though there may be disagreement about the substance on the fact that this question has not been responded to properly. That is why there is a motion for a resolution attached to give power to the President of Parliament to instruct the Committee on Legal Affairs to take legal action against the Commission to answer that question, if – as I suspect is already the case this evening – this has not happened. The cause for concern here is that it is a failure by the Commission to respond to the Committee on Petitions – now in total as opposed to an individual Member.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue itself continues, as the Commissioner and Members know. People are still being made bankrupt and their health and their lives are still often in turmoil. This petition needs to be closed, we need answers to the question. My colleagues and I on the Committee on Petitions cannot agree to the petition being closed until we get the proper answers to these questions tabled now and also previously by my former colleague Roy Perry.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must answer the question properly to give at least a chance to those who have suffered at the hands of Lloyd’s in this sad affair the opportunity to be able to pursue their cases.</p>
<p class="contents">I have never been and will not be one who advises members of Lloyd’s – ‘Names’ – who have suffered financially to pursue a case with no expectation of success. That way lies folly and further trouble. However, I, along with colleagues who have investigated this matter, believe that it needs proper consideration. That is why the question has been tabled in the terms it has. This is no personal reflection on Commissioner McCreevy, but I am not satisfied that the Commission has given the proper answer. Therefore, it must realise that further consequences will follow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Of course, this is a Directive that was not adopted by a previous British Government but which was then adopted by a subsequent government, the current government; the Commission began an infringement procedure pursuant to Article 226, the situation was changed, the Directive was incorporated and, from that point, as Commissioner McCreevy has pointed out, according to the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, it was not possible to continue proceedings before the Court, because Article 226 says: ‘If the Commission considers that a Member State has failed to fulfil an obligation under this Treaty, it shall deliver a reasoned opinion on the matter after giving the State concerned the opportunity ...’.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the State conformed to the Commission’s opinion, we currently have no case from a legal point of view. That is to say that I have the impression that, as Commissioner McCreevy has said, at this point, the only possibility is to bring an action before the British legal authorities, but not before the Institutions of the European Union. In legal terms, we could say that, as things stand, neither this Parliament, nor the Commission, nor the Court of Justice of the European Union are the appropriate fora for dealing with this kind of complaint.</p>
<p class="contents">That, unfortunately, is how the Treaty is worded. We could have a different Treaty, which would impose obligations on the Commission with regard to things that have happened previously, but in this case the case-law of the Court of Justice is clear and that is why I raised objections in relation to this issue and I continue to do so today. That is to say that the Treaty does not authorise the Commission to bring a State before the Court of Justice once the State has conformed to European Union Law. It is not a mathematical or immediate, or automatic, system, but rather the State must firstly be called upon to comply, and when it does so, the procedure comes to an end; from that point, the Commission can do nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">My feeling is that, at this point, both the Commission’s previous reply and the reply that Commissioner McCreevy has just given us are entirely satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">I recommend that the people affected by the Lloyd's case turn to the British courts and take appropriate action in accordance with British Law, but I believe that there is no point in our considering this procedure at this point; it is a huge waste of time for this Parliament and we could go as far as to say that it would also mislead the people affected, because it takes them along a path that will take them nowhere.</p>
<p class="contents">The British courts themselves are their only chance of success; in fact I believe actions have already been brought before those courts. This is the only form of action possible. And that is what I recommend to the people involved in this kind of complaint. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If we are honest, and I agree with Mr Medina Ortega about this, we know that whatever we do may not bring a resolution to the many personal cases of loss. We do not want legal proceedings between our institutions for the sake of having legal proceedings, but we do want to do something that enhances the position and standing of Parliament and Europe’s institutions. The central issue here is about how the European Union functions and, more particularly within your area, about how the internal market functions. It is quite simple really: a directive appears not to have been fully and properly implemented over a long period of years. Eventually the Member State comes into compliance 20 years after the event. That just cannot be good enough for Parliament or for Europe. In addition, our Committee on Petitions is often the first point of call. It should be an early warning system, but sometimes, as in this case, it happens after the event.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should always be on guard to ensure that implementation takes place properly. And if there is a query about implementation it should be prepared, given the current political climate in Europe, to give unequivocal answers.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has always argued that correspondence regarding possible enforcement proceedings between Member States and the Commission should be shared. It is quite straightforward and I appreciate that your predecessor, Mr Bolkestein, wrote saying that there were reasons for not revealing some of the correspondence. Surely, again in the current political climate, we have a duty to our citizens to get to the bottom of what happens in cases like this and to give them satisfactory answers. Otherwise we have every right to expect the negative responses that we got in France and Holland. If we cannot answer our citizens’ straightforward questions about how we implement EU law, then it is a poor show. I hope, Commissioner, that you will be able to help us more than your predecessor could. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As this question relates to the internal market, there are no grounds to refuse to make such a reply. In November 2003 Commissioner Bolkestein refused to give a proper answer. The committees responsible then asked the President of Parliament to take legal action against the Commission. A few months later it was indicated that the necessary legal requirements would not have been met. Now again, a year later, a new resolution has been tabled.</p>
<p class="contents">Colleagues, we are now eight years on from what was in this case the first of many petitions. It is almost two years since the overwhelming vote on the first resolution on the Lloyd’s affair. Thousands of citizens were driven into bankruptcy and are now, as we speak, still at risk. Some have committed suicide. This is the result of deliberate and systematic deception in the Lloyd’s affair. When it is dealing with a petition, not the role, but the credibility of this Parliament is at stake. If the European citizens write to us to turn to us for help, and Member States fail, a successful case before the European Court of Justice would enhance Parliament’s role in the examination of petitions.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, if no progress is made, I must conclude that Parliament is unable to help the European citizens who ask for its help. In that case, I must apply other techniques in an effort to wake this House; to get justice for tens of thousands of European citizens who are terrorised by this affair. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">From examining the documentation, both the breaches of the Commission and those of the British Government, or at least of its so-called supervisory bodies, stand out, but what also stands out is the gap between the interests of the people and the interest of a very restricted number of plutocrats and speculators.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Lloyd’s affair, what was controlled can be very easily identified, whilst, as chance would have it, who controlled it cannot. The legitimate doubt arises that Directive 73/239/EEC on solvency was disregarded with the conscious acquiescence, not to say complicity, of the European Commission and the competent supervisory bodies of the UK Treasury. A popular Italian proverb says: ‘Every law has its loophole.’ The old saying is also true in terms of the United Kingdom and the European Commission: the fact remains, however, that the business of insurance is a gamble that Lloyd’s has nearly always won and won for centuries.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no sympathy for those who take risks in investing and in financial speculations, because those types of entrepreneur feel no sympathy for small savers, for consumers, for the extremely high number of victims of their dangerous and unscrupulous financial games, and for those who, on the contrary, make money through the sweat of their brow, investing their physical and mental resources and drawing an income from it.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who gamble on probability, a gamble that clearly yields more profit than forgiveness, given that that activity has been practised for centuries, must also accept the risks; the Lloyd’s affair is a symbolic example of the unfair expectations of those who always want to win just because they have large sums of money to risk, not caring less about all those, the great majority, who bet their own lives on their work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need to distinguish between two issues here. The first is the issue of those who invested in Lloyd’s and whether or not the British Government is obliged to compensate them for their losses. The Commissioner quite rightly pointed out that it is an issue that has to be pursued through the UK courts.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what we are specifically dealing with here is the refusal of the Commission to deal properly and in accordance with the Treaties in replying to questions from this House. The Commissioner is explicitly obliged under the Treaties to reply to questions. Tonight, yet again, he has refused to provide all the information that was sought as far back as 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">On another occasion, a previous Commissioner indicated that the UK Government was unhappy with the Commission revealing the information which was being sought by the Committee on Petitions. Since this is a codecision issue – as the insurance directive is a codecision directive – Parliament has at least equal right to the information which is available to the Commission and the Member State. They are not the only ones responsible for the legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">So I appeal to the Commissioner to avoid the ignominy of being brought before the European Court of Justice by this House for failing to comply with the Treaties. It seems to me, Commissioner, that in any event that you may end up in court if you do not comply. I do not know British law that well, but I suspect that if this case was in Ireland the complainants could force you to produce the information. I think it is entirely unfair to deny this House the information to which it is entitled, and you face the real risk of being brought before the European Court of Justice if you do not provide it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When doubts were raised, the Commission started an investigation and issued a letter of formal notice and a supplementary letter of formal notice. The Commission has answered questions put to it by the Parliament to the best of its ability. My predecessor met with representatives of the Committee on Petitions and answered questions in this Chamber, as well as many written questions. I have met with Mr Libicki to discuss this matter, and am here again this evening to answer Parliament’s questions. This is what accountability on the part of the Commission amounts to. The Commission has acted by deciding to open an infringement procedure and acted again by deciding to close the case when it received a satisfactory answer from the UK authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission always endeavours to answer Parliament’s questions to the best of its abilities. In this case, however, the Commission is being asked to pronounce on whether a Member State was in conformity with Community law during a certain period in the past, and under a different legislative regime to that which is now in place. The Commission cannot answer that question because the pre-litigation and litigation proceedings that would have established the answer were not completed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
