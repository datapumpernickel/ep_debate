The loss of human life that has happened there, the economic damage and also the irreparable destruction of the historical and monumental heritage of this most beautiful city have astounded us all.</p>
<p class="contents">Southern Peru is experiencing a tragic situation caused by the earthquake of 23 June, the devastating effects of which have left over a hundred dead, over a thousand injured, and have destroyed over ten thousand homes, leaving over 40 000 people homeless in the provinces of Arequipa, Moquegua and Tacna.</p>
<p class="contents">The earthquake has also caused severe destruction in northern Chile and in Bolivia. The economic damage has set these regions back by more than 20 years. The scale of the disaster has affected infrastructure and economic development. Some towns, villages, districts, settlements and roads have been destroyed by the earthquake.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced by such a disaster, the forces of international solidarity and especially European solidarity were swift to act. The European Union humanitarian office mobilised in record time, and I should like to congratulate those responsible in the European Commission on their rapid intervention with a package of measures which, right from the first few hours, included food aid, temporary accommodation, supplies of products for purifying water and deliveries of medicines. In this context I must also feel proud of the solidarity expressed by the Spanish government and people, who have contributed very generously.</p>
<p class="contents">At times like these we have to look to the future, and the reconstruction and rehabilitation plans must be coordinated quickly and effectively. To these ends, a strategic communication should be drawn up covering all aspects of aid coordination and the reconstruction and rehabilitation plans that I have mentioned for the affected areas.</p>
<p class="contents">This sad human tragedy may be an occasion for Latin Americans to be more united and determined when facing their numerous difficulties, and also for them to deepen their ties and their process of regional integration with, perhaps, larger doses of solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The starting point for Parliament’s resolution is, in effect, the Commission’s rapid action, and I should like to join in congratulating the Commission and particularly the Commissioner, Mr Patten, on this rapid action.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the purpose of our resolution is to remind us that this initial aid is likely to be insufficient, given the extent of the disaster. We have in fact just been visited by the new President-elect of Peru, Mr Alejandro Toledo, who has met members of Parliament and also the Commission and has told them of his needs.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not think this is the moment to adopt a resolution on Peru’s economic policy and, in this respect, we do not consider it prudent to support the amendment tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, since we believe it is a subject that requires rather more time for consideration. Above all, we do not believe it is the right moment to tell the government of Peru how it should prepare its budget for 2002. We do hope, however, that, regardless of the overall context of the resolution, the Commission will over the coming weeks and months consider the special situation of this country, which has been through quite a critical time from a constitutional and economic standpoint, and which now, after an impeccable electoral process, seems to have started on the road to recovery in democracy and with the confidence of the whole population. We hope that, based on these views – I repeat, regardless of what happens here – the Commission will go ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a subject to which the Commissioner, Mr Patten, is quite sensitive: the effectiveness of Community aid. It seems that, in the past, the financial resources earmarked for the Latin American area have not been used fully effectively. Since the start of his mandate, Mr Patten has been concerned with the effectiveness of the operations, and we should like to know whether at this moment (although it may still be premature) the aid that the Community sends is achieving its results, and also what measures he foresees for the development of future aid. While aid is being granted, it is important that it should be monitored and that the Commission should inform us whether in effect this aid that we are approving, which is paid for with our taxpayers’ money, is achieving positive results.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from that, I repeat, I want to join in congratulating the Commission and the Commissioner, Mr Patten. I hope that in this new stage Peru may find an important ally in the Commission and the European Union, and that the Commission may soon present to us proposals for aid for the recovery of Peru and aid for cooperation with the Andean Community, which, as we know, finds itself in difficulties, not only in Peru but also in other countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is indeed important to attempt, as a matter of urgency, to do something to address the damage caused by the terrible earthquake on 23 June this year. The consequences of this earthquake have been described by the previous speakers. I will not go over them again as we already know what they are. I just want to point out that the quake reached 8.3 on the Richter scale. That says it all.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, there is no Richter scale to gauge the extent of the institutional, economic, social and cultural devastation brought about by almost ten years of dictatorship under Alberto Fujimori and his henchman, Vladimiro Montesinos. In a room in this Parliament not far from this one, only the day before yesterday, Alfredo Toledo, the future president of Peru, painted an uncompromising picture of the situation in his country. He described institutions in ruin, an economy in dire straits. He told us that he is going to start the task of rebuilding as soon as he has been sworn in, which should happen on 28 July, Peru’s national holiday. In particular, he told us that he was against impunity for those responsible for this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore believe that Japan should be asked to extradite the former dictator Alberto Fujimori, and that he and his accomplice, Montesinos, should be tried in Peru itself. We call for the 'Truth’ commission, which was promised by the candidates, to be set up, for the committee to establish responsibilities and to carry out the purge that must follow of the armed forces, which colluded with the dictatorship. We also call for the return of the money stolen by the dictatorship from the Peruvian people, which totals 43 billion dollars, and which is probably tucked away in a European bank somewhere. Lastly, our institutions should find out whether the money stolen from the Peruvian people is indeed in our banks.</p>

Up-dated figures from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs indicate that almost 190 000 people were affected and some 35 000 homes damaged or destroyed. Through its humanitarian aid office ECHO, the Commission reacted, and I am grateful for the generous remarks made by the honourable Member, Mr Medina.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission reacted very promptly. A decision to allocate humanitarian aid amounting to EUR 1.15m was taken two days after the earthquake to help meet the first urgent needs of the victims. This is the first time, in fact, that the Commission has made use of its new system for responding immediately to the sudden onset of humanitarian crises which came into operation less than two weeks ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, five emergency humanitarian operations are already under way. The Spanish Red Cross is distributing food aid and emergency relief items for 1 000 families to the tune of EUR 250 000. Oxfam is spending EUR 200 000 on emergency water storage and distribution facilities and sanitation. Save the Children Fund – EUR 300 000 on blankets and tents. Medicos Del Mundo – EUR 100 000 on blankets, medicines, water tanks and plastic sheets for shelter. The International Federation of the Red Cross – EUR 300 000 on shelter, food and support to the rescue efforts for health, water, sanitation and other relief supplies. That is how our emergency relief is being spent and I think it is being spent in sensible ways.</p>
<p class="contents">According to information received from the field, the international response has been generous and the immediate needs seem to be covered. Nevertheless, the Commission services continue to monitor the situation in case additional aid is required.</p>
<p class="contents">A debate on a resolution on the Peruvian earthquake is not perhaps the most appropriate framework to discuss the political situation in Peru, but I would nevertheless like to stress that we are extremely satisfied with the capacity shown by Peru and its transitional government to carry out transparent and clean elections after the political disasters described very effectively by the honourable Member in his maiden speech. We shall look forward to hearing from him many times in the future. It was a pretty vigorous maiden as maidens go!</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union Observation Mission for the elections was extremely positive. Like honourable Members, I discussed the catastrophe and the European response on Tuesday with President Toledo during his visit to Parliament. We want to congratulate the interim government and the people of Peru for the maturity shown in this situation and for the support and cooperation provided to our team in the field.</p>
<p class="contents">I was able to say to President Toledo when he was here with us that the approximately EUR 60m in programmes for the alleviation of poverty blocked by the conduct of the elections in 2000 will now be released. We want to proceed with those projects as rapidly as possible. I follow very much the point raised by Mr Medina, you want to get on with those projects as soon as possible and I know that poverty alleviation is one of the new President's priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">We also want to sit down with the new government to discuss programming our future assistance. The President himself underlined his commitment to reforming the judiciary and making sure that there is in place a rule of law in the institutions to make that rule of law effective. I feel that that is a very important way in which we can see the encouragement of more private investment in Peru and more confidence on the part of the international community.</p>
