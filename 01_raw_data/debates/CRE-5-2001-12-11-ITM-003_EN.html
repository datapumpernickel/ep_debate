Some of you witnessed the progress of the negotiations in situ. As President-in-Office of the Council, I exchanged ideas on several occasions with MEPs who moreover – and that was very practical –had their meeting room immediately adjoining that of the presidency.

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR) </span>On 19 November, the General Affairs Council has been congratulated on the results obtained at Doha, and on the excellent work carried out by our negotiators, Commissioners Pascal Lamy and Franz Fischler, and their colleagues. It is thanks to this work, as well as the cohesion and solidarity shown by the Union through these negotiators, that they were able, in spite of the fact that the situation of the European Union within the WTO was not favourable at the start of the process, to get things back on an even keel and obtain much better results than we might have hoped for.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union, which at all times remained a major player in the conference, was finally able to achieve the main objective it had set itself, of launching a new round of multilateral trade negotiations focusing on trade liberalisation, the strengthening of regulations and the acknowledgement of development needs.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the development dimension is the main thread of what we now call the ‘Doha development agenda’. This is the name, in fact, that has been given to all of the texts adopted. The work programme adopted in view of the multilateral trade negotiations within the framework of the ministerial declaration includes a package of important implementation measures and takes up those unresolved implementation issues that aim more or less for a re-balancing or an amendment of existing agreements within the context of the negotiation agenda relating to single undertakings.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to this, all chapters in the agenda are focused on specific measures to assist developing countries, with regard, for example, to the access of their products to markets, to their special or differential treatment, technical assistance or capacity building.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot over-emphasise the importance of this fifth ministerial conference for the development dimension. It should take place before the end of 2003 and will be a key point in the negotiations. We will need, in fact, to make decisions with regard to further negotiations, notably with regard to investments and competition, issues that will have been studied during the first phase. It is obvious that this will be, for developing countries as well as for others, a very important time for assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Union should be particularly pleased with the approval of the derogation with regard to the partnership agreement between the European Community and the ACP countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioners, the European Union has made a considerable effort in the field of access to medicines. It has managed to bring initially very diverse opinions closer together and has contributed greatly to the final text which was met by approval by all parties.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, the statement about TRIPS and public health has given the developing countries the desired assurance that the TRIPS Agreement is indeed offering flexibility, even without amending that Agreement. Even NGOs have received the Agreement favourably.</p>
<p class="contents">As for further legislation, an important step has been made in order to develop the environmental dimension of world trade. The European Union managed to ensure that negotiations on the environment start without delay, and that the link between the WTO rules and the trade rules of the multi-lateral environment agreements which form part of them becomes more transparent. This is a very important breakthrough.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the negotiation agenda offers scope for expanding the environmental themes during the Fifth Ministerial Conference. However, as is always the case in negotiations, not everything went according to plan, of course. For example, it appeared impossible, despite efforts, to alter the developing countries’ resistance to the introduction of basic labour standards in the trade negotiations. It appeared impossible to make a reference in the ministerial statement to the development of a permanent forum between the ILO and other international organisations, including the WTO. However, the European Union did manage to have the phrase scrapped which would have restricted the dialogue about basic labour standards to the ILO, and that enables us to continue our quest for a permanent forum. Moreover, at the suggestion of the presidency, a statement was added in the shape of this phrase to the conclusions of the General Affairs Council of 14 November in Doha, Qatar, in which the Council and the Commission confirm this objective.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle of future negotiations was also laid down for the so-called Singapore themes which form part of the priorities of European industry and which concern investments, competition, trade facilitation and transparency regarding government contracts. These will be initiated following the Fifth Ministerial Conference on the basis of explicit consensus with regard to its modalities.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also reason for satisfaction in the field of agriculture. The negotiations will aim to further improve market access and dismantle the different types of trade-distorting aid.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the pure trade aspects, serious consideration will also be given to non-trade concerns. Some of you have followed the export subsidies saga from very close range. You know the outcome, but let me assure you that it was nevertheless a difficult journey, and that for a long time it looked like the Commissioners would not succeed in reaching a sound agreement. But they did anyway, and they deserve all our congratulations on that score. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Finally, a last word on transparency. The organisation of internal works at Doha was exemplary. The alternation between plenary sessions, on the one hand, and issue groups, on the other, ensured the necessary combination of transparency and efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">During the plenary sessions, the delegations had the opportunity to express their opinions and to listen to the positions of others, as well as listening to the assessments, I quote, of the President’s friends. These individuals chaired the issue groups, whose objective was to facilitate bilateral and multilateral discussions between WTO members, to harmonise positions and to draw up written agreements. It should be noted that none of the President’s friends were citizens of the European Union or the United States, and that these two regions were not represented at the time further balances in the text were drawn up. I am underlining this because, all too often, there is the tendency to believe that everything that happens at the WTO is a result of constant collusion between the United States and the European Union, and that other countries do not have a say, so this is proof that this is not the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, our respective representatives read the texts at the same time as all the other delegations. Several delegations from developing countries showed their appreciation and satisfaction with the working method used during their closing speeches.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that today we can safely say that we have put the failure of Seattle firmly behind us. The credibility of the WTO has been restored. Furthermore, in the current international context, the success of the conference is a positive sign of international solidarity and confidence in the positive development of the world economy.

We came back from Doha with a WTO that was both stronger and more balanced, which was the key objective of the mandate that the Council and your Parliament had given to the negotiators. So the results very largely lived up to many of the concerns you had expressed in this Chamber, in particular in your two resolutions of 25 October. I will try, in a few words, to show you how they lived up to these concerns, in the light of the Union’s three key objectives: integration of the developing countries, better governance of globalisation and better access to the market for all.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us begin with the first objective, integrating the developing countries in the global economy. That objective is fully and constantly present in every part of the negotiating programme we adopted in Doha. From the point of view of development policy, we have made progress on the four aspects of trade policy that are crucial to development – better access for the developing countries to our markets, better domestic policies, in particular with regard to the investment, competition and public procurement aspects of our work programme; a stronger role for the developing countries in the multilateral negotiation process and, lastly, boosting these countries’ capacity to derive benefit from the liberalisation of trade.</p>
<p class="contents">One point I want to emphasise is the negotiation process. As the President-in-Office of the Council just pointed out – and I agree with her 100% – the working method in Doha was more transparent, which did indeed enable the developing countries, some of whom, as you may remember, had left Seattle frustrated, others furious, to play their full part in the decision-making mechanisms. That is an important new development.</p>
<p class="contents">As for technical assistance for the developing countries, the Commission, together with the Council and, at the appropriate time, Parliament, will have to rethink the way the Union both when it is acting as such and when it is acting through the Member States, is handling the technical assistance programmes for the developing countries in the field of trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to a subject close your hearts, namely the special situation of the least-developed countries, let us remember what was achieved at the third United Nations conference for the least-developed countries in Brussels, which has now been incorporated in the WTO’s work programme. That, too, is good news.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck referred to the declaration on intellectual property rights and health, which, I believe, is fairly typical of what we have achieved, given that the Union made the rather difficult but, in the end, positive decision to try to strike a balance between the United States’ concerns on the one side and the concerns of third countries on the other. That is a specific case in which we acted as intermediaries and basically each side saw the other’s point of view, which finally proved the right approach to take. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> The EU’s second goal is to improve the governance of globalisation. You know what the Commission’s views are on this. Today we face a deficit of multilateral rules, which calls into question the equality between economic players, the transparency of transactions and the preservation of certain social values. This has given rise to fear or concern in some quarters.</p>
<p class="contents">Markets have become globalised more rapidly than institutions and regulatory instruments. This is true in the economic field as in the social and environmental field.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, you know our views in this area; we need to establish coherence between all the aspects of the multilateral system and we need more constant, clear and definite relations between its various pillars. The WTO is one of those pillars. It is not the only one and it cannot support the entire weight of this coherence by itself.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard and, once again, in line with our mandate, Doha represents a considerable step forward. In terms of regulating the markets, global rules on investment, on competition, on public procurement and on trade facilitation now form part of the work programme. Regarding the environment, Doha will help establish greater international coherence by providing for negotiations to clarify the status of the multilateral agreements on the environment in the context of the WTO. As you know, the Union had to struggle hard to obtain this decision. I believe it was right to do so because this is a first step towards establishing greater coherence between the various pillars of international governance, in this case between the trade and environment pillars. In the event of inconsistency or potential conflict, we did not want this pillar to continue depending entirely on the WTO instrument for settling disputes, whatever the virtues of that instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to one aspect of the international governance issues, we did not hide our disappointment at the outcome of the negotiations, although we accepted it. I am referring to the social issues. We did not achieve general agreement on forging the kind of clear link we had hoped to see between the International Labour Organisation and other organisations, including the WTO. We regret that. The developing countries were politically opposed to this idea and we could not overcome their opposition. That is not a reason for giving up. On the contrary, I believe we have to draw on every available multilateral means of putting this idea forward, because it represents the Union’s view and formed part of our mandate, especially as regards strengthening the multilateral aspect of the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Having failed to succeed in relation to this multilateral aspect, we will be developing the other aspects of Community policy, as we have now begun to do, in particular the bilateral and the unilateral parts. From that point of view, the agreement we reached yesterday in the Council, by a qualified majority, on renewing the system of generalised preferences – an agreement that quite considerably strengthens the social conditions on which trade preferences depend – is good news. It shows all those who believe this point is important that if we do not manage to make progress on every front, or at least on the unilateral front, this agreement on the part of the Council, with the assent of your Parliament, which had supported and upheld this position, and with the agreement of the Economic and Social Committee, marked a major step forward yesterday.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of the way the WTO operates, your Parliament had expressed certain concerns. Here we have one piece of good news, namely that Doha was indeed more open and that thanks to the rather clever variable system of plenary meetings, restricted meetings and regional participation, the African continent, for instance, was able to play a very good part in the decision-making. The not so good news is that for the time being no decision has been reached during this negotiating round on reforming the World Trade Organisation itself. To tell the truth, nobody was in favour of this reform, given the inevitable risk of deadlock. I think the question has simply been postponed and that it will come up again before the round we launched in Doha is concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">On the specific question of relations with the national parliaments or your Parliament, the proposal to incorporate a reference to closer association between Member State parliaments was not accepted. This was because of pressure by a number of developing countries that were not really in favour of the idea and because of the American position, which could be described as reluctant, to say the least. In any case, there were not enough representatives of the American parliamentary authorities to deal with this question seriously. So that is where we stand at the moment. In fact, the Commission and Parliament have already been working in the spirit of transparency, information and consultation that we had hoped to promote within the WTO. I believe we are doing so to the satisfaction of those of you who are interested in these matters and I fully intend to continue along these lines.</p>
<p class="contents">Our final objective is the pursuit of liberalisation of trade as such: to liberate trade in goods, services and investments, to contribute to global growth and, therefore, to reducing poverty, provided we make progress with the rules on the fair distribution of trade benefits. In this respect, the results are entirely in line with what we had hoped. In regard to abolishing customs duties on goods, for instance, we are clearly targeting tariff levels. This applies to the liberalisation of services – the timetable has been decided and the negotiations should open up considerable opportunities to EU companies.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, and those of you who were in Doha made sure of this, your concerns about consumer protection, health, education, public service and cultural diversity were taken into consideration. The negotiating programme adopted in Doha certainly does not commit us to go beyond the limits that were set both by the Council and by Parliament in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point concerns agriculture. I will now hand over to Franz Fischler who can tell you a little more about this subject. Here too, however, I believe we achieved our main objective, which was to ensure that the Union remained capable of taking forward the common agricultural policy at a rate that is and will be decided by the EU institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, in my capacity as, shall we say, principal negotiator, let me tell you that one of the keys to success in this business was our work with the Belgian Presidency and, via the Belgian Presidency, with the Member States, whose presence is not always entirely convenient in such circumstances, and with those of you who were there at the meeting. I have said it in public. I think it is perfectly acceptable for me to say it to you in a definitive manner.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fischler,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission. – (DE)</span> Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, in order to convey a realistic impression of what the Doha agreement means for agriculture, I would like to very briefly touch upon the individual points of the Doha declaration. The first part of the declaration concerns the general objective of agricultural negotiations within the framework of the WTO, that is to say the creation of a fair and market-oriented trading system. At the same time it also acknowledges the work that has been done since the beginning of 2000 under the ‘Article 20 negotiations’.</p>
<p class="contents">The next section deals with the traditional three pillars of trade: market access, exports, and competition and domestic support measures. In the case of market access, the text settled on was "comprehensive negotiations aimed at substantial improvements in market access". This reflects the conclusions of the Agriculture Council on 27 September 1999, in which the importance of further liberalisation of agricultural trade as a contribution towards sustainable economic growth was recognised.</p>
<p class="contents">The term ‘comprehensive negotiations’ means that all agricultural products can be covered by the negotiations, and also that all issues should be covered. In this connection we also made it clear that geographical information should also be included here.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to export subsidies, the declaration talks about reductions in all forms of export subsidies, in other words exactly what this House called for in its resolution in October. It is also stated that the negotiations should aim to phase out all forms of export subsidies completely. However, the text also clearly indicates that none of the statements on the three pillars should anticipate the outcome of the negotiations. There is therefore at present no commitment to negotiate the total elimination of export subsidies during this round.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we also know that there is a broad coalition against continuing export subsidies. The Cairns Group, the USA and the 77 Group of developing countries all spoke out against continuing export subsidies. As regards domestic support, the text refers to substantial reductions in competition-distorting domestic support. This is also in line with your own resolution, which called for the rejection of competition-distorting measures, and it corresponds to our own mandate, which commits us to negotiate on domestic support while retaining the concept of the blue box and green box. We consciously chose the word ‘concept’ to indicate that we are perfectly willing to negotiate on the details of the blue box and the green box. The extent of distortion of competition will be a key element of all discussions relating to domestic support.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point is the special and differential treatment of the developing countries. I know that one of your own priorities is to integrate the developing countries in international trade. The wording of the Doha declaration is in accordance with this objective and it also matches the Council mandate of 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the text deals with non-trade concerns. The proposals that the WTO Member States put forward in Geneva in this area are specifically recognised. As you know, the European Union too presented a raft of proposals on the most important non-trade concerns, such as the environment, the development of rural regions, food security, consumer affairs, labelling and animal protection. By specifically recognising non-trade concerns, the Doha declaration allows us to pursue these objectives further in forthcoming negotiations. The last section contains the timetable for agreeing on methodology, 31 March 2003, and the deadlines for presenting the comprehensive drafts. This is to take place before the next WTO ministerial conference, so that agreement on agriculture can be reached at the same time as the overall package, by 1 January 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from the purely agricultural part of the text, I would also like to point out that the section on the TRIPS Agreement also deals with the issue of geographical information. This will enable us to pursue our objectives in the negotiations on geographical information and in the agricultural negotiations, and also in the TRIPS negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in parallel to the decision on the start of the Doha development round, agreement was also reach on the ACP waiver, which allows us to conclude the solution negotiated with the USA and Ecuador to bring an end to the banana war. This means that the proposal the Commission has already put forward can be accepted, as soon as you here in the European Parliament have adopted your position on this, which I hope will happen in the course of this week.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude with the comment that the satisfactory outcome of the Doha Conference does not necessarily mean that the forthcoming agricultural negotiations will now be straightforward. The objectives of the other major WTO members are in some cases very different indeed from our own, but we will do our utmost to secure the European agricultural model and at the same time to negotiate a fair and more market-oriented trading system for agricultural products.</p>
<p class="contents">Things will very much depend on our continuing success in achieving a common approach on the part of the Member States, and your support will assist us in this respect. Another thing that will help us is continuation of the excellent cooperation that we have had with the Council and also within the Commission on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Doha development programme, which includes the liberalisation of trade as well as elements of new rules, stressed the commitment of the developed countries to capacity building in respect of the less developed countries and to helping them implement already existing WTO rules.</p>
<p class="contents">I am firmly of the opinion that the small but boisterous anti-globalisation groups have now had a clear response from the less developed countries represented at Doha. We want to be involved in liberalising world trade and clarifying its rules, as that is also in the interest of the less developed countries. Every country had the opportunity to torpedo any collective decision – nobody did so, however.</p>
<p class="contents">The presence of China and Taiwan at the WTO was also a significant milestone. We must hope that Russia will be able to clarify its own internal structures in such a way as to allow her also to take part.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union’s own goals at Doha at least were successfully achieved. Commissioners Lamy and Fischler deserve our thanks for succeeding in seeing through to the end some tough negotiations that lasted a good number of days. Furthermore, the Council’s internal cohesion remained firm the whole time, something that was obviously necessary for the Union to be able to approve the outcome of the talks. In addition to being involved in the negotiations process itself, Commissioners Lamy and Fischler, together with Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck also, kept us Members of Parliament, who were following the events, well aware the whole time of where things were going. Sustainable development and the inclusion of environmental considerations in trade policy decisions were agreed to be an all-embracing objective in future talks, something that is certainly of crucial importance to us, the countries in the Union. As talks on the trade in agricultural products are also to be conducted in accordance with a comprehensive agenda but without any predetermined conclusion having been reached concerning forms of subsidy and timetables, this difficult matter, too, can now be negotiated peaceably whilst the Union’s common agricultural policy is being reformed.</p>
<p class="contents">Our parliamentary group, which held talks with several delegations that were present at Doha, thought it regrettable that the US Congress did not send their representatives there. As we continue our efforts to develop WTO transparency and parliamentary monitoring of ministerial conferences, the presence of the US Congress is essential. It is also realistic to state that we will only be able to move forward in this matter with the approval of governments. Hopefully, Germany, as we unofficially heard at Doha, will before very long take the matter up formally in the WTO bodies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van den Berg (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, the WTO meeting in Qatar was a landmark achievement, especially for all those who realise that globalisation is one of the twenty-first century’s greatest challenges and that it is a challenge to bring it under democratic and political control. In the view of my group, globalisation desperately needs worldwide rules and global institutions. This means that globalisation can also be at the service of people, and not the other way round. As Commissioner Lamy said, Seattle two years ago failed on all kinds of fronts. It was not transparent, the groups were imbalanced and participation was not well organised. There was also a great deal of fear that, due to this failure, a number of matters which affect all of us greatly, including development, the right to adopt one’s own domestic policy, workers’ rights, and the environment, would suffer badly as a result. It is actually a real achievement for us to have witnessed true change in Qatar after those two years. It constitutes a first step towards a new WTO, in a fight to equip globalisation with rules which are at the service of human values.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is therefore delighted with the outcome of this Fourth Ministerial Conference. Not because we are pleased with all the aspects, far from it. We shall continue to apply pressure and a whole host of things are still missing, but in essence, we made a significant step forward. This fresh step is certainly also of importance in the removal of inequalities between North and South. This is one of the most important things in the globalisation phenomenon as a whole. It is certainly striking to note what we have achieved on the WTO agenda, both in the way in which all kinds of developing countries took part jointly in the debate in a well-organised manner, and with regard to the agenda itself. We wanted a development round, and at least we can now say that there is a development agenda. And needless to say, it will be specific results which will soon be at issue. In this respect, the TRIPS account and public health care are of huge importance. It has been recognised that when it really matters, public health care and the need for the same sometimes transcend intellectual property rights, and that allowance is made for this within intellectual property rules. It is clear that this requires further elucidation, but what is important is what happened there at political level. The recognition as such will persuade many to join a modern and new worldwide WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, the agreements involving the waiver for the Cotonou Agreement of the ACP and EU countries are of crucial importance, for this has helped us bring about an enormous breakthrough in our relations with the ACP countries, a breakthrough which we might not have had otherwise. In the field of environment and trade, we managed to put a number of items on the agenda of which we feared right up to the last minute that they would not make it. This is an enormous leap forward, a taboo has been shattered. It should not become green protectionism, but it is of the utmost importance for us that we have managed to bring it about.</p>
<p class="contents">According to our group, it is a sad state of affairs that we have not actually made any real headway on the score of democracy and transparency, as already stated by Commissioner Lamy too, and on the score of workers’ rights. We may have prevented certain things from reverting back to the old ways, but we have a desperate need for more success in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to conclude by saying that our group has greatly valued cooperation with Commissioners Lamy and Fischler, as well as the President-in-Office, and that the Commissioner’s statement that this House must ultimately approve the Doha results, places us in a fully-fledged, grown-up democracy and a fully-fledged democratic role. We greatly appreciate this, and we rely on a very fruitful campaign in the years to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In our view, without the effective work of the Commissioner and the Council, in cooperation with Parliament, the new round would never have been proposed, let alone launched, and for that we are grateful. It seems to us that the summit at Doha represented the coming together of two themes or two trends within the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">The first theme is the first concerted attempt to accommodate the needs and legitimate complaints of developing countries. We have referred already to the TRIPS Agreement, the text on implementation, US movement on anti-dumping, a chink of light in the European position on agriculture – these to us are very significant developments.</p>
<p class="contents">The second theme or trend is that the talks extended well beyond traditional market access preoccupations and moved towards the development of new rules, competition, investment and, above all, the environment. That again seems to us to be a very welcome development and we are very pleased to see that a balance seems to have been struck – a sensible and workable balance between the needs of developing countries and the need to develop new rules within the World Trade Organisation. Some have suggested – I think my Green friends and other critics of the WTO – that somehow these two things are incompatible with each other and that developing new rules on the WTO is anathema to the interests of the developing countries. We found it particularly bizarre that Green Members of this House and Green campaigners rejected talks on the environment within the WTO, in the name of the developing countries. To us, there is no trade-off between sustainable multilateral environmental disciplines and multilateral attempts at poverty alleviation.</p>
<p class="contents">Now is the time for delivery. Some of the news over the last few days is a little mixed, particularly from the United States, over the concessions which were extracted from the Administration in the fast-track debate and the debate on trade and steel in Washington. We must keep the pressure up to make sure that the momentum that was established in Doha is maintained in the years ahead and we will certainly strive to do so.</p>

For us, with a few exceptions, it was not a success. It was an unedifying example of the richer countries bullying the poorer ones and has prompted many to assert that the so-called victory in Doha was a failure for democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">While it is certainly true the developing countries asserted themselves in a much stronger way than ever before – and that is to be commended – it is also true that the outcome from Doha falls far short of the development round which was promised us. That is not only the view of the Green/EFA Group, but also of the vast majority of NGOs from both north and south, and of many of the southern representatives there as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me remind you of some of the interventions in the Doha plenary debate. The Indian Minister of Commerce, Mr Murasoli Muran, said that the only conclusion that could be drawn is that developing countries have little say in the agenda-setting of the WTO; it appears that the whole process was a mere formality and we are being coerced against our will. Let me remind you of what Jamaica said. Ambassador Mr Randsford Smith said that we regret that the draft texts presented to this ministerial conference, as at the outcome of the Geneva preparatory process, do not sufficiently reflect or capture the position and proposals of developing countries. I could give you many more similar quotations. Let us have a look in a bit more detail at what they really mean.</p>
<p class="contents">There was only a very brief acknowledgement of the need to review implementation issues: that was a key agenda issue for the developing countries going into Doha. The language on the phasing out of agricultural exports subsidies has been substantially watered down, due to EU objections. As a result, farmers in the south will continue to have their livelihoods devastated. As Tanzania's Trade Minister, Mr Iddi Simba, said, the wrong policy on agriculture might lose elections in France, but it loses lives in Africa. There is no commitment to an early phase-out of textiles and garment quotas because of strong resistance from the United States. Demands for development linked to the promotion of food security, which is being promoted by many developing countries, were completely ignored.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Lamy, I do not expect you to agree with this analysis, but at the very least you should acknowledge the very real anger and frustration of the developing countries throughout the conference and pledge that in the negotiations that are now beginning their interests will genuinely be at the forefront of our priorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe we have three good reasons to appreciate the results.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the real involvement of the southern countries and the evidence that multilateralism is effectively beginning to happen. Before Doha we did not have a pre-negotiated agenda; after Doha we have to deal with a whole range of claims put forward by the southern countries. As a result, the WTO, still fragile but better recognised, is therefore strengthened. Of course this is not yet the kind of democratisation the NGOs and European parliamentarians had hoped to see, but there has clearly been progress and Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck is right to emphasise the transparency and improved method seen in Doha. Unlike Caroline Lucas, I was not aware of general anger or frustration; on the contrary, I noted a sense of relief all round because this method enabled us to finally reach some degree of consensus. Let me add, and I was surprised that this was not mentioned in the opening statements, that we are committed to negotiating the reform of the instrument for settling disputes.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, a window has been opened for examining the coherence between social questions and trade rules. Liberalisation is indeed continuing, in particular in order to respond to the southern countries’ interests with regard to market access. Thanks to the European Union, however, and here I believe we can thank Pascal Lamy for his firm stance, we have the beginnings of a broad agenda – the environment, investment and competition can be negotiated on the basis of an explicit consensus. In substance, this is still not much and we can understand why some of the NGOs wanted a more ambitious agenda, one that included the social aspect in particular. If we are to achieve that, however, they and we will have to overcome some major inconsistencies. Indeed we must not conceal the inconsistencies between different interests and claim to always speak in the name of the south. Differences must be expressed if they are effectively to be overcome and that is how we managed to make progress on the question of medicines, when the north-south conjunction proved effective. Similarly, we can make progress on the social aspect only if we carefully reflect on how to help strengthen international trade unionism.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, for the first time, as much importance was attached to implementation as to the new subjects introduced. Here again, I did not interpret the results in the same way as Caroline Lucas. We made progress on the method and thanks to India we had a system not of prior evaluation but of ongoing evaluation during the negotiations: textiles, agriculture, anti-dumping measures, subsidies and even intellectual property were negotiated – with the possibility of renegotiation.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, we still have to make great efforts for the future to ensure that the process runs smoothly and in the right directions and here I have two points to make. The first is that there is a strong risk that the Union’s trade policy will be handicapped by the absence of a common policy. We have a certain lack of cohesion here and it is up to us to clarify our agricultural and industrial social model. My second point is that the social question is emblematic. There is no question of giving up and adhering to the ILO. The European Union must demand the establishment of multilateral social dimensions for development and solidarity. So we still have a lot of work to do on this subject, but this should not frighten us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am satisfied that our negotiators understand the extent of this challenge and – I hope – draw on the benefit of hindsight resulting from our experiences with the current regime.</p>
<p class="contents">From an agricultural perspective, we must not allow the United States to dictate agricultural policy. On the last occasion they insisted on dismantling agricultural support and then proceeded to provide support for United States farmers at a level three times greater than that received by European farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased that in the preparatory talks we seem to have reached a satisfactory agreement on export refunds. From an Irish perspective, export refunds are crucial because of our dependence on exports to third countries. Equally we need to take a strong stand on food imports from outside the EU. We are investing heavily in the implementation of food safety measures and have banned the use of growth promoters. Yet EU farmers are expected to compete with imports from countries where those products are used.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally, in relation to sheepmeat, important to European, and particularly Irish, farmers – badly managed arrangements with New Zealand mean there are no controls to prevent a deliberate New Zealand policy to flood the EU market at peak production periods. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, overloading the WTO now and in the future with too many expectations for too many sectors will jeopardise the achievement of the organisation’s single, fundamental objective: market access, revitalising the stagnant situation of international trade, in the interests of both rich and poor countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Commissioner, with regard to agriculture – let us not forget, before we start to feel too pleased with ourselves, that, ultimately, Europe’s negotiating position, as Mr Fischer explained, was actually an attempt to defend the indefensible, to defend the common agricultural policy. We concern ourselves with working standards in Africa, Asia and South America, and yet, at Doha, we defended the wealthy French peasant farmers against the poor peasant farmers of South-East Asia, Africa and Latin America. This is the bottom line. Therefore, the agenda should not be expanded. Let us concern ourselves rather with the opening up of the markets, especially our rich agricultural and textiles markets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to ask the President, on behalf of the European Parliament, to send a communication to President Shevardnaze calling upon him not only to do everything in his power to solve this crime, but also to make sure at long last that constitutional means are used to ensure that people who work in Georgia and for Georgia are guaranteed appropriate protection, so that this essential work can be done effectively. I regard this incident as a very serious one. We want to do everything to help the South Caucasus, but the South Caucasus itself must also make efforts to protect people entrusted to its care.</p>
