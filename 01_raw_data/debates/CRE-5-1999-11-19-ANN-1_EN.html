<p>In its conclusions concerning the agricultural aspects of the forthcoming Millennium Round, the Agriculture Council has clearly stated its firm will to safeguard the existing - and developing - model of European agriculture based on its multifunctional character.</p>
<p>In the conclusions of its meeting on 27 September 1999, the Council recalled that 'as was decided by the European Council in Berlin, the decisions adopted regarding the reform of the CAP within the framework of Agenda 2000 constitute essential elements of the European Union's position in the forthcoming negotiations shall be founded on the full Agenda 2000 package decided by the European Council'.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Council saw a need to 'take an offensive line within the forthcoming WTO negotiations in order to achieve, inter alia, the following aims: taking full advantage of the expansion in world trade while maintaining and developing the European model of agriculture with its multifunctional characteristics and with high quality and safety standards; placing market liberalisation in a setting which brings international recognition of the constraints imposed on European farmers and agricultural products and does not call into question the principle of the Community preference.'</p>
<p>The aim of developing the existing European model of agriculture based on its multifunctional aspects was particularly highlighted by the Council which expressed its firm resolution to continue developing this model and to act to assert its identity both inside and outside the European Union.</p>
<p>The multifunctional nature of agriculture has been recognised in a wider context: at their meeting in March 1998, OECD Ministers noted that 'because of its multifunctional character, agriculture plays a particularly important role in the life of rural areas'. This is especially true in the case of European agriculture which has its own specific nature and characteristics related to its territorial coverage and the existence of different regions, to the size of its rural population and the large number of family farms, to the diversity of its products and differences in its yields and to the multiple roles increasingly taken on by it.</p>
<p>It follows from what I have just said that the Council recognises that family farms constitute one of the basic elements of the European multifunctional agricultural model - a model which the Council has undertaken to develop, thus ensuring the future of such farms.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0594"></a>

Both Regulations harmonise rules of production, labelling and inspection for organic production, and constitute in this way guidelines on how to assess 'organic production claims' in the Community.</p>

<p>Already in 1986, the Council issued Regulation 3528/86 on protecting the Community’s forests from atmospheric pollution. This measure, which came into effect on 1 January, 1987 and has been extended several times, is, at present, due to last for 15 years, and before its expiry on 31 December 2001, the Commission will provide the Council with a report on how this regulation has been applied.</p>
<p>For this reason, the Council urged the Commission to reinvestigate measures to prevent atmospheric pollution in connection with the resolution passed on 14 and 15 December 1998 on forestry strategy in the EU. The objective is to continually assess and improve the efficiency of the European monitoring system relating to the health of Europe’s forests, taking account of all possible effects on the forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>In the resolution in question, the Council also considers it essential that its forestry strategy inter alia promote, in compliance with the rules of the open market economy, the use of environment-friendly products such as wood and other products from forests that have been managed and used sustainably, and also support forestry and the wood processing industry, as they are important for income, employment and other factors that affect the quality of life.</p>
<p>In addition, the European Forestry Information and Communication System (EFICS) was introduced in 1989, and this system, again in compliance with last year’s Council resolution, should be developed in order to acquire better and more reliable data on forests, with an emphasis on the importance of cooperation with the relevant NGOs and international organisations.</p>
<p>Finally, the Community and the Member States try to promote in a systematic and coordinated way the sustainable management and use of forests, their protection and their development, when implementing a pan-European process for the protection of forests and cooperation as agreed with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, and also within the framework of global conferences on the protection of Europe’s forests.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0605"></a>

In June 1998, the Council laid down guidelines for EU policy in relation to third countries in matters concerning the death penalty. The EU’s basic aim is to abolish capital punishment worldwide. To realise this aim, the Council is urging countries where the death penalty still exists to bring in a moratorium on executions, and is calling for minimum standards to be applied. Furthermore, it is asking countries to associate themselves with international legal instruments banning the death penalty.</p>
<p>The EU produced an initiative, in accordance with its guidelines, by proposing for the first time a motion for a resolution on the death penalty in the fifty-fifth session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva in 1999. This initiative succeeded very well: it was sharper in tone than former resolutions, and, furthermore, it had more supporters – 72, as opposed to 65 in 1998. The EU also organised a panel discussion on the death penalty at the session of the Commission on Human Rights, which was attended by NGOs and government representatives from different countries.</p>
<p>The Council has just decided to continue with its policy, according to which it will raise the issue of capital punishment in multilateral forums, and it decided for the first time to propose a motion for a resolution on the death penalty in the general assembly of the UN (Session 54)). The resolution will urge all countries that still have the death penalty to impose a moratorium on executions with the purpose of abolishing capital punishment entirely. The Council believes that this EU initiative will give greater strength to the international trend to abolish the death penalty.</p>
<p>In addition to the initiatives in international contacts undertaken by the EU, there are situations when the Union will intercede in individual cases. The European Union is especially worried about cases where minimum standards are being violated. For example, when the death penalty is used for the most serious crimes of all, it should never be used with people who were below the age of 18 when the crime was committed, pregnant women, mothers or the mentally ill. The European Union also considers it very important that minimum standards are acknowledged, which are, for example, basing the sentence on clear and convincing evidence, the competent jurisdiction of a court, following correct procedures and adequate legal aid.</p>
<p>In the case of Joaquín José Martínez, the European Union will closely follow what ensues from taking the case to the Florida Supreme Court. If the outcome is negative, the European Union is ready to make official contact on the matter on the initiative of one of its Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0607"></a>

<p>The EU is actively promoting the entry into force and universal adherence to the CTBT; the Council has to that end adopted a Common Position last July. On the basis of the Common Position, the EU during September carried out demarches by the Troika to all those countries on the list of 44 countries specified by the Treaty and whose signature and ratification is necessary for its entry into force, but which have not yet done so, calling on them to sign and ratify the CTBT without delay. The EU also participated actively in the conference held in Vienna on October 6-8 to facilitate the entry into force of the CTBT in accordance with Article XIV of the Treaty, which contributed to building political support for the goal of early entry into force of the CTBT.</p>
<p>At the European Council meeting in Tampere on 16 October, the Member States reiterated their commitment to intensify their efforts to bring the Treaty into force at the earliest opportunity.

<p>The question of surveillance, as the honourable Member knows, is at present being looked into by the competent bodies of the Council in connection with a proposal for a convention on mutual legal redress in criminal matters. This proposal is based on Article 34 (2)(d) of the Treaty on the European Union. It particularly reconfirms the rules of legal surveillance in cases in which legal investigations being undertaken within the territory of the Member States of the European Union extend across borders. The European Parliament has been heard concerning the proposal for a convention, which was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (C 251, 2 September 1999).</p>
<p>Regarding planned action by the Council concerning the protection of people’s rights in this area, it would seem important to point out that all Member States have ratified the convention on the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and that there is special mention in the Treaty on the European Union of a respect for human rights as one of the cornerstones of the Union.

<p>The honourable Member’s question relates to the work of the Council, on the one hand with regard to the external air and sea border checks carried out by the Member States, and, on the other, with regard to the reasons for migration and refugees coming from some African countries.</p>
<p>We have taken action especially within the framework of the Schengen Agreement to make external air and sea checks by Member States more effective, and with the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam this action has now been included in the European Union Code. Although Member States implement this action, the Council monitors their effective enforcement via the competent bodies. For example, we embarked on practical action, in cooperation with selected African countries, to prevent illegal immigration by air or sea on the basis of a Schengen executive committee decision on the coordinated use of document experts made on 18 December 1998. In addition, the Schengen executive committee adopted, through its decision of 28 April 1999, a plan for reciprocal visits by contact persons, who will act as advisors and support in the implementation of external border security and control.</p>
<p>In addition to the Schengen code, this sort of practical action is also being developed in the name of the whole of the EU on the basis of EU codes that already exist, in particular the common position established on 25 October 1996, which concerns assistance and initiation work in connection with border crossings in third countries. Such measures, which are coordinated through the competent bodies of the Council, do not at present, however, affect any African countries.</p>
<p>Regarding the reasons for migration and refugees coming from African countries, we would refer to the action plan for Morocco, which the Council adopted on 11 October 1999. The plan is one of five action plans, each of which defines a comprehensive and consistent approach, with attention being paid to the situation in the main countries that migrants and refugees come from and/or pass through. For each country selected, the action plans will contain proposals for a coherent and balanced combination of different EU schemes in the areas of foreign affairs and development aid, as well as humanitarian and economic aid.</p>
<p>In the action plan for Morocco, it is considered that Morocco is a country that people leave from or pass through on their way to Europe, for economic reasons. The action plan recommends mainly the following: to exploit existing channels in order to better compile relevant information, to disseminate correct data on immigration, to develop strategies to prevent the smuggling of illegal immigrants, and to promote measures to try to implement repatriation agreements. We are promoting direct foreign investment, vocational training and encouraging entrepreneurship and small businesses. We will facilitate voluntary repatriation and resettlement as well as help Moroccans legally resident in EU countries adapt to society.</p>
<p>The European Council that met in Tampere on 15 and 16 October 1999 considered that the first action plans adopted by the Council are useful, and asked the Council and the Commission to report back on their implementation at the European Council convened for December 2000.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0635"></a>

<p>According to the information received by the Council at the end of September, 8,960 people from minority groups are recorded to have returned to the Serbian Republic in 1999. The present estimate is at least double that figure, as many who have returned are not registered.</p>
<p>The EU continues to give its full support to the efforts of High Representative Wolfgang Petritsch. The High Representative has said that the return of those belonging to minority groups is one main focus of his work. He has recently proposed a package of reforms on property legislation, which other international organisations working in Bosnia-Herzegovina fully support, including the UN peacekeeping forces, the UN delegate for refugees, the OSCE and the SFOR. The reforms of property legislation will remove one of the greatest obstacles to the restitution of lawfully owned property and thus to the return of refugees. The EU expects the return of those representing minority groups to return in both directions as a result. In addition, the EU has given the returning migrants financial support through the European Community humanitarian assistance office.</p>
<p>It must be said that the return of those representing minority groups to the Serbian Republic also depends on external factors, such as the return of Serbian refugees from the Serbian Republic to Croatia.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0640"></a>

<p>The Council is committed to a democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and fully supports the UN civilian operation efforts in Kosovo in order to achieve this goal. For this reason, the Council expects all sides to fully implement Resolution 1244 of the UN Security Council in all respects. The EU and its Member States are investing heavily in personnel and funding in the reconstruction of Kosovo and restoring order there. The EU is paying particular attention to the fourth pillar of the UN civilian operation in Kosovo. This pillar is under EU command and it concerns responsibility for reconstruction and financial resuscitation.</p>
<p>The Council severely condemns the continuation of ethnic violence. With the help of the UN civilian operation in Kosovo and the peacekeeping forces there we must do all we can to end the violence. Full advantage should be taken of negotiating mechanisms with local leaders working within the framework of the UN civilian operation in Kosovo. All inhabitants of Kosovo, irrespective of ethnic origin, must be able to stay or return there and live in peace without harassment or intimidation. This was and is the basis of the EU’s firm commitment in Kosovo.</p>
<p>The stability of the countries in the area is vital for the stability of the whole region. Consequently, the Council is fully committed to respecting the territorial integrity of the countries in the area. The European Union will play a leading role in implementing the Stability Pact, which aims to support the countries of Southeast Europe in their efforts to promote peace, democracy, a respect for human rights, and economic prosperity and stability in the whole region.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0655"></a>

<p>The conclusions of the Symposium held in Brussels on 21-22 October for the foundation of a European Museum, with the financial backing of the EU, have provoked some highly negative reactions and anger in the Greek people but also among experts. The view that the history of Europe really begins with Charlemagne and that it develops in opposition to Byzantium not only distorts history but attempts by means of the Museum and the Great Book of Europe to indoctrinate Europeans with ignorance, racism and intolerance. When Ancient Greek and Roman culture are removed from Europe's history, when Byzantium is actually considered as an enemy, Europe is reduced to crusades and conquerors, to colonies and violence. It is noteworthy that the President of Parliament and present and former presidents and members of the European Commission participated in the Symposium.</p>

This has provoked a great deal of protest from a number of people in Sweden who are immigrants and who quite rightly see this requirement as discriminatory. Indicating the holder's country of birth does not in any way promote traffic safety in the Member States and hence does not serve any purpose on a driving licence. According to the officials responsible at the Commission, Sweden is the only country to have complied with this Directive by introducing a letter code for the country of birth on its citizens' driving licences. Other Member States have interpreted the Directive in such a way that it is not possible to tell from a driving licence where its holder was born.

<p>The honourable Member is correct when she states that Community driving licence models - both the paper model and the credit card format - require the place of birth of the licence holder to be mentioned.</p>
<p>The necessity of indicating the place of birth derives from the need of certain Member Sates to individualise a licence holder by means of a supplementary criterion in addition to the surname, first name and date of birth of the licence holder.</p>
<p>Such a requirement was originated by the Vienna Convention of 1968 and was retained by the Council when adopting Directives on driving licences<a href="#defann_24_3" name="refann_24_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The obligations imposed by Directive 91/439/EEC apply equally to all of them and have been transposed accordingly.</p>
<p>However, the relevant provisions do not state in what way this indication has to be carried out. The indication of the place of birth may thus differ considerably: the full address, the city of birth, a postal code, the country of birth are all acceptable forms of indication that may be used. A certain room for manoeuvre is permitted whilst still staying within the spirit of the Directive.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Commission did not object to the request by the Swedish authorities to indicate the place of birth by means of a code.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission has explained in the recent meeting of the Committee for Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism that there are currently reasonably good prospects for a positive outcome in 2001 of the ongoing activities of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) on the development of a new noise stringency standard. These prospects may offer the Community the possibility of making a strategic choice between the entry into force of the Hushkits Regulation on 4 May 2000 with the ensuing risk of a conflict that might jeopardise the development of a new ICAO noise standard and the adoption at ICAO level of a noise standard with an increased environmental benefit compared to the Regulation. As the United States have confirmed their willingness to fully contribute to the successful completion by 2001 of the ICAO activities, the Commission could accept under certain conditions to propose a further suspension of the date of application of Council Regulation 925/1999 (EC) if this suspension can be supported by the de-escalation of the present US pressures for a withdrawal of the Regulation. This strategic choice is, therefore, dependent upon the quality of guarantees that the United States will be able to give.</p>
<p>It is obvious that any proposal aimed at amending the Hushkits Regulation can only be adopted with the full involvement of the European Parliament in the framework of the codecision procedure.</p>
<p>As set out in the Commission Communication of 29 September to the Council and the European Parliament on progress made in the consultations with the United States on the noise stringency issue, the inherent characteristics of the ICAO process make it impossible at this stage to give a 100% guarantee about the final outcome of this process.

<p>The honourable Member is right in saying that in general there is in Central and Eastern European countries (CEEC) a railway network which functions reasonably well. In fact, for over 50 years most candidate countries followed a policy which distorted demand in favour of monopoly public transport and railways.</p>
<p>However, the priority of most candidate countries now lies clearly on extending and improving the road network, for political reasons as well as a result of market demand.</p>
<p>In the last few years, however, the Community has supported rail development and significant Community financing has been granted, under the PHARE programme, for railway infrastructure investment as well as for technical assistance for the restructuring of the railway companies. For example, the single largest PHARE contract ever signed in the Czech Republic concerns the modernisation of a railway section in Corridor IV<a href="#defann_27_1" name="refann_27_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, with a contribution of EUR 34 million. Similar large-scale projects have been or are being supported in other candidate countries.</p>
<p>In the draft Accession Partnerships with the candidate countries, issued recently by the Commission, it is proposed that railways be considered as a medium-term priority. This is to say that the required efforts of alignment with the acquis in this sector should begin in the course of the year 2000, and that assistance under the pre-accession financing instruments will then be available to secure progress.</p>
<p>The Commission, in liaison with the EIB, and the relevant International Financial Institutions are coordinating their respective financial assistance instruments, within the framework of a Memorandum of Understanding, with a view to fulfilling in an optimal manner the priorities set out in the Accession Partnerships. This includes in particular assistance to the railway sector in the CEECs.</p>
<p>In the future, large-scale infrastructure investment measures will be covered by the so-called Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-Accession (ISPA), which will come on stream in January 2000 with a yearly budget of more than EUR 500 million for transport. One of the features of the ISPA strategy for the selection of transport projects, which will soon be approved, concerned the promotion of railway transport and a significant number of proposals in the pipeline for financing are for railway infrastructure projects.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The drawing up of plans to return property comes within the area of competence of Member States, and not the Union. The Commission’s authority to comment on this issue is therefore limited. What is clear is that the Commission would welcome the passing of a law concerning the restitution of private property.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue to follow developments closely in this connection and will make a further statement on this in its next report, provided that the law has been passed by then.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0648"></a>

<p>1. The European Convention on Human Rights, within the meaning of Article 6 of the Amsterdam Treaty on European Union, establishes the basis of the principles to be applied by the Union in this area. Even if it does not explicitly deal with the problems of disabled people, the rights of these persons are recognised in a general sense.</p>
<p> In addition, these rights are specifically recognised by the European Social Charter.</p>
<p>2. With reference to these texts, in its reports on the progress made by applicant countries towards accession, the Commission has made it clear that, in its opinion, the rights of disabled people are an integral part of human rights which these countries must observe within the meaning of the political Copenhagen criteria. The Commission has therefore observed and analysed </p>
<p>. the adoption and transposition of the relevant law that entered into force in Hungary on 1 January 1999 and the difficulties that still remain there,</p>
<p>. the situation in Romania over the course of 1998 and the progress achieved in 1999,</p>
<p>. the problems faced by certain disabled people in Latvia, as well as</p>
<p>. the progress made in Estonia and the situation in Slovenia.</p>
<p>In the opinion of the Commission, these analyses and statements should contribute to an improvement in the situation in the countries concerned as regards disabled people and also other human rights.</p>
<p>3. It should also be pointed out in a general context that by the time of their accession, applicant countries will have to have transposed the European Employment Strategy which contains guidelines on the subject of the disabled and the labour market.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0667"></a>

<p>Austria notes with concern that all applicant countries display serious shortcomings in their environmental and energy policies. There are two possible solutions here: either the maximum possible alignment of standards in the areas of environment and energy policy at the actual time of accession by the individual countries or generous transitional periods. Undeniably, the first option will require substantial financial resources if standards are to be aligned in good time. The question as to who is to provide these resources has not been clarified. The second option would lead to a state of affairs in which, at one and the same time, the opportunities of the internal market can be exploited by the applicant countries but European environmental and energy standards do not need to be complied with in the medium term: this would result in serious distortions of competition.</p>

<p>The honourable Member is correct as regards the shortcomings of the applicant countries in terms of environmental protection and energy policy. Certainly, suitable solutions have to be found, inter alia, in the form of transitional measures.</p>
<p>The Community needs a large internal market that functions smoothly and that guarantees a better protected environment for all its citizens. Environmental pollution does not stop at borders or customs authorities. Our markets are already closely interdependent and they are becoming increasingly integrated year by year. We should not therefore be asking ourselves the question, as is often the case, whether imminent enlargement with transitional measures would be better or whether deferred enlargement without transitional measures would be preferable. Rather it is a question of giving precedence to the most pressing problems and establishing priorities. The internal market for energy presupposes reasonable energy prices that cover costs and efficient regulatory mechanisms in all countries and we will have to ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken even before accession. Framework regulations on the environment which form the basis of all future practical measures are another example. As regards the Accession Partnerships, this question therefore numbers among the short-term priorities.</p>
<p>In all of this, it should not be forgotten that everyone will benefit from the extension of our environmental and energy standards to other European States: New markets are opening up for the European economy and the citizens of Europe will live in a better protected environment.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0549"></a>

<p>At this stage, the Commission does not intend to take a particular initiative with regard to the sale of organic products in canteens.</p>
<p>Organic farming is a production method which currently is already strongly supported throughout the whole marketing chain by the particular protection given in the framework of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91. Moreover, the Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund provides for possibilities of financial support to organic farming in particular in the framework of its chapter VI, agri-environment.</p>

<p>The preparation of meals for canteens and their presentation as resulting from organic production requires that certain specific inspection measures provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 be respected, in order to ensure the origin of the products sold from organic production.</p>

<p>The UNDCP has published the results of an annual survey of opium production, which show that estimated total raw opium production in Afghanistan has more than doubled in a year, rising from 2,100 tonnes in 1998 to 4,600 tonnes in 1999. The area devoted to opium cultivation has increased by 43%, from 64,000 to 91,000 hectares. 97% of opium production in 1999 is in areas under Taliban control and the number of Afghan districts where it is grown has risen from 73 to 104. Global opium production has increased from 3,750 tonnes to 6,000 tonnes - an increase of 60%.</p>
<p>For some years, the UNDCP has been engaged in costly intensive programmes to eradicate the cultivation of opium poppies in Afghanistan, which are directly managed by the Taliban, who are known for the violent and segregationist system they have forced on the country. The EU budget provides funding for the UNDCP and its programmes, including the one involving Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Given the prevailing political and economic climate in Afghanistan, and in the absence of a reliable partnership with legitimate public authorities, the Commission considers that there is limited scope for effective drug control intervention inside Afghanistan. It has provided and continues to assist the Afghan civilian population through humanitarian aid. The Community is aware that alternatives to opium production are normally not competitive economically and strict law enforcement mechanisms are necessary to support them. The Taliban have a direct interest in the opium and heroin trade and have tried to link it with international recognition. The Commission has therefore not financed and UNDCP alternative crop development programmes in Afghanistan either prior to, or since, the emergence of the Taliban movement. It continues however to monitor the activities of UNDCP and has noted the quality of recent analytical work undertaken on various aspects of the drug problem. The only activities financed by the Community in the field of drugs in Afghanistan relate to small NGO projects for treatment and prevention services for drug addicts and drug demand reduction. This will be helpful in eventually designing effective programmes when favourable conditions exist to address the issue in official partnership with a recognised government in Afghanistan.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0560"></a>

<p>The Extraordinary European Council held in Tampere made progress towards a European legal area comparable to the Single Market or the EMU in terms of width and depth. Achieving this ideal to the full will take time; in the meantime, simple, yet pragmatic and efficient steps can be and are being taken in so far as out-of-court dispute settlement is concerned.</p>
<p>On 30 March 1998, the Commission adopted Recommendation 98/257/EC on the principles applicable to the bodies responsible for out-of-court settlement of consumer disputes.</p>
<p>This recommendation sets out principles for all bodies responsible for out-of-court settlement of consumer disputes. The principles are: independence, transparency, adversarial principle, effectiveness, legality, liberty and representation. The Recommendation encourages Member States to identify bodies respecting all the principles and to notify the Commission thereof with a view to building a network of these bodies. At the Consumer Council on 8 November, the responsible Member of the Commission reminded Member States which had not yet reacted, to notify the Commission about their respective systems.</p>
<p>The Commission Communication of the Action Plan for implementing the Financial Services Framework, <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=99&amp;nu_doc=0232">COM (99) 232</a>, includes the initiative to create a network of existing out-of-court structures in the area of financial services with a view to improving the opportunities for consumer redress in cross-border transactions. This initiative fits perfectly into the overall strategy identified by the 1998 Recommendation.</p>
<p>Apart from this, the Commission attaches major importance to the issue of access to justice. Particularly in the light of the Tampere Conclusions, the Commission is currently examining ways in which cross-border legal protection of consumers (including those using financial services) can be improved.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0561"></a>

<p>The Commission has adopted a final negative decision on the land acquisition scheme at reduced prices in former East Germany. For certain beneficiaries, the reduced price constitutes compensation for loss suffered in the past; however, this is not true for newly settled farmers. For this category, the measure constitutes state aid. The aid rate is higher than the rates the Commission normally accepts for the purchase of farmland outside less favoured areas. In addition, the aid in question is discriminatory as most beneficiaries must have been resident in former East Germany on 3 October 1990, a condition that in practice can only be fulfilled by (East) German nationals.</p>
<p>The German authorities have abided by the Commission decision which has led to a stand-still of land sales. On 25 August 1999, an amended law has been notified which enlarges the potential group of beneficiaries and strikes out any residency requirement on a given date. Furthermore, the aid rates would be brought into line with the aid rates usually accepted by the Commission.</p>
<p>At present, we are examining whether the new arrangements exclude any discrimination. Additional information has been requested from Germany in this respect. Once all the information is available, the Commission has to take a decision about the compatibility with the provisions in the Treaty concerning state aids within a period of two months.</p>
<p>Should the Commission decide that the measure is incompatible, it will not be legally possible for Germany to apply for an approval of the land acquisition programme in its original form, for which the Commission has already given a final negative decision.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0568"></a>

<p>A – The electricity grid link between Spain and Morocco, partly financed by an EIB loan, was intended to enable Spain to supply Morocco with electricity at extremely competitive rates during the summer period when a considerable energy deficit is experienced. The amount of energy which this line can carry is of the same order as that produced by a large power plant. This electricity line will therefore have the opposite effect to the construction of a nuclear power plant.</p>
<p>B – There is no question, in supporting the construction of the Morocco-Spain electricity cable, of thereby promoting nuclear energy production in Morocco for exporting onwards into Europe. The Tan-Tan nuclear reactor project would consist of a very small unit (10 MW) intended for seawater desalination.</p>

<p>The Commission last assessed Greece's performance in relation to the convergence criteria in the Convergence Report of March 1998. According to Article 122 (ex-109k) of the EC Treaty, the Commission and the ECB shall report to the Council on the progress made in fulfilling the conditions for participation in the single currency at least once every two years, or at the request of a Member State with a derogation. This means, first, that the same convergence criteria will be applied to Greece as for the other Member States for assessing the achievement of a high degree of sustainable convergence; and second, that the Commission will examine the fulfilment by Greece of the convergence criteria in the year 2000, possibly at the request of the Greek authorities.</p>
<p>According to the Treaty provisions, the Commission and the European Central Bank shall report to the Council on the progress made by Greece in the fulfilment of its obligations regarding economic and monetary union. Then, after consulting the European Parliament and after discussion in the Council meeting in the composition of the Heads of State or Government, the Council makes the final decision on the basis of a proposal from the Commission. In between the formal reports, the Commission is not carrying out a formal assessment of the convergence performance of the Member States with a derogation. However, the Commission closely monitors the economic performance and policies of the Member States in the context of the regular surveillance exercise, including the excessive deficit procedure.</p>
<p>As regards economic developments, it is evident that Greece has made significant progress with respect to the fulfilment of the convergence criteria laid down by the Treaty. Public finances have improved: the government deficit was below 3% of GDP in 1998 and the debt ratio has been on a downward path since 1996, although it is still above 60% of GDP. The Greek drachma has participated in the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary System since March 1998, and in the new Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II) since January 1999. The differential of long-term interest rates with the euro area has narrowed. Finally, the inflation rate is on a declining path and has reached 1.5% yoy (HICP) in September.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0573"></a>

<p>The damage caused to the Attica Psychiatric Hospital by the destructive earthquake of 7 September 1999 has been of particular concern to the Commission. In an effort to redress the adverse situation that emerged at the Hospital following the earthquake, the Commission has been discussing a series of measures with the Greek authorities along the following lines:</p>
<p>1. Special measures for the immediate transfer and temporary housing of patients who live at present in overcrowded accommodation, through co-financing renting of buildings and the recruitment of additional qualified staff (mental health professionals, nursing staff) to cope with the increased need for staff arising from the dispersion of activity in different buildings and locations.</p>
<p>2. The revision of actions for the de-institutionalisation of patients, that had already been agreed with the Greek authorities in the 1994-99 CSF for Greece, in the light of the extraordinary circumstances following the earthquake with a view to accelerating the effort through the immediate transfer of patients ready for de-institutionalisation to out-of-hospital structures (apartments, hostels).</p>
<p>The above activity will be implemented against the background of a broader operational plan, which is at present being compiled by the competent Greek authorities, for the transformation of the Attica Psychiatric Hospital into a modern psychiatric hospital for patients referred to it for more specialised therapy by other mental health services. This plan will include both the required infrastructure works as well as the operational interventions to achieve the objective set with particular emphasis on patient de-institutionalisation and the creation of the required out-of-hospital structures and sector specific mental health services.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As the honourable Member may be aware, the Commission investigates all notified concentrations with a Community dimension to assess whether they will significantly impede competition in the common market. Although it is true, that, for example, in the package tour sector, a concentration and consolidation process is ongoing, it is not true that a monopoly situation has been or would be created in any Member State. On the contrary, the application of the merger control law by the Commission has proven to be an efficient instrument for maintaining and developing effective competition within the common market, in avoiding the creation or strengthening of dominant positions.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to draw the attention of the honourable Member to a recent decision of 22 September 1999 in which the Commission has prohibited the acquisition by Airtours of First Choice in the UK leisure travel market. The take-over would have created a market structure in which the remaining three large vertically integrated companies would collectively have had a dominant position.</p>

<p>The Commission attaches the utmost priority to the quality of childcare in crèches as an important part of its overall social policy. The health and safety of the children is vital and provision must be beyond reproach. The Commission will take all necessary measures to ensure the security of the children in crèches.</p>
<p>Significant improvements have been proposed to secure the prevention of abuse. The Commission has prepared a set of internal guidelines that would provide the staff working in the crèches with a set of instructions and administrative rules to be followed in the even of suspicion or complaints concerning the abuse of children attending the crèches. These guidelines were submitted to the relevant Belgian public body - ONE (“Organisation de la naissance et de l'enfance”)/Kind &amp; Gezin for consultation in September of this year. The Commission expects to receive the reply very shortly. For the staff employed in the crèches, a training programme centres on issues relating to child abuse is under way. The programme will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2000. Improvements are also required to relieve overcrowding in certain crèches and preparatory action to achieve that is being undertaken.</p>
<p>The general policy which requires that the safety of children is ensured is followed in the crèches that are directly managed by the Commission, and in those in which management is subcontracted. As a result, the Commission ensures that the relevant established standards are respected in terms of education, health and medical follow-up, teaching and management staff, the general environment and relations with parents. In this area, the Commission follows the guidelines and recommendations of the ONE/Kind &amp; Gezin.</p>
<p>In addition the Commission continues to pursue its contacts with the Belgian public bodies responsible for matters relating to young children, ONE/Kind &amp; Gezin, with the purpose of setting up a neutral, professional and independent system of control and evaluation of the service offered by the Commission crèches.</p>
<p>The company responsible for the management of the Clovis crèche, Esedra, was chosen following a call for tender published in 1995, which set out the necessary organisation, operational and educational requirements, on the basis of a list of technical specifications.</p>
<p>A number of companies replied to the call for tender and in 1995, following the use of the established procedures, Esedra was considered to be the company that responded best to the requirements and specifications which had been set out, both in terms of management and its education programme.</p>
<p>The current contract with Esedra runs, at the latest, to 30 July 2000. The decision to maintain the contract with Esedra in 1997 and 1998 was taken because the Commission took the view that at that time there was no evidence of serious failures by the company in terms of the management and running of the Clovis crèche. It was not deemed appropriate, at that time, to prejudge the outcome of the investigations that were then under way.</p>
<p>The Commission has decided, however, to launch an early call for tenders with a view to concluding a new contract for the management of the Clovis crèche. The first public indication of the Commission's intention to conclude a new contract was published in May of this year, and was republished in July in order to ensure a greater degree of competition. Seven offers were received. When the procedures connected with the tender have been completed, the current contract will end.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0577"></a>

The region, which accounts for over 30% of the country's landmass has received less than five percent of European infrastructure funds coming to Ireland since 1994 and not surprisingly lags behind the rest of Europe at 60% of EU GDP. There is deep concern that the continued absence of real regionalisation will perpetuate these comparatively low levels of investment in much needed infrastructure and that regional bodies will not be permitted to have a sufficiently strong role in the allocation of EU funds in the regions. Should this be the case, can I ask the Commission to fulfil the very welcome promise made by Commissioner Barnier at the hearing to visit the region and ensure that all actors involved are given a fair voice in decision making?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Up to the present, Ireland has been defined as a single region for the purposes of European regional policy with a single Objective 1 Community Support Framework under the responsibility of the central government. The Commission has encouraged the involvement of regional partners in the programmes co-financed under the Structural Funds in Ireland in accordance with the regulations. For the future, Ireland has been redefined for the purpose of European regional policy as two regions with the result that the new Border, Midland and Western region will be eligible under Objective 1 in its own right for the period 2000-2006. This change will, on its own, tend to have the effect of introducing a more decentralised approach to programme management in Ireland.</p>
<p>In relation to infrastructure spending, the Border, Midland and Western region has been allocated, during the period 1994-1999, some 33% of the total expenditure across the country, although it is recognised that there are gaps remaining in infrastructure endowment as compared to other parts of the country.</p>
<p>The Irish Government is, at present, preparing the National Development Plan which will form the basis for the negotiations with the Commission on the use of Structural and Cohesion Funds in 2000-2006. One of the Commission's priorities for the Objective 1 region will be the development of a regional strategy for Borders, Midland and Western region with an effective management structure and partnership at regional level. It is, however, the national government that is responsible for deciding the appropriate administrative arrangements at regional level.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0579"></a>

<p>The accident of 30 September in the JCO Ltd. uranium conversion plant in Tokaimura and the incident of 4 October in the Wolsong-3 nuclear power plant in South Korea highlighted once more the importance of ensuring the highest levels of safety in installations dealing with radioactive materials. The accident in Tokaimura showed that the question of nuclear safety is not circumscribed to nuclear power plants but affects all installations where significant amounts of radioactive material are handled.</p>
<p>The European Commission attaches great importance to the question of nuclear safety, and will continue to do so. The accident at Tokaimura will lead to an increased effort concerning facilities other than nuclear power plants, namely in the area of training of operators and safety culture.</p>
<p>The research on nuclear fission is part of the Framework Programme of the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) for research and training activities. The framework programme is implemented through direct research actions performed by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) and indirect (shared cost) actions managed by the Research Directorate-General.</p>
<p>In the Fifth Framework Programme for the period 1998-2002, EUR 281 m have been allocated to the JRC, with an indicative breakdown of EUR 122 m for nuclear fission safety, EUR 138 m for nuclear safeguards and EUR 21 m for decommissioning and waste management.</p>
<p>For the indirect actions the key action on nuclear fission has been allocated EUR 142 m.

<p>The region of Transcaucasus is of vital interest to the European Union for many reasons - stability of the entire Caucasus region, economic interests (particularly in the energy sector), access to Central Asia. This being so, the strengthening of relations between the Union and the Transcaucasian republics ought to be a Community political objective of the first rank.</p>
<p>In the light of the foregoing and despite the laudable efforts by the Commission representatives in Tbilisi, it is hard to believe that the Union's presence in this region reflects the priority which it ought to have. More specifically, although the Commission has a delegation in Tbilisi it has only offices in Armenia and Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>Does the Commission not feel that it would be in the Union's own best interests to strengthen rapidly its presence in these two countries, in particular by opening delegations in Yerevan and Baku? More generally, what steps is it contemplating to lend a fresh impetus to relations between the Union and the three Transcaucasian republics? In particular, is it planning to offer rapidly to these three republics Association Agreements opening the way for those that so desire to full and complete membership of the European Union?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission recognises the strategic significance of the Caucasus and is deeply committed to developing an effective partnership between the Union and the countries of the region. With enlargement of the European Union to the East, these relationships increase in importance. It must be ensured that borders with these countries do not become the dividing line between poverty and prosperity in Europe. The Commission believes however that full implementation of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreements should be the first priority in building the Union's relations with countries of the region.</p>
<p>The strength of this partnership cannot be measured simply in terms of whether or not there is a Commission delegation in each country. With the present arrangements, the Commission has been able to give strong support to the process of economic and political reform in the region backed by Community financial assistance amounting to some EUR 850 m over the period 1992-1998. Much of this assistance has been directed to measures to support a peaceful solution to the present conflicts in the region.</p>
<p>Like any organisation, the Commission is obliged to work within a limited budget. The need to respond to the Kosovo crisis in particular has put pressure on resources. At present, the Head of Delegation in Tbilisi is also accredited to Armenia as non-resident Head of Delegation. The Commission will soon open a supporting office in Yerevan to facilitate its activities. In addition, the Commission has appointed a Special Envoy, resident in Brussels, who has particular responsibility for Azerbaijan and who is preparing to open a full Delegation in Baku as soon as resources are available.</p>
<p>But the Commission remains committed to building up its representation in the Caucasus where possible. The Commission counts on the support of this House in the relevant budget discussions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0582"></a>

<p>The question put by the Member of Parliament concerns the limitation applied in Austria to the number of students in medical training who are permitted to go on to practical training (the so-called “Turnus”) in order to qualify as general medical practitioners, and also the limitation of the number of doctors permitted to work in some health insurance schemes.</p>
<p>Community Directive 93/16/EEC ensured minimal harmonisation of professional medical training conditions with a view to facilitating freedom of movement within the Community. Aside from the terms of this Directive, the Member States are free to determine their own regulations on training, access to and practice of the activity concerned. The responsibility of Member States for access to training and establishment of a numerus clausus was specifically confirmed by a decision of the Court of Justice in 1986. Nonetheless, as far as the measures governing access to higher and university education are concerned, the Member States are bound to refrain from any discrimination on the basis of nationality, which would thus be in contravention of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>As far as national measures to limit the number of doctors involved in some activities or the arrangements for the practice of a profession are concerned, the Commission considers that they do not, in principle, contravene Community law.</p>
<p>The question which has been put, which is limited to individuals trained in Austria, therefore comes under the jurisdiction of the Member State concerned. According to the information available to the Commission, in Austria there are various possibilities of attachment to health insurance schemes as well as, in practice, in the medical sector outside health insurance schemes (where the reimbursement of services is possible in some circumstances).</p>
<p>In general, there are restrictions upon access to medical training in the great majority of the Member States.

<p>Will the Commission indicate how it intends to build on the positive commitment given on 4 October 1999 by one of the US companies at the forefront of GM food development, that it does not intend to commercialise the so-called ‘terminator’ technology, which can be used to ensure that crops produce sterile seeds, thereby depriving farmers of the right to hold over seed produced in one growing season for use in the next, and which can have particularly serious consequences for subsistence farmers?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission noted and appreciates the public commitment referred to by the honourable Member according to which the company declared 'not to commercialise sterile seed technologies, such as the one dubbed ‘terminator’'.</p>
<p>Sterile seed technology, including ‘terminator’ technology, is one of a class of so-called 'genetic use restriction technologies' (GURTs). Genetically engineered seeds that carry the specific technology produce plants with inviable seeds and affect the established agricultural practice of farmers using 'farm-saved' seed.</p>
<p>Another set of technologies activate or de-activate specific genes responsible for the value-added traits resulting from the respective genetic modifications. These technologies are still in the conceptual or developmental stage, and it will take still some more years prior to their commercialisation. The Commission will be vigilant in monitoring such developments.</p>
<p>In the Community, the current regulatory situation can be summarised as follows:</p>
<p>Council Directive 98/95/EC of 14 December 1998 amending, in respect of the internal market, genetically modified plant varieties and plant genetic resources, the entire set of established seed legislation, which shall be implemented by 1 February 2000, has established a link between the procedures for 'agricultural' approval of new plant varieties and those applicable to the required assessment of the risks of genetically modified plant varieties for human health and the environment. For the time-being, the latter procedures are those laid down in Council Directive 90/220/EEC.</p>
<p>At this stage, it is too early to determine the possible impact of sterile seed technologies on human health and the environment.</p>
<p>But there is another aspect to be considered. At the time of adoption of Directive 98/95/EC, the Commission has undertaken 'to examine the concept of an assessment of the advantages and disadvantages resulting from the use of seed of genetically modified varieties in respect of the established agricultural practices'.</p>
<p>This examination is under way but has not been completed yet.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0603"></a>

<p>The recent catastrophic earthquake in Greece and the broad-based show of solidarity by the peoples of the European Union for the victims highlighted the need to establish a legal basis so that the institutions of the European Union can give practical expression to the good intentions of its citizens.</p>

<p>Does the Commission intend to put an end to this blatant inconsistency by taking the initiative to make provision for the necessary legal basis to enable the European Union to offer practical assistance in the event of major natural disasters by contributing towards meeting the immediate basic needs of the victims and helping them to survive?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is sensitive to the concerns expressed by the honourable Member. It points out that from 1977 to 1995, it administered the budget heading B4-3400 for emergency aid to Community populations stricken by natural disasters. During this period, this resource was used on 172 occasions to provide support to victims in all Member States. For 18 years, this action made it possible to provide emergency aid very promptly to victims and their families in order to assist them in dealing with the expense occasioned by such disasters.</p>
<p>The Commission also recalls that in 1996, Parliament eliminated the appropriations for this activity, despite the fact that the Commission proposed that it be continued, thus contributing to presenting an image of Community action that was human and compassionate to the citizens of Europe.</p>
<p>It should also be pointed out that in the meantime, Parliament has supported the development of Community cooperation in the field of civil protection: a Community action programme for the period 2000-2004 is going to be adopted. However, in spite of a number of interventions by Members of Parliament or by groups, it has not deemed it appropriate to issue a clear political sign with a view to the reestablishment of the emergency aid which would perfectly complement the civil protection action programme.</p>
<p>It is therefore up to Parliament to clearly express its position as to whether emergency aid should be re-established or not, before the Commission considers the possibility of presenting a proposal to establish a legal basis for aid in the event of natural disasters.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0604"></a>

The first article stipulates that, “If one or more animals on a holding comply with none of the provisions laid down in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 820/97, a restriction shall be imposed on movement of all animals to and from that holding. If the keeper of an animal cannot prove its identification within two working days, it shall be destroyed without delay under the supervision of the veterinary authorities, and without compensation from the competent authority”.</p>
<p>The cattle targeted are those which do not have any of the elements stipulated by the identification system: ear-tagging, registration on a computer database, passport, registration on individual records to be maintained on each farm. In cases of exceptional seriousness, after expiry of the given deadline, slaughter is justified, particularly in the light of infringements committed which may represent a risk to human and animal health.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0615"></a>

<p>The introduction of these vessels is not in conformity with the objectives of the MAGPs (multiannual guidance programmes).

<p>In the context of mergers and other processes of corporate restructuring due account must also be taken of the existing Community and national legal requirements in force related to worker information and consultation and to the protection of workers against dismissals. It seems particularly relevant to mention within this context the Community Directives on collective redundancies (98/59/EC), transfers of undertakings (77/187/EC) and European Works Councils (94/45/EC).</p>
<p>Under the Community rules on competition and, in particular, the EC Merger Regulation No 4064/89 (as amended by Regulation No 1310/97), the Commission examines mergers and acquisitions where certain minimum turnover thresholds are achieved by the companies concerned (= concentrations having Community dimension). The parties to such concentration have to notify the project to the Commission and are, as a rule, not allowed to implement it before the receipt of a clearance decision.</p>
<p>If the Commission, after its market investigation, comes to the conclusion that a concentration would create or strengthen dominant position impeding effective competition, it declares the proposed deal as incompatible with the common market.</p>
<p>In making this appraisal, Article 2(b) of the Merger Regulation establishes that the Commission shall take into account, inter alia, the market position of the undertakings concerned and their economic and financial power and the interests of intermediate and ultimate consumers.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0622"></a>

<p>On 24 November 1995, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. On 15 December 1997, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Directive 97/66/EC concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the telecommunications sector. The implementation period of both Directives expired on 24 October 1998.</p>
<p>Both Directives have the aim of ensuring the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data, and in particular their right to privacy, in order to ensure the free flow of personal data in the Community. These Directives are, therefore, relevant to the matters raised in the honourable Member’s question.</p>
<p>However, the scope of the Directives is naturally limited to the issues which come within the framework of the EC Treaty. In addition, both Directives allows Member States to provide, under certain conditions, for exemptions to safeguard national security, defence and public security and to assist the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences as well as unauthorised use of the telecommunications system. Any citizens who feels that his or her privacy is prejudiced can either complain to the national supervisory data protection authorities or address a national court.</p>
<p>The Commission will report to the European Parliament and to the Council at regular intervals on the implementation of these Directives. It will, in particular, examine the way in which exemptions are applied to Member States.</p>

<p>The Spanish Government is once again implementing Community regulations in a negative manner, which is at odds with the political responsibilities of cross-border territorial units and contrary to the principle of subsidiarity, since in its pursuit of a centralist policy which generates territorial imbalances it is seeking to appropriate and channel off 55% of the Structural Fund appropriations for the 2000-2006 period which should be invested in the Objective 1 Autonomous Communities. Thus a mere 62,569 million pesetas (EUR 376 million) from the European Funds have been allocated to the draft budget for Galicia for the Year 2000: this amounts to a mere 45% of the funds which should be allocated directly to Galicia under EU law, while the rest (55%) has remained in the hands of a central government which used the European Funds in a particularly discriminatory manner in 1994-1999, thus harming the interests of the Objective 1 Autonomous Communities, and notably Galicia.</p>

On the other hand, this molecule appears to have only a limited action on the epidemiology of the illness since it is apparently effective only on Trypanosomiasis (T. Gambiense) rife in West Africa. Under the aegis of the WHO, and in collaboration with the manufacturer, these negotiations are in progress in order to improve the manufacturing process and investigate new partners. It is not, however, in the power of the Commission to exert pressure on industry for it to get involved in non-profitable activities.</p>
<p>The Commission recalls that the reappearance of sleeping sickness in Central Africa is due not to the inaccessibility of treatment, but to other reasons, particularly the discontinuation of prevention measures or the impossibility of fighting against the vector in war zones. The exponential increase of the number of cases of trypanosomiasis in these inaccessible areas (Angola, Congo Republic, etc) represents a major health problem in these regions. Merely fighting the vectors is insufficient to disrupt the transmission cycle of the epidemic and treatment campaigns will be needed in order to eliminate the pools of infected people. Projects implemented by the NGOs are scheduled in these regions but they are still dependent upon geographical accessibility.</p>
<p>In the past, the Commission has supported research projects for the development of new active molecules for various diseases, including Trypanosomiasis, and will continue to do so. The budgetary allocation for research against infectious diseases has been increased considerably for the fifth framework programme for research and development, thanks to the creation of key action II of the Quality of Life Programme. The INCO Programme is due shortly to publish an invitation for the submission of research projects into medicines based on North-South research partners.</p>
<p>Accessibility to certain essential medicines in developing countries is likely to be considerably increased by the continuation of technological research and development operations, the implementation of new European regulations on orphan drugs, improvement of the management of the distribution of pharmaceutical products in a number of low-income countries and the establishment of more effective medicinal policies based on increased support to the health sector. Action to improve the accessibility of health care is not just focussed on new medicines and vaccines, but is intended to respond to public health priorities for which basic essential medicines are often lacking.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0630"></a>

Since the museum of Europe currently being established, which is also financed by European Union resources, uses similar definitions, locating the beginning of Europe, for example, with Charlemagne, restricting it to the Catholic church, leaving out Greece, Rome and Byzantium, etc., and giving rise to all kinds of suspicions as to its ulterior motives, which body decided on the delineation of Europe and the funding of a museum with aims such as these, and when did it do so?

<p>The honourable Member refers to an intervention made on 19 October 1999 by the responsible Member of the Commission in charge of Environment to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection of the European Parliament. The Commissioner committed herself to keep the Committee regularly informed on developments intervened in the framework of Commission efforts in the field of implementation of Community environmental law.</p>
<p>It should be first recalled that a fair amount of information is already available to Parliament (and also the public since it can also be consulted on the Internet) on these matters, e.g.:</p>
<p>- The Annual Report of the Commission on monitoring the application of Community Law, which includes an extensive chapter on the environment containing also comprehensive tables over the present situation on the implementation of each directive per Member State.</p>
<p>- Annual Survey on the Implementation and Enforcement of Community Environmental Law, produced by the Directorate-General for Environment and supplied to Parliament pursuant to the Council Resolution on the Commission's Communication on Implementing EC environmental law.</p>
<p>- Press releases produced by the Directorate-General for Environment on decisions taken by the Commission concerning infringements.</p>
<p>Additional information is also available within the framework of the 'International Market Scoreboard' which includes environmental directives. This scoreboard belongs to the responsibility of the Directorate-General for the Internal market, but receives input from the Directorate-General for Environment with regard to environmental directives. This scoreboard is updated on a six-monthly basis (April and November) and is sent to the Council, European Parliament and Member States to help them to follow progress made.</p>
<p>A first step would therefore be to improve the way in which this information is presented and conveyed to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection of the European Parliament. The Commission will make sure that this is done on a regular basis. The Commission is also currently examining how the scope and quality of this existing information could be improved in order to provide us with the best possible overview of the situation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0641"></a>

<p>The Commission decided to decrease certain refunds in the milk sector because of the increased export activity for those products coupled with improved world and internal market situations. World market prices for skimmed milk powder (SMP) and whole milk powder (WMP) have increased from low points reached in July and the US dollar has been showing positive trends for some weeks. In addition, the internal price of SMP has increased substantially reflecting strong demand from both external and internal sources leading some industrialists to claim there was insufficient supply for their internal needs. In light of the market opportunity presented and the requirement to make the best use of scarce budgetary resources, the Commission has made a prudent change in export refunds. The Commission underlines the prudent nature of the change adopted because, while the internal and external markets allow it now, it is difficult to predict what the Community's opportunities for selling on the world market will be next year when the effects of increased milk production outside the Community may limit the Community's outlets. The decision taken ought to be politically acceptable in light of the fact that it was taken on the basis of the rules for fixing export refunds, the gap between the external and internal prices ought to be bridged by an export refund.</p>

<p>In June 1998, the Council, meeting in Luxembourg, decided that the use of driftnets for tuna fishing should be phased out by 1 January 2002. It also decided, in Regulation 1239/98/EC,<a href="#defann_79_1" name="refann_79_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> that the fleet should be reduced by at least 40% for 1998 and that lists should be drawn up yearly. It is more than clear that the provisions of this Regulation are not being complied with: the lists are not being forwarded on time, the number of vessels using driftnets is actually increasing, etc.</p>
<p>The Commission, however, in its reply of 6 October 1999 to a question on the subject, stated that, according to information applied by the Member States, the obligation laid down in Article 11 of the Regulation is in fact being complied with.</p>
<p>Has the Commission taken any action since that date to ascertain whether this Regulation is being strictly adhered to? Can it state what checks it has made on the implementation of its provisions?</p>

<p>The Commission is dealing with research on aircraft emissions from two different aspects.</p>
<p>The assessment of aircraft emissions has been dealt with in the Fourth Framework Programme for Research and Technical Development (FP4) under the specific programme 'Environment and Climate' and is continued in the Fifth Framework Programme (FP5) under the Key Action on Global Change Climate and Biodiversity. A couple of research projects under FP4 dealt with the issue of measurements of aircraft emissions of water vapour. In particular, the project POLINAT II (Pollution from Aircraft Emissions in the North Atlantic Flight Corridor) has performed successful studies of measurements and modelling of aircraft emissions including water vapour, carbon dioxide and nitrogen species. The results indicate that these atmospheric species could have a potential impact on climate change.</p>
<p>Moreover, Key Action 4 (Aeronautics) of the specific research Programme 'Competitive and Sustainable Growth' (FP5) is devoting major research activities to the enabling technologies for the abatement/mitigation of the atmospheric impact of aircraft emissions, such as CO2, NOx, particulates (smoke) and aerosols, the latter two of which together with the emitted water vapour (as CO2 a basic product of the combustion process of fossil fuel) form contrails and cirrus clouds at cruise altitude of the aircraft in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere.</p>
<p>For a worldwide review on the ongoing activities in the area, just recently, i.e. in June 1999, a Special Aviation 'Aviation and the Global Atmosphere' has been published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The report is the first and only assessment up to now for a specific industrial subsector. This 300 pages report, by far the most comprehensive assessment carried out on the effects of aviation on the atmospheric envelope and the possible strands for mitigation, states that emissions from air traffic producing water vapour are considered to have a potential major impact on climate change. The report<a href="#defann_80_1" name="refann_80_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> is available from Cambridge University Press, UK. The Commission has contributed to this assessment through its own basic European assessment report, published in 1998, and the results of various research projects it has supported since the early nineties under the Research Framework Programmes, and in particular under FP4.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The second report concluded, however, that there was a need for the 1991 Directive to be updated and extended, in particular to cover a wider range of criminal activity and to apply to a number of vulnerable non-financial professions and activities. The Commission tabled the corresponding proposal in July 1999<a href="#defann_81_4" name="refann_81_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. This proposal included in particular criminal activity damaging or likely to damage the European Communities' financial interests. Work on it has already begun in the European Parliament and the Council. The Tampere European Council of October 1999 called for this proposal to be adopted as a matter of priority.</p>
<p>The fight against money laundering has both first and third pillar elements and parallel to the work on the directive a number of initiatives to reinforce police and judicial cooperation in this area have been adopted or are under discussion under Title VI of the Treaty.

<p>The abolition of the drachma green rate and its replacement by the Euro exchange rate has had serious negative repercussions on the income of Greek farmers. The relevant EU regulation, which is supposed to deal with the problem of the countries remaining outside EMU, has turned out to be ineffective in practice and to be inadequate to cope with the nominal reduction in the prices of agricultural products caused by the EU's currency policy.</p>
<p>Given that allocations have been provided for, most of which have in fact not been used, for offsetting exchange losses in trade with third countries, following the creation of the euro and the abolition of the green rate, does the Commission intend to amend the regulation in order to regularise the rates and to pay compensatory amounts to Greek farmers in order to eliminate the reductions in prices and subsidies due to currency parity considerations?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The agrimonetary compensation linked to the introduction of the euro is governed by Council Regulations (EC) 2799/98 (agrimonetary scheme of euro) and 2800/98 (transitional measures for the introduction of the euro). It results from Articles 4 and 5 of Regulation (EC) 2799/98 that agrimonetary compensation can only be granted if certain conditions are fulfilled, notably, that an appreciable revaluation has taken place. These conditions are not fulfilled in the Greek case.</p>
<p>Although the euro value of the drachma applicable to prices is lower than the agricultural conversion rate applicable up to 31 December 1998, the reduction of the conversion rate (-3.414%) cannot be considered as an appreciable one, as defined in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) 2800/98 as the threshold rate is not reached. Concerning the conversion rate applied to the 'direct payments', the Greek situation is heterogeneous. For premia applicable to livestock and for the structural measures, the 1999 conversion rate gives rise to an increase in national currency of 4.628% compared to 1998. On the other hand, the 1999 conversion rate applicable to arable crops is lower (-7.876%) than the rate applied in 1998. But here again, the reduction of the conversion rate is not appreciable because it does not exceed the threshold as defined in Article 5.5 of Regulation (EC) 2799/98 and therefore, no agrimonetary compensation can be granted.</p>
<p>The euro values of the Greek drachma during 1999 do not meet the conditions fixed in the above mentioned Regulations. Therefore, no agrimonetary compensation can be granted in the Greek case. Furthermore, the Commission does not intend to make a proposal modifying current legislation in this matter.</p>

<p>According to this year's EU report and the statement of the Member of the Commission responsible for environmental matters, ozone pollution poses a serious problem for the Greeks and other citizens, particularly those in Mediterranean countries. Measurements of ozone levels reveal that it often considerably exceeds the precautionary limits set by Community legislation. The representatives of the Mediterranean countries have maintained that the cost of the measures required to reduce the ozone pollution of the atmosphere by 70% by 2010 (with 1990 as the reference year) is exceptionally high and that they are unable to make any definite commitments. </p>
<p>Does the Commission intend to undertake the promotion of the legal framework necessary to safeguard public health and protect the environment, through a reduction in ozone pollution and the provision of adequate financial resources to surmount the problem of the cost of measures, particularly since these represent a burden upon the Mediterranean countries that is out of proportion with their part in creating the problem?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Several years' monitoring of ozone levels in the Community showed widespread cases whereby the current ozone protection thresholds of Directive 92/72 on air pollution by ozone<a href="#defann_83_1" name="refann_83_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> have been exceeded in particular in Central Europe and in the Mediterranean countries. The Commission last June adopted a proposal for a Community strategy against ozone<a href="#defann_83_2" name="refann_83_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> which comprises a proposal for a daughter directive related to ground-level ozone under the current framework of air quality legislation<a href="#defann_83_3" name="refann_83_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. The proposal sets interim target values for ozone in ambient air to be achieved as far as possible by 2010. Given the transboundary nature of ozone pollution, efforts to reduce the emissions of ozone forming substances have to be coordinated on a European level. Therefore, the Commission's strategy includes also a proposed Directive setting limits for the total emissions in 2010 (National Emission Ceilings Directive) differentiated for each individual Member State.</p>
<p>The ceiling for each Member State was derived so that the underlying environmental objectives were met in the most cost-effective manner for the Community as a whole, while reflecting the polluter-pays principle. Costs for each Member State of implementing the ceilings were part of the analysis underpinning the proposal and the specific conditions in the Mediterranean as regards the formation of ozone were fully taken into account.</p>
<p>Cost per capita or GDP incurred in most countries in Southern Europe are lower than the Community average. The exception is Greece which because of its location at the periphery of the Community has to make a relatively high effort. However, the proposed emission ceilings for Greece will lead to a pronounced decline of the pollution load especially in Athens. Additionally, analysis of the cost of damage from ozone exposure to humans and vegetation in Greece has clearly shown that costs for abatement are more than balanced by the benefits from reduced ozone exposure for Greece. As Member States have full flexibility on what action is appropriate to comply with the emission ceilings in their particular circumstances there is no specific financial support planned in relation to that proposal. The Commission believes that existing regional funding schemes provides for any emerging need for support.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that when the new protocol under the UN-ECE Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution enters into force, it will require additional efforts from Greece's neighbours like Bulgaria. This will mean a remarkable relief for Greece compared with the ceilings in the NEC proposal, which had to be based on no further reductions beyond 'current legislation' outside the Community. In order to accommodate this development, the proposal for the national emission ceilings Directive and the ozone Directive include a revision clause committing the Commission to revise the emission ceilings by the end of 2004 accordingly.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Whilst welcoming the future enlargement of the Union, serious questions arise as to the implications of this process on the historic nations and regions. As a representative from Wales, I am deeply concerned about the implications for future representation in this House of nations and regions within larger Member States such as the UK. Stateless nations such as Wales and Scotland are underrepresented within the EU in comparison to Member States with a similar population. Whilst accepting the inevitability of a reduction in the number of present Members in this House to accommodate new Member States, can the Commissioner give a guarantee that it will be done in a fair manner and not at the expense of underrepresented regions?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
