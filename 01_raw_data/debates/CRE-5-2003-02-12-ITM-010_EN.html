<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Harbour (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, it gives me great pleasure to be able to present my report, even if for the second night running I find myself speaking in the last debate of the day. On behalf of all my colleagues on the committee, I hope that we can request the services to give the internal market a rather more prominent place in future.</p>
<p class="contents">As you said in your introduction, my report is about the Commission's strategy paper, Delivering the Promise. That will be very much the theme of my speech. But I want to say, for the record, that I have also been involved in considering a veritable cascade of other documents that the Commissioner sent us over the last few months. I have also considered the second Biennial Report on Mutual Recognition, the State of the Internal Market for Services and the Internal Market Scoreboard No 11, a very colourful document I am sure you have all read.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I move to the substance of the report, I should like to say that it is a privilege for me to have succeeded, as the committee's rapporteur on internal market strategy, my very good friend, Mrs Palacio, who was such a tremendous chairman of our committee and did so much to champion the cause of the internal market. She has now gone on to higher things as the Foreign Minister of Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">I have had the pleasure of working on this report by a happy coincidence during the time when the 10th anniversary of the internal market was marked. We were very pleased to welcome Commissioner Bolkestein and Mr Benson, the chairman of the Competitiveness Council, to Parliament back in November 2002. I would like to thank them both for enthusiastically promoting the cause of the internal market during that time. In his speech then Mr Bolkestein asked us to produce an ambitious and hard-hitting report. I think I have managed that, but I could not have done it without a lot of support from my colleagues. You will see tomorrow that I am confident this report will get the overwhelming support of the House. I particularly want to thank the shadow rapporteur, Mrs McCarthy, who made many valuable contributions, that we have included; my colleague and former President, Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, who has done the same; and thanks to the rapporteur for opinion Mr David Martin from the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee. We have incorporated a number of his points. I hope he feels that we have done justice to his work as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I am slightly disappointed that the Liberal benches tonight are empty. I hope that their absence means that they are content with the work we have done. However, since they are of your political family, Commissioner, I hope you will draw that to their attention tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">I will highlight some of the points in this report. It is no coincidence that we have timed it now, in the run-up to the economic summit and following on the debate we had this morning. Our central recommendation - and Commissioner, we want you to take this forward from this House when you go to the summit so that the Council takes note of it - is that we want the completion of the internal market to be the top priority of the 2003 economic summit. We want the 'delivery gap' - a phrase that you appropriately used, Commissioner - to be closed. We want the new Competitiveness Council to address the issues seriously and make a difference. Naturally, we want the deficit revealed on your scoreboards in Member States' transposition to be closed. We also want to see quicker and more effective action taken where the Rules are being flouted. As part of the Better Regulation Initiative, we want to deal with the problems of over-complex, gold plating of internal market regulations. We also want internal market compatibility to be introduced as part of the assessment process.</p>
<p class="contents">We urge you to move forward quickly with the Internal Market for Services strategy. It is clear that will be a difficult measure, but it is a vital one. It will include important elements of mutual recognition, alongside harmonisation. We want the Member States to take a much more mature attitude to using mutual recognition alongside other weapons as a measure to create the single market. In our committee, we are absolutely dismayed that the sales promotion regulation, an ideal single market mutual recognition measure is still blocked in Council. We hope you will take that message back as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to conclude with two important points. First, we hope that you, Commissioner, will join us and the single market in organising another Single Market Forum before the end of 2003 where we can celebrate the entry of ten new countries to the internal market. That is something in which we want to involve consumers, businesses, Member governments and Commissioners in the quest to make the internal market work better.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we hope that you can get, with the support of the Council, a firm declaration of support for the completion of the single market on its tenth anniversary. We have been ambitious and hard hitting. We invite the Council to take the same approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, this is a very important topic, one of the bases on which the European Union rests.</p>
<p class="contents">Last November, I challenged Parliament to come up with bold new ideas for improving the internal market. The Harbour report more than meets that challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">Ten years of the internal market have given us 2.5 million extra jobs and EUR 900 billion, cumulatively, in extra wealth. But that is not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">Too many barriers are still holding us back. Enlargement makes it all the more urgent to clear the decks. As any engineer will tell you, if you add a couple of storeys to a building, which is what enlargement in essence will do, you must make sure that the foundations are sufficiently strong.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence the emphasis in the forthcoming medium-term Internal Market Strategy for the years 2003-2006. The emphasis in that medium-term Internal Market Strategy – a document that the Commission will present in April – is on going 'back to basics'.</p>
<p class="contents">Foremost among this move 'back to basics' is the matter of implementation and enforcement. I welcome Parliament's support for strengthening the Commission’s enforcement powers in the future IGC. The Harbour report also calls on the Commission to calculate the economic costs of transposition delays. I can see the attraction of that idea, but the transposition deficit is a moving target which reflects different directives with different economic impacts over time. However, I have asked my staff to look into the feasibility of making such a calculation and I will report back to you as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not yet as easy to trade within the internal market as it is to trade within a Member State. Borders still exist, not perhaps in the real world, but certainly in the minds of national officials who often do not yet think or act in a European way. We may need to put some disciplines in place to get a change in behaviour. As you may know, the Commission is giving very high priority to making a proposal for a horizontal instrument to remove barriers in the services market by the end of the year. We are also considering ways of making trade in goods easier.</p>
<p class="contents">EU citizens and businesses deserve more and better information about their internal market rights. Mr Harbour’s report calls for a second Internal Market Forum as a means of connecting with citizens. I welcome the idea of a second forum and I shall be honoured to take part - if you invite me, of course!</p>
<p class="contents">Removing tax obstacles is another key priority. I welcome Parliament’s support for the Commission’s communications on the taxation of persons and passenger cars, a subject dear to the heart of Mr Vatanen, who spoke to me at length about that. I respect his energy in pursuing that subject. The Commission will bring forward proposals this year to modernise and simplify VAT rules so as to reduce the burden on businesses, particularly on SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">This list is not exhaustive. We all know that the internal market covers a multitude of subjects. We are still open to ideas. I should like to work closely with Parliament in the coming months as our strategy takes shape.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by endorsing the opening paragraph of the Harbour report which states that the internal market should be the top priority for this year’s Spring Summit. I wholeheartedly agree with Mr Harbour on that and call on Parliament to do everything it can to ensure that this comes about. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee broadly shares the view of the state of the internal market set out by the Commission in its third annual report. Like the Commission, we regret that in the period covered by the report only about 50% of the target actions have been met. However, we reject the Commission's claim that the Council and Parliament are equally to blame for this failure.</p>
<p class="contents">The list set out by the Commission itself in the report contains eight examples of where we have failed to meet targets. Six of these clearly lie at the door of the Council, and only two can loosely be blamed on the European Parliament. We therefore call on the Commission, at the Spring Summit, to push the Council to come forward with a clear set of priorities and a timetable for meeting its commitments under the single market programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee welcomes the four headings for target actions set out in the review: modernising markets, improving business conditions, meeting citizens' needs and anticipating enlargement. As far as the modernisation of markets is concerned, we particularly welcome the call to improve the pace of the delivery of the financial services action plan. Financial services are the oil in Europe's economic engine, and we share the Commission's view that a truly integrated financial sector could add between 0.5 and 0.7% annually to EU GDP: a staggering EUR 43 billion per year.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the improvement of business conditions, we particularly welcome the objective aimed at ensuring that, in all Member States, a private limited company can be set up within 18 working days and at a cost of no more than EUR 213.</p>
<p class="contents">Where meeting citizens' needs is concerned, we welcome the emphasis given to encouraging free movement of labour, particularly through the introduction of a European health card, and the improved mutual recognition of academic and professional qualifications.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as far as anticipating enlargement is concerned, we now believe it urgent that the Commission addresses the administrative capacity of the candidate countries to ensure compliance with single market legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner himself has said, the creation of the single market and the progress we have made since 1992 is remarkable, but there are no grounds for complacency. We believe that the Commission has set out a practical roadmap for the next 18 months. The Commission will have the support of my committee, and I am sure the whole of the Parliament, in meeting the objectives it has set out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On Monday, we discussed the fallout from the World Economic Summit in Davos, and today we have already had a debate on the Spring Summit. Circling around the future of the internal market and the Lisbon targets, both debates made clear how important the internal market is to us. Both the Commissioner and the ten-year balance sheet documented and demonstrated the benefits brought by the internal market, in terms of growth, employment and competitiveness, to all our continent's citizens. Yet, despite these manifest advantages, the internal market is not yet complete and still has a large number of weaknesses. Allusion was made to the facts that 50% of the objectives have not yet been achieved, that the progress made is less than what had been aimed for, and that 2.1% of all the directives on the internal market have still not yet been transposed. We therefore call on the Commission and the Council to avail themselves of all the options available, including sanctions, coordination and the initiation of legislation, in order to bring to fruition those things to which we have jointly committed ourselves. The Lisbon targets are ambitious, and we will not achieve them without a successful internal market and without adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">The internal market and the Stability and Growth Pact are the essential instruments for achieving the Lisbon targets by 2010. Their importance lies in the credibility they give to long-term objectives. They have an essential contribution to make in building confidence in Europe's goals on the part of the public, of enterprises and employees.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a blatant discrepancy between what is piously promised at summits and what is transposed at home, and so we demand that all the directives on the internal market be transposed into law. We demand that coordination of this process be taken charge of by the Commission, and that its right to initiate legislation be extended. This is no longer a matter of apportioning guilt, but of specifying short-term targets – and responsibilities – on the way to the overall objective. This has to do with fiscal policy, with the various competences involved, which still lead to distortions of competition and to new obstacles. It has to do with studying the effects on small and medium-sized enterprises as we progress towards this great internal market. Of course, it also affects the internal market in financial services, which would alone account for 1.1% – or EUR 130 billion worth – of growth, and it has to do with the creation of the internal services market. There is much for us to do, and, although we see from the balance sheet that we are on the right road, we must not slow down or come to a halt; instead, we have to discover a new dynamism. So I thank the rapporteur for having made us aware of these things in such an impressive way and also for defining new objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I always find it somewhat amazing that on this graveyard shift on a Wednesday night, which Mr Harbour and I have shared on many occasions, we have ended up discussing perhaps one of the most important pieces of legislation that the European Union has passed, but the way this Parliament operates, that tends to be the way of things.</p>
<p class="contents">It is just over ten years now since the internal market came into operation. In that time, vast strides have been made towards the completion of the market. That said, however, there is still a long way to go. There are still a number of barriers - barriers to trade. We look at the different tax regimes in the Member States, whether it be indirect taxation or direct taxation - all are used as barriers to trade. We look at different employment legislation in Member States - this too is used as a barrier to trade. We look at our own failure to decide upon a Community patent - again that is a barrier to trade, but the solution there is in our own hands.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is not only the free movement of goods that we should be concerned about. It is also about the free movement of workers, the free movement of labour. At the moment within the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market we are discussing the mutual recognition of professional qualifications. The sooner that is sorted out, the sooner another barrier will be removed.</p>
<p class="contents">In today's climate, however, there is another barrier. It is a barrier of fear and suspicion which has developed since 11 September, but was probably there beforehand. That is a barrier restricting the free movement of workers. We cannot allow ourselves to become a fortress Europe by setting up internal walls.</p>
<p class="contents">I was interested to hear what the Commissioner had to say. The onus is on him, however, to take a long hard look at every Member State to see where these countries, while proclaiming the benefits of the internal market, are at the same time blocking its completion by using internal rules to flout it. Most of the time this is for short-term political gain.</p>
<p class="contents">We have an opportunity to bring about the completion of the internal market. Commissioner, you challenged this Parliament to come up with a hard-hitting report which you have now got. We challenge you to finish the job – and you have our support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What concerns the rapporteur is the gap between the intention of completing the unification of the market at European level and the reluctance of the national States. However, what concerns the working classes of the European Union is certainly not that, but rather the avalanche of collective dismissals. The big companies who are responsible for those dismissals did not need any vote in the European Parliament to homogenise their attitude in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">These collective dismissals have been carried out by big companies such as Airlib in France or big multinationals such as Daewoo, ACT, Arcelor, Pechiney or Fiat, which operate in several countries in Europe, and whose shareholders, both past and present, are well able to afford to preserve the jobs of all those people whom they are rendering unemployed. If big companies wish to restructure, that is their affair, but what is inadmissible and revolting is that they should do it by condemning their workers to unemployment and poverty. It is the shareholders who should pay, and not the workers. The profits of the companies and the capital of their shareholders should be used, as a matter of priority, to guarantee the jobs and wages of the workers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very grateful to Mr Harbour, not only for being so magnanimous in his comments about the work I carried out on this report, but also for taking on so many of the numerous amendments I tabled.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly grateful to him for taking up my initiative calling upon the Member States, at the Spring Summit, to reaffirm their commitment to delivering the promise of a single market by signing up to a solemn declaration in this, the single market's tenth anniversary year. I hope the Greek Presidency and the Commission can take up this initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Such an initiative is needed because if Member States were to be given the equivalent of an end of term school report, there would be no gold stars for model pupils. Rather, they would receive the comment 'could do better'. In fact, they could do much better. The November scoreboard illustrates our failure to deliver. We are failing businesses by not reducing barriers; we are failing consumers, who in many sectors are not seeing the benefits of more choice and cheaper goods; and finally we are sliding backwards in terms of our attempt to achieve the goal of becoming the world's most competitive economy by 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">Future scoreboards must not only quantify the benefits of single market laws, they should, as Mr Harbour suggested, include an index of damage illustrating the costs of non-implementation. The Commission should undertake a rigorous evaluation of why Member States are failing to implement, and it must identify the root cause. Is it simply a case of national protectionism? Is it due to concern for consumer protection, or to a lack of administrative capacity in Member States? I agree that there should be strong sanctions for non-implementation, swift action, tight deadlines and effective deterrents to non-implementation. Otherwise I fear, Commissioner, that we will be here in ten years' time talking about the need to complete the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Achieving a single market in financial services in one fell swoop could boost EU growth by 1.1%. It would add EUR 130 billion to Europe's wealth and reduce the cost of raising capital for business by 0.5%. The takeover directive, as I know you agree, Commissioner, is a key component of financial services in single markets. I agree that we in this Parliament should get it onto the statute book as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have tried to cooperate with the fundamental objectives of the report – with which I may say I am in total agreement – with certain amendments because I thought it would be useful to incorporate certain points.</p>
<p class="contents">The first, in line with what Mr Martin has just said on behalf of the Committee on Industry, is to reject – and this has been done very intelligently by the rapporteur – the equal treatment, undoubtedly hasty on the part of the Commission, of Parliament and the Council with regard to the causes of the delay of certain rules of the internal market. As we say in our country, 'every candlestick should support its candle' and we should not all be judged equally in relation to responsibilities that are different.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect was the need – and Mr Harbour agreed immediately – to incorporate workers’ organisations into the cooperation which were and are laid down in the report between the consumers’ organisations and the employers’ organisations. For those whose political doctrine consists of a social market economy, this involvement by all social elements seems to us to be significant. I would like to take up a statement by the Commissioner: as long as all active sections of European society fail to take on board the idea of the internal market, all imaginable rules and actions will be insufficient to make it a reality. If on the other hand society is mobilised, this objective will be achieved much more easily.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has also accepted my request that greater attention be paid to the existing obstacles to the creation of small businesses and the necessary initiatives to overcome them. Because, Mr President, we can go on and on about employment in large companies, but the people who really provide work in the European Union, in really huge quantities, are the small and medium-sized businesses. And we must ensure that they can be incorporated into the internal market without obstacles, as Mr Karas has said.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to acknowledge the progress made thanks to the efforts of Commissioner de Palacio – it is fair to say – on liberalisation, not ‘liberation’ as the Spanish text mistakenly says, in the field of gas, electricity and air transport. I would like to thank Mr Harbour for incorporating these points, as well as the fortunate way he has incorporated the principle elements of my Amendment No 40 into paragraph 33; by the way, Mr President, and for the benefit of the services of this House, I would like to make the observation that this paragraph 33 of the English text does not exist in the Spanish text, and it should also be included in our language.</p>
<p class="contents">I will therefore vote in favour of this excellent report, on which I congratulate Mr Harbour once again, and I would also like to thank him for his kind words for Mrs Palacio, not the Commissioner, but her sister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who has cooperated so fully in the work to implement the internal market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, thank you for allowing me to take the floor yet again. I will confine my reply to a few main points.</p>
<p class="contents">First, I welcome the fact that those who have spoken - all but one perhaps - have supported the report written by Mr Harbour and also support most clearly and energetically the whole concept of the internal market. Without the support of Parliament the Commission would be at a loss as to what to do with regard to furthering the internal market. I can assure Mr Harbour that I will speak to my Liberal friends and tell them what they missed tonight. Mr Harbour will recall that the Liberal complement of this Parliament is somewhat smaller than the group to which he himself belongs. Personally speaking, I regret that but it is what it is.</p>
<p class="contents">Both Mr Harbour and Mr Martin have made references to the European Council. Sometimes the European Council rather airily asks ministers concerned to deal with that issue and then move on to more rarefied subjects. I recall that, perhaps a year ago, the European Council said that the Community Patent should be dealt with as soon as possible by the Commission and the Council of Ministers. Nothing has happened. It is not much use for the European Council to issue generalities. I wish it would deal more with the subjects at hand.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Harbour also mentioned the subject of sales promotion. The Commission will certainly do its best to help the Greek Presidency reach a conclusion on that important file. I shall discuss the matter with those Member States that have outstanding concerns. It is my opinion that the proposal is compatible with the follow-up to the Green Paper on Consumer Protection, as my colleague Commissioner Byrne and I have made clear on many occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Martin spoke about a European health card. He may be interested to know that the Commission is engaged in activities in the area of health. The issue concerns citizens who cannot get quick treatment in their own country and so want to go abroad to get treatment. The European Court of Justice, not long ago, delivered a judgment stating that not only should that be allowed, but also that compensation should be paid to the patient according to the rules of his home country. The issue is now whether or not that patient should get authorisation from the authorities in his own country before going abroad for treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">There was a meeting on that important subject in the so-called 'High Level Reflection Group' last week. I and my colleagues Commissioner Diamantopoulou and Commissioner Byrne were there to defend the principle that this also relates to the internal market because, if a patient goes abroad to get treatment, that is a matter of the freedom of services. Therefore it is an aspect of the internal market and one that is very close to the citizen. After all, what is more important to a person than his health?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Martin may be interested to hear about this. He can rest assured that my colleagues and I are determined to pursue that subject, although some Member States do not agree with this approach. That is an obstacle.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to Mr Karas' point about different tax barriers which exist, again, the Commission is not sitting on its hands. We use the instruments of infringement proceedings and, in particular where citizens of one Member State get tax relief if they contribute to pension fund in their own Member State but do not get tax relief if they contribute to a pension fund in another Member State. That is a clear case of discrimination against the second Member State. Recently the Commission has started infringement proceedings. Already, in one particular case, the European Court of Justice ruled that this is not admissible. The Commission is determined to pursue obstacles of a fiscal nature where such an obstacle impinges on the internal market, but only where the Treaty allows us to do so. As Members will realise, the area of taxation requires unanimity. To get unanimity among 15 Member States is extremely difficult. To get unanimity in 25 Member States would be well nigh impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Mrs McCarthy's point on the scoreboard, it is perhaps an unpleasant, but very necessary matter to keep Member States focused on what they have to do. The scoreboard is a form of 'soft law', peer pressure or best practice. It is not a legal instrument but it goes together with the matter of infringement proceedings. Therefore we are determined to continue issuing those scoreboards.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, as Mrs McCarthy said, do our best to do what we decided at Lisbon. Lisbon said that we should have a microeconomic structural adjustment programme. There is a delivery gap and we are not doing as well as we ought to. Indeed it is in the Council, most often, where there are obstacles. I tell them with great regularity that they should be quicker. That also applies to the Takeover Directive mentioned by Mrs McCarthy and others.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I entirely agree with Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado that we should see to it that there are no obstacles to the setting-up of small- and medium-sized enterprises. The time needed to set up such a company is much longer than it is in the United States. If we really want to overtake the United States as far as the creation of small- and medium-sized enterprises is concerned, we must see to it that we act in accordance with the words of Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
