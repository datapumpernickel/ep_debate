It is a chance for us to reflect on what will be lost, especially for Parliament, should we be incapable of salvaging the project and bringing it to a successful conclusion. It is a chance for us to respond to the cacophony of sounds emerging from the ranks of the Council – some simplistic, some in breach of the Treaty, some improbable politically. It is a chance for us to encourage the Commission to be more forthright and incisive to assist us in finding a way forward out of the crisis. It is a chance for Parliament to fill some political space and to bring a focus to the period of reflection.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that we cannot achieve all this by ourselves but must have the close collaboration of national parliaments. I must say that I find it fairly curious in this context that the Presidents of the Austrian, Finnish and German Parliaments seem somewhat reluctant to cooperate with us. It is up to the parliaments to decide whether or not they turn up. Those who choose to turn up will have a decisive say in fashioning the decisions about the future of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals, which received strong support from the committee, set out a parliamentary process. We seek to establish a series of parliamentary forums to debate some fundamental – perhaps even primitive – questions about the nature and purpose of Europe. We want to have the debate about the reform of common policies that the first Convention was in some part frustrated in being denied. This policy debate can and should be radical, but it must take place within the constitutional context and be closely related to issues of competences, to instruments and to procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of these forums will take place on 9 May and will address its conclusions to the European Council, which is to take some first decisions about the furtherance of the project.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like to draw the period of reflection to a close at the end of 2007 with a firm, clear decision on what to do with the Treaty. As the resolution states, there are, in theory, several scenarios we could follow, but in practice there are only two. The first is to supplement the present Treaty with interpretative protocols or declarations. The second is to make rather more substantive changes to Part III so that we address the legitimate concerns and disquiet expressed by citizens in France and the Netherlands and in some other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Between and inside the groups there is certainly controversy about the appropriate way to express ourselves. However, on the essentials of salvaging the Treaty, we are strongly united and I commend the resolution to Parliament.</p>

Little time now remains before Parliament takes this great step, this great decision, but if I had no more than a minute in which to speak, I would use it to thank my fellow rapporteur, Mr Duff, for the extraordinary honour and pleasure of working with him on this.</p>
<p class="contents">From him I learned that the future – by which I mean the future we share in this Europe of ours – can be found by looking in the most diverse directions, and for that I am very grateful to him. If the combination of a Green Austrian and an English Liberal is not a handicap from the word go, then I do believe that other combinations can work just as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, not even the harmonious notes sounded by the President of the Council’s magic flute this morning could mask the crisis that is going on in Europe, and, while he did not mention it, I would like to, and I would like to say something about what is at the heart of this crisis. At the centre of this whole, newly-ignited, dispute, the disagreements we have, and the European crisis, is a single sentence uttered by <span class="italic">the</span> founding father of the European Union, Jean Monnet, who said, ‘We are not uniting states; we are uniting people’. That is what today’s argument is about.</p>
<p class="contents">Are we to have a Europe of chancelleries, governments and elites, or the union of citizens to which this constitution has opened the door? Those who talk as if the constitution were dead are rejecting the human Europe, giving the intergovernmental Europe a shot in the arm and conjuring up the ghosts of the 19th century, those primal misfortunes from Pandora’s box: nationalism, rivalry between states, the concept of the balance of power, the striving for dominance, a fragmented Europe incapable of maintaining its own peace, let alone of becoming a power for peace. That is what this dispute is about.</p>
<p class="contents">Before we entered the Chamber, there were fellow Members there to welcome us dressed as ostriches. They had no need to dress up, for we knew perfectly well who they were, and we are not blind; we know that the nationalists regarded the temporary failure of the ratification process as presenting them with an historic opportunity for a nationalist renaissance. To them, by this report, and with virtual unanimity, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs delivers a resounding ‘no’.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Constitution is not dead, for people’s need for a future in which they can live in Europe in freedom and peace at home and abroad lives on as an objective in their hearts and minds, and the Constitution is a crucial step in moving towards a social order, a political architecture, a political space, in which such a future is possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The crisis that the report we are presenting today attempts to resolve is a crisis of confidence, the crisis of a Union that cannot tell the difference between a union of citizens and a union of states, a Union in which people’s expectations are disappointed as a veritable matter of course. It has no answer to social issues, it suffers from a democracy deficit, fundamental rights are not secured, there is not enough transparency, and the power of governments is unbridled and subject to few controls. This constitution, though, is a step forward, and if it is beset by difficulties, then we will try to keep it on course.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have conceived is a European debate; I see us as bringing the process back to the people, and that adds up to nothing less than taking the elites’ project and turning it into a <span class="italic">res publica</span>, a popular cause.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this House – if it adopts this report – will join us in appealing to all the parties, to the population at large, to the municipalities and regions, to the trade unions and to civil society, to carry on with this debate, to take up the future of this Europe of ours as a popular cause and to join with us in contending for it.</p>
<p class="contents">We did not envisage that this debate should be without form. We, in all the groups, agreed on six questions, covering many issues that people fight shy of talking about: the goal of European integration, the borders of Europe, the future of the economic and social model, Europe’s role in the world, the area of security, freedom and law, not to mention the social issues – and, even if the constitution does not do all the things we want it to do, which it goes without saying it will not, then I do nonetheless hope that this plan brings us a good deal closer to this objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps I might say one more thing about precisely where our difference with the Constitutional Affairs Committee lies. What the rapporteurs want, and what they have fought for, is another step forward rather than the continued ratification process being regarded as the end product of this debate; they want it also to be possible to improve the constitution, to retain what is at its heart and, in 2007, to revise it in a more open process and a more credible debate, with the revision to be presented to the public in a Europe-wide referendum. My hope is that, aided by the Commission’s level-headedness and this House’s courage, this further step may be taken.</p>

I am particularly glad that the mandatory dialogue between the institutions has reached a topic that is particularly demanding of cooperation. As both the rapporteurs have already said, it is true to say that 2005 was a difficult year; Mr Voggenhuber went so far as to use the word ‘crisis’. We are indeed going through a crisis of confidence where the European public are concerned. We must answer those questions that they have every right to ask of us. I also agree with Mr Duff that this crisis of confidence and these misgivings about the European project present all of us with an opportunity, of which all of us together – the Commission, Parliament and the Council – must make use.</p>
<p class="contents">It is at this point that I would like to extend most especial thanks to your House, for you were wrestling with this issue at a time when the governments were not yet willing to make a serious start on debate. The Duff/Voggenhuber report has been the occasion, in this House, for a debate that will help us to move on. The Austrian Presidency has, from its very first day, endeavoured to engage in this debate, to carry it further and develop it. You will all have been able, as you followed it, to note how very vigorous it has been from the very outset, with the whole spectrum of opinions being given voice, and the report adopted by the Constitutional Affairs Committee reflects that.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing that does come across clearly is that there are no quick fixes, no tricks and no shortcuts, whereby we might, so to speak, throw a bridge across the confidence gap between Europe and its citizens. Only a real and serious engagement with the problems will be credible and effective in the long term. Our belief that this debate must be a wide-ranging one reflects the view expressed in your report, which we are debating today. What we need is not just a debate about the constitutional treaty or the legal dimension, but a broad debate on what sort of Europe we want, where we want to go, where Europe’s borders are, and how we can address the European public’s fears and worries.</p>
<p class="contents">We, in the Council, want not only to continue with this debate, but also to conduct it in greater depth. We have planned a series of events at which we want to have broad-based discussions with the European public. Only yesterday, we were discussing with the Commission and with your House the methods and strategies whereby we might communicate this Europe of ours and what it stands for to the public and by what means, in what discussion forums and in what depth we might best meet the expectations that people have of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As the President of the Council said today, we do intend, at the same time as we kick off the debate, to consider the issue of European identity. On the 250th anniversary of Mozart’s birth, in Salzburg, we intend to address the question of ‘What is Europe, what is the European identity?’</p>
<p class="contents">Right through to the end of the Austrian Presidency, there will be a whole series of other events, for the debate on Europe’s future is a many-sided one, and it is only when all of its sides are lit that all the dimensions with which we have to do become apparent. Important though this public debate is, there will also have to be practical work done in order that it may be clearer to us which way we should go, and it will have to be done by the governments of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council Presidency’s most important task is to get all the Member States on board, for it is only together that we will be able to move forward. As the Chancellor has already said, what we want to achieve is to be able, at the end of our Presidency, to produce a sketch of the way ahead and to agree on how we can best cooperate in achieving our common goals.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that one consequence of our joint effort over the coming months will be an increase in positive thinking in Europe, and I agree with Mr Voggenhuber that we must discuss Europe as a <span class="italic">res publica</span>, as something that really is to the benefit of all its citizens.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Margot Wallström, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, honourable Members, in this first plenary part-session of the year I should like to wish all of you an excellent 2006. From the Constitutional point of view, I believe it can only be better than last year. I hope, as the person responsible both for Constitutional issues and for interinstitutional affairs, that we can continue our fruitful, effective and close cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank the rapporteurs for this report on the period of reflection and the motion for a resolution. I have already discussed it on several occasions with the two Members of the European Parliament who were members of the European Convention. I would like to underline the considerable progress made since the initial considerations and congratulate the co-rapporteurs for the job they have done and also for their ability to take on board the many views expressed during the intense discussions in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I will limit my remarks to four points. The first is that we all wish to achieve a constitutional settlement, to make Europe more transparent, more democratic and more effective. The question is how to achieve that settlement after the French and Dutch ‘no’ votes. I was happy to see that all options regarding the Constitution remain open in your resolution. During the reflection period it is essential to listen to citizens, social partners, political parties, and national and regional parliaments without prejudging the result of the wider dialogue and debate. If we do not, this exercise will lose all its value.</p>
<p class="contents">I also took note of your favourite option. Maintaining the Constitution, however, will not be possible without French and Dutch support with, if necessary, additional clarifications and measures. Recent Eurobarometer surveys have shown that European citizens’ support for the concept of a Constitution for the EU has increased by two percentage points over the past five months to 63%. Therefore, as has been said many times in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, it is important to change the context rather than the text. That is why the dialogue has to focus on the European project in connection with Constitutional reform, and on the ultimate objective linked to the instruments to deliver it. It is only after the listening exercise based on the results of national debates is complete, that we will be able to draw conclusions on the best Constitutional settlement for Europe. That is also why the Commission wants to focus on policy priorities addressing citizens’ concerns on growth, jobs, employment and security.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I fully share your resistance to proposals for core groups of certain Member States. What we want is a Europe for everyone, not just for some. The Union is in the process of consolidating the most recent accession process. We still have to work hard to ensure the smooth integration of the new Member States. My view is that any enhanced cooperation must, in all circumstances, be undertaken within the existing Treaties and remain open to all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">You can rest assured that the Commission and myself will not support any proposal for enhanced cooperation outside the European Union institutional framework.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it seems reasonable to me to draft final conclusions on the reflection period in 2007, under the German or Portuguese Presidency. The June 2006 European Council is clearly a major milestone in this process, but it should not be the end of it. It will, of course, be up to the European Council to decide on any potential extension of the reflection period beyond the June 2006 extension already suggested by the Austrian Presidency. In any case, as announced in Plan D, the Commission will prepare a communication for the June European Council setting out its thinking on the initial feedback received during the period of reflection, and this will be based on the national visits currently being undertaken by the President, myself and fellow Commissioners, a special Eurobarometer report, discussion forums and the 9 May conferences.</p>
<p class="contents">This synthesis report should explain the background and approach taken by the Commission over the last year, outline the initial results of the listening exercise and provide a series of conclusions for the Austrian Presidency on the next steps to be taken. This will complement the factual report that will be prepared by the Austrian Presidency on the basis of contributions from the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, I support your rejection of piecemeal implementation of the Constitution. The reason for that is simple - it has to do with respect. Respect for those who said ‘no’ and for those who have already ratified, and respect for the institutional balance. Cherry-picking could give the impression that the Union is trying to circumvent the results of national referenda and is liable to impair the overall institutional balance.</p>
<p class="contents">We should respect the difference between our institutions and those in the Member States and, most of all, when we embark on various praiseworthy initiatives and projects we should always respect each country’s democratic traditions. All of us play important, but different, roles.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would stress that we cannot discuss these issues without entering into political debate and discussing political priorities. European citizens will see that there are political differences in Europe. This is another forum for discussing political priorities, but without it and without any discussion on constitutional matters nothing will work. We have to combine this process with creating legitimacy for our institutions by delivering the political results that European citizens want, so we have to consider their daily concerns as well as the constitutional issues.</p>

This failure, which had to do not only with national issues but also with the mood in Europe as a whole, represents a failure on the part of national politics, but also of European politics, in that we have not succeeded in justifying Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to take the public’s concerns seriously, not least in France and in the Netherlands; we cannot simply disregard them, but should spell out why we need this sort of Europe. That is what the period of reflection needs to be used for; it is not a period for debate on details in the constitution, but a time when Europe must be justified to people.</p>
<p class="contents">It has to be clear to us, and we have to make it clear to others, that the constitutional treaty contains things the absence of which the public formerly criticised, such as greater capacity to act in foreign and security policy matters, on which the opinion I have drafted concentrates, and which, according to all opinion surveys, is precisely what the public want. They want Europe to be represented to the outside world, and it is precisely so that it may be that there are rules in the constitution, rules that only it provides for and which we, under present conditions, cannot lay down without it. It creates a new form of subsidiarity involving the national parliaments, thereby making centralisation impossible, and backs up this concept of subsidiarity with solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Citizens’ rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights have a major part to play in this. This constitution makes the citizens into decision-making actors and also provides them with protection. It must also be clear to us that in future, for example, the President of the Commission, as head of the European executive, will emerge directly from the elections to the European Parliament, with the public having a part to play in that. That is why we should focus on the fact that Parts I and II are the actual constitutional treaty itself, whilst Part III is the Treaty of Nice, about which there have been misunderstandings that we have not been able to eradicate, and so I am grateful to the Austrian Presidency for its willingness to put forward a ‘road map’ and glad that Germany, during its presidency, intends to take new initiatives. We should now concentrate on dialogue, assess the reflection period, and put forward our proposals in 2007. It follows from this that we cannot take action right now, as Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber propose; that would be premature and does not reflect what the public wants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know that the issues that Mr Brok has just raised have prompted a great deal of debate, not least within the political groupings in this House, and there is much to be said for both positions. Perhaps we have to begin with the issues of substance, which we may well have neglected to some degree; how, for example, can we persuade the public that Europe needs a constitution of the kind that has been drafted? I gave a number of examples in the opinion I drafted on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and perhaps I can adduce one that did not yet count for much at the time I was writing, but has acquired significance over the past few days in this House. I refer, of course, to the issue of energy.</p>
<p class="contents">It was pretty surprising, indeed pretty astonishing, to see how many Members of this House who had, until recently, perhaps taken a rather sceptical view of such things, are now forthright advocates of a common energy policy; I was delighted to hear what Mr Saryusz-Wolski had to say on the subject. The Federal Chancellor is a constant advocate of subsidiarity; today, as President of the Council, he argued strongly in favour of a common energy policy. This is just one example showing how important it is that the powers and prerogatives that we, particularly in the Constitution, have accorded to the European level be used to the utmost. I see this as the road down which we must go.</p>
<p class="contents">I could, at this point, for example, talk about space policy, which has been another topic for debate in this place, and which is not about sending Europeans into space, but rather about monitoring the environment or giving warnings of tsunamis in good time. There are plenty of other things that are realistic and feasible and capable of being explained to the public if we focus on matters of substance rather than the institutional issues.</p>
<p class="contents">What we in this House expect, of course, is a road map or sketch of how things are to progress. I beg you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in all the weighty matters with which you will have to deal over the coming weeks and months of this Presidency, to highlight how much better we could handle them if we had a European constitution. That is absolutely vital. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With the referendum on the Constitution in France and the Netherlands, the citizens who wanted to get in and watch from the terraces went beyond that and organised an actual invasion of the pitch. Today’s crisis in Europe also lies in the fact that it is no longer possible to go back behind closed doors, back to the Europe of the Treaties and elitist decisions, and that, at the same time, no one knows how to get the people back onto the terraces so that they can express their opinions properly as fans normally do.</p>
<p class="contents">Reinventing a system of participation and accountability, whereby the Union answers directly to the citizens, without the self-seeking, distorting and misleading mediation of the Member States, is a prerequisite for setting the European project in motion again, whatever its new content may be. The question is, however, accountability for what? We must avoid the mistake of turning the pause for reflection into a pause of inaction.</p>
<p class="contents">No Plan D will be a success if, in addition to the ‘D’ for ‘debate’, ‘dialogue’ and ‘democracy’, it does not also include ‘D’ for ‘delivery’. Delivery is the best context in which to recast the text of the Constitution, and the best way to make people understand just how useful Europe can be. That is why even self-inflicted failures, like today’s <span class="italic">de facto</span> refusal to regulate market access to port services, can become symbolically dangerous.</p>
<p class="contents">There are areas of recognised European competence in which the existing treaties already provide for qualified majority voting and the interinstitutional codecision procedure – transport is one example. There are also areas where subsidiarity should properly be interpreted in reverse: not letting the Member States do badly what can be done better at a European level. In these areas of competence, the Union must raise its delivery rate and dare to show how useful it can be.</p>
<p class="contents">Today it is no longer enough to see the Union merely as a clever solution to the problems of war, including the Cold War. What we need is a Union that is equal to the global challenges of the third millennium. We are also reflecting in order to better understand what we must do tomorrow, but we must be careful not to let that be an excuse for any inaction on our part today, or we would risk invalidating all our reflection, no matter how clever it might be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It may therefore have come as a surprise that I was appointed to draft the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development in respect of the report on the period of reflection following the rejection of the Constitution. I consider this a sign of the openness with which our Committee approached this issue. The principle of <span class="italic">audiatur et altera pars</span> – let the other side be heard – is one of the fundamental preconditions for real dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">My views provoked constructive debate in committee, resulting in a compromise that was well thought through, and anything but toothless. The report was endorsed by every member of the Committee, with no votes against, and four abstentions. This demonstrates that dialogue on the future of the Union is possible. Our report in fact advocates principles that are missing from the report of Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber. I refer in particular to the principle of legal precaution, by which we should be guided, so that we do not, in the regulations which we approve during the period of reflection, constantly refer to a Constitution that is currently dead from a legal standpoint but which might be resurrected in its original form. It is naïve and misguided to believe that the more often we refer to the Constitution the more we will boost its chances for resuscitation. Such rules may needlessly be undermined at some future point.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Committee’s report also recommends that we enter into cooperation with the institutions of national and regional parliaments, which possess a high degree of qualification and legitimacy, and that we do this more than just once a year for the sake of appearances, as recommended in the report before us today. Unfortunately, there are other parts of the report that strike a discordant note, the most surprising of which is that it sets out what the result of open dialogue ought to be. It evens states that the now dead Constitution is to be ratified in 2009. This is tantamount to trampling over the democratic will of the people of at least two EU Member States. If we are to prescribe the outcome of dialogue in advance, if we reduce dialogue to the level of a stage-managed performance involving unrepresentative bodies, if we continue to spend money in such a way that only the most gratifying opinions are heard, the EU will never have any chance of developing effective structures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This House has had a long fight where codecision in agricultural matters is concerned, and the draft constitution’s incorporation of codecision – which goes back to the Treaties of Amsterdam – in the fields of environmental protection, food safety and the protection of consumers is something to be welcomed. Where agricultural policy is concerned, however, the Council of Agriculture Ministers can still disregard the opinions of the European Parliament, since the codecision procedure is not, under the current Treaty, applicable to the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the draft constitution, when considered in the light of the above, held out the prospect of increased democratic legitimacy, in that all decisions on agricultural policy were to be subject to codecision, the Agriculture Committee does believe that the existing text is still in need of some improvements. The objectives of the common agricultural policy, as set out in Article III-227, contradict the goals of the European Union described in Article I-3, and no longer serve any readily explainable purpose. They must, as a matter of urgency, be updated to take account of the multifunctional nature of our present agriculture, which provides work for 10 million people in the EU, is the sole guarantor of the sustainable development of rural areas and cannot be considered in isolation from them.</p>
<p class="contents">This draft constitution is not equal to the task of creating a CAP that is acceptable to society at large, and so one priority for any future treaty must be to extend codecision to the common agricultural policy, and, in particular, to close the loopholes that remain in Articles III-230 (2) and III-231 (2) of the text as it stands at present.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the CAP is so very important and occupies a predominant position in the EU’s Budget, the European public have every right to the highest possible degree of transparency and, above all in this sensitive area, codecision – which, as I see it, can mean nothing other than full codecision for the European Parliament on all matters relating to agricultural policy, consumer protection and the safety of food. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that that state of affairs is now a thing of the past.</p>
<p class="contents">I have had the honour of drafting the Legal Affairs Committee’s opinion, which is very much in line with the content of this draft report from the lead Committee. The Legal Affairs Committee’s particular concern has been that we should not prematurely abandon the present draft constitution. In the subject areas that really matter to us, such as the composition and powers of the European Court of Justice, the reordering of the lawmaking process and comitology procedure, and judicial cooperation, we simply do not see that a completely new start would enable us to make any real improvements; indeed, it is more likely to have the opposite effect. While I do regret having had to listen today to the Austrian Presidency’s critical views of the powers of the European Court of Justice and the fact that such criticism comes now not only from that source, it does lead me to think that the solutions provided in this draft constitution really are very good after all.</p>
<p class="contents">We have good legal reasons for objecting to any hasty division of the draft Constitution. Part I contains a very large number of fundamental principles, and we all know that it was only the derogations contained in Part III that made them politically acceptable. We also, albeit with some regret, have good legal reasons for regarding Parts I and III as connected, and no new structure will be possible without fundamental reworking of Part III.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by expressing my grave disappointment with the letter from the three presidents of national parliaments. The sight of many former members of the Convention in this Chamber reminds me of the dedication with which members of the national parliaments worked with us on the draft constitution, of the important proposals they had to make, and, in view of that, I simply cannot regard this letter from the three presidents as being the last word on the subject. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What does this opinion say? First of all, it points out all the improvements provided for by the Constitution in relation to the current Treaties. The improvements in terms of security, liberty and justice were many and significant and, above all, they were the subject of consensus on the part of the nations comprising Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not going to list them all, but I shall simply mention four points that are likely to get us over this bad patch and that the excellent report by my colleagues, Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber has put back on the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the widespread introduction of qualified majority voting and the simplification of the legislative acts enable us to devise a policy rather than be thwarted by the finer points of such a policy. Next, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, which is a factory of Community law when Parliament is at a loss, is extended. The definitive strengthening of Parliament’s role as co-legislator might also be mentioned, this being something that we need to promote. Finally, integrating the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the very wording of the Constitution confers legal value upon the latter. There are, of course, other positive points, but those I have just listed are genuinely fundamental.</p>
<p class="contents">Forgive my alluding to these possibilities still open to us, but I wanted to emphasise the advances entailed by this Constitution in an area not discussed throughout the EU Member States, namely that of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the area of freedom, justice and security. Therein lies, indeed, the material for constructing a framework right now, pending the advent of a new document. Why, therefore, do the Member States not take more advantage of this material in order to try to bind together again an EU that is being given a rough ride?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we consider it a matter of priority systematically to take account of the impact of EU policies on fundamental rights and, so that we might not delay in presenting an initial bill, we emphasise how urgent it is to set up an independent Agency for Fundamental Rights, as requested by Parliament on 26 May 2005. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Seldom do we discuss more important issues than the one we are discussing now. Our thanks should go to the rapporteurs who have taken the initiative and, on the basis of broad-ranging discussions, have presented this topic.</p>
<p class="contents">The future of Europe is our common problem, equally important for the young and the elderly, for men and women. As Mrs Wallström has emphasised, most European citizens see no problem in the decision-making mechanisms of the European institutions. Their problem is primarily a lack of clarity in the vision they have of their own future, their prospects, their security and the new challenges which they are still struggling to find a response to.</p>
<p class="contents">Uncertainty and fear of the future were clearly the main factors behind the NO outcome in the votes on the Constitution. Clearly, we are all responsible for finding a way forwards. Those of us here at the European Parliament should be aware of the messages and signals we are sending out when we take decisions, for instance, on cohesion instruments or the transfer of pension rights or when we give preferential treatment to migrants from third countries rather than to the citizens of new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The governments of Member States must bear their share of responsibility for frequently behaving as if European matters, such as the work-life balance goals formulated in the Lisbon Strategy, do not concern them. A fundamental question remains as to whether we will be able to develop a sufficiently appealing common vision and as to whether our European values will be strong enough to produce an adequate level of social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, women account for more than [half] of all European citizens and voters. They have their own specific problems, which call for a sensitive approach and satisfactory solutions. The views of women should therefore be accorded sufficiently serious consideration in the forthcoming debate. Mr President, I would like to emphasise in conclusion that, in the opinion of the Committee for Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, a repeat of the split between the core countries of Europe and the remaining ones would be one of the worst possible outcomes of our efforts to find a way forwards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First, it is nice to start talking about the Constitution again. The budget is out of the way; we can start focusing on other things. To me, it seems as if the Constitution has been in intensive care for the past eight or nine months. Now it has been slowly taken out and I think the process of recovery will be slow, but I think we should be looking at 2009.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the message of this report is that all options are open; easy does it; let us not say that the Constitution is dead; let us not start renegotiating; let us not say that this Treaty cannot enter into force. We have time and we have to think about it.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is that recently there has been some controversy between the European Parliament and the speakers of three national parliaments. We need to turn that into a positive. The European Parliament should not, and must not, be arrogant or paternal towards the national parliaments. Yes, let us have a European forum, but let us do it together and have a real debate about the future of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is that from some sections in the past few months we have heard talk about ‘core Europe’. I think that talk is absolute and utter rubbish, because the people we hear it from are usually the people who want to put the brakes on integration. Let us start by ratifying the Constitution; let us get the ball rolling, let us work together and, most importantly, let us work together within the institutions of the European Union. I cringe at any talk about ‘core Europe’ outside. The best way forward is to do it inside the Treaty, do it together, and I am sure we can overcome this and have a Constitution by 2009. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now there are at least two views within that majority. One view is to say that this text of the Constitution is dead following the referendum defeats in France and the Netherlands; that we had better start thinking of something else and preparing a different way forward. The other view is to say: wait a minute, this text has actually now been ratified by a majority of Member States. The heads of government themselves in the European Council did not declare it dead, they extended the period of ratification and opened a period of reflection. In that period of reflection we must listen to those who said ‘no’, but we must also listen to the majority who have said ‘yes’ and find a way forward that can ultimately bring the two together.</p>
<p class="contents">This report achieves a synthesis of those two viewpoints. It says that it is too soon to conclude now; the period of reflection must be extended at least until 2007. Until then we need to keep all options open. We need longer and deeper reflection. Of course – as is to be expected – we say that this Parliament would prefer to maintain the text, but we recognise that that would only be possible if measures were taken to reassure and convince public opinion. What those measures are is left open. There are, in theory, many options: supplementary interpretative declarations, extra protocols, rewriting part of the text, rewriting the whole text, starting a new text. That we will conclude at the end of the period of reflection, but for now let us keep on with that reflection, deepen it, broaden it and reach conclusions in a year’s time.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing is certain, Mr President: the status quo – that is, the current Treaties – is not sufficient for this Union in its enlarged form to function effectively or democratically. This issue will not go away. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We were convinced that the EU needed the constitutional framework. We considered the Constitutional Treaty to be an efficient tool for moving the EU forward and for giving it the political dimension and social perspective that are both necessary. We have not changed our opinion, and we do not think that the Constitution should be declared defunct before we have examined it for signs of life. Otherwise, it will be impossible to declare that the patient is dead.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor, however, can the fact be ignored that, during the process of ratification, a disjunction appeared between the desire for deeper integration, demonstrated by the European elites, and the feelings of a section of European society. This disjunction is not only of relevance to the two countries that refused to ratify the draft Constitution. It is a serious problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Jean Monnet used to say that, faced with a serious problem, its context sometimes has to be changed. That is precisely the purpose of the period of reflection. The great public debate on the future of the European Union should create a new context for the European constitutional enterprise. It is for the European Parliament to define the framework and the arrangements for these debates, to have the national parliaments and civil society take part in them, to specify the questions and to draw up the necessary agenda. It is in that way that it will be possible for the European forum to appear, and to do so in the form of a public space for Europe. We must not decide just yet on the future of the document. That time will come after the period of reflection, after the European debate and after having changed the context. The report presented to us states this very well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union needs a democratic Constitution and cannot just stumble along with Nice. The debate that must take place on the Constitution has to be a European debate, and the letter sent by the three presidents of national parliaments shows that responsibility for the debate cannot be left at national level, but that there is a need for a truly European body, like this Parliament, to conduct it and – all right, yes, we must say it openly – to steer it as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Two things are missing in the report, however, and we hope to be able to introduce them with the vote in this House. In fact, Mr Corbett, I do not agree with you: it is absolutely not true that the movement of those who voted ‘yes’ to the Constitution is split between those who now want to get rid of the text and those who want to keep it. It is not like that. The amendment that we shall put to the vote tomorrow explicitly states that one possibility – not a theoretical one, but a practical one – might be to change the text and that, if that were to happen, it would require a new constitutional process, which might also end with a referendum.</p>
<p class="contents">To think, however, that the only proposal that we, as the European Parliament, should put forward is to maintain the current text and nothing else is false and short-sighted, and it is that attitude that might really divide the pro-European movement, that is to say the movement that obtained broad support for the Constitution in this House, with 500 votes.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the two amendments tabled by the rapporteurs should be supported by a large majority in this Parliament, because they simply state that it is possible to debate various options. Perhaps no option is better than the others, but I believe that they should all be discussed, including the one that right now sounds strangely drastic, which is that we should reopen the debate on the Constitution with the citizens as well.</p>

For example, the two co-rapporteurs of the resolution we are now debating did not consider it appropriate this time to describe the majority of the electorate in France and the Netherlands with the unkind epithets that some levelled at them a few months ago.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to thank Mr Voggenhuber and Mr Duff for emphasising here, at least in their resolution, that the citizens have in fact, and I quote, 'expressed concerns and worries which need to be taken into account', and that we need to respect their decision and 'to analyse carefully the reasons for the negative results'. That is a step forward. This would be even clearer if the report stated that the draft treaty is now dead and that the debate now centres on what should replace it. My group is prepared to take an active part in the debate on the future of the Union with our fellow citizens. As regards the topics put forward for those discussions, we agree with them in essence.</p>
<p class="contents">The question that arises is this: what will be the political result of this debate? How far are you prepared to go in transforming the policies and structures of the EU as it is, in order to meet the demands being made by most of Europe's societies, which were demonstrated most spectacularly by the rejection of the constitutional treaty? That is where the problem lies. The report now before us proposes only, and I quote, 'to reassure … public opinion', given that, and again I quote, 'in any case … the Constitution enters into force during 2009'. In that case, it is no longer a debate, but a communication campaign.</p>

Could you imagine a national parliament praising Labour policies and condemning Conservative ones on the front of the parliament building itself? No, you could not, could you? You still use taxpayers’ money to distribute millions of brochures propagating what was rejected. You started ratification of a text which had not yet been properly translated. You refused to publish a reader-friendly edition of the Constitution, because you wanted the text approved without being read. You manipulated the time schedule for holding referendums and hoped to drive the UK into a corner after 24 ratifications. But, dear colleagues, you lost, as I have done several times.</p>

<p class="contents">A new agreement could be drafted by a directly elected convention and put to referendums in all the Member States, perhaps at the same time as the next European elections. Then we would know the verdict of the citizens. The French voters have not regretted their ‘no’; many Dutch voters have changed their minds, but they were the ones who voted ‘yes’. Listen to the voters, let us make a fresh start.</p>

Secondly, and most importantly of all, I would like to thank the Austrian Presidency for having the political courage to take this issue out of the esoteric area and put it back on the political agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most important issues we have to look at – and it follows on from what Mr Bonde has just been saying – is: when is a ‘no’ really a ‘no’? When is it that one country can stop every other country from moving forward? When is it that two countries can prevent other countries from moving forward? The uniqueness of what the European Union has been about is that it has striven to find common ground between very different and varying interests. Just because we have hit a barrier with regard to progress in constitutional change and treaty change aiming at a more efficient and effective way of decision-making, does that mean that we have to stick our heads in the sand, as some of my colleagues would say? The ostrich, whilst it may stick its head in the sand at some stage, is also the fastest runner on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to learn very quickly how to become fast runners to deal with the concerns that people have. Those concerns are not just related to the model of the European Union. Many of those who voted ‘no’ in France or Holland voted that way because of domestic political reasons. They also voted out of fear. As we discovered in Ireland some years ago, there was an irrational fear in some people when they voted ‘no’, a fear of the huge influx of immigrants taking all our jobs, stealing our social welfare and ruining our country. The reality was totally different: integration is possible; common sense and calmness is possible, but most importantly of all, this is true not just within this insular House and not just within national parliaments. Until such time as we convince the citizens and allow them ownership of the European Union project, only then and truly then can we say that we have a citizens’ Europe that rightfully belongs to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With breathtaking arrogance this report, and indeed the last speaker, seeks to second-guess and repudiate the democratic verdict of the people of France and Holland by declaring that those results were not about rejecting the Constitution, but about dissent and other issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonsense! The question on the ballot paper was about one thing only – the acceptability of the Constitution – and the answer was equally clear. Why not face the truth? You lost. Instead, the Europhiles in this House have a new catchphrase. They think it is very clever: ‘Context, not text, is the problem’. How fitting that it begins with the word ‘con’. For that is what this period of reflection is all about. How can the text be repackaged so that next time they can con the voters into buying the soiled goods that is the Constitution? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is just as important to me, which does not mean one should not take the ‘no’s’ into consideration, for they also send out a strong message we should take into account. That is only a negative message, though, one that does not offer an alternative, whilst, paradoxically, the fear that this ‘no’ expresses would probably be best allayed in a European Constitution, in a European response.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, as the Commissioner was right to point out, looking at Eurobarometer, we notice that the citizens know very well that a number of cross-border problems require a European response and ‘more Europe’. I particularly have the second and third pillars in mind, which is mainly what the Constitution would have catered for. Another paradox is that during the referendum debates, the strengthening of this political Europe was virtually overlooked in the second and third pillars.</p>
<p class="contents">I do think that it is indeed now time to actively use the period of reflection provided for by the Commission’s plan D. We should, in other words, take all the time we need and not rush into anything. That is why I endorse the report that is before us now, because it points in that direction, although I fear that certain amendments which the rapporteurs have re-tabled seem to favour the short cuts and draw conclusions prematurely. I think that we should take the time, together with the national parliaments, mainly to provide a response to the basic question mentioned in the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was good news for my country and surely for the whole of the Union. I say this because we Spanish joined twenty years ago and a little more than a year ago we held a referendum and voted ‘yes’ to the European Constitution, with the same rights, duties and responsibilities with which other countries, France and the Netherlands, voted ‘no’. A ‘yes’ is worth the same as a ‘no’, whether expressed by referendum or by a parliament. And today an absolute majority of members of the Union have said yes to the European Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">This report – I have had the opportunity to work with its two rapporteurs for four months, as shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group – is a balanced result, which essentially says four things:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, this Parliament still considers the Constitution to be the best instrument for creating a more democratic and effective Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, if it does not enter into force, the Union’s political and institutional problems will worsen, not just persist, and furthermore it will be impossible to carry out more enlargements on the basis of the Treaty of Nice following the entry of Bulgaria and Rumania.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must begin a genuine period of reflection and debate, amongst the institutions and with the citizens, in order to seek solutions to the current crisis. At the end of this period we will have to draw conclusions that allow us to move forward and complete the political union.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, to be consistent with how we acted in January 2005, a positive result from this period of reflection would be to maintain the current text, which would only be possible with the appropriate measures. We shall then define the appropriate measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the current political context, we can say that there are new elements on the basis of which we can move ahead with the Constitution and refute two positions: firstly, the statement that the Constitution is dead – well, reports of its death have been grossly exaggerated – and, secondly, the idea that we must first deal with unemployment, immigration or fighting crime, a view which ignores the fact that, in order to do so, we need this Constitution. This is not just an issue for institutionalists.</p>

To it I would add that this Treaty represents the beginning of the end for an enlarged Union of citizens. What, after all, is Nice all about? It is about there being no fundamental rights binding in law, no citizens’ initiatives, no clear demarcation of powers, no full budgetary rights for the European Parliament, right of national parliaments to intervene in response to proposals from the Commission, no parliamentary control of Europol, no foreign minister and no European diplomatic service.</p>
<p class="contents">The list of all the things that Europe stands to lose without a constitution is a very long one; there must be no march back to the past. Are we then to say, in all seriousness, that Nice must be cast in concrete? I do not want the European Union to degenerate into a free trade zone with limited social liability; a core Europe that draws new dividing lines across Europe is unacceptable, and so the constitutional process must go on. Europe needs a new Treaty. The one thing that is blindingly clear is that ‘as you were’ will get us nowhere.</p>
<p class="contents">People’s worries and problems must, at last, be taken seriously – that is the message that comes over, loud and clear, from the French and Dutch referenda on the Constitution. What we need is a political shift in the European Union, in the shape of a move towards a social Europe. It is only then that there will be active public support for the enlarged Union and for a Europe united in peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the eyes of many European citizens the EU spends its time discussing bananas, the shape of a carrot and solar radiation levels, but not the issues that relate to the everyday life of European citizens. Seven out of ten citizens in Slovakia know very little about the EU and its structure. Citizens view the Union as something distant from their daily problems. It came as a shock that more people cast their votes in a recent Big Brother reality TV show than during the elections to the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Mass media play an important and crucial role in informing European citizens. Citizens are interested in the EU and want information on how it functions. The mass media should begin to inform them about the work of European institutions and the ways in which their decisions can affect everyday life. For this to happen, however, the right conditions need to be in place. I can appreciate that a journalist may find it difficult to explain draft legislation containing thousands of amendments, especially if the text is published just a few days before voting takes place and is not, for that matter, published in all languages. If the media are to inform citizens objectively about the work of the EU, they must focus on genuine work rather than titbits or scandals. At the same time, however, we must create the conditions for citizens to become better informed; we must eliminate the complex nature of European legislation and restrict the number of debates taking place behind closed doors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that languages are a vehicle for communication rather than for isolation.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, Mr President, that this report makes three important points. Mr Dehaene and Mr Stubb have already said some important things on this issue, but there are three points that I would like to mention.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, this Constitution is the result of a consensus and, until we have an alternative menu, this is what we have. And it is a good consensus because those people who have voted ‘no’ in certain countries of the European Union are incapable of having a coffee together or of producing an alternative text. That is the reality. Those who say ‘no’ are people who reject but do not build. They are not proposing anything. Until there is another menu on the table, I shall stick to this menu and this Parliament will stick to this menu.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we are against the partial application of aspects of the Constitution. Why? For the same reason: because the Constitution is the result of a consensus and we are not all in agreement with all of it, but we agree with it as a whole and we would not therefore accept − and this Parliament is right to state this in its report − the idea of taking one thing but not another. We agree with everything as a whole but we do not agree with cherry-picking<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, this Parliament states in this report that there will not be any new enlargements of the European Union without a Constitution, and it has good reason. We are aware that the Union will not operate, either in democratic terms or in terms of efficiency, without the provisions laid down in the Constitution. This appears in Article 49 of the current Treaties, Mr President, and I address this to our ostrich friends, because this Parliament must give its opinion on any enlargement of the European Union and, through this report, this Parliament is making a very clear and solemn commitment: there will be no enlargements without a Constitution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Duff/Voggenhuber report has sparked lively debates, and is as such part of Commissioner Wallström’s Plan D.</p>
<p class="contents">What has come out of our deliberations is, then, something very encouraging: the overwhelming majority in this House holds fast to the European constitution. Far from disappearing, the reasons for the new European treaty have become more pressing: greater effectiveness, more transparency, more democracy. All the reforms and advances that the constitution brings with it are urgently needed. The debates in the Netherlands and France have done nothing to consign them to oblivion. I am very glad that the Austrian Presidency is breathing new life into this debate. Over the last few months, we have been in some sense paralysed. What we need for 2006 is a wide-ranging debate in all twenty-five countries, and I can tell the President of the Council and the Vice-President that I hope all twenty-five of them will make their contribution. I have seen the interim report from the December summit; it left a great deal to be desired. In most of the Member States, the debate has not even begun yet, and so it would be quite wrong, now, in January 2006, to present the results of a debate even before we have had one. What we have to do now is spend a year discussing the great issues of European policy with all the stakeholders in all the Member States, and then we will be able, in 2007, to come to conclusions as to which procedure we opt for to bring this project to a successful conclusion. There are various options available to us; my country’s Chancellor has asked why we do not extend the constitution by adding on to it a protocol on the social Europe, and that is a way forward that we should discuss.</p>
<p class="contents">This period of reflection will endow us, and European democracy, with new strength. We have every chance of coming out of this crisis in better condition than we were in when it started.</p>

Although it is true that the Constitutional Treaty has been rejected more on account of context than text, it is also true that the text of the Constitutional Treaty proved too weak to solve the problems in context. It lacked a sufficient number of bold and engaging ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">Why do we not give the citizens real power and get them to directly elect the President of the Commission, for example, or create the possibility of a European collective referendum – so not 25 or 27 small referendums, but a true European referendum – or why do we not create a truly European political space, in other words a European <span class="italic">res publica</span>?</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to context, the Dutch citizens – like, I assume, those in most other Member States too – do not in any event want to discuss the institutions for the moment, thank you very much. What they do want is a Europe that becomes competitive, creates jobs, combats terrorism and cross-border crime, that pursues proper external policy, and that, at long last, simply does what it is expected to do. If we do not succeed, then, breathing new life into a Treaty review is like flogging a dead horse and all talk then becomes academic.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly, we need a new Treaty in order to make Europe more democratic and more efficient, but there is no rush. Some of the many excellent ideas which our rapporteurs have floated are intended to extend the period of reflection to late-2007, to keep more options open and also in general, I welcome a method to indicate how we should hold the debate. What we do not need, though, is a document entitled ‘Constitution’ which frightens people off rather than involving them. After all, a rose smells just as sweetly under another name. As a result, holding onto the name and the text for dear life is for my group an insuperable problem.</p>
<p class="contents">If the solution is to submit an improved text – and I truly hope we will succeed in this, for it is important – then I am in favour of submitting it to all European citizens in a referendum, to coincide with the next European elections. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The question is, is the Constitution dead or is it just sleeping? If the answer to all this had been ‘yes’, there can be no doubt that the Commissioners would have had no difficulty in explaining what ‘yes’ meant. It is just us poor peasants who happen to believe in ‘no’ who now need to have it explained to us what ‘no’ means.</p>
<p class="contents">‘No’ in this case means sheer arrogance on the part of the Commission in presuming to go ahead with this project, when 70% of people in Austria do not want it to go ahead; when two-thirds of the population of Great Britain do not see any benefit in future membership of this sham Parliament; when the people of France have voted ‘no’; and when the people of Holland have voted ‘no’.</p>
<p class="contents">What part of ‘no’ does the Commission not understand? ‘No’ means that large proportions of the population of Europe do not want to continue with this pretence. We thought we were joining a common market and it has grown and grown and grown like Topsy until this final report, which is pushing us towards full political union. Well, it will all fall apart, without any doubt, because that is not what people thought they were voting for.

<p class="contents">However, the main reason for the crisis that has developed is not the content of the Constitution that ensures a better regulation of the future functioning of the European Union, but the fact that in the eyes of many citizens, the performance of the European Union is not satisfactory and it is not convincing. The institutions and the elite running the European Union have lost the trust of a number of citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the opinion of the European Commission, and as I mentioned in my accepted motion for amendment, it is important to ensure that one of the objectives of the period of consideration is to find ways for the European Union to regain the trust of citizens. We also believe that in order to ensure success, we need a debate on how the European Union can increase its performance and how it can contribute to the solution of the real problems of people.</p>
<p class="contents">The Constitutional Treaty, or its most important sections must be preserved.

<p class="contents">I myself am a former member of the Convention, a socialist and a Frenchman, in no particular order, and I would like, at this stage, to step into this infamous debate on the death or otherwise of the Constitution. I have every respect for the people who voted for this text – I myself voted 'yes' – but, at the same time, we cannot act as if nothing had happened, as if the French and Dutch votes made no difference to the situation. Neither can we act as if there was now only one possible solution, only one result, namely the ratification, after a few detours, of the original text rejected by the French and the Dutch.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we need to help the rapporteurs, and to that end I have co-signed, with them and with Mrs Berès, a number of amendments calling for reality to be taken into account. I would refer you in particular to three amendments: Amendment 18, Amendment 24 and Amendment 27. I think that, if we adopt them, if Parliament adopts them, it will give itself a wide range of options, it will be open-minded, it will make a real contribution to the debate, and it will not get bogged down in a single solution, idea or way of thinking. When all is said and done, I want to vote in favour of this text, as do the French socialists, but we cannot do so if it is just a one-way street. Therefore, let us continue to move forwards tomorrow by voting in favour of these amendments.</p>

Of that there can be no doubt. Two countries have voted against it in referenda and done so with large majorities and high turnouts. The fact that the European political establishment is now trying to explain this away is a democratic scandal. Politicians and senior officials are now openly discussing how the results of these referenda are to be circumvented. They have, of their own accord, the audacity to interpret the results in terms of dissatisfaction with the governments in office in both countries. They are beginning to calculate how many countries were in favour of the draft Constitution, in spite of its being clear that all the countries have to approve the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Rarely has it been so clear how wide the gulf is between the political elite and the populations on EU issues. Everything indicates that the draft Constitution would have been rejected in Germany, too, if there had been a referendum there. The same applies to the United Kingdom, Austria, Sweden, Denmark and perhaps other countries too. The EU’s power-wielding elite talks shamelessly, however, about difficult setbacks that made their presence felt last year. I wish to point out that democratic outcomes are only setbacks for those who have come off worse because they lack grassroots support.

<p class="contents">The peoples of two core founding States have thrown your projects out, my friends. I know it is hard to accept rejection, but look at the figures: 55% of French voters; 62% of Dutch voters. You might try to argue that the voters have got it wrong; that they are suffering from what Marxists used to call false consciousness; that they need better propaganda; that it is up to us – the Euro-elite – to point them in the right direction. To which I say, ‘Do your damnedest’.</p>
<p class="contents">Current polls in the Netherlands show that 82% of Dutch voters would now vote ‘no’ – a tribute to the level-headedness of that brave people. But if you think you can turn them around, dear colleagues, be my guests. Doing so would at least prove your commitment to the democratic ideals you so frequently invoke.</p>
<p class="contents">Far more outrageous would be to push ahead with the implementation of the Constitution – or, at least, of its contents – without popular consent. Yet this is precisely what you are doing. Look at the number of policies and institutions envisaged by the Constitution that have been or are being enacted regardless: the European External Action Service, the European Human Rights Agency, the European Defence Agency, the European Space Programme, the European External Borders Agency, a justiciable Charter of Fundamental Rights: none of these has any proper legal basis outside the Constitution. By adopting them anyway, you demonstrate that you will allow no force – internal or external, neither your own rule book nor the expressed opposition of your peoples in the ballot box – to arrest the rush to political assimilation. In doing so, you vindicate the severest of your opponents’ criticisms.</p>

<p class="contents">This means that despite the doubts and reluctance expressed, the Constitution has certainly not been discarded. It is not a thing of the past. On the contrary, it continues to feature prominently on our agendas. As a result of the French and Dutch ‘no’ votes, the Constitution remains very much alive because we are continuing to debate it. All Europeans need to find an answer to the question as to the kind of Europe they want.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of this resolution, Parliament is calling on all European citizens to engage in a far-reaching discussion of the question to which I just referred. It is also calling on all national parliaments and governments to state what their expectations are. We should be saying to the governments of the nine Member States which have not yet ratified the Constitution that since their Prime Ministers signed the document, they ought to commence ratification proceedings because it is their right and duty to do so under international law. It is a duty pursuant to the Convention on the Law of Treaties.</p>

Political institutions and social actors, along with the media, will take on the responsibility of addressing the following question: does Europe want to secure the future?</p>
<p class="contents">The constitution issue is not a simple matter of the architecture of the institutions. It is more about the way in which Europe ensures that its institutions act in accordance with a moral awareness of the world. All of us, citizens of Europe, in the corridors of power, on the Union’s front line, feel the weight of this challenge. How can we govern such a huge and open cosmopolitan area? How can we realise a project of justice that lies both inside and outside Europe’s boundaries? How can we build a way of life not based on tradition? How can we turn Europe into a democratic power and founder of a new world order? How, as a union of different communities, can we be a role model? How can we find a way, together, of protecting human rights around the world? How can we find a way, together, of influencing the world? How can we return to politics its legislative power over a globalised and deregulated economy? How can we connect justice with efficiency? How can we open the doors to new political models?</p>
<p class="contents">The future allows us no room for fear. We have an urgent need to discuss political integration, to discuss the introduction of a cosmopolitan and more human way of life, to discuss the extent to which the Constitution itself represents and constructs our European identity. After all, our European identity was not born out of tradition, but out of morality, desire and reason. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To build or rebuild the people’s trust we need vision, effective policies and means, and the means include financial resources and the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we, as Parliament, must not abandon the prospect of the Constitutional Treaty. As for the diatribe about the current text, I think Parliament must defend everything that has been gained through it. Will the debate be able to move on? I do not think it will be easy but, quite frankly, I am not going to rule out that path, either.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, as has already been emphasised, I should like us to take that path in close collaboration with the national parliaments, since the way the debate on the subject has been conducted, particularly by European governments, has, in my view, been neither thorough nor correct. I should like to thank the Austrian Presidency for having at last partly resurrected the debate. Let us hope that from now on the various institutions can be more in tune with each other. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nor shall I refer to the detailed, extensive and exhaustive discussions held last year; I shall refer to the dialogue to which they refer.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to express the opinion that the dialogue which we need to hold must revolve not around the Constitution but around the existential problems of the European Union, which are: firstly, the degree to which the European Union is still necessary; secondly, if the European Union is necessary, what type of European Union do we want and, thirdly, how enlarged a European Union do we want.</p>
<p class="contents">If there is no common answer to these existential questions at the level of both policies and citizens, I greatly fear that no form of Constitution for Europe will ever be acceptable to the citizens of Europe. If and insofar as we in the European Union believe that it needs to be unified and strengthened, then our challenge is to convince the citizens also of the correctness of this way forward. Confidence and faith in the European vision are the basis of the universal consent of states and citizens to constitutional arrangements for the functioning of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">If the citizens of the European states do not realise the importance to mankind of the existence and further unification and strengthening of the European Union, then I predict that no constitutional proposal will be accepted in future. That is why I believe that we should not waste any more time. We need to build on what we have and what we have today is the Constitution. That is what we need to work on and that is what we need to build on, because I greatly fear that any other effort we make to create an alternative will fail and will be a final failure which will be at the expense of the unification and progress of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is time we got to work. What is this work? In my opinion, it is not analysing ourselves in interminable discussions about the precise definition of the new social state, EU financing and so on. If we believe that we shall find common ground between us on all these questions as a precondition to trying the Constitution again, I believe that we shall never have a European constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, in my opinion there should only be one final objective to this period of reflection. Irrespective of each person's political convictions, we need to persuade ourselves that, for all these major European wagers, we can, as Europeans, address them better jointly than separately. This is perhaps also the most important context which is missing for any text if it is to be acceptable to everyone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are now hearing it said, over and over again, that 70 % of Austrians do not want this constitution – an obvious reference to the latest Eurobarometer surveys and no more revealing than they are, combined with a flagrant disregard for the democratic rules and procedures that apply in Austria, my own country, where both houses of the country’s Parliament have ratified the Constitution by massive majorities. Some, however, attach greater weight to percentages in surveys than to the procedures required by constitutional law.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor do I have any sympathy with the <span class="italic">modus operandi</span> adopted by those who already want to discuss alternatives, even before the ongoing ratification process is completed. Those who are now calling for new alternatives are treating as worthless the decisions democratically reached in most of the Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">More to the point, where are these alternatives? In the Convention on the Future of Europe, we had long discussions on all of them; discussions about a more democratic Europe, a more social Union and so on. Over and over again, we came up with the same results. Desirable though they might be, every improvement of that kind would end up producing more Europe, and a stronger Europe, and hence the very thing that most of the Member States and the people who live in them do not at present want – a continuing loss of power on the part of the nation states. Let us then do what the majority in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has proposed; let us try to inform the European public about what really is, and is not, in the 2004 Constitutional Treaty, and let us have a second run at getting a consensus in support of the best constitution currently on the market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A whole range of them have been expressed, but one thing that has been said does strike me as corresponding to the majority view in the Council, and that is that the European Union, at this present time, before we get a clearer view of the situation, should keep every realistic and reasonable option open, for what we have learned from our experiences over the past year is that quick, perhaps even premature or precipitate estimates of the situation get us nowhere in this debate. I agree with Mr Leinen that the Presidency of the Council, at this stage of debate, would be ill-advised to try to pre-empt results, and would indeed risk doing damage were it to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need now is a discussion. Let me reiterate my gratitude to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and to the rapporteurs, Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber, for initiating this debate. The Presidency will respond to it. We too believe that all the opinions voiced in this debate have to be respected. As the Vice-President Wallström so aptly said, ‘what we want is a Europe for everyone’. Building that Europe is a task that the Austrian Presidency of the Council, too, has set itself. Together with the other Member States and in consultation with the other institutions, we will work on the road map to which reference was made earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">To the statement made today to the effect that the public are not interested in any debate about institutions, I would counter that this Europe of ours does, however, need the institutions and institutional structures that will enable it to do what its citizens expect of it.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much hope that what the President of the Council has said today will have made it plain that the Austrian Presidency of the Council is very definitely in earnest about addressing the problems that affect the European public and are of interest to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is to quote Mr Brok who, at the beginning of the debate, said that the citizens are the stakeholders. It is Europe’s citizens who are the most important target group and who have the most to gain or to lose from how we handle the issue of a new Constitutional Treaty for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is to say that democracy is no spectator sport. It requires us to engage in debates and in a dialogue with people, to involve our political leaders and our citizens in every possible way and to help each other play our different roles in this connection.</p>
<p class="contents">Having so many times heard wry comments along the lines of ‘what is it in the “no” vote that you do not understand’, I want to add that, in actual fact, opinion polls and interviews have told us precisely why people have come out in favour of, or voted against, the Constitutional Treaty. It is not something we have invented. We know that every referendum, the scope of which includes constitutional issues, involves a risk of one’s in actual fact obtaining answers to questions that have not been asked. That is something of which politicians in all our Member States are aware.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor is there anything particularly odd about the fact that 25 Member States engaging in a debate about how we are to rise to the constitutional challenge posed by a Europe whose membership has grown from 15 to 25 countries should, in actual fact, wonder how we are to extricate ourselves from a situation in which two Member States have rejected the Constitutional Treaty while 14 have approved it. How do we deal with that situation? Are we now simply to bring the process to an end, or is there a way out of the situation? There is nothing odd about these reflections. You are making things rather too easy for yourselves. What is most interesting is that those who represent UKIP (the UK Independence Party) and call this Assembly a sham parliament appear to be all too happy not to contribute a single constructive idea of their own and to let European taxpayers pay their salaries as Members of that sham parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we need, in actual fact, to buck up our ideas and conduct an intellectually honest debate about the issues concerning Europe. We know a very great deal, and there is no short cut. However much you may laugh, all we can do is engage in debate and dialogue with people and to discuss factual matters before linking them to the constitutional solutions that are necessary if we are to obtain a more open, more democratic and more efficient Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
