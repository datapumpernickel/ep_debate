This means that our citizens increasingly feel that the poverty and underdevelopment in which a large part of the population lives affect them and makes them demand that the public authorities demonstrate greater commitment in the field of development<span class="italic"> </span>cooperation<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I hope that this message is conveyed to you when you arrive: responding to this request from the citizens for greater solidarity requires giving the least-developed countries the opportunity to implement the changes necessary to achieve the progress and well-being of their peoples and to make the framework that you have described for us this morning and, with which we are very happy, a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">It also requires, however, a fixed-term commitment to go beyond what was agreed in Laeken and to establish a strict timetable for States that have not yet done so to achieve, within the deadline set, the objective of allocating 0.7% of gross domestic product to official development aid and to do so in order to comply with an ethical requirement: we cannot continue to tolerate the living conditions that so many millions of people, who embody our own dignity and our own rights, are forced to endure.</p>
<p class="contents">Solidarity is part of our <span class="italic">acquis</span>. We must also make this commitment for the sake of coherence, because the challenge of eradicating poverty, which the European Union has taken up, requires a budgetary effort in line with the magnitude of the task facing us. And because, without development, democracy and respect for human rights are nothing more than pipe dreams. And, lastly, because contributing to the progress and development of peoples is the best weapon with which to ensure international peace and security, something that, unfortunately, not all countries seem to understand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We were surprised, a few days ago, by what the President-in-Office of the Council had to say to us in the Committee on Development and Cooperation: we must do everything we can to ensure that Monterrey does not end without agreement and the European Union has to negotiate with the United States until it concludes an agreement with them. The problem is that the extraordinarily restrictive positions of the American administration will be even more restrictive if the European Union makes it known that it is willing to accept anything as long as an agreement is concluded, regardless of its content.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that we know the content of the draft consensus drawn up by those preparing the Conference, our fears are all the more well founded. This statement contains no binding commitment on contributions and on a timetable for financing development. If these turned out to be the Conference’s conclusions, Monterrey would be just another wasted opportunity<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">Seeking agreement must be one of our objectives at the Conference, but concluding an agreement cannot mean making concessions on commitments, such as allocating 0.7 % of GDP, or a timetable for making this contribution with which to finance development. Nor should we go back on targets on which a commitment has already been given for 2015, such as the 50% reduction in people living in conditions of extreme poverty, the two-thirds reduction in current infant mortality rates and the universal provision of primary education for all of the world’s children, boys and girls. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, that is not the development we are seeing in Denmark at the moment where we are cutting back on development aid in a way that I think is very unfortunate. Even though we have cut back, we shall of course still be among the largest providers of aid, but it is, at any event, totally the wrong signal that we in Denmark, and the Danish Government, are sending at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">I also fear that the Montreal Conference will just be another conference, with no practical consequences, and I should therefore like to highlight three practical issues in my speech here today. The first is the demand for development aid. I think it absolutely crucial that we set practical objectives for when the individual EU countries are to have reached a figure of 0.7%. As far as I remember, we have been hearing about this 0.7% since 1974, and the vast majority of countries are still a very long way from achieving that goal. That is why I am also looking forward to hearing what the Commission has elicited from its visit to the different countries in terms of establishing definite time frames. These are what are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing I should like to urge is that Mr Lamy’s efforts to remove trade barriers – efforts which have so far been directed towards the least developed countries – should also apply to other countries for, without trade and without the opportunity to trade without customs barriers, no progress can of course be made. The third thing I should like to emphasise is that we must look at what we can do in the public sector with a view to promoting private investment, and I believe that, in this area, we can bring about more fruitful cooperation than we have done so far. In that way, it will also be possible to translate the World Economic Forum’s words into practical action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that we must now take firm and visible action.</p>
<p class="contents">How do we go about doubling the current level of aid given by industrialised countries to achieve the required USD 50 billion a year, as recommended in several of the preparatory reports for the Monterrey conference, so that we can meet the most basic requirements of developing countries, particularly in terms of education and health?</p>
<p class="contents">What stage has the Commission reached in its negotiations with each Member State on a timetable to enable us to achieve the objective of 0.7%, which was set some 32 years ago? Although the attitude of the United States is placing the very existence of aid for development under serious threat, the Monterrey conference would be an opportunity for the European Union to prepare and set in motion a strict process to rigorously monitor this timetable.</p>
<p class="contents">There are still other avenues to be explored. Firstly, we must cancel debt and go much further than the HIPC initiative. The crisis in Argentina is an urgent reminder – as if it were needed – of the need for us to act. The world parliamentary forum, held some days ago in Porto Alegre, also recommends, by means of a resolution, that the United Nations establish an international tribunal to combat debt in order to guarantee financing for development. Furthermore, it is time to seriously consider introducing a tax on international financial transfers. Lastly, reforms in the financial system and international trade system are obviously needed in order to make them more democratic and to combat the mechanisms which cause poverty in developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, as regards the current situation with aid, we must ensure that payments of sums are made in a swift and efficient manner as, at the end of 2000, EUR 9 billion remained in the coffers of the European Development Fund and we must also change the focus of the ODA. It is, first and foremost, private investors who find this attractive, as it helps to further develop each country’s specialist knowledge of production niches for exporting goods in terms of the requirements of the global market and not of populations. The commitments made towards developing countries must be honoured. This is a legitimate expectation of the 2.8 billion people who live on less than USD 2 per day. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has become almost a customary ritual to trundle out these data each time.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Mr President, we need to take action. There is an urgent need for more practical measures from industrialised countries and international financial institutions, not least through more effective cooperation, without duplication or overlapping of effort. That means more careful monitoring of the allocation of development funds. In other words, we need practical measures implemented with the greatest transparency and with the minimum bureaucracy necessary for the monitoring process.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the March 2002 International Conference at Monterrey and the Johannesburg world summit to be held subsequently this September will be extremely important in this respect. Their success would certainly be a clear signal for further, more general acceleration of measures boosting sustainable development. Key areas for action include mustering local financial resources for development and international resources, including countries in international trading and so on.</p>

The removal of poverty, backwardness and ignorance must be first on the list if we are to combat terrorism. A new world economic order and a new kind of politics are on the agenda – things that were called for by the more than 60 000 participants in the Second World Social Forum in Porto Alegre.</p>
<p class="contents">Argentina is a shocking illustration of where neoliberalism will take us. Those who want to provide really effective development aid should not close their ears to the message from Porto Alegre, but actively involve those democratic forces that are active in that forum, in the brainstorming process and in the implementation of a new politics of development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Most of the speeches raised issues which the Council, of course, bore very much in mind when it took the decisions necessary to achieve the Monterrey consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the requests that I have heard are also shared by the European Union and the Council, which represents the European Union, and the Commission, which will also represent the European Union at the Monterrey Conference. Naturally, I would say that it is highly praiseworthy that these opinions should be expressed in this parliamentary forum, which must be the forum for expressing our ambitions and our aspirations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say, however, that Parliament also well understands and I imagine that it is sensitive to the fact that we are immersed in an international negotiation in which it is not simply enough for the European Union to hold and to express its ideas, of which we are proud, but instead to try to conclude an agreement with everyone else.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that the European Union is in a very special position at this type of conference. It often finds itself in the middle, between some partners at the same level of development, which very frequently do not share our ideas and are not quite so generous, and developing countries which, naturally, do not agree with us, because they have the right to demand much of us and, often, much more than we can normally give.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say that the Monterrey consensus contains all the basic and fundamental elements and, from everything that we have heard today in Parliament, I would say that we have sufficient baggage, both in the Council Presidency and the Commission, to carry on having faith in our ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">We already know that there is consensus and that the consensus is very broad, but this does not exclude us from being more ambitious in Monterrey. I have already listed these ambitions but I wish to repeat them. The European Union intends to issue a message in defence of its values, which I listed previously: the defence of democracy, of good governance, of strengthening the institutional development of aid-receiving countries, the Rule of Law, peace and security and human rights. All of these elements that have been mentioned here in the European Parliament are fundamental values of our culture and civilisation and will be the values that guide us in the debates in Monterrey.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, I would say that we have sufficient grounds to feel satisfied, since the Monterrey consensus takes up all of this, perhaps not as far as we would have liked to see, but it does address these issues in a substantial way. Let us hope that at this meeting, which will be held in March, the European Union, which has a common and single position and counts on the support of Parliament, can go even further with these principles and these objectives that I have expressed and which, as I have seen, enjoy the support of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say, in conclusion, that the Community delegation intends to include five Members of the European Parliament and that, therefore, Parliament will be fully integrated in the delegation and will have first hand information. Naturally, I remain at the disposition of this House and at your disposition, Mr President, to return here after Monterrey and inform you on the outcome of the Conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also very important to remember that fighting global poverty is not a short-term repair job in the poor countries. We often hear the view that, since we have been giving development aid to Africa for 25 or 30 years and they are still poor, maybe the whole approach is wrong. That is a fundamental mistake. This is not a short-term project. Any global society with just a minimum of decency has to understand that the transfer of resources from the rich to the poor must be a permanent feature.</p>
<p class="contents">That approach alters the focus of the discussion about what is wrong with development cooperation. In fact, it holds the key to understanding what globalisation means, and it means taking an inclusive approach to viewing the real world. We had better get used to the idea that a permanent transfer is part of the challenge facing us. This is not the same as accepting that development cooperation should simply deteriorate into becoming some sort of social gap-filling. The whole agenda for structural or political reform vis-à-vis governance is absolutely essential to achieving real progress. But it makes a big difference if seen as something we will have to do for some more years or as part of the future. The whole attitude of different countries to the idea of sharing in this and of this being inseparable from the world view in general is crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Dybkjaer and Mrs Boudjenah mentioned the 0.7 % target for the EU. This is on our agenda for the first time. It has never really been discussed at EU level before, either between the Commission and the Member States or between Member States themselves. So we have made it a new area of discussion. We have established some sort of peer pressure and the response from the series of discussions in capital cities that we carried out before Laeken was in a sense encouraging because all Member States reacted positively to the need to establish some sort of calendar. In this area decision-making still lies with the Member States – the Commission has acquired no new powers here – but this discussion is now legitimate and we will bring it to the fore as one aspect of our input for the Conference in Monterrey.</p>
<p class="contents">This discussion will not end at Monterrey; it is a reflection of how Europe sees itself and the role it should play in the world that we want to move forward in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to Mr van den Berg and Mr van den Bos, who both commented on the imbalance between military and development spending and the whole philosophy behind this, I would point to the general view that the cradle of European and Western civilisation was ancient Greece. Personally, I think it was home to the kind of Europe I want to represent and is the part of Greek history with which I want to identify. I think and hope that for Europe the cradle was in fact Athens rather than Sparta. This is my response to what Members said about the balance between the military approach and this more humanistic or morally driven way of defining our role and our philosophy in this world.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the baggage we will be taking to Monterrey and this is, philosophically speaking, the message we will deliver there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
