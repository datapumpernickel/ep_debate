<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Loud applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to welcome the previous Sakharov Prize laureates who join us today: the President of East Timor, Mr Xanana Gusmão; the President of Kosovo, Mr Ibrahim Rugova; from China, Mr Wei Jingsheng; from Algeria, Ms Salima Ghezali; from Spain, representatives of ¡Basta Ya!; and from Angola, Dom Zacharias Kamwenho.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me also to recall some laureates who are absent: her continuing fight for freedom and democracy in her own country prevents Aung San Suu Kyi from joining us; from Turkey, Leyla Zana sends greetings of support and solidarity; in Cuba and not free to attend, Oswaldo Payá sends his greetings.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(The House rose and applauded each of the laureates)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This is an important occasion for the European Parliament, both symbolic and solemn. Symbolic, because today affords us, the European Parliament and the United Nations, an opportunity to mark and to celebrate the values and the public purpose that we share and hold in common.</p>
<p class="contents">Ours is a Union based on values of pluralist democracy, respect for the rule of law, the promotion of individual and minority rights, solidarity, sustainability, open economy and respect for cultural diversity. Arguably, our European Union is the most successful conflict resolution process the world has seen and we are proud of that.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This House strongly believes in the value and worth of the United Nations and its Charter, and in multilateralism.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We are resolved to make our positive contribution to ensure that, in meeting the challenges and duties of the 21st century, multilateralism can and shall be effective. We support the fight against global terrorism, but we also insist on recognising the duty to fight against global poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards weapons of mass destruction, we stand firmly on the side of non-proliferation, but our instinctive European response is for engagement and not for isolation.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a responsibility to the security of our citizens in the Union to ensure that our borders are not porous or open to international trafficking and crime, and yet we also have a duty before humanity not to be a 'fortress Europe'.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Let me tell you, Mr Secretary-General, that as Europeans, our Union and its Member States are proud to be the largest donor community of untied development assistance, humanitarian aid and food aid in the world. We are proud of what we do, but we accept that we could and should do more.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We in the Parliament are proud of our commitment in this Union to the politics of sustainability – locally and globally – not least in our constant promotion of the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Our belief in the rule of law has galvanised this House into being one of the earliest, most consistent and most vocal supporters of the International Criminal Court.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I can tell you, Mr Secretary-General, that we should prefer the due process of the International Criminal Court, any day, to the absence of due process in Guantanamo Bay.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Loud applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Our pledge to you today, Mr Secretary-General, is for Europe, in all of its manifestations, to be a reliable regional partner for the United Nations and what it stands for.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, today sees us gathered here, not just for its symbolic value, but also for a solemn purpose. On 19 August 2003, in Baghdad, terrorism reached a new low, when 22 of your colleagues paid the ultimate price in the service of peace and international humanity. Joining us today – and I would ask those who can to stand and be recognised – are the relatives of some of those who paid that price, and some of the survivors.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to welcome to our Chamber Mrs Annie de Mello, widow of Sergio Vieira de Mello, and her son Mr Laurent de Mello; Ms Rula Al-Farra, sister of Ms Reham Al-Farra; and Mr Luís Martín-Oar and his wife. As I remarked, we are also joined today by a number of those who survived that vicious assault: Ms Nada Al-Nashif, Mrs Mona Rishmawi and Professor Gil Loescher, you are also very welcome here today.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(The House rose and paid tribute to the relatives of the victims and to the survivors)</span></p>
<p class="contents">You honour us with your presence today. Permit me to say to all of you that we know we cannot compensate your loss, but I hope you now understand that we have felt it.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Secretary-General – and this is why we are solemnly gathered here today – I should like to say to you on behalf of this Parliament that for defending freedom and for promoting the values we have in common, it is my privilege to award to you, the United Nations, the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kofi Annan,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Secretary-General of the United Nations</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, thank you for that very kind introduction. Members of the European Parliament, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen and dear friends, I am deeply touched that you have honoured my friend and colleague, Sergio Vieira de Mello, and the many other UN staff who lost their lives in working for peace in the world. I am proud to accept the Sakharov prize in memory of them.</p>
<p class="contents">This prize for freedom of thought is not only a worthy recognition of the ultimate sacrifice that they made in the cause of peace. It is also a welcome acknowledgement of the kinds of people they were. The brave men and women we lost in Baghdad on 19 August – UN staff and others – were free spirits and free thinkers and also soldiers of humanity and of peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier, President Cox and I met some of the survivors of the attack and family members of those who were killed or injured. They are with us in the Chamber now. I thank them for joining us today and I accept this prize in their name too.</p>
<p class="contents">I also thank you, President Cox, and all of you, as Members of the European Parliament, for inviting these special people to share this occasion. It is a gesture that speaks volumes about the solidarity of the European Union with the United Nations. Like many who survived the blast, the United Nations itself carries deep wounds. But our determination is stronger than ever, and we value the solidarity of friends like you. You showed your commitment this morning, when you adopted a resolution to strengthen the EU’s political and financial support for the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">In its long history, Europe has seen more than its fair share of war, tyranny and terrible suffering. But Europeans have replaced that with a future of hope. You have pursued the path of peace through multilateralism. And today, the European Union is a shining light of tolerance, human rights, and international cooperation. After 1 May this year, that light will shine even brighter. When you enlarge to 25 Member States, you will cross a divide between east and west that once seemed unbridgeable. Enlargement is the greatest force for peace on the European continent.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The hope for further enlargement in years to come promises to build other bridges of cooperation and understanding – including between the West and Islam, and between peoples who have fought each other in bloody wars.</p>
<p class="contents">As time goes by, the continent is also experiencing an enlargement of what it means to be European. I look forward to the day when Europe rejoices as much in diversity within States as it does in diversity between them.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Many of your societies are already very diverse. But all of your societies – and many others around the world too – will become more diverse in the decades to come. This is the inevitable result of the movement of people across international borders. That movement is not going to stop. As an international community, we need to manage the movement of people across borders far better than we do ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">... not just for the sake of those who move, but for the sake of the countries they leave behind and those they travel through and those they migrate to. People migrate today for the same reasons that tens of millions of Europeans once left your shores – they flee war or oppression, or they leave in search of a better life in a new land. Those who are forced out of their homes – the refugees who flee in fear for their safety – are our collective legal and moral responsibility. We have an agreed legal framework for their protection – the 1951 Refugee Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">However, when refugees cannot seek asylum because of offshore barriers, or are detained for excessive periods in unsatisfactory conditions, or are refused entry because of restrictive interpretations of the Convention, the asylum system is broken and the promise of the Convention is broken too.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Your asylum system needs the resources to process claims fairly, quickly, and openly so that refugees are protected and solutions found for them. European States need to move towards a system of joint processing and sharing of responsibilities. Along with others, the EU must also help strengthen the capacity of poor countries to provide protection and solutions for refugees. After all, seven out of ten refugees seek refuge in developing countries, where resources are far more stretched and human rights standards more uneven. If we ignore this fact, there is a missing link in our approach to refugees – as Professor Gil Loescher, who survived the Baghdad blast and is with us here today, has rightly pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">Most immigrants are not refugees. We call them voluntary migrants – and some of them truly are. However, many leave their home countries not because they really want to, but because they see no future at home.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is our shared duty to do what we can to ensure that there are more opportunities in developing countries. If we truly forge a global partnership for development, in order to meet the Millennium Development Goals, we will do a lot to reduce the incentive for people to leave. Your asylum systems are overburdened precisely because many people who feel they must leave see no other channel through which to migrate. Many others try more desperate and clandestine measures, and are sometimes injured or even killed – suffocating in trucks, drowning at sea, or perishing in the undercarriage of aircraft. The lucky ones who <span class="italic">do</span> get in often find themselves at the mercy of unscrupulous employers, and alienated from society.</p>
<p class="contents">Some resort to people smugglers to assist their journey. Others fall victim to traffickers – especially women, who are forced into prostitution in a modern form of sex slavery, and become acutely vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. This silent human rights crisis shames our world. It also generates billions of dollars for shadowy networks of organised criminals, who subvert the rule of law in all societies where they operate.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the sovereign right of all states to decide which voluntary migrants they will accept, and on what terms. But we cannot simply close our doors, or shut our eyes to this human tragedy. The situation is all the more tragic given that many States which close their doors actually <span class="italic">need</span> immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the centre and left)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Here in Europe, your birth rates and death rates have dropped dramatically. Your populations are getting smaller and growing older. Without immigration, the population of the soon-to-be 25 Member States of the EU – 452 million in 2000 – would drop to under 400 million people by 2050. Some states – such as Italy, Austria, Germany and Greece – would see their populations drop by around a quarter. That would mean that one in three Italians, for example, would be over the age of 65 – nearly double the proportion today. Were this to happen, jobs would go unfilled and services undelivered. Your economies would shrink and your societies could stagnate. Many other countries – from Japan, to the Russian Federation, to South Korea – face the same problem. There is no simple solution to this problem. But immigration is inevitably an important part of the solution.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the centre and left)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore encourage European states to open up greater avenues for legal migration ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the centre and left)</span></p>
<p class="contents">... for skilled and unskilled workers, for family reunification and economic improvement, for temporary and permanent migrants.</p>
<p class="contents">Poor countries reap benefits from migration too – through remittances. The amounts which migrant workers send back to their countries of origin are growing fast. In 2002, in formal remittances alone, migrants from developing countries sent back at least USD 88 billion to their countries of origin – that is 54% more than the USD 57 billion those same countries received in overseas development assistance.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Do not get me wrong, I do not pretend that migration is without problems. Immigrants bring to their host communities different cultures and customs, different languages and religions. This is a source of enrichment, but it can be a source of discomfort – and even of division and alienation. The challenge of integration is real. Almost every large new immigrant group has been reviled to some degree in the early days of its establishment. The experience of some immigrants today is reminiscent of the hostility that the Huguenots once faced in England, as did the Germans, the Italians and the Irish in the United States, and the Chinese in Australia. But the longer perspective is almost always far more positive.</p>
<p class="contents">Integration is a two-way street. Immigrants must adjust to their new societies – and societies must adjust too. The word 'integrate' literally means 'to make whole'. That is the imperative for Europe today. Integration of the immigrants who have become permanent members of European society is essential for their productivity and human dignity.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is also essential for the functioning of healthy, humane democracies. They cannot extract the labour of immigrants and ignore other aspects of their humanity. The great Swiss writer Max Frisch said of the European 'guest worker programmes' of the 1960s: 'We wanted workers, but we got people'. Acknowledging and responding to that reality is one of your central challenges – a reality that is reflected in the United Nations Migrant Workers Convention, which I urge European states, and indeed all states, to sign and ratify.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Migration can also cause challenges for the countries migrants leave behind. Yes, they may gain remittances. However, if they lose contact with their diasporas, they can lose some of their best and brightest talent. This opens up new vistas for international cooperation. After all, just as developing countries often want to attract emigrants back home, developed countries often have an interest in immigrants returning home after a period of time. International cooperation on this and other issues is key to managing migration better. In the effort to build better international cooperation, you in the European Union should be where you belong – in the lead. You have already given more thought than most regions to this issue – and the Tampere framework is a basis on which to forge a common European policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Combating illegal immigration should be part of a much broader agenda – an agenda to harness the benefits of immigration, rather than vainly trying to stop it. But sometimes, the breadth of the agenda has been lost amidst shrill debates about clamping down on illegal immigration – as though that were the major purpose of migration policy.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the centre and left)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The public has been fed images of a flood of unwelcome entrants, and of threats to their societies and identities. In the process, immigrants have sometimes been stigmatised, vilified, even de-humanised. In the process, an essential truth has also been lost. The vast majority of immigrants are industrious, courageous and determined. They do not want a free ride. They want a fair opportunity. They are not criminals or terrorists. They are law-abiding. They do not want to live apart. They want to integrate, while retaining their identity.</p>
<p class="contents">Only through cooperation – bilateral, regional and global – can we build the partnerships between receiver and sender countries that are in the interests of both; explore innovations to make migration a driver for development; fight smugglers and traffickers effectively and agree on common standards for the treatment of immigrants and the management of migration. That is why I am particularly glad that, last month, the Global Commission on International Migration was established. The Commission is itself a welcome instance of North-South cooperation, co-chaired by distinguished public figures from Sweden and South Africa. I thank all states who are supporting this vital work and I hope it will help promote greater public understanding. Above all, I hope it will win broad acceptance for a better normative and institutional framework for managing migration at the global level – a framework that has human rights at its centre.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">But the most essential ingredient of all is leadership. You, as Members of the European Parliament, have a vital role to play in providing that leadership. The message is clear. Migrants need Europe, but Europe also needs migrants.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">A closed Europe would be a meaner, poorer, weaker, older Europe. An open Europe will be a fairer, richer, stronger, younger Europe – provided you manage migration well.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We must not minimise the difficulties that migration can bring. But let us also rejoice in the enormous contribution that migrants have made in science, academia, sports, the arts, and government – including some of you as Members of this Parliament. And let us remember that, without migrants, many health systems would be short-staffed; many parents would not have the home help they need to pursue careers; many jobs that provide services and generate revenue would go unfilled and many societies would age and shrink. Migrants are part of the solution, not part of the problem.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">They should not be made the scapegoats for a vast array of social ills.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s anthem, Beethoven’s 'Ode to Joy', speaks of the day when all humans will become brothers. If Sergio Vieira de Mello were with us today – and, indeed, if Andrei Sakharov were too – they would say to you what I say to you: the people who move across borders today, in search of a better life for themselves and their families, are our brothers and our sisters too. Let us treat them that way.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In that spirit, in all our common endeavours, let the European Union and the United Nations be beacons of hope for a better future for all mankind.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cowen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, it is a signal honour to take part in this sitting of the European Parliament for the award of the 2003 Sakharov prize to Secretary-General Annan and the entire United Nations staff, and to commemorate in particular Mr Sergio Vieira de Mello and the many other UN officials who lost their lives in the performance of their duties.</p>
<p class="contents">I can think of no more appropriate designation of a prize for freedom of thought than the name of Andrei Sakharov. And I can think of no more fitting recipient of this prize than Secretary-General Kofi Annan and his colleagues.</p>
<p class="contents">The enduring value of the Sakharov prize is that it evokes continually the memory and example of an outstanding human rights advocate who lived and worked in circumstances where such advocacy was considered an act of dissidence. This prize in his name sends out every year a clear signal of support from Europe to those who are struggling for peace and human rights, often in the face of significant hostility and in conditions of personal risk. I believe therefore that the Parliament has made a wise and kind choice in reflecting on and commemorating the enormous sacrifices made by UN personnel in the cause of peace and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">On 19 August 2003 we were all horrified at the appalling attack on the lives of UN personnel in their headquarters in Baghdad. Those who carried out this attack struck a violent and cowardly blow at the people best placed and most committed to bringing relief to the Iraqi people. The loss of Sergio Vieira de Mello was a cause of particular sadness. In my own country, as in many others, the outstanding work done by Mr Vieira de Mello on behalf of the UN, especially in Timor Leste, was widely known and enormously regarded. I know that he would have made an enormous contribution as High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">UN personnel throughout the world perform heroic and often unheralded work. It is in many ways a pity that the prevailing image of the UN derives so much from the moments of vertiginous political drama in and around the chamber of the Security Council. This image misses the depth of the commitment of many unknown UN officials throughout the world, acting as peacekeepers, providing assistance to refugees, developing human rights capacity, coordinating emergency humanitarian assistance and protecting the rights of women and the marginalised. The Millennium Summit Declaration referred to the United Nations as ‘the common house of the entire human family’. UN staff, in their daily working lives, demonstrate the truth of this description.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We are indebted to Secretary-General Annan on many levels and for many things. This morning, of course, I would draw attention to the courage and the clarity with which he has addressed the challenges facing the multilateral system and role that migration policy can play in it. At the General Assembly last September the Secretary-General characterised the position to which the UN had come as ‘a fork in the road’. And as recently as last weekend at the World Economic Forum the Secretary-General noted that the conduct of international politics had become less favourable to the maintenance of a stable, equitable and rule-based international order and that the role of the UN itself and the system of collective security were under serious strain.</p>
<p class="contents">It is because of the urgency of this threat that the Council has recommitted itself to effective multilateralism. A stronger, international society, a rules-based international order and strong international institutions are critically important EU objectives. Central to this is the EU support for a strengthened UN. Intensified and effective cooperation between the EU and the UN is a central priority for this presidency. It is imperative that the UN be given the means to meet successfully the many and varied challenges of today.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Secretary-General said in his report last year on the implementation of the Millennium Declaration, human rights are universal principles, but inspiring as those principles are, they do not implement themselves. The multilateral system embodied in the UN Charter is the only way that human rights and humanitarian law can be effectively defended.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It provides the only real means of addressing the varied threats of today: terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, poverty, hunger and disease; together with new, or rather growing, challenges such as migration – to which the Secretary-General has made particular reference today. It is only through being multilateralist that effective action can be taken to meet the Millennium Development Goals, for example, so that the glaring inequalities and unremitting human suffering which in turn create and foster so many threats to peace and security can be meaningfully addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is entirely in character that the Secretary-General did not use this occasion to indulge the plaudits that inevitably and rightly come with prestigious prizes such as this. Instead he has chosen to direct our attention to the challenges of a major pressing issue, that of migration. This is an issue with which my own country has endured historical experience accumulated through generations who migrated from Ireland and made lives for themselves abroad.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now an issue of major global significance which needs to be put higher up the international agenda. Globalisation has given rise to an unprecedented movement of people, in turn giving rise to unparalleled challenges. Like the Secretary-General I welcome the establishment last month of the Global Commission on International Migration. UN High Commissioner for Refugees Lubbers attended the informal meeting of EU Justice and Home Affairs Ministers in Dublin on Thursday last, at which there was a constructive discussion of proposed European asylum and migration legislation. This was very useful and we look forward to building on this valuable dialogue with such an important partner, the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">In October 1999 the European Council in Tampere agreed on the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice in the EU, firmly rooted in our shared commitment to human rights, democratic institutions and the rule of law. This freedom is not the exclusive preserve of the Union’s own citizens. It must also be available to those whose circumstances lead them justifiably to seek access to our territory. In its proposals and actions on immigration and asylum, the Union is committed to taking account of both the humanitarian and economic aspects and to ensuring full respect for the human rights-based principles enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights and other international norms. We must confront this challenge with effective action based on our ambition in 1999 to complete this agenda by the middle of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">For the European Union, the United Nations is more than a political affiliation. As the Nobel Committee stated in awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to Kofi Annan and the United Nations staff in 2001, it granted the prize ‘to proclaim that the only negotiable route to global peace and cooperation goes by way of the United Nations’.</p>
<p class="contents">We are deeply grateful therefore to the Secretary-General for his ceaseless work in defending the multilateral system. We wish to record our deep appreciation of the UN staff all over the world serving the cause of peace and justice, human rights and development. And we remember those among the UN staff who have given their lives in this cause. Therefore, Mr. President, let me join you in commending the award of the Sakharov Prize to the United Nations Secretary-General and his staff.</p>

It is a particular pleasure because it is extremely difficult to recall another occasion on which the aims of an award and its recipient have cohered so perfectly.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Checking the statute of the prize, I found that it can be awarded for particular achievement in any of four fields: defence of human rights and fundamental freedoms, safeguarding the rights of minorities, respect for international law, and the development of democracy and the implementation of the rule of law. By my reckoning, that means we should today be awarding the prize four times over.</p>
<p class="contents">It is being given, of course, in memory of Sergio Vieira de Mello, and his life exemplified those values. Its barbaric curtailment leaves the world a good deal poorer. Sergio Vieira de Mello was an extraordinary man. I was privileged to see his work at first hand, in Hong Kong, in Kosovo and in East Timor. He was gallant, he was wise, he was dashing, he was principled and he was immensely effective. We are very fortunate that the UN is blessed with other, equally talented individuals, and is led by one as well.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Kofi Annan has made an immense contribution to furthering the effectiveness of the UN – and its constituent parts – where it matters: on the ground, across the globe. Under his authority, both in overseeing its peacekeeping operations, and subsequently as Secretary-General, the UN has brought protection, comfort and hope to millions. The Secretary-General has done this in the face of unprecedented challenges to the authority and even the fundamental rationale of the organisation. He has consistently risen to and overcome those challenges, unflinching and with his dignity wholly intact.</p>
<p class="contents">Right from the start, with the renewal of the United Nations plan for reform, through the review of peacekeeping operations, the Millennium Report, the call to action on HIV/AIDS and the establishment of the current Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, the Secretary-General has ensured that our collective focus is in the right place at the right time. He does so once again today with his words on our obligation to develop a viable humane approach to asylum and immigration. I make this point as one, like many in this House, who is a descendant of migrants – in my case, of those who fled from the famine and hunger in Ireland in the 19th century to which the Minister referred.</p>
<p class="contents">The Secretary-General has reinvigorated the staple work of the UN institutions, the work that is done by those all-too-frequently unsung heroes: promoting economic development, feeding the hungry and educating the world. And he has ensured that this work responds flexibly to challenges never imagined by the founders of the UN: political challenges, military challenges, even medical challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think that it is an exaggeration to say that the Secretary-General’s personality and wisdom exemplify all our warmest and highest aspirations for the institution that he leads, the institution which he has served with such distinction for so many years. Like all Members here today, I salute the UN and I salute the Secretary-General with admiration and humility. I also commend his speech and the sentiments which underpinned it to the elected members of this Parliament and to those who elect them.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I hope that in the months ahead these are arguments that we hear put with compassion and commitment to those who will, I trust, be doing their democratic duty.</p>

When, in the Conference of Presidents and in this House, we voted that you should receive the Sakharov Prize for 2003, we did so gladly and not merely as a matter of political judgment. Now, as we offer you our heartfelt gratitude, we remember Sérgio Vieira de Mello and the many who were killed by a murderous terrorist act in Baghdad, we remember the many who have laid down their lives in the service of the United Nations, and, to those members of their families who are here today, we extend our sympathy and express our solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who work for the United Nations dedicate themselves to human rights and democracy, and so it is only right that the Sakharov Prize should be awarded to the United Nations. Today, we remember Andrei Sakharov, whose great intellectual and moral strength can be felt to this day by those who visit his simple grave in the Novodevichy cemetery outside Moscow, and our desire is that the Russian people may follow his example; that, in Russia and around the world, people may bring to life the ideals of Andrei Sakharov, that great physicist, philosopher and campaigner for human rights. Today, our thoughts are also with his widow, Yelena Bonner, who shared decades of exile with him and to whom our group awarded the Schuman Medal, and today we greet her in her simple and modest home in Moscow’s Ulitsa Skalova.</p>
<p class="contents">We would have been glad of the presence of the Sakharov Prize laureates Leyla Zana und Oswaldo José Paya Sardiñas, who, along with others, are unable to be with us today.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Andrei Sakharov once said that the most important voice is the one that cannot be heard, and my hope for the people of Cuba is that they may be enabled to speak clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">Although, Mr Secretary-General, there is much that could be said about immigration, which involves integration, we share the same values of human dignity, democracy and the rule of law, so, all things considered, we are taking the same road, and I hope that you will, as Secretary-General, see the day when the European Union, with a seat of its own, can defend these values in the Security Council and in the United Nations.</p>

My group had the honour of nominating the Secretary-General for the Sakharov Prize, and I would like to thank the other political groups for having ensured an overwhelming majority in Parliament in order to express a common will to acknowledge the difficult and heroic work of the United Nations and to encourage it to persevere in the noble cause of world peace and stability.</p>
<p class="contents">My group does not just wish to pay tribute to Sergio Vieira de Mello and the other victims of an heroic struggle, but also to acknowledge the efforts of many United Nations officials and chiefs who are continuing their work, and I would like to mention two symbolic names, those of Mr Blix and Mr El Baradei, who have done important work in favour of peace and the reduction of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last two years we have not just seen terrorist attacks which have led to the deaths of many innocent people, but also an unprecedented assault on the international institutions, in particular the UN.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Secretary-General, I would like to reaffirm the importance of solidarity and close cooperation between peoples and nations. In this regard, you have given us a lesson today on the importance of migrations, and I would say, on behalf of my group, that we thank you for this brave and committed speech because we are living in a world in which globalisation applies to capital, to services and to products; but ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">... is not applied to people.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking from your speech the elements which need to be carried out in the European Union, I would also like to offer you our cooperation in the work you have begun on the reform of the United Nations, with a view to ensuring that the UN, together with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the World Trade Organisation and the International Labour Organisation, can work together. I believe this is a common cause which both the European Union and the United Nations must work on.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, Mr President, I would also like to say that we are clearly committed to multilateralism as opposed to unilateralism, to preventive action rather than pre-emptive attacks, and that it must not be said that the United Nations is incapable: Namibia, South Africa, Mozambique, El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, Cambodia, Guatemala, Kosovo, Timor, Sierra Leone, Liberia and the Congo demonstrate that the United Nations is necessary and important and is a legitimate and noble cause and that we must support its efforts.</p>

We recognise the value that immigrants bring to Europe and we understand that closing Europe's front door will only drive the desperate to seek access through the back. Many of us were migrants once upon a time and we know how ill it behoves our generation to shut the gates of mercy on mankind. A Europe of security and justice for all is a Europe that extends those rights to those who justly seek a new life here. Like you, we recognise the political challenge that implies.</p>
<p class="contents">Your words today remind us of the power of the United Nations to transcend the parochial in us all. The United Nations has a precious power to speak for us all. That is why my Group wishes to see the return of the United Nations to Iraq as soon as the security situation allows. Credible and legitimate democratic government in Iraq is not possible without the presence of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We want a political settlement in Iraq that guarantees the highest standards of civil and political rights for all Iraqis.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations was founded by the same generation who founded this European Union – ‘to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind’. Like this Union it believes that the closer we sit at the table of peace and prosperity, the slower we will be to reach for the tools of war. It is a sorry testament to a stubborn world that the UN still seems such an unlikely experiment in international governance.</p>
<p class="contents">Winston Churchill once said that the UN is designed not to take us to heaven, but to save us from hell. In order to do that better the UN must reform. As its largest contributors, the EU and its Member States have not only the weight to insist on reform but the responsibility to do so. A mature Europe would find the political will to put behind it an institutional settlement at the UN that leaves power where it lay in 1945. A mature Europe would insist on a permanent membership that reflected the realities of the 21st century. It would accept that the current veto is a tool of obstruction, a privilege that can no longer be justified.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Secretary-General, on behalf of the Liberal Group allow me to pay tribute to the members of your organisation who will not see you take this prize in their name today. Your staff who lost their lives with Sergio Vieira de Mello – including Fiona Watson who was known to me – died defending a vision of national renewal in Iraq that is now our duty.</p>

We are honoured to have you with us in this House – your presence here is highly symbolic – and in our turn we too welcome, with respect and sympathy, the family and friends of Mr Vieira de Mello and the other victims of the dreadful terrorist attack in Baghdad.</p>
<p class="contents">One year ago, Secretary-General, almost to the day, the European Parliament adopted a resolution in support of the mission of the United Nations inspectors in Iraq. Many of us still wanted to believe that it was possible to avoid the war, which we sensed would cause great devastation. In the period that followed, it became apparent that what was happening in the United Nations reflected world public opinion as never before. The public took to the streets in their millions to demonstrate, while in the Security Council the majority of the Member States resisted and did battle. On all sides the goal was the same: to try to prevent a bloody, destabilising and irresponsible conflict. Rarely has the UN been able to be as faithful as it was in those days to the first words of the Charter, ‘We the Peoples of the United Nations’.</p>
<p class="contents">We did not succeed, but the lesson was learnt. A particular idea of how the world should be organised was, admittedly, seriously flouted by a coalition of States, but since then it has, however, been spectacularly validated by the collective experience, to the point that the former gung-ho warriors are now appealing to the UN. This idea is firstly that war is certainly no way to resolve the world’s problems. Secondly, it is that no nation, even a hyper-power, can ignore the global challenges facing the international community. Finally, it is that there is more to building a world of peace than taking action against terrorist networks.</p>
<p class="contents">If, to our dismay, the tragic deadlock in the Middle East should persist – 13 Palestinians were killed yesterday in Gaza by the occupying army and 10 Israelis have just lost their lives this morning in a suicide bombing in Jerusalem; this is the kind of thing that must stop at all costs – should the Iraqi occupation, the war in Chechnya and the dreadful conflicts in Africa continue; should the peace plans such as the one for Western Sahara remain unimplemented; should there continue to be humiliation and despair nourished by social and cultural divides and should violations of human rights continue to mar the world, it is probable that, in the future, the world will not be safe and no one will enjoy a peaceful life. It is in all our interests to be aware of this and we all have a responsibility to create a new order.

And listening to you, I had a dream too, a dream that your words on immigration were echoed by all of the Members of this House and did not remain yours alone.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I had a dream that all of the Heads of Government who say that they admire you, admired what you have just said and your lucid words on immigration. I had a dream that finally the peoples listening to you admired your speech and your lucid and humanist views on immigration. Because, ladies and gentlemen, there is no point in giving Mr Kofi Annan a standing ovation if, in our day-to-day work, in our resolutions, in our laws and in our countries, we do exactly the opposite of what he is asking us.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Loud applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">And that is why, with admiration and joy – even if I admit that our group was sceptical about your being awarded this Sakharov Prize, because we wanted it to go to a man or woman from Iran or Chechnya who is fighting for their freedom – and, because you have demonstrated such clear-mindedness here, I am asking you, as a Sakharov Prize laureate, to ensure that the Turkish Government frees Leila Zana, to ensure that the Cuban Government lets this Sakharov Prize winner go and, above all, you are asked to ensure that the UN takes an initiative to enable the Jewish people, who had to emigrate from Europe because they were threatened with annihilation, to live in peace and to enable the Palestinian people, who have the right to a State, to live in peace. It is this idea, this strength and your lucidity that inspire me to salute you as the laureate of the Sakharov Prize.</p>

We also wanted to thank you for the work that you do at the head of this organisation and for helping to restore and reinforce its prestige. For all of this, we thank you.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, in choosing you we also chose your colleagues, all of those who paid with their lives to fulfil their chosen role in the service of the most just and noble of causes. To the families of those who are no longer with us, we wish to convey our solidarity and pay our respects, and our thoughts and good wishes also go to all of those who were injured and continue to endure physical suffering.</p>
<p class="contents">You have just spoken about the problems of immigration, Secretary-General. You were right to do so. Of course, this is the utopia that will help the world to move forward and we are all aware of this. If you believe, however, that the problems associated with immigration will be resolved solely by ensuring that the developed countries open their borders, you are mistaken. Obviously this is necessary, but it is not the answer to the problem.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I should have liked, Secretary-General – but probably this was implicit in your comments – to hear you condemn the economic consequences of globalisation and the imbalance that this creates between developed and developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also have liked, Secretary-General, to hear you express the wish that developed countries would increase their aid, because the only way – or at least the main and most pressing way – to resolve the problem is firstly to give all of those who are suffering in developing countries the means to live a normal life. And that is why I regret the fact that the developed countries are all so reticent and overcautious in this regard. At one time, General De Gaulle said that if all of us had devoted 1% of GDP to this problem it would have been to a large extent resolved. Well, it is not too late to do so. And as well as applauding you, as you so richly deserve, perhaps all of those who are here, and in particular those who hold office through their parties in the governments of Western Europe, might be inspired to act on these resolutions.</p>

We are destroying the planet’s biodiversity at the same rate at which the dinosaurs were wiped out. There are more than 110 million active mines, distributed among 70 countries. In ten years, two million children have been killed in wars or by landmines. Every day, 8 000 young people are infected with HIV. More than four million young people have died of AIDS. Thirteen million have lost their mothers or both parents, but 95% of them live in Africa, so it is not, of course, really our problem. Or is it?</p>
<p class="contents">When I was young, I dreamed of working for the UN and of being able to play my part in uniting the nations of the world in peace and cooperation. I am therefore very happy that, in the Conference of Presidents, I was able to register my group’s unanimous support for the UN, because never before have there been so many innocent and poverty-stricken children who need a helping-hand from ourselves in our cosy little corner of the rich part of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">We who sit in Parliament may disagree about a lot, but we can all agree in paying tribute to you as Secretary-General of our common, worldwide organisation, the UN. No one can suspect the UN’s blue berets of having any remit other than peace. I therefore hope that the UN can be given a common and permanent military force to deploy once all peaceful means have been exhausted.</p>
<p class="contents">You must not only be secretary of a Security Council whose members are in disagreement. You must also be general of a reformed and dynamic UN. In war, you must be commander-in-chief of all the generals, for, without UN permission, it should again be prohibited to go to war.</p>
<p class="contents">It perhaps sounds naive, but it is still my dream that there will one day be so many naive people in the world that we shall not permit the destruction of our planet and the killing of innocent children through landmines, famine or HIV. We would do well to transfer a couple of hundred euros in aid from each EU cow to those whose need is greater, namely citizens who today have to place their children in something that is not a bed, following something that is not a meal and perhaps with an illness that makes life before death all too short.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you, Mr Kofi Annan, for doing more than ourselves to engage with the most important matters in the world, and thank you for your moving speech.</p>

<p class="contents">Secretary-General, we welcome your call for a Europe that is more open to immigration by men and women who have fled their countries in a bid to escape poverty and very often dictatorship. In welcoming them, we need to tackle the root causes that drive them to leave their countries. With this in mind, we very much appreciated your spelling out an idea several months ago that is both simple and revolutionary. ‘Democracy and human rights, though distinct concepts, are closely interlinked. Democracy, as a human right in itself, is implied in Article 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but it only functions in its fullest sense when other human rights are respected.’ We wholeheartedly agree with you, Secretary-General: democracy is a universal value to which every human being has a right and this is the challenge that we need to take up in the Middle East, in Africa and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">Secretary-General, in this connection, before concluding, allow me to mention the issue of the appointment of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. As you know, on the initiative of the Italian Presidency a European candidate has been put forward, a Member of this Parliament. This candidate has the support of the President of the European Commission and of key figures from all of the Union’s institutions as well as from other countries and regional groups. The fact that we have put forward a candidate signals Europe’s commitment to promoting and strengthening human rights, the rule of law and democracy wherever they are violated. Secretary-General, I would venture to hope that you will select this candidate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also regret the fact that domestic political circumstances prevent the laureates from Cuba, Burma and Turkey from being with us today.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have to do, I believe, is to advance democracy and freedom throughout the world, for human rights on the one hand, and peace on the other, are dependent on them. Democracy and freedom are the pillars without which no improvement is sustainable. In the brief conversation that the Bureau of the Foreign Affairs Committee was able to have with you earlier, it became even clearer to us that the European Parliament and the European Union really can work together on joint projects, and that we can cooperate very closely where policy matters and budgetary resources are concerned, as well as in many other areas – be it on issues connected with the supply of water, with education in the developing world, infrastructure measures or the fight against epidemics. I believe that, if we succeed in this way in raising standards in the world’s less-favoured areas, we will also be creating the right conditions for peace, freedom and human rights, and it is for that reason that we need to cooperate in this area. The same is the case with political objectives and problem-solving, whether this be in the Middle East or in Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">While I have to say that I listened to what you had to say about migration with a great deal of admiration, I would also like to point out at the same time that migration is an admission of failure, for we should deal with problems where people actually live; that is where we have to start.</p>
