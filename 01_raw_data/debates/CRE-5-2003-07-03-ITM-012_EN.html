In the northern mountainous region, many of the 300 000 ‘forgotten people of Laos’ are still bearing the brunt of the Communist regime’s vengeance. Their political choice during the Vietnam War was considered ‘treason’ and is still an anathema justifying the present reign of terror.</p>
<p class="contents">The show trial and the absurd sentencing in Phonsavan of a French and a Belgian journalist and an American Hmong pastor is no isolated incident. Cut off from the outside world, Vientiane is trying to break this people. It appears that interest in, and recognition of, the conflict with the Hmong is unwelcome.</p>
<p class="contents">As such, Laos features on the obscure list of countries that commit serious breaches in respect of freedom of religion. The Christian minority, in particular, is harshly persecuted, and their religion is even prohibited. This violation of individual freedom and personal dignity cannot be justified in the name of any culture or country.</p>
<p class="contents">With the present resolution, I would therefore call on the Laotian authorities to end their repression against Hmong and other, particularly Christian, minorities with immediate effect. Failure to respond to this request should prompt the Council and the Commission to reconsider every aspect of relations with Laos. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Once again, these rights have been flouted and today we are forced to condemn the situation in Laos. Since 5 June, two journalists, one French and the other Belgian, have been imprisoned, together with their guides, in Vientiane in Laos. They were arrested in the Xieng Khuang province whilst reporting on the situation of the Hmong minority. After a trial that bordered on the farcical, on 30 June, Thierry Falise and Vincent Reynaud were sentenced to 15 years in prison for ‘obstructing an official in the performance of his duties’, as the case against them described it. This fallacious charge on the one hand and the sentence handed down, on the other, contravene the provisions of the Laotian criminal code.</p>
<p class="contents">Thierry Falise and Vincent Reynaud were in fact convicted simply for carrying out their work as journalists and cameramen, filming a group of mountain people who have been hounded for years by an authoritarian regime that flouts every principle of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution that we propose Parliament should adopt and which we urge its President to convey to the Laotian authorities and to all member countries of ASEAN calls first for the immediate release of the two journalists and their guides; secondly, for international conventions to be applied, including the convention adopted by French-speaking countries in the Bamako declaration, which Laos has ratified, in order to protect the rights of journalists, particularly those reporting in conflict zones. Thirdly, the resolution calls for the immediate suspension of all policies of persecution and repression towards the Hmong people and other minorities in Laos; and fourthly, for all economic cooperation between the EU and Laos to be reviewed, as soon as possible and with the European Parliament being kept informed, as provided for in the agreements to which our resolution refers.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, Mr President, and I wish to state, on behalf of my entire group, that we cannot continue to assist and maintain relations with countries which, in full view of the whole world, breach human rights. It is one of our responsibilities as the European Parliament to condemn things that are totally unacceptable and to say so relentlessly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If one looks at what has happened since, there have been restrictions on access to people in prison, their place of detention has been kept secret for more than a week now. Clearly the trials did not respect their rights under international law. They did not get a fair trial.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Laos is quite alarming. Not only are these people suffering, but so is the rest of the country. People's rights are not being respected: their civil, political and religious rights are not being respected. There are no rights, for example, for people in prison. Many of these people are unjustifiably in prison. They do not have visitation rights.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning we met with a delegation from Laos. The evidence that they gave us raised serious concerns. Some speakers have said that we need to reconsider our relationship with Laos if the authorities do not take notice of the situation in their own country. It is clear that there should be an immediate release of these journalists. There should be freedom of the press. They need to end the persecution of the Hmong and other minorities. It must stop.</p>
<p class="contents">The court case was also criticised by Washington. They called it a farce. They called for a fair trial. We need to be very careful here in respect of who is pointing the finger at whom, considering that Washington is responsible for the Guantanamo Bay issue. Those people have not had a fair trial, nor have they had legitimate charges posed against them. I doubt that this would happen in the European Union. The Americans need to look at what they are doing before they point a finger at anyone else. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Laos is an ancient kingdom and very rich in culture; it was, as a country, peaceful and tolerant, which, in the days when it was a kingdom, was a threat to nobody. I am glad that the Laotian royal family are present with us today.</p>
<p class="contents">In the course of the twentieth century, the country became a victim – firstly of colonialism, then of the Second World War and, last but not least, of the conflict between East and West. It was brutally wrecked by Communist occupation. It must be clear to us that, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, our task is to ensure that Laos becomes a flourishing democratic country rather than ending up as a museum of real-life socialism. We therefore declare that human rights and the rule of law need to be reinforced, that freedom of faith and conscience need to be respected, and that political prisoners must be set free. As a matter of priority, Laos must become freely accessible to the media, so that the world can learn what is actually going on there, and so that the country’s continuing deficiencies are not hidden from it.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European Union seek cooperation with Laos. We will abide by the trade and cooperation agreement if the human rights to which it refers are respected, but if this human rights clause is disregarded and treated as nothing but a joke, then we will have to put a question mark against our cooperation – with the regime rather than with the Laotian people – and make it perfectly clear that, while trade, business and cooperation are necessary, they are founded upon law, underpinned by human rights and by the values on which our global community depends. It is for that reason that we make it our concern that Laos should once more be free, democratic and under the rule of law.</p>

I have here the <span class="italic">communiqué</span>, dated 1.30.p.m: ‘the Laotian Minister for Foreign Affaires awaits a request from the governments of the countries from which the three men come: Belgium, France and the United States, for their pardon’ – which will of course be granted if this has not already been done. We can only welcome the effective role played by our Ministers for Foreign Affairs and by the diplomats in the area, a role which, without a shadow of a doubt, has led to the prisoners’ imminent release.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we rejoice in the outcome of these actions, we remain extremely concerned at the fate of the four Laotians who were accompanying Thierry Falise and Vincent Reynaud and who, we are told, could face a sentence of twenty years in prison. We also appeal to the clemency of the Laotian Government. Too many journalists have paid with their lives or have been given stiff prison sentences for having done their job, which is to inform people.</p>
<p class="contents">We recall that freedom of expression is a fundamental right. We expect the Commission and the Council to support the actions of our diplomats and we hope that our European office in the region will intervene to ensure that the four Laotian citizens are also released. We wish to state, Mr President, before this House, all our solidarity with the journalists and with their families, who have been through such a hard time and assure them that the European Parliament, the guardian of freedom, will relentlessly defend the right to a free press, the right to free information and, more than ever, human rights, whatever regime is in power. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Their names and locations have not been published. At the same time, we know that, on Monday 30 June of this year, they were sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment, without their right to a defence being respected, for having, it was said, impeded an officer in the performance of his duties.</p>
<p class="contents">When we, here in the European Parliament, draw attention to the lack of democratic rights in Laos, we urge the authorities in that country to ensure compliance with the country’s constitution that purports to guarantee religious freedom and freedom for religious groups. We call upon the authorities in Laos immediately to put a stop to all policies involving the persecution and oppression of the Hmong people, other minorities in Laos and Christian population groups. We also call upon the authorities in Laos to give the Red Cross permission to visit the political prisoners in order to assure themselves of their physical well-being.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe that the Commission should investigate whether it is appropriate to continue with the ongoing cooperation with the authorities in Laos and that it should report to Parliament on this issue. We request of the European Parliament that, if the imprisoned journalists have not been freed before then, the problem be added to the agenda of the next meeting of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me also to protest against the fact that the Laotian constitution has, in practice, wordings that impede religious freedom in the country by banning all acts that give rise to religious division or lead to a general division among the people. Under these laws, 60 Christians were arrested in 2002, and an active campaign to close churches was conducted between 1999 and 2001. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To give you some indication, Italy comes 40th, after Benin and South Korea. In Laos, the media remains entirely in the hands of the only political party and its parliament is taking its time over adopting a law that will allow private media ownership, which was promised in 2001. There is still no news of the five leaders of the October 1999 movement who have disappeared, including Thongpaseuth Kenakoun, the author of several articles and pamphlets on the situation in Laos and the need for democratic reform.</p>
<p class="contents">The case of Thierry Falise and Vincent Reynaud is not, therefore, a judicial accident. It has arisen in a climate of ongoing breaches of human rights and the scandalous verdict that sentenced them to fifteen years in prison on 1 July raises at least two questions. The first is that of the freedom of the press in general, which as we have seen is often flouted, even in Europe. This freedom is one of the pillars of democracy and we must defend it at all costs. The second issue concerns the democratic clause of the cooperation agreements, which could often be described as a clause in form only: a hollow shell.</p>
<p class="contents">Can we expect Europe to be taken seriously, however, when, having signed an agreement, it does not ensure that this clause is respected, by means of appropriate sanctions? We know, as Mrs André-Léonard has confirmed, that the joint pressure exerted by Belgium, France, the United States and the European Union will probably lead to the release of Falise, Reynaud and Naw Karl Mua, which will be a relief for everyone. I call on Parliament, however, also to call for the release of Thao Moua, Tha Char Yang, the two guides, Pa Phue Khang, their driver, and a fourth, unknown Laotian, because they are neither reporters nor foreigners. They are simply Laotians. The sentences they received range from 12 to 20 years in prison and we cannot, Mr President, wash our hands of them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also wish to acknowledge their struggle, because it is as a result of that struggle that we in this Parliament are able to work; as a result of their tireless fight for democracy, for the rule of law, for freedom and also for national reconciliation in their country.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that everything has been said in this debate and Mrs de Keyser was right to insist on this point: Mrs André-Léonard’s news about the likely release of the Belgian, French and American journalists does not mean that the four Laotians who were accompanying them will be released; they will end up spending 10, 15 or 20 years in the gaols of Vientiane.</p>
<p class="contents">This business involving the journalists is the umpteenth such occurrence, the umpteenth proof that the situation in Laos is extremely serious, that this regime is totally corrupt, that this regime should be investigated by Interpol and all the international financial bodies, due to the scale of its trafficking, and that the European Union should change its policy vis-à-vis Laos. Every complacent policy simply strengthens the extremist elements in the Laotian regime. We must, by adopting a firm policy, do what we can to encourage those within the regime who wish to work towards a policy of democratisation, towards a policy of reconciliation. This is crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">We have instruments in place; we give Laos EUR 160 million per year under trade agreements in the textile sector alone. We have dozens of cooperation projects running. We must undertake a very thorough assessment and tell the Laotian regime that, unless they undertake specific and practical reforms in the fields of justice, information, economics and politics, we will end all forms of cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to the issue of the European journalists arrested, Mr Falise and Mr Reynaud, this issue is being dealt with at bilateral level by France and Belgium.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union's ministerial troika, however, has had the opportunity to talk bilaterally through the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Laos, on the occasion of the recent Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum in Phnom Penh on 19 June. The Commission is in close contact with the French Embassy and with the Belgian Consulate in Vientiane, and with other Member States with local representation or accredited in Bangkok, and the Commission has held an informal meeting with top officials of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Laos.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the Commission supports the diplomatic actions taken by the Member States in question to find a satisfactory solution to this case, a solution which – we agree with Mrs André-Léonard – can only be found by means of a diplomatic and political solution. Furthermore, we are prepared to take any necessary action to put pressure on the government of Laos at European Union level.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not, however, consider it useful to include an issue of this type on an agenda of a different nature, such as the meetings of ASEAN, since we do not believe it to be appropriate to raise this issue in high-level multilateral meetings. We hope that the news given earlier by Mrs André-Léonard will eventually lead to a good result.</p>
<p class="contents">A final comment on the general human rights situation in Laos and our position. The Commission is closely monitoring the situation by means of our delegation in Vientiane and we are going to continue to analyse the human rights situation and its possible impact on the EC-Laos cooperation programme in view of the joint EC-Laos committee scheduled for next autumn. In this regard, the Commission is always prepared to discuss this issue with the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
