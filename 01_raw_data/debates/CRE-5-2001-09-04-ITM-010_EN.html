<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Thank you for inviting me to report to this House on the climate change conference in July.</p>
<p class="contents">The conference was a success, particularly for the European Union. On 23 July it reached a consensus political agreement on modalities to implement the Kyoto Protocol. It thereby resolved all the main outstanding political issues which were left open after the first part of the conference in The Hague last November. This paves the way for the ratification of the protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to give you a brief assessment of the Bonn Conference before I turn to the main decisions on substance.</p>
<p class="contents">The outcome of Bonn represents a major achievement for the European Union. Following the United States' withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol, the European Union has taken the lead in defending the protocol. This included a declaration by the European Councils in Stockholm and Gothenburg and resolutions from the European Parliament. High-level missions by the Swedish and Belgian presidencies and the Commission visited the United States, Canada, Russia, Iran, China, Australia and Japan to seek support for our position.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU's commitment to bring the Kyoto Protocol into force before the World Summit on Sustainable Development – Rio+10 – in September this year was shared by many other parties. This made the success in Bonn so important. The agreement struck in Bonn indeed prevented an unravelling of the international efforts to combat climate change following the failure of the conference in the Hague and the announcement by President Bush that the United States will not support the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">What also might have happened was an alternative proposal to the Kyoto Protocol by the United States. This would have thrown the international efforts to establish an effective international framework for combating climate change into disarray. The talks in Bonn therefore represented a race against the clock. It has to be said that the United States honoured President Bush's promise not to prevent other parties from going ahead on the Kyoto Protocol. During the final plenary of the ministerial segment of the conference no party objected to the adoption of the political agreement reached. At the same time the EU and other parties have expressed the hope that the US will rejoin the Kyoto process. Nothing in the agreement prevents it from doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union showed a strong and unified position during the talks and the Belgian presidency did a good job in coordinating our position. I should also acknowledge the political support from the NGOs and MEPs present at the meeting, participating in a very constructive way. The outcome of Bonn represents a victory for multilateral international relations. Against the background of the current debate on globalisation it sends another political signal that the international community is able to address global problems to the benefit of all countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement was a breakthrough, but of course there remain a number of steps to be taken before the Kyoto Protocol can enter into force. First, the political elements agreed upon will have to be translated into legal texts. This will be finalised and formally adopted by the conference of the parties at its next session, COP 7 in Marrakesh in November.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the prospects now for ratification of the Kyoto Protocol? Entry into force requires ratification by 55 parties representing at least 55% of the CO2 emissions in 1990 of the industrialised countries. Given that the United States has no intention of ratifying the protocol for the time being, this means that ratification by at least Japan and Russia, in addition to the EU and the candidate countries, is necessary to bring the protocol into effect.</p>
<p class="contents">As the candidate countries supported the EU's positions our attention focuses particularly on Japan, but also on Russia. Japan feels strongly linked to the Kyoto Protocol and has repeatedly stated its aim of bringing it into force by 2002. At the same time Japan has so far refrained from clearly committing itself to ratifying the protocol, even without the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia's position was unclear throughout the negotiations and at the last minute it became clear in Bonn that it would not raise any objections. This is despite the fact that Russia will benefit economically from the Kyoto Protocol and the establishment of an international emissions trading system as it will be in a position to sell emission credits due to its generous emissions targets.</p>
<p class="contents">Both countries now have a major responsibility in determining whether or not the international community takes an important step in combating climate change. Hence Bonn represented an important step but is not yet the end of the process.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also highlight the constructive role played in Bonn by the developing countries, G4-77/China, under the chairmanship of Iran, sharing EU positions on many points. Our good relations with this group proved to be an essential element in achieving a successful outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">In the difficult situation in which we found ourselves, the EU was forced to make concessions to other parties to obtain an agreement in Bonn and rescue the Kyoto Protocol. These concessions relate mainly to a generous counting of carbon zincs towards industrialised countries' emissions targets and, on the last night of the negotiations, to the legally binding character of the compliance regime.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement on zincs means that around 70% of the overall 5.2% emission reduction target for industrialised countries under the protocol can be covered by zincs instead of actual emission reductions. Nonetheless, given that emissions have increased in most industrialised countries since 1990 a significant emission reduction effort in those countries is still required. Giving up on the legally binding character of the consequences for non-compliance was another concession necessary to get Japan on board. However, in exchange, the system itself is quite ambitious and, even though for the moment only politically binding, creates a strong incentive for parties to comply. Once implemented the Kyoto Protocol will have a more elaborate and stringent compliance system than any other multilateral environmental agreement so far.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement includes a declaration by the EU and a number of other countries of a funding package of EUR 450 million per year by 2005 for capacity building, technology transfer and adaptation to climate change for developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The main progress of the Kyoto Protocol is, in any case, to establish the architecture and general rules of an international framework on climate change: for example, binding emission targets, the flexible mechanisms for achieving those targets, a compliance regime, support to developing countries on which further decisions can build. Besides its importance in addressing one of the biggest global challenges – climate change – the Kyoto Protocol will establish a new major international market for emissions rights among industrialised countries. It will also channel new resources to developing countries and the economies in transition in central and eastern Europe. It is certainly also important for the political acceptance of the Kyoto Protocol that investments in nuclear facilities are excluded from joint implementation and the clean development mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said earlier, the agreement in Bonn paves the way for the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. The European Union is committed to ratification by our Heads of State and Government. I therefore intend to present to the Council and the European Parliament soon, and certainly well before the end of the year, first of all a ratification proposal for the Kyoto Protocol. This will include a Council decision on the burden sharing among the Member States of the Communities, overall a 8% emission reduction target on the basis of the political agreement of the Environment Council of 16 June 1998; secondly, a communication on a cost-effective implementation strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the EU based on the final report of the Commission's European climate change programme, the ECCP; thirdly, a proposal for a framework directive on an EU-wide emission trading scheme as a core element in a cost-effective Kyoto implementation strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express my appreciation for the ongoing support of the European Parliament for the EU's position in the international climate negotiations and your continuing interest in this issue. It was reflected in your strong Parliamentary delegation in Bonn. I hope to continue our good cooperation in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An environmental message, an economic message and one concerning governance. With regard to the environment, this Conference will go down in history as the one that brought to an end the talks and negotiations on climate change that had been dragging on for ten years and the one that enabled us finally to take action. It is true that the agreement is less ambitious that we had hoped and was drawn up mainly at the expense of concessions made in negotiations by the European Union. The alternative to this tiny step forwards, however, would have been incomparably worse. Without the political agreement that was achieved in Bonn, the Kyoto Protocol would be dead and we would have had to waste another ten years working on a global policy to mitigate the damage caused by climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">I should, therefore, like to congratulate Commissioner Wallström on her excellent role in the political handling of this dossier since her appointment, and I also congratulate her for the announcement she made today about presenting to this House the process of ratifying the Kyoto protocol, the practical measures on the emissions trading system and the European programme for climate change. I should also like to highlight the excellent cooperation maintained between the European Parliament delegation, the Commissioner for the Environment and the Council, through the Belgian Presidency, throughout the Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">The second message from Bonn is a change in the economic model: from a fire-based, fuel-using economy, to one which is coal-based. In this economy, a ton of coal has a set price and carbon dioxide emissions represent a cost that must be factored into the overall costs of all products and into the annual financial statements of all companies. We will therefore be seeing, in all economic sectors, a conversion to cleaner technologies. Obviously, the competitive advantages will go to those who convert the quickest. This is precisely where the mistake in President Bush’s calculation lies that is already beginning to concern North American businessmen, as we saw in Bonn: In the short term, Kyoto will cost less than was thought and will bring competitive advantages in the medium term.</p>
<p class="contents">The third message from Bonn concerns globalisation. Climate change has become more than an environmental dossier, it has become an issue that symbolises the environmental regulation of globalisation. The Bonn conference thereby demonstrated, for the first time, that those who have moved quickly and effectively to promote the advantages of globalisation are also able to act to minimise the harmful effects of that same globalisation. This is the great hope that was generated in Bonn: it is possible to find common solutions to global problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many of us went there with misgivings about the likely result of the conference. These were, of course, felt particularly keenly in July when it was feared that what had been discussed previously would simply go by the board.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to emphasise that my political group and I are deeply impressed both with the Commissioner's work and with the Swedish and Belgian presidencies. I am talking here not only about what happened at the Bonn conference itself but also about the sound preparatory work which, for example, the Commissioner carried out by travelling around a number of countries to try to convince them of the importance of the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">We can only regret the fact that there is no political will for change on the other side of the Atlantic. It is only to be hoped that, in time, there will be political developments aimed at persuading the United States too to take part in this necessary work. American companies will probably also appreciate in the long term that they are missing something by not being involved in this development.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no going back now. If we are to be able to make some impact upon climate change, everyone must participate, especially the United States which is one of the biggest producers of greenhouse gases.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now a question of putting words into action. As I have pointed out throughout these discussions, the Kyoto Protocol is only the beginning. It sounds hopeful when the Commissioner now promises that we shall have a ratification proposal before the end of the year and that the intention is to return with communications and proposals on trading in emissions rights. On this issue, I want to emphasise what Parliament has said previously, namely that trading in emissions rights must never become the biggest part of the commitment. A real change has to take place. We must change our transport systems and we must reduce emissions if there is to be less of an effect upon the climate.</p>
<p class="contents">That also applies to sinks. There are, of course, a number of shortcomings in the Protocol and the decision. It had been hoped that the sinks would not have been so important. Norway has set a good example by saying that it does not intend to make use of its sinks in the same way. It would be all to the good if more countries were to follow that example.</p>
<p class="contents">We must wait to see what happens at the conference in Marrakesh. Sooner or later, it will also be time to begin discussing how we are to make further progress. Practical proposals are required if progress is really to take place and if we are not simply to get bogged down in the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me, finally, to thank the Commissioner and the Presidency for the sound work they have done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope so – it certainly did mine. Together with Mr Pronk and the Belgian Presidency, you have achieved a great deal. You provided an immense service to the environment and strengthened European influence. I would like to congratulate and thank you.</p>
<p class="contents">I was pleased with aspects of the deal, the compromise over nuclear power for example was as good as we could get. But overall the agreement is weak. What matters, however, is the process that has now been established. I know that Mr de Roo has instructed me in the past about how the process and the importance of it cannot be overestimated, pointing for example at the way in which the Montreal Protocol has been developed into a really effective instrument from a rather poor beginning over the past decade. But the Kyoto process is going to be very much harder. The priorities are to have it ratified, to get our own Member States to implement effective action plans, and not only to launch emissions trading but to prove that it can work, which is the hardest task of all. And if we can make it work, then I hope that American business will be attracted and the whole political climate across the globe will change.</p>
<p class="contents">You have still a lot to do. The vast majority in this House will strongly support you in your continuing efforts. I thank you again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Kyoto protocol is not dead, as President Bush has stated, but alive and kicking. Kyoto is a baby that has learned to walk at the age of four. Most babies learn to walk around their first birthday. Better later than never, as we say in the Netherlands in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing that is certain is that the Kyoto baby needs to grow considerably in order to keep climate change under control. But that other environmental baby, the Treaty of Montreal of 1987, also needed fourteen years to combat the gap in the ozone layer effectively. The same will apply to our Kyoto baby.</p>
<p class="contents">President Bush is already experiencing that there is much truth in the Dutch saying: he who breaks, pays. He who walks out of negotiations, loses. The Japanese Minister, Mr Kawaguchi, arrived in Washington today for a six-day visit to try to persuade President Bush to change his mind and participate. There are very good reasons for doing so. CO2 emissions are twice as high in the United States as in Europe. It is no surprise then that there should be studies, like that of Florentin Krause, which show that the United States, by pursuing a shrewd energy policy, could both meet the levels of Kyoto and achieve 1% extra economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to step up the pressure on President Bush even further, my group and, fortunately, Parliament too, proposes organising CoP-9 in the United States in 2003. By then, the Kyoto baby will be a child of school age and will have to learn to talk, especially about the international trade in CO2 rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In Bonn, American business seemed very interested in participating in that international trade after 2008. The companies felt that they had been left out in the cold by their own President. The European Union persuaded them by teaching the Kyoto baby to walk, but now it needs to learn to run. I would like to ask the Commission to submit the Kyoto protocol for ratification before CoP-7 in Marrakech, and to put the proposal for internal CO2 trade before CoP-7. Finally, regarding the transport sector, which is so difficult to curb, I would advise the Commission to publish proposals restricting the CO2 emissions from vans and trucks.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to express a word of thanks to the troika for the unanimous leadership of the European delegation and to the Belgian Presidency for its special balancing skills; to the Commission for the flexible and effective cooperation in Bonn, to the G-77 for the constructive attitude and to the environmental movement for its strikingly constructive contribution to teaching the Kyoto baby to walk. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the other hand, if we measure what was achieved by that battle that you waged, Commissioner – in conjunction with Parliament’s delegation and that of the rest of the Commission – to conclude the agreement that was finally reached, we must thank you, Commissioner, and this delegation for having concluded an agreement that is fundamentally consistent, in that all the countries adopted this approach. The result of this was to isolate the United States who, unfortunately, is sticking to a position that is not in the interests of the world as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">I also feel that the exclusion of nuclear energy as an alternative to reducing greenhouse gases is a positive development.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot conceal our reticence over emissions trading and its monitoring or the use of sinks. The European Parliament has already stated, on several occasions, that sinks should only be used in a limited and carefully monitored way. These issues are of concern to us.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also concerned about follow-up and monitoring mechanisms for compliance and the issue of possible sanctions in the event of non-compliance. Of greatest concern to us is the fact that the report by the European Environment Agency states that unless decisions are taken immediately, by 2010 emissions will increase by 6%.</p>
<p class="contents">In our future work – and here I agree with my fellow speakers – it is, therefore, we industrialised countries that will have to lead the way in this reduction of emissions. It is crucial that we ratify the protocol and make greater reductions than those laid down in the agreement. We must introduce legally binding measures, take action on transport, which emits huge quantities of CO2 and clarify the amount of aid to be given to developing countries to ensure that they take similar action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it is as the Commissioner said: the protocol has been saved. Obviously, this in itself will not solve the problems. The problems inherent in climate change and what needs to be done to stop climate change go far beyond what was agreed in Bonn. But it is an important first step.</p>
<p class="contents">We must counter those who criticise the Kyoto protocol in principle – a number of members from Germany, for example, have said that the whole protocol is useless – and those who, as environmental politicians, have said it is useless because it does not go far enough, by saying that, if your house is on fire and you think it will take ten fire engines to put it out, you are hardly going to turn the first fire engine away and say, please do not start fighting the fire until all ten fire engines are here; you do what you can as quickly as possible, bearing in mind that other measures are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">These other measures are being negotiated both at international level and, of course, in the European Union. Now we have to tackle the question of implementation. You made a number of important announcements on that today, Commissioner, and you have our support. We must keep talking to the Americans at international level. A lot of people, including here in Parliament, are hugely critical of the Americans because of their policy in just about every political arena.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we should concentrate on fundamentals. We should make it clear to our American friends that we do not agree with them on numerous counts but that we can live with our differences. However, in this area, we Europeans cannot live with the fact that the Americans keep holding back. And we need to tell them as much again and again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Well done. For the rest, it never fails to astound me just how united Europeans are on the question of climate change and the measures needed to counter it. I think that climate policy is a policy people can identify with in Europe and we should turn this to our advantage. I also think that it is our duty to work on the American public, so that they follow our lead. Perhaps, in this case, we are one step ahead of the Americans, just as public opinion on other questions is often one step ahead of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to comment on one point of view: the impact of this climate policy on energy policy. The whole point of climate policy is that it requires us to put a price on CO2 in the future. Let us suppose that your estimates are right and that CO2 costs about EUR 30 a tonne. That means that electricity from brown coal will rise by about 3.5 eurocents and electricity from hard coal will rise by about 3 eurocents. The price of renewable sources of energy will not rise, i.e. they will become more competitive. But nor will the price of nuclear energy rise. As is it not excluded from emission trading and is only banned where there is joint implementation, this works to the advantage of nuclear energy. This completely changes the weightings within the energy spectrum. That is not the subject of this evening’s debate, but it will be subject of debates over coming months and years. I just wanted to point that out.</p>
<p class="contents">For the rest, I share the view of many of my fellow members who said that this is a process. We have only just begun it and we must stick with it. The very fact of having been there is, I think a very good thing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Kyoto has ultimately not remained an empty promise. At the last moment, Bonn produced the political signal that was necessary. It is a signal on the basis of which Kyoto can become a reality. We must make a start on this project as soon as possible, not only in Europe, but also in other parts of the world. Political agreements must now be translated into concrete action with visible results, because that is the way to strengthen political support for climate policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The signal must now be seen and heard everywhere. The struggle against the emission of greenhouse gases is a worldwide challenge in third-world countries where the results of the rise in sea level and the change in weather patterns are making themselves painfully felt. It is a global task, for which Europe must take its share of the responsibility. We must invest and not forget that at present there are two billion people without electricity. Sustainable energy can give a boost to development.</p>
<p class="contents">Much more discussion is needed with the United States, where the main fear is loss of jobs. We must now demonstrate that, in fact, the economic effects are favourable. Sustainable development must lead to sustainable growth. Within the Union, we must now quickly begin the ratification process and launch the system of emission rights. Industry is keen to have clarity and to start rightaway. We must make the transition to a low-CO2 economy and give this a concrete form. This requires research and innovation. It is of great importance for us to join forces in a common research programme. The framework programme for research and Article 169 offer a good basis for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Climate policy is also a component of the Sixth Environmental Action Programme. It must be adopted across the product and packaging policy, transport policy and energy policy. In each Member State, action programmes must be introduced and clear political choices must be made on the way in which Kyoto is realised. In this way, Kyoto and Bonn will culminate in an unparalleled burst of innovation. It is now time for action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is thanks to their excellent preparation of our negotiations and the preparatory work within the European Union that we have been able to succeed. But we were also able to speak with one voice in Bonn, which led to better results, and we stayed united. We worked well with NGOs and I believe that this also contributed to this good result.</p>
<p class="contents">As you said, the real result in Bonn was that we put the international framework in place. Of course we had to make some very unsatisfactory concessions, and the end result and the real reductions were limited in a way that we are not at all happy with, but we will have to live with this framework for a very long time. It will be subject to many adaptations and political changes and exposed to market forces, which will lead to change over time. However, we took the initiative from the very beginning and we were able to carry it through to an international agreement. Now we can work within that. We can change and develop it. The total emission reduction required, for example, for Japan is 14% and for Canada around 15% so there is still a real effort to be made for these countries. But of course we are not happy with some of the substantial concessions we had to make.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I want to make which underlines what you have stated is that we now have to move from words to deeds. Again it is only by showing the way, leading by example, that we can stay credible. So I will shortly be presenting these three proposals to continue this work. We should stay in the lead in the world debate about climate change. We should be the first to present different initiatives at conferences or whatever, to exchange good practice, and so on. I would like your cooperation. My intention is to keep the initiative and ensure that we lead the world in combating climate change. We now have to concentrate on Marrakesh and putting all the legal texts in place so that these can be implemented. Everything will stand or fall with their implementation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
