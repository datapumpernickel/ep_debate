<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I welcome this opportunity to report on the recent contamination of the feed and food chain with medroxy-progesterone acetate, or MPA as it is commonly known.</p>
<p class="contents">I must stress that the Commission takes this incident very seriously indeed. It is simply unacceptable that hormones should find their way into the food and feed chains.</p>
<p class="contents">So, having found ourselves in this regrettable situation, what action did we take?</p>
<p class="contents">First, my services called an emergency meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health on 10 July, with further meetings following on 16 and 24 July. These were in addition to the continuous contacts between the Commission services and their counterparts in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">These efforts were very successful in reducing the risk to public health to a minimum. However, this success was achieved at a very high cost. Very substantial quantities of food and feed had to be traced and destroyed. The impact has been particularly severe in the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="contents">Investigations into the factors which allowed the contamination to take place are, of course, ongoing. However, two factors in particular already stand out: firstly, the application of Community legislation on the movement and disposal of pharmaceutical waste, and secondly, the carelessness of certain feed producers in their selection of raw material suppliers.</p>
<p class="contents">Investigations into the onward distribution of the contaminated glucose syrup revealed that it had been delivered to feed mills and traders and, to a limited extent, to the food industry.</p>
<p class="contents">The contaminated feed was produced mostly for pigs, but also, to a much lesser extent, for cattle, poultry, zoo animals and pets.</p>
<p class="contents">This contaminated feed could be separated into two groups: a lesser quantity of highly contaminated feed distributed to 57 farms in the Netherlands and larger quantities with a low level of contamination.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to the situation, the Standing Committee agreed the following measures. All animals fed with highly contaminated feed would be kept under strict official control. Member States would test individual animals fed with the highly contaminated feed and only release them for consumption if results confirmed that MPA could not be detected. The authorities in the Netherlands chose to destroy pigs fed with the highly contaminated feed, thus removing them entirely from the food chain.</p>
<p class="contents">All samples from animals fed with the low contamination feed tested negative for the presence of MPA and the restriction was therefore lifted. Several hundred samples of glucose syrup, molasses and feed have been analysed and, as a result, thousands of tonnes of contaminated raw materials and feeding stuffs have been recalled, seized and destroyed.</p>
<p class="contents">The next meeting of the Standing Committee is planned for 11 September. At this meeting, the measures taken by the Member States in relation to the MPA contamination will be reviewed. However, we can already conclude that the measures were successful in limiting the potential risk to the public. They were also very successful in averting any unilateral restrictions by Member States or third countries on trade, particularly from the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly we have to learn the lessons from the contamination and avoid any repetition. At the Agriculture Council of 15 July 2002, I repeated my call for the Member States’ competent authorities for food and feed to exercise stricter control to ensure a high level of consumer health protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Feed and food operators need to be more aware of their responsibilities in this area. We all consider the food law a major step forward for the protection of human health. In that context, the responsibilities of feed and food operators are clearly established. Feed operators must ensure that the raw materials they buy are safe.</p>
<p class="contents">In the very near future the Commission will be proposing a major reform of the Community’s system of official controls, in order to create a harmonised, coordinated and more effective system of controls on food and feed.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Food and Veterinary Office is urgently investigating the operation and control of the animal feed sector. Its aim will be to pinpoint how recent contamination incidents have been allowed to occur and to identify the action that needs to be taken to prevent similar incidents arising in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in order to complete the legal framework for the entire feed sector, the Commission will present a new proposal on feed hygiene at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">We intend to put forward general hygiene rules for the production, distribution and feeding of animals and also to enlarge the scope of the registration system for feed operations.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the current arrangements, only establishments dealing with certain feed additives are registered. Clearly this is not sufficient to ensure traceability of all feed materials.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, a positive list of feed materials is being looked at with a view to increasing consumer protection, as Parliament itself has requested. I am pleased to say that the feasibility study you requested is nearly complete. You will receive the report with our analysis before the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the question arises as to whether Community legislation in relation to the waste sector is sufficiently stringent and properly implemented. I would remind you that had existing waste legislation been correctly applied in the case of MPA, it would have prevented such an incident. I alerted my colleague, Mrs Wallström, as soon as it became apparent that the problem involved pharmaceutical waste. Discussions have taken place with waste experts from the Member States and are continuing.</p>
<p class="contents">One lesson we can learn from this incident is the need for closer coordination and cooperation between the authorities responsible for the waste sector and those responsible for feed and food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The authorities of the Member States involved in this affair have been asked to provide all relevant information to enable the case to be assessed from an environmental point of view. On the basis of that assessment, the Commission will take any further action deemed necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it goes without saying that incidents such as this only serve to undermine our efforts to restore consumer confidence in our food supply. We need to redouble our efforts, in terms not just of legislation but also better enforcement and control, to make such incidents a thing of the past. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bowis (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, food safety has been high on our parliamentary menu for the past three years. We have had scares and scandals in Europe on olive oil, contaminated wine, mineral water, listeria, salmonella, E. coli, BSE, dioxins, sludge and slurry. They all concerned our constituents and exercised our legislative minds. Now, once again, there is a problem with hormones. We discussed and debated the Food Safety White Paper and went on to pass legislation on food and feed and on the establishment of the European Food Safety Authority.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, our media have been full of new food scandals. 50 000 Dutch pigs condemned to be slaughtered because they were contaminated by illegal feedstuffs – illegal because of contamination by MPA hormones in feed additives. The cost to the Netherlands alone is immense, tens of millions of euros. The problem probably came, as we heard, from waste water from an American-owned pharmaceutical company in Ireland, sent by an Irish waste disposal firm to a Belgian reprocessing plant that is now bankrupt. That firm supplied glucose syrup or treacle to Dutch feed manufacturers. All 4 000 pigs were then exported from the Netherlands to Belgium. The banned hormone has been found in pigfeed in Germany. 300 German farms were banned from selling milk or animals. But pork was sold, was processed and has been eaten by humans and of course MPA in humans can cause infertility. Some of the syrup, too, ended up with soft drink manufacturers. Some of the feed ended up in Denmark, Spain, France and possibly Luxembourg and Britain.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the messages the Commissioner has highlighted is that we need coordination, not only between governments but between the directorates of the Commission. I welcome what he said about talking to Mrs Wallström.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, what is the point of our passing laws if they are not enforced? Where were the checks and the monitoring? What, incidentally, are the Commission's new proposals on controls? Was this negligence or was it a criminal attempt to increase the weight of pigs by illegal means? How often is a blind eye turned to wrongdoing? A banned carcinogenic herbicide was found in grain fed to organic chickens in Germany in June. Yet exports of organic chicken or eggs from Germany were not banned.</p>
<p class="contents">I have faith in our new food safety measures. I have faith in our new authority and I wish it could be set up faster. But it will only be effective if we have proper enforcement throughout the European Union.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Roth-Behrendt (PSE).</span></span>   <span class="italic">– (DE)</span> Mr President, over the past few years – since 1996, I would say – I have told this House at least five times that animal feed should not be a dustbin for cheaply disposing of all kinds of rubbish. It is surprising to find that such a simple statement never ceases to be topical and is never a source of boredom, given that it remains so topical. Why should that be? Because of our agricultural policy, of course. Since we try to produce everything as cheaply as possible, it makes sense to produce cattle feed as cheaply as possible too.</p>
<p class="contents">I once said that the manufacturers and we ourselves should try to picture sitting down in front of a plate of animal feed with a knife and fork on either side – just imagine what that would look like! Mr Bowis just pointed out that this is not just a matter of carelessness here but of criminal intent. He is quite right. To describe storing animal feed in a former chemical works as carelessness is to put it mildly. I do not know what makes people do things like that or allow them to happen. What are we to think when a waste disposal company produces glucose syrup as a parallel activity? Should we not perhaps be somewhat sceptical when we come across an Irish company wanting to dispose of its waste – to which there can be no objections as such – and we see that it wants to do this in Belgium and that the waste reprocessing company also produces glucose syrup? The waste that it is processing comes from washing the coating on contraceptive pills, which of course contains sugar.</p>
<p class="contents">No one actually noticed this and we all found it quite normal, but when it actually came to light in the course of the monitoring process it caused enormous excitement.</p>
<p class="contents">If we do not start to change the system in some way, we will carry on having this debate here at least three times a year. So what can we change about the system? I am grateful to Commissioner Byrne for pinpointing some ideas. Yes, we need tough legislation on feed hygiene. Yes, we need to separate the production of animal and plant-based feeds. Yes, we need stricter approval procedures for feed producers, with a registration system for factories producing animal feeds. And yes, every manufacturer of feedingstuffs must employ a biochemist at his plant full-time and not just source one from somewhere else. These are all commonplace ideas that we could all suggest, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the situation with legislation on waste? Yes, there is indeed proper waste legislation. Are there proper controls in the Member States? Apparently neither the country of origin nor the receiving country carries out controls. Will the Commission go to the European Court of Justice more quickly? Will countries which are obviously ignoring their control obligations under the existing legislation be prosecuted more quickly and suffer appropriate penalties? What is the position as regards controls in the Member States? Since the BSE crisis, we have established that the real Bermuda Triangle within the European Union is the system of controls in the Member States. We should be obliging all Member States to, at last, make the process more transparent and to tell us how many people are carrying out controls on what, when, where and with what result. That can just be one page, nice and transparent, available to anyone, and on the Internet if you like. Is that too much to ask? No, it is not too much to ask!</p>
<p class="contents">We have been saying for years – since 1996 – that we want a positive list of substances and additives in animal feed. Commissioner Byrne told us that the feasibility study is almost complete, so we should be able to start soon. I am grateful for that. However, if we do not all accept that up to now we have been consistently turning a blind eye so that animal feed can be produced cheaply and so that meat can be produced cheaply, then we will still be encouraging firms to dump all kinds of waste, anything that can no longer be recycled in any other way, in animal feed. That is why we need to have quality requirements for animal feeds. We need to have other controls on animal protein. And in our role as consumers, we ourselves also need to consider what we are consuming and how, and what we are willing to pay for products.</p>

If we consider the recent scandals, the big question is whether the Commission would have been able to prevent them. The Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin has been in existence for a number of years. What kind of inspections does it carry out precisely? How often are they carried out? Is there room for improvement? Would the Commission be able to comment on this? The imports of food, of meat from other countries, have already been mentioned. Does the Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin have sufficient staff to inspect them?</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to raise the issue of the Food Safety Authority. Once this is fully up and running, it will need to analyse all the production processes and see whether they can be improved. This Authority will also need to issue recommendations to the Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin about the way in which the inspection procedures can be improved still further. In fact, cooperation with the Member States will also be required. However, the most important thing is for the Office to perform its task of implementing existing legislation well. In the light of increasing liberalisation, we will obviously be facing ever growing imports and, in my view, ever greater risks as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue is production in Europe itself. The idea that the entire production chain is to be monitored is increasingly taking root in different countries. This is referred to as ‘integrated production’. Why does the Commission not prescribe any standards in this respect? What exactly is integrated production in a European context? How can we monitor every link in the production chain? There is legislation in Europe governing organic production in which this is laid down. In a slightly different area, there is legislation in Europe which defines precisely what regional products are. Why, therefore, do we not have legislation which identifies what integrated production is by means of a quality mark? Then we would be able to trace everything promptly. Moreover, the European consumer would be able to express a preference for European products from European farmers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The revision of the directive on food may help to significantly change this situation. This is particularly necessary given the growing worldwide trend towards producing food by artificial means. There are at present no universal controls on the value-added chain, and awareness of state food controls needs to be increased.</p>
<p class="contents">There will certainly be an improvement in this state of affairs if we can succeed in involving the agricultural industry, the animal feed industry and those engaged in the monitoring of food. That will not be a simple task as those in positions of responsibility throughout the chain have a very negative attitude. State controls are necessary, but we need to create better incentives for promoting voluntary self-regulation and self-regulation under civil law. State controls can then focus on the high-risk companies and farms that will always exist. It is not acceptable, when products have been placed on the market contrary to health regulations, for this to be declared the result of a production accident and the products withdrawn under covert or open buy-back schemes so that they will simply be forgotten.</p>
<p class="contents">As we know from past experience, it tends to be very difficult to clarify the facts of such cases rapidly and rigorously. Compulsory reporting of what are labelled as serious health risks is clearly not enough. In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania 320 farms were temporarily closed because of suspected contamination with Nitrofen, but the discovery of this scandal and the attendant publicity were remarkable not so much because of the number of cases as because of the nature of the crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are also moments when we learn a great deal about society. Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mr Bowis pointed out that, apparently, there are people in the food industry who act irresponsibly and are careless, and for whom only the gross profits, pure financial gain and greed count. What lessons can I and my group draw from the nitrofen case in Germany and the Whyeth Pharmaceutical/Bioland case in Ireland and Belgium?</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we need to prevent products entering the human and animal food chain which originate from recycled waste, and inspection must also be stepped up, including in respect of the waste flow of the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. In my own country – and I assume that this is the case in most – we need to work towards better cooperation between the services that monitor the food chain and the services that manage the waste flows. I am pleased, Commissioner, that you have come to the same conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is a European Rapid Alert System that also applies to animal feed, and that, I believe, is functioning well at the moment. Should we not insist that our national and regional counterparts adopt a kind of rapid alert system internally within the Member States too, and certainly in federal Member States such as Germany and Belgium where the powers are spread across different authorities?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must introduce a system of perfect traceability of raw materials that end up in the food chain.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, and this is something which my group has advocated, we ban by law all practices that do not yield any extra nutritional value or any extra advantage to the consumer, or that are superfluous from a technical point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, it is clear that the number of inspections needs to be increased. They must also be diversified, for we can only find something if we look for it. This was made abundantly clear in Germany's nitrofen case when the organic sector decided to carry out voluntary checks.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixthly, I would push for producer liability to play its full part. The whole debate on environmental liability must be speeded up and we must bring it to a more rapid conclusion. Finally, Commissioner, I would once again urge the Commission to draw up of a positive list of products allowed in cattle feed. You have announced that this is to be the subject of a feasibility study. I would expressly ask you what progress is being made on this matter. Finally, there are quite a few comic characters in the food industry, and only a well-organised authority with strict inspections can rid the industry of these characters once and for all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this regard I compliment the Commissioner on his response to the most recent scare and share fully his views with regard to what has happened.</p>
<p class="contents">While the number of incidents proportionate to the volume of quality food produced is minimal, the negative impact on consumers is considerable. Restoring confidence in the food chain has been a slow, tedious and indeed expensive process. Thankfully the measures put in place are proving their effectiveness and there is now an acute awareness on the part of all involved, from producers to processors, from the retail to the catering trade, that any breach of the regulations is unacceptable and will be severely dealt with.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to put on the record that, while EU consumers always had access to quality food, the effectiveness of new controls and greater transparency in the food chain provide the additional safeguards necessary to allay fears resulting from isolated incidents and indeed the unforgivable incident which this House is addressing this morning. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Listening to today's debate on food safety, I fear that we have not come very far in recent years. Producers and consumers have the same objective, we are all in the same boat, so it is not just consumers that are affected but the producers themselves as well. As I see it, consumers are quite right to be alarmed by the serious problems we have had recently, the string of scandals that have already been mentioned – BSE, dioxin, Nitrofen – it is a very long list. Ultimately, however, the weakest link in the chain is always the farmer, the producer, who has taken a battering because of the price situation. That is why the agricultural sector has a particularly great interest in achieving high quality in the upstream market.</p>
<p class="contents">I am at present rapporteur on the issue of additives in animal feed. Commissioner, I am certainly in agreement with you in calling for very stringent measures to be applied to a wide variety of additives. We are talking here about antibiotics and cocciodiostatic drugs. I have just been discussing this with some of your colleagues. As a practical person, I firmly believe that we got things adequately sorted out on paper a long time ago but, in practice, when it comes to implementation and control, I regret to say that we will still have a lot of black sheep to deal with in future. We will only make progress here if the control system involves tougher sanctions. As I see it, those who are too slack deserve to be pilloried and should have their quota withdrawn and their production units shut down.</p>
<p class="contents">Only if you point the way on this with our support can pressure be exerted to restore a reasonable situation in the European Union, one in which producers and consumers can process or consume food in the knowledge that it is safe and we can maintain the high quality of food that we have in the future as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to fully support Mrs Roth-Behrendt's proposals, but we have spent over 20 years talking about people's willingness to spend more money on food; it is just that the distribution process has totally changed. We need to be honest about the fact that many people simply cannot afford it. They want it all. They want not just to eat and drink, they also want to go on holiday, to travel, and so on and so forth. That is why we have food that is virtually free. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the problems we face in this House is that we often orate about how everything should be perfect without always ourselves being willing to seek the means to go with the ends: the means to allow us to have an effective FVO, which at the moment is overstretched and understaffed; the means to have a proper process of scrutiny whereby every Member State, great or small, whether its population is a few hundred thousand or many millions, takes equal precautions and provides equal information. That has not happened in some of the cases here and I appreciate the difficulties that the Commissioner faces as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">In regard to the scandal about the presence of nitrofen in grains for organic chickens, we know from information provided between May and July that not all of the Member States were informed with express speed about what had happened. Our information is that in regard to contaminated pork – to pigs that had been fed with these appalling materials – four Member States had purchased and no doubt their citizens had consumed some of the contaminated pork before the process of control was effectively operating.</p>
<p class="contents">The controls are now better and, as a result of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health being set up in February and the evidence it collates, we can now say that we have a rapid-alert system that ought to work. That is the Commissioner's responsibility, so we commend him on it.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is whether the Member States are providing sufficient information. Can they be trusted to bring their own rogue operators under control? I do not know. I should like to hear from the Commissioner whether he believes the resources are there. Mr Bowis said earlier that all the institutions have been dilatory and slow in setting up EFSA. It is going to come into operation later than we had hoped. Is that one of the reasons why we are having to wait longer to get these positive lists of feed materials and the general hygiene rules which follow from the reforms we so enthusiastically greeted last year? I hope that the Commissioner can tell us that proper investigations are proceeding in all the Member States as to why organisations like Bioland could perpetrate the scandals they did. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have been quoted in the German press as saying that there are thousands of substances that need to be tested. I hope that was a misquote, because if there really are thousands of substances added to animal feeds, that would be a scandal in itself. The number of additives needs to be limited and that should be implemented on a restrictive basis. After all, if the industry then comes along and says that it has forgotten a substance and makes the test available straight away, that substance can be added on.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the positive list does not mean that we have nothing to worry about. The fact that there are people willing to dispose of toxic materials by putting them in animal feeds because that is cheaper demonstrates a criminal intent which should be punished accordingly. That also convinces me – and I think we in this House are all agreed on this – that a simple ban is not enough. We need to consider what substances we are banning and what happens to them next. Mrs Roth-Behrendt has already pointed out that legislation on waste should be closely linked with controls, just as it should be linked with what we are discussing here, so that there is not any overlap. We have repeatedly seen cases of substances that really should be destroyed finding their way into animal feeds.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we should not throw the baby out with the bath water – please note, Mr President! We have already seen what can happen in the case of food waste. We also need to establish reasonable recycling arrangements where it is appropriate to do so. Yesterday, I visited a cat and dog food factory. When you see the meticulous controls applied there you realise that it is not a question of controls but rather of the sanctions that can be applied by consumers wielding their purchasing power against industry.</p>

I should also like to thank the Commissioner for what he has said. I do notice, however, that, although he is introducing a large number of measures, he fails to mention the best piece of news, namely that it was the farmers who discovered that something was wrong with their pigs, because their sows were not breeding properly. It is down to the farmers. This means, then, that there is a very important lesson we should draw from this, and that we should be aware that the inspection system, however effectively it has been set up, has failed thus far.</p>
<p class="contents">With all these fine measures that are now being proposed, I have one overriding question, and I believe that Mrs Roth-Behrendt has already mentioned it as well. How does waste legislation relate to what we do with our cattle feed? Who monitors this? Commissioner, if you say that, according to Commissioner Wallström, if waste legislation had been enforced, we would not be facing any problems now, then I think you should ask the Irish authorities why they did not verify that these hormones landed up in a waste processor in an improper manner. Why did they subsequently not check at the border that these hormones were being exported to a company which should raise question marks, at any rate in Belgium? This means, therefore, that in this respect, the Irish and the Belgians have dropped major clangers.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, why – and I am also speaking on behalf of my own country – did we fail to check these companies when we know that, in addition to manure, they also produce their own feed and that they are already shrouded in great suspicion? What about product liability legislation? I hope that those who lost out will be receiving compensation from the governments responsible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An enormous variety of food is on offer, including food from widely varying countries outside the European Union. Our guiding principle should continue to be that our food should be safe and of a high quality, in order to ensure that consumers are protected. Food is the most basic prerequisite for people's health and quality of life.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, past scandals have unsettled and frightened consumers enormously. For example, I find it irresponsible that dishonest pharmaceutical companies should dispose of hormone products through animal feed and food, turning consumers into walking rubbish bins. I find it absolutely horrifying that metroxyprogesteronacetate is present in sugar syrup and soft drinks! I would like to ask, Commissioner, what legal steps have now been taken to prevent this recurring in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the new European Food Safety Authority as an early warning system for Europe and as an efficient crisis management system coordinated between the Commission and the Member States. I am, however, concerned that the EU's controls should work properly. The network should be extended to provide better information and the reporting obligation for companies should be brought in as quickly as possible so that goods and products are withdrawn from the market if they are harmful.</p>
<p class="contents">What has the Commission done in the meantime to implement this, and to ensure greater transparency and traceability? We need to protect consumers, and that applies to imports as well. That is why I believe it is a matter of urgent necessity to introduce control systems for food as quickly as possible in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe too, including those cases where food is already produced in accordance with European standards. However, to allow consumers to decide for themselves what they want, we need to ensure that we have practical and clear labelling both for conventionally produced food and for genetically modified food. I firmly believe that we need to set the course for this as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But how am I as a consumer to know if a particular food is healthy? Just looking certainly is not enough. An apple with wormholes in it can be far healthier than a shiny, beautifully round apple. The agricultural sector – and this does not just apply to Austria – professes to observe the principles of food safety, traceability and hygiene.</p>
<p class="contents">For me, this debate is an opportunity to champion the cause of small farms, because it is always in the big, industrialised concerns, which really have very little in common with farms, that scandals occur. Nevertheless, small farms are still at the mercy of animal feed producers and vets who can prescribe all sorts of hormones and other drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing is certain: the controls have not worked. You can, of course, turn things round however you want and say, yes, we just need even stricter rules. But if we are not even enforcing the existing rules, how are we going to cope with even stricter ones? It will not help at all. Whatever legislation we enact will remain a paper tiger if we do not enforce it. As I see it, controlling the enforcers should be a job for the Commission. You cannot just turn your back on this problem. Cheap food may be good for winning the next election, but it is not good for public health, and I think the public knows that too.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress once more that strict rules and regulations and comprehensive documentation of controls are certainly important for big companies. But it would be pointless to harass small family farms with this. To be quite specific, very small food-processing companies need more information and motivation and less bureaucracy and documentation. There is no denying that not only is preventing food crises extremely important for the future of farmers, it is also highly important for the future of public health in the European Union. I believe, Commissioner, that we have not yet found the right way of achieving this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, a number of speakers have referred to the problem of waste and waste policy. We will have an opportunity to discuss this issue later this month in Parliament when we adopt the animal by-products regulation. This hugely important piece of legislation will ensure that one key sector in particular, animal by-products, is better regulated.</p>
<p class="contents">The positive list was referred to by a number of people. I shall say something about that. The Commission will shortly present the study which has been undertaken on the positive list. This will be presented to Parliament and our views on the feasibility of such a list will be made available for discussion here in Parliament at that time. But we should bear in mind that a positive list would not include MPA. It would not, therefore, have prevented the recent contamination. MPA should not be on the list; it will never be approved and therefore the positive list is not the full answer. However, I recognise that a number of people in this House are anxious for progress to be made on this issue and this will be discussed in Parliament before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of people also mentioned the Food Safety Authority. The work is ongoing there and, as we all know, the board has been established. Further steps have been taken on the appointment of the executive director. The board will hold its first meeting very soon on 18 September. In relation to further progress on the Food Safety Authority, if Parliament would make the appropriations requested by the Commission available to us, this would facilitate our work. I know that there are reasons why Parliament feels it wants to hold back this money as leverage for something else, but that may or may not be legitimate. It does nothing to facilitate the establishment of the Food Safety Authority and ensure that it is up and running and carrying out its work. I would appeal to Parliament to reconsider its position on these appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">Some other points were raised by individual Members and I hope I can pick them all up but if I do not, please forgive me. Mr Bowis made reference to growth promoters. We can safely conclude that the contamination we are talking about this morning was not due to illegal use to increase the weight of pigs. Such use, that is the use of hormones as growth promoters, is illegal.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already said, the Commission will be presenting a major proposal on controls shortly. This is aimed primarily at improving the implementation of our existing legislation. I intend in particular to increase the penalties and the cost of non-compliance.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we all agree that we must make it painful and costly for Member States and producers if they fail to implement Community legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Roth-Behrendt made a number of relevant points. She is 100% right: feed must not serve as the dustbin for waste producers. Several of the recent major food-safety crises have originated from waste management: dioxin, the recent nitrofen crisis in Germany, sludge and now MPA and BSE. They are all associated with the feed issue.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already said, we must improve contacts between the Member States on the treatment and disposal of waste – a controversial issue in a number of Member States but, nonetheless, one that has to be addressed with courage and effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Mulder referred to the Food and Veterinary Office. It is doing a very good job in ensuring compliance with Community law. Its reports continue to highlight the serious shortcomings in the implementation of legislation. It could do with more resources, but that is an issue for the budgetary authority. I am unhappy with the follow-up to the FAO's recommendations in a number of areas. This is why the Commission is coming forward with a new proposal to improve controls. As I have said repeatedly, we must make it painful and costly not to respect Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Mulder mentioned a quality mark. This may be valuable but it has its limitations. Like legislation, quality marks are only effective if the qualifying conditions are respected. In the Netherlands, for instance, feed producers undertook to use only safe ingredients as part of their quality assurance scheme. Clearly, they failed to respect this requirement. So quality marks may be useful but they have their limitations.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Whitehead referred to the rapid alert system at Community level and this has worked very effectively in relation to the recent food-safety crises. In a number of cases – not just this one but also the nitrofen case – the system worked very effectively. The problems have occurred at the national level. As Mr Whitehead suggests, in the recent nitrofen crisis in Germany there were clear failings in the notification of national authorities. Very often that occurs because of the federal structure that exists in a number of our Member States. Mr Staes also made the point that those Member States that have a federal structure really need to look at their systems of rapid alert to ensure that they match what we have at Community level. For instance, the Commission immediately notified Member States when it learned of this particular contamination.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Oomen-Ruijten then referred to a number of points that I would like to take up. Commissioner Wallström and I have written to the Irish authorities requesting a full and comprehensive reply to the question marks as to their compliance with the relevant Community legislation. This legislation requires formal notification of the movement of pharmaceutical waste, which does not appear to have happened in this instance. In the light of the reply I expect to have from the Irish authorities later this month we will then be in a position to return to this issue. When that reply comes in it will be examined closely and any further action that needs to be taken will be addressed at that time.</p>
