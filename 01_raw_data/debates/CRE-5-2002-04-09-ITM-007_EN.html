<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Trillo-Figueroa,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like firstly to express my enormous personal satisfaction and that of the Spanish Government at this first appearance, as has been highlighted by the President, which, furthermore, if you will allow me, is for me a re-acquaintance with the parliamentary world. I had the honour of presiding over the Spanish Parliament – the Spanish <span class="italic">Cortes Generales</span> – during the last legislature as President of Congress and my true and definitive political vocation is a parliamentary one.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, it has also been an honour for me to have the opportunity to receive the Chairmen of the Defence Committees of the Parliaments of the fifteen countries of Europe, together with the representatives of the European Parliament and the Parliamentary Assembly of the WEU, in order to deal, quite rightly, with the objectives of the Spanish Presidency of the Union during this six-month period, which I also explained in this Parliament’s Committee on External Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on 18 February.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to start by describing the form my speech will take: I would firstly like to briefly point out the precedents and principles which inspire the European security and defence policy and then move on to an analysis of the objectives of the Spanish Presidency in the three areas into which these objectives have been grouped. The operational dimension, the institutional dimension, and equally importantly, the dimension relating to all the issues of concern to public opinion, both national and European.</p>
<p class="contents">To start with the precedents, I must point out that our real mandate, following the Saint-Malo meeting, started in December 1999 in Helsinki when it was decided to create a European rapid reaction force, which would consist of at least 60 000 troops deployable within two months and for at least one year and including logistical support and air, sea and land resources for carrying out the missions we have christened ‘Petersberg tasks’, in a reference to the famous palace near Bonn where they were analysed, and which are basically the maintenance or enforcement of peace and rescue and humanitarian missions, which will have to be created by 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, since the beginning of 2000, in just two years, we have largely been able to implement this main objective in such a way that, following the Portuguese and French Presidencies, bodies were created which were initially transitional and which are now permanent, and a catalogue of military capabilities has been created, which has since been updated and to which the contributions of six aspiring countries have been incorporated and which was revised by the previous Belgian Presidency, whose work I am grateful for. The military objective slowed down somewhat during the Swedish Presidency, although that Presidency did make good use of its time to develop civil crisis procedures and management bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Laeken European Council declared this rapid reaction force operable, but I must say frankly that this operability is for the moment more virtual than real, and this means that the Spanish Presidency’s mandate is even more urgent following the events of 11 September.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to briefly indicate the principles and firstly point out, as this House knows very well, the intergovernmental nature of the area we are dealing with from which, furthermore, stems the principle of voluntarism, the direct link to the European Council and the <span class="italic">sui generis </span>organisation of this area, which includes the High Commissioner and the Secretary-General, who will subsequently have the opportunity to speak to this House concerning another area, the PSC, the Military Committee and the European Military Staff.</p>
<p class="contents">The second principle is that of mission speciality. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this principle of speciality must be understood as a principle of evaluation, and I therefore repeat that we are talking exclusively about military missions for the carrying out of Petersberg tasks, humanitarian peace enforcement or peacekeeping missions, or rescue missions. Hence one of the difficulties, Mr President, in including the contribution of European military capabilities to defending against external terrorism, when necessary, which is connected to the main priority of the Spanish Presidency, which is the fight against terrorism and which, nevertheless, in the current state of development of our missions as a result of the principle of evaluation, we cannot undertake without a prior Council declaration which I will refer to later if there is time.</p>
<p class="contents">The third principle is that of subsidiarity, obviously not in the traditional sense understood by this House and by all European law, the former Community law, but simply in the sense that our tasks as Europeans in the Europe of the security and defence policy are subsidiary to national defence, which corresponds – since it still forms part of that core, previously a hard core, of sovereignty – to national governments. It is undoubtedly also subsidiary to collective defence, which for the majority of the countries of the Union is attributed to the Atlantic Alliance, so that our missions, in turn, are in this respect subsidiary to the collective defence which falls to the Atlantic Alliance, but are no less autonomous for that.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore the fourth principle is the principle of complementarity, so that, by appropriately combining the structures of the Atlantic Alliance with those of the European Union, we can maintain those principles, which common sense suggests are absolutely essential in order that there be no duplication or redundancy of structures, planning or expenditure. At the end of the day investments in defence are like the two sides of the same coin, as in the case of our common currency.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me now to refer, before listing the objectives of the Spanish Presidency, to the slogan chosen by this Presidency for this six-month period: as you know, ‘more Europe’, which applies both internally and externally. More Europe internally means, in terms of the European security and defence policy, that the European citizens should acquire a greater awareness of the need for a common foreign and security policy. More Europe externally means no more and no less than confronting an essential need.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, please believe me that I am expressing not only a personal opinion but also that of the Spanish Government when I say that the European security and defence policy is an essential need for the European Union. If Europe wants to have a united presence in the world it is essential that it has a common security and defence policy. The European Union cannot have credibility in the world without having its own united voice in the field of security and without that voice being accompanied and supported by military capabilities. We have had the opportunity to witness this shortcoming. I also believe, ladies and gentlemen, that neither is it feasible in the long term to have a common monetary policy if there is no European common foreign and security policy to support that currency.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said earlier, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we can group the objectives for these six months of the Spanish Presidency into the following three areas: operative or operational objectives, institutional objectives and objectives relating to public opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Beginning with the operative objectives, which are clearly the most technical, I must tell Parliament that they were the main focus of the informal meeting I held with the my colleagues, the Defence Ministers of the Union, on 22 and 23 March in Zaragoza. We have all decided to make the Headline Goal and its military capabilities our main priority. And in this respect I must firstly point out that we are working on determining the immediate response elements for the possible carrying out of the Petersberg tasks agreed in Helsinki. This need to determine the elements for immediate response also stems from the recently proven need to choose certain capabilities for the Headline Goal – its catalogue – so that there may be procedures to allow it to be mobilised immediately in the event of crisis. We have not simply tried to construct a mini Headline Goal, nor to create a parallel Headline Goal, but to determine the procedures for selecting capabilities that would be available in the initial moments in order to confront a crisis more rapidly.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we are promoting progress in the designation of a general operational headquarters. To put it clearly, with the informality which is normal in a parliamentary debate, the Laeken Declaration on Operational Capability does not for the moment tell us where the general operational headquarters to lead a force commissioned to carry out a Petersberg task in a situation of crisis would be. We still do not know, but neither do we know what the elements of that force which would have to be deployed in the initial moments would be. Therefore, these two objectives are essential to making the Declaration on Operational Capability effective. There are sufficient offers of general headquarters to determine what the immediate future of those general headquarters may be. We need to ensure – and we have established the requirements – the corresponding multinationality of its structures and the harmonisation of its procedures and operation. The Presidency will continue to promote lines of action for the work on this issue: developing normalised operational procedures which will govern the operation of future general headquarters and, secondly, also participating in the general headquarters panel which has been created within the European Action Plan that I will now refer to.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Laeken Council approved a Belgian proposal, sponsored by the Netherlands, for an action plan for European military capabilities. It is simply the working method for indicating the shortcomings of our catalogue and for providing the means to resolve that lack of capability. By mobilising the Chiefs of Defence Staff of each of the Member States, the Spanish Presidency sought to determine what they saw as the most significant shortcomings in capability in the catalogue. An answer was given in record time and seventeen panels of experts have been created and are now operating, and they are working on analysing solutions for the twenty-three priorities or shortcomings considered the most important. For our part, we are making a cooperative effort to head four of these panels, which, by way of example, relate to attack helicopters, in-flight refuelling, air carrier capability and field hospitals. We are also participating in eight other panels. In Zaragoza, we held a preliminary exchange of views on the direction to take for the provision and funding of the new capabilities that are necessary as a result of the studies under way and original ideas for common funding have been put on the table, which we are studying and which perhaps I will also be able to explain in detail later on.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, and in accordance with the permanent objective of transparency in our actions with regard to the Atlantic Alliance, the European Union group of experts known as the Headline Task Force is already operating and carrying out studies and is meeting frequently during our Presidency together with NATO experts, who will continue to support this process with full cooperation and transparency with the work of the Atlantic Alliance in order to develop its defence capability initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">In this field I must also mention the need for us to create a mechanism for developing capabilities which can clearly indicate at any time our situation in terms of European capabilities or lack thereof. It must naturally be an autonomous European Union mechanism but at the same time, for our own benefit, it must draw on the positive experiences of the Atlantic Alliance.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the greatest difficulty lies in the relationship with planning procedures of the Alliance forces in aspects such as the appropriate form and the tasks of the group of capabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">That no doubt brings us to an important, if not decisive, aspect, not just of our Presidency, but of the development of the European security and defence policy, which is the relationship between the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance, the development of the so-called Berlin Plus agreement, particularly in the chapter relating to the permanent access of the European Union during crisis management processes to NATO’s capabilities. The Barcelona European Council stressed the importance of reaching and concluding permanent agreements between the European Union and NATO as soon as possible and has charged the Presidency and the Secretary-General, the High Representative, with making the necessary high-level contacts in order to make the negotiations a success.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Heads of State and Government have simply stated that we cannot go on delaying the creation of a permanent framework for cooperation with NATO and that <span class="italic">ad hoc </span>or case-by-case solutions could lead to situations of stalemate similar to those we have already seen and would harm the Union at the least appropriate time, at the point of implementing, for the first time, a crisis management operation, seriously jeopardising its present and future prestige.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I will leave, in case there is greater interest on the part of the honourable Members, the examination of the assumption by the European Union of the leadership of certain missions, both in relation to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the continuation of the Amber Fox operation, and the assumption of certain responsibilities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and it remains for me in this field to mention the importance of the CME 02 exercise, which will test our capacity for organisation by means of crisis management procedures in May. It is going to take place during the Spanish Presidency and I can guarantee, ladies and gentlemen, that the difficulties which initially seemed insoluble are being overcome and also confirm to you that we will carry out this exercise not only on the date set but – I am sure – with success, giving an appropriate role to the various European Union institutions, such as the Military Committee, the Political and Security Committee, the Secretary-General, the High Representative, and the Chiefs of Staff.</p>
<p class="contents">I referred to a second area, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, which is the institutional field. In this regard I must point out that Spain, together with certain other countries, has promoted the need to create and formalise a Council of Defence Ministers. Please understand, ladies and gentlemen, that this is not just a question of adding another Council to the European institutional galaxy; it is simply a question of those of us who hold this responsibility being able to fulfil it, being able to work. We neither want to replace nor interfere with the competences of the Foreign Ministers; we simply want to do our work, to be able to deal with the problems I have referred to: the effectiveness of the Headline Goal and the possible deployment of Petersberg tasks. To this end, the Council is of essential importance. We have taken a first big step, because it has enjoyed full consensus, which is the meeting, under the umbrella of the General Affairs Council, of the Council of Defence Ministers, consisting solely of Defence Ministers, during May in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, and within the institutional objectives, I will move on to discussing the bases for a European arms policy, which will also provide an answer to the questions and concerns of Mr Brok. In reality, although very briefly mentioned in the Helsinki declaration, there had so far been no attempt to implement – or at least to establish the bases, to pave the way to – a European arms policy. And we wanted to take this step in a decisive manner. It is in no way a question of interfering with the European arms industry, which would not fall within our competence, but it is a question of setting the bases, the elemental principles, of a European arms policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier I said that the European security and defence policy is absolutely essential to the Union, and an arms policy is also essential to any defence policy. We have therefore prepared a kind of decalogue – the number of principles is of minimal importance at the end of the day – which achieves consensus on the broad principles that would govern a European arms policy. This list is based on the notion that the European arms industry must be at the service of the CFSP and not the other way round – which may seem an obvious principle, but in reality quite the opposite is usually true – and that it must be based on the principles of voluntarism, transparency and coordination with other organisations. Amongst the concrete measures envisaged we also incorporate the harmonisation of operative requirements, the common use of capabilities, the possible acquisition of those capabilities via a European arms agency, which unifies or at least coordinates the existing ones, the study of an accounting system more suited to reality, which facilitates the long-term funding of certain systems and also the search – as I said before – for new common funding formulas.</p>
<p class="contents">The need to define a methodology to deal in the medium and long term with the lack of capability identified in the Helsinki catalogue brings us to these principles of a European arms policy, which will be examined by the national arms directors of the various countries at a meeting organised by the Presidency for 29 April.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I am coming to the end of the time available to me and, in trying to sum up aspects which are no less important but which are clearly not the essential priority, the operational aspects, please allow me to refer, in the seconds remaining to me, to those aspects which relate to the creation of an awareness of European defence amongst public opinion and to aspects connected to that awareness. Ladies and gentlemen, we have witnessed events which require us to construct a legal <span class="italic">acquis</span> of humanitarian law for Petersberg tasks in the future. When Spain made this proposal the events of 11 September had not yet taken place. After 11 September, some months afterwards, certain events have demonstrated that it is absolutely essential for us to clarify the law applicable to crisis situations. I am clearly referring to the treatment given to prisoners, the treatment of the civil population, the treatment of private property and the relationship with civil authorities in the implementation of these tasks. We thought that this could be a road which starts in Salamanca, European Capital of Culture during these months, where many years ago, in the sixteenth century, the <span class="italic">ius ad bellum</span> and the <span class="italic">ius in bello</span> were born, and to that end we have also called a meeting in Salamanca in May, to which the representatives of all the countries of the Union and also third countries are of course invited, as well as the International Committee of the Red Cross.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Spanish Presidency could not ignore the Mediterranean dimension of the CFSP. As you know, a meeting has been scheduled for 22 and 23 April in Valencia, which is very timely. We did not want the CFSP to be left out of this Mediterranean dimension and, to that end, we have also scheduled a seminar in Barcelona for 20 and 21 April on the Mediterranean dimension within our common security and defence policy. It is simply a question of letting the southern Mediterranean countries know that the Headline Goal is not a threat, even less against them: it is a question of establishing stable contacts with their armed forces, with their governments, which enrich the Mediterranean as an area of security and prosperity. And finally, also with this objective, there will be a meeting in Cartagena, following a Belgian initiative, of the people responsible for public opinion within the various defence departments, together with specialists from various media, in order to give new impetus to the understanding and communication of our message to the European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may be allowed to abuse your patience, Mr President, I would like to make a final brief comment, which I believe to be important, on terrorism. Ladies and gentlemen, I have already pointed out that the Spanish Presidency – and President Aznar was able to say this in this House – treats the fight against terrorism as its main priority. In these circumstances, there is no need to stress why Spain is morally obliged to place the fight against terrorism at the forefront of its Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">We have given the subject much consideration together with our defence colleagues in the European Union and we agree that the fight against terrorism should not fall within the Petersberg tasks, as I previously anticipated. We also agree that the fight against internal terrorism in the Union should correspond to the Rule of Law by means of its normal procedures, by means of courts of law and State security forces, but we could not remain passive in terms of the defence of our citizens in the face of possible terrorist attacks from outside the Union, which would undoubtedly require these common military capabilities we are trying to create. I am referring to our capabilities to tackle arms of mass destruction, NBC – nuclear, bacteriological or chemical – and also to our intelligence capabilities, the ability of our forces to protect themselves during missions and, finally, our capability to protect what has come to be known as the common space or European single sky. These capabilities, these tasks, make up the considerations and the basic approaches of a document being prepared by the Spanish Presidency to submit to the Seville European Council, where we hope it will be approved and for which we would also like the support, as for everything I have mentioned, of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you very much, Mr President.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Brok (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks for this debate, especially as we are also celebrating a premiere in the debate being opened by the Defence Minister of the Spanish Presidency. I think this is a positive message, one that we receive as such and for which we are grateful. Mr President-in-Office, I also think you were right in what you said at the end about terrorism and what Spain is quite rightly trying to do about it. Looking, though, at the post-11 September political landscape, I feel that here too we may have taken a lot of decisions and discussed a lot of things, but that a lot of momentum has been lost in the national ministerial machinery as regards the actual implementation of this campaign against terrorism and the clarification of the issues on the interface between external and internal security.</p>
<p class="contents">In this very week just past, the European Mission in the Middle East has shown us how little political influence we have. One reason for our lack of influence is that, alongside our great efforts on the foreign aid front – the European Union gives three times as much in overseas aid as the United States of America – and despite our growing involvement in the field of civil crisis management, we are still not in a position to give real security guarantees because our military capacity is still far from sufficiently developed. </p>
<p class="contents">The decisions we have made in recent years, ranging from the Treaty of Amsterdam by way of Cologne to the present day, were outstanding, but their implementation is still, in many areas, deplorable in the extreme. Following as I do the debates in some of our Member States on the A 400 M cargo aircraft, they indicate to me that the objective may well be in view and figures are perhaps provided, but the actual implementation and equipment are inadequate and too slow; hence we play a small role because we are not taken seriously, because we cannot really deliver, and because things are not being implemented as they should be.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings us, of necessity, to the institutional issues. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I disagree with your statement that this is an exclusively intergovernmental function. Overseas aid and civil crisis management are to a large extent a matter for the first pillar and their financing should be handled via the Budget. It is not solely and exclusively an intergovernmental function, but a combined one, and, seeing that its weaknesses are on the intergovernmental side, we therefore think that the Convention must make improvements and come to final decisions notwithstanding the need to allow for issues of national sovereignty, which play a role in this issue. We cannot, with Brussels, come to majority decisions to the effect that the soldiers of every EU country are to go to war. The national parliaments have important things to say about this.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet we must, for example, get the idea of enhanced cooperation accepted, in order to bring into being a coalition of the willing. In Nice, we achieved this everywhere except in the area of defence policy, just where we needed it most. In Nice, this was, alas, prevented; we must make the decisive breakthrough now. We want, clearly, to do this jointly with our partners in NATO, which is indispensable to collective security. We also have to organise European security and defence policy in such a way that those NATO states that are not in the EU do not feel themselves excluded. An intensive dialogue must take place, and hence I also think it right that we should find a solution with Turkey so that there is a proper process of consultation if something happens in Turkey's vicinity. In this sense, it is to be hoped that the agreements, which we have unfortunately not had officially submitted to us, represent steps in the right direction. The Council, though, must take up a clear position, so that the European Union's autonomous right of decision as such is not thereby jeopardised. Perhaps this will be supplied in the course of this debate, and we will thereby become more secure in our position on this issue. </p>
<p class="contents">We must recognise that we agree on many things, but not on how they are to be implemented. This is true also of arms policy. We see how there is an ever-growing technological gap between Europeans and the USA, and that we are no longer able to really wage war together, because the technological differences have become so massive. This has catastrophic consequences, not only for our defence policy capacity, but also in terms of industrial policy, which makes it also an issue for Europe's internal market. I am glad to see Commissioner Liikanen here with Commissioner Patten. I can well imagine that this interface with industrial and arms policy will mean that the European Research Framework Programme for Joint Projects could increasingly be used in the field of military research. Perhaps consideration could be given to how this might be done and to how resources can be pooled in acquiring equipment. There are certain things that we can acquire jointly – transport capacity is one example – in order to synergise on that basis in maintenance, acquisitions and much else, thus achieving more reasonable costs. We spend 60% of what the United States does on military requirements, but with 10% of the outcome that they achieve. This obviously has to do with us being organised in the wrong way. This means, if our budget resources really are tight even at a European and national level, that it must surely be possible for us to organise ourselves in such a way – that is, on Community lines – as to do what has to be done and achieve the desired effects in our common interest.</p>
<p class="contents">This naturally involves the arms exports issue and the clarification of European competences in order to remove the lack of uniformity in the code of conduct. The European Union must get better at protecting its interests, including the military ones, and also in order to secure peace. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I agree with you, and believe that the example you have given is a very good one, that a community with a common currency also has common interests in security policy. This is a reason why we must reach the point where, in a European Union with an internal common market, a common currency and a common legal system, we no longer have areas with a lower standard of security. We must enforce a common standard of security. I wish to express my gratitude for our being permitted to advance this in a cooperative process.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, Minister, let me first thank Parliament for giving the Commission this opportunity to debate the vital matters covered by these motions, and let me also thank the Council presidency for the contribution it has just made through the Spanish Minister of Defence, who made an extremely interesting and important speech. I particularly endorse all that he said in his closing remarks about terrorism and the importance of giving terrorism the priority which it deserves to be given by pluralist democracies. Some Member States have a particular concern about defeating terrorism in all its manifestations.</p>
<p class="contents">As you said, Mr President, my colleague Mr Liikanen will intervene in a moment on defence trade and production issues but let me say something about the Commission’s overall approach to security and defence.</p>
<p class="contents">I start from the extremely strong conviction that it is not possible to divide foreign policy neatly into civil matters on the one hand, and military and defence issues on the other, as if they were unrelated and as if they could be handled without reference to one another. The European Security and Defence Policy is an integral part of the common foreign and security policy. The Treaty requires that the Commission should be fully associated with that policy. The Commission has no direct role in military aspects, which are themselves limited by the Treaty to the so-called Petersberg tasks. But in practice our full association with the common foreign and security policy means that we are closely involved in the policy as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">That is as it should be – because a coherent overall European security, conflict prevention and crisis management policy is bound to embrace both civil and military matters, and this is a point to which I want to return at the end of my remarks.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has international relationships and programmes in many fields covering, for example, energy, environment, economic cooperation, human rights, justice and home affairs, external assistance programmes and so on. It may be that, in a crisis, initiatives are taken which also involve military deployments, or have other defence implications. But in that case the military element is one strand in what must be a seamless and integrated European policy towards the country or region in question.</p>
<p class="contents">Take the example of the Western Balkans which we have debated so often in this Chamber. After a long period of bloodshed and inter-ethnic strife culminating in the successful military campaign to halt ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, the European Union launched a concerted effort to restore stability and to bring about thoroughgoing political and economic reform in the region. We have created a framework of Stabilisation and Association Agreements to encourage regional integration and to give these countries a long-term political perspective of European Union membership. We are managing a key part of the UN Mission in Kosovo. We also took initiatives such as the Energy for Democracy programme in Serbia, which had explicitly political, as well as economic and humanitarian objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">All these have been elements – and important elements – of an integrated European security and conflict prevention policy in the region. The European Commission continues to play a central part in the conception and execution of that policy. But the EU’s policy in the region has also involved military deployments – for example in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, where NATO deployed overwhelmingly European forces in support of a political settlement at a time of rising inter-ethnic tension and violence. The deployment had to be closely co-ordinated with what the European Union was already doing. Mr Solana and I were directly involved in mediation at the time the force went in, as Parliament knows. The Commission supported the political purposes of the military deployment through its Rapid Reaction Mechanism, helping to restore confidence in the region and to reduce inter-ethnic tension through an emergency house-reconstruction programme and through other measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, at the European Council in Barcelona, heads of government have expressed the European Union’s availability to take responsibility for a follow-on military operation, if certain conditions can be fulfilled, including permanent arrangements on European Union-NATO cooperation. The Commission is not directly involved in that decision, which touches upon the physical security of national military personnel deployed in the region – nor do we seek direct involvement. But, again, we must be associated in so far as this will add value to the European Union’s overall effort. We need to be able to make our voice heard because, as I have said, military decisions also have implications for the European Union's comprehensive security policy in the wider sense, as I have described it.</p>
<p class="contents">The linkages between defence and military aspects of CFSP, and the more traditional areas of Community concern, are complex and often politically sensitive. The European Commission stands ready to play its part in using the potential of the Treaty to help to develop a strong, efficient and viable European armaments industry. It is clear from the motions before us today that this is as the European Parliament would wish. Most Members of this House, for example, would support the Commission’s initiative to launch the Advisory Group on Aerospace – or STAR 21 as it is known – to consider the strategic challenges faced by the European Union in that crucial sector. We welcome the participation in that Group of Carlos Westendorp, Chairman of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, and of Karl von Wogau.</p>
<p class="contents">We are ready to play our part as I say. But we need to proceed in such matters in close cooperation with Member States who retain national responsibility for many of the policies involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The linkages between civil and military concerns, and between European Union and national responsibilities, in the conduct of an integrated security and crisis management policy are still being thought through. Yet the necessary institutional machinery is starting to take shape – in the Political and Security Committee, for example, and in the bodies that advise it, including the Military Committee, the Politico-Military Group and the Committee for Civilian Aspects of Crisis Management. I am working with Mr Solana to define the potential and the limits of our respective roles and responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not always easy. There are unresolved questions, for example, about the financing of the common foreign and security policy, whether for actions funded out of the Community budget, or for expenditure with military or defence implications, which must always be charged to Member States. The European Union needs mechanisms that will give it greater budgetary flexibility in the conduct of foreign policy, and will enable it to deploy funds more quickly in times of crisis. We have put forward some Community budget proposals to that end. But in the search for greater flexibility we must not create parallel structures in the common foreign and security policy which escape proper parliamentary scrutiny and financial control through the Court of Auditors – or which encroach upon matters of Community competence.</p>
<p class="contents">These problems are not insoluble. We have agreed arrangements for the EU Policing Mission in Bosnia, for example, which tread a careful path between the competing concerns. But we must continue to proceed with sensitivity – and that applies as well in the area of defence-related industries which my colleague, Mr Liikanen, is about to address.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make one final point and I am provoked – or encouraged – to do so by the interesting remarks made by Mr Brok. Mr Brok quite understandably said that we needed to be able to demonstrate how serious we are about Europe's security. He spoke about expenditure on defence and expenditure on defence equipment. These are extremely dangerous waters – shark-filled waters – for a Commissioner to seek to swim in. The Commission is not a 16th Member State; it does not have its own taxpayers responsible for electing it or discharging it. I read about the important debate as to whether Europe should spend more on precision-guided missiles, on special forces, on air-lift capacity, on military telecommunications. It seems to me that a very strong intellectual and political case is made that unless we are prepared to spend more in these areas, the consequences on the trans-Atlantic alliance in terms of the difference in technological capacity are bound, in due course, to be destabilising. But I do not want to enter any further into that debate, I just want to make one very important, realistic point.</p>
<p class="contents">The President of the United States has just asked for a 14% increase in defence spending – an increase of USD 48 billion in the United States defence budget. I would like to know whether there is anybody in this Parliament who is a member of a political party which would be able to get elected, advocating in Europe a 14% increase in defence spending, while at the same time health and education spending are cut. Hands up!</p>
<p class="contents">I just want to make the point that we should be realistic. We should not allow the gap between our rhetoric and what we are actually prepared to argue for as politicians to open up too widely. And we should recognise the extremely important contribution we make to all those other aspects of security which, for example, we were talking about at Monterrey a few weeks ago under the aegis of the United Nations. It is not irrelevant to security to engage at the moment in what some people rather sneeringly call social work in Afghanistan. If social work in Afghanistan makes it unnecessary for us to be militarily involved in Afghanistan again in five or ten years' time, then that seems to be to be a very good investment in the security of the European Union and the region and the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope we can be realistic in our assessments of security and realistic about the best ways in which Europe can actually contribute to greater security around the world, with the wholehearted endorsement of those who vote for you, if not for me.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, as mentioned in the question put by Mr Brok, the Commission communication of December 1997, 'implementing the strategy of the Union's defence-related industries', regulated an ambitious overall approach. It contained a draft Council common position relating to the development of a European armaments policy and an action plan of 14 points for the defence-related industries. Among the 14 items of the action plan, some of these measures require legislation, while others can be carried out using instruments already available to the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">A good deal of progress has been made with regard to most of the actions, in fact with 11 out of a total of 14. However, until recently, Council discussions have generally been characterised by differences of opinion between the Member States preventing the adoption of a common position on the framing of a European armaments policy. This made progress especially difficult with regard to measures requiring legislative action such as the action plan items on customs duties and intra-Community transfers. I would like to underline today, however, that the Commission has begun infringement proceedings against 10 Member States on the question of the proper application of the Common Customs Tariff on military and non-military goods. This action may serve to reactivate discussions on the issue. Furthermore, as regards the intra-Community transfers of these goods, work on trying to find appropriate technical solutions continues and some progress has been made.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the difficulties in moving forward on some of these critical issues as rapidly as we had hoped, I would like to stress that the analysis advocating a need for re-structuring the European defence industry and for creating a single market for defence products is as valid as ever. It is even more pertinent for at least two reasons. They are: firstly, the development of the European security policy and defence policy and secondly, the constitution of trans-national defence companies. The competitiveness of the European defence industry is vital to the credibility of the nascent European security and defence policy. Thus, the Commission expects that governments increasingly recognise the urgency for a change in attitudes in order to end policies and practices that prevent European defence companies from working together more efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">Such a change in the position of the Member States might allow the Commission to contribute more effectively to the creation of the European defence equipment market through exercising its competence, and to Community policies such as the creation of the single market in defence, external trade etc. Thus, the Commission intends – and that was the question to which I replied positively, Mr Brok – to re-examine and update the action plan in order to take into account any new developments.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition the Commission is pursuing the objective of promoting the greater competitiveness of Europe's defence industry in close cooperation with national authorities and industry representatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Brok also mentioned the question of standardisation. An important initiative in this context is our efforts aimed at promoting awareness of the importance of standardisation issues for the efficiency and the competitiveness of the European defence industries, and of investigating options and possible start-up actions for defence standards reform. On this occasion, the European standardisation organisation CEN was identified as the ideal forum to implement this effort in the form of a handbook of defence standards and procedures which, when in place, will offer more transparency, improving inter-operability, harmonisation requirements and cost-efficiency in procurement.</p>
<p class="contents">In the foreseeable future, two ongoing processes make us feel confident that efficient solutions may finally be within reach. They are: progress on ESDP paving the way for harmonising the demand in Europe for defence equipment and, in parallel, the gradual recognition of the need to harmonise the rules and regulations which affect the competitiveness of the industries once restructured.</p>
<p class="contents">As Commissioner Patten mentioned, these developments are acknowledged in the STAR 21 initiative: the strategic aerospace review for 21st century currently in progress. STAR 21 aims to broaden the understanding of aerospace-related issues in Europe and trigger the action which will ensure that Europe's aerospace industry can play a full part in Europe's future. This initiative brings together senior representatives from industry with the Commission, the Council and also with the European Parliament as was mentioned here today, with the participation of Mr von Wogau and of Mr Westendorp y Cabeza, Chairman of the Committee on Industry.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this report, which we will present in July, will give a further push to our efforts to have a strong competitive European defence industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are also grounds, however, to believe that much remains to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I believe the United States is enjoying an unprecedented political and military hegemony. If we consider that today the United States represents about 4% of the world’s population – and I say this with admiration – and are capable of producing 30% of goods and services; that China, with five times the area and with a much larger population is only capable of producing 3%; if we consider that Russia’s production levels have fallen below those of Switzerland and if we remember the military budget figures given here, we can see clearly that all this is highly disproportionate.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, representatives of the Commission, I would like to ask a question which refers rather more to the future. I would like to know whether, if this Convention, which is working on the future of Europe, eventually creates a constitutional treaty, what place would defence policy have in that treaty and, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, whether it would be political fiction to imagine a security and defence policy – as Commissioner Patten said a moment ago – incorporated into the first pillar, which went further than conflict prevention and crisis management and could lead to Europe having more influence on the international stage in line with its economic, financial and industrial power.</p>
<p class="contents">The President-in-Office of the Council has referred to the fight against terrorism and it is clear that when freedom was attacked with the barbarity of 11 September it was perfectly demonstrated that in today’s globalised landscape concepts of security, defence, diplomacy, trade, culture and religion are all interrelated and that this should be translated into a common awareness that, since the phenomenon of terrorism affects all of us equally, there must be a response that comes from all of us equally.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that it is essential that we accept the views expressed here on the normal elements of the Rule of Law in the fight against terrorism and the need to coordinate the information instruments we have as well as the instruments for fighting the threat of the NBC warfare.</p>
<p class="contents">A final word, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, with regard to the observations which have been made here and which have been brilliantly laid out by Mr Patten, because, when we move from the demands of humanism to figures, it is rather as if we were moving on from the Beatitudes to the accounts books. I believe we must realise that, if we want a defence policy, we have to pay for it and that it is important to reconcile, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the desire of public opinion for the European Union to be present on the international stage with the need not to take on too much expenditure, which is apparently not very popular amongst our public opinion. It is therefore important – and I will end here, Mr President – not to confuse the adjective with the noun and the peripheral with the fundamental. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Good intentions are being translated into increasingly concrete activities, and the development of the rapid reaction force is progressing at a steady pace. Hopefully it will be possible to deploy this force for the first time in Macedonia. Despite everything, however, even the bringing together of a force of approximately 2 000 troops remains an arduous task which the European Union cannot yet achieve without NATO, something which brings with it the necessary problems. In itself, cooperation with NATO is to be welcomed, because it allows us to be operational more quickly, but it is also a complicating factor, as is evident from the talks with Turkey. In the longer term, the European Union must strive towards total autonomy where the deployment of the rapid reaction force is concerned. The so far non-existent military capacity must therefore be developed as a matter of urgency. The European Union is not NATO, and NATO is not the United Nations. We must not switch roles. It is not the EU’s ambition to be a collective defence organisation. The EU is not a military superpower, and puts the emphasis first and foremost on a multilateral approach to international problems via the UN and other international organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently, striking discrepancies between the European Union and the US have come to light. These are mainly due to differing views on security. The common foreign and security policy is, in fact, the manifestation of Europe’s history over the past 100 years. The cooperation model is paramount. Far less emphasis is placed on the military instrument than is the case in the United States, and this is not simply due to the lack of military superpower status. We have recognised the relative value of the instrument, and are therefore placing far more emphasis on the use of civil means, including diplomacy and economic cooperation. Not for nothing have conflict prevention and conflict solution become mainstays of our policy. The enlargement of the European Union, but also the Balkans policy, are illustrations of this. However, it also explains the renewed focus on fighting poverty, and not simply as a result of 11 September. Such policy is inherently multilateral and also explains why we react to Sharon’s military approach with such horror. We know from personal, painful experience that problems only escalate as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">The US sees things differently in many cases. Having military power and its possible use are paramount. If necessary, we will go it alone, we hear them say. This is illustrated by the US’ views on arms control, or the threatening language in the direction of Iraq. Needless to say, we support the desire to stop the distribution of weapons of mass destruction, first of all in Iraq. This is what we have the United Nations for, and the EU must help make a policy possible. We should certainly not exclude force, but violence is not the obvious choice. A kind of artificial distribution of tasks has taken place between the European Union and the United States. They use their military power, and often determine policy in this way, while the European Union often ends up picking up the pieces; at least, this is often how it appears. This is untenable in the long run. To us, civil power is more important than military power, and this should become the core of the transatlantic dialogue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, this is still not the case. Its own inability leads to frustration and even to open humiliation, as we have seen in the recent mission to Israel, for example. The political price that has to be paid for more effective policy is a reduction in the amount of say that individual nations have for the sake of greater European unity. Decisive foreign policy cannot only be based on economic clout and generosity with euros. The Middle East conflict proves how limited the influence of Israel’s key trading partner and the largest provider of aid to the Palestinians actually is. Without the development of credible European defence, Europe remains a yapping puppy that is allowed to frolic alongside the American bulldog. In this context, the rapid reaction force is a necessary precondition, but it is not meeting the mark by a long shot with regard to all the Petersberg tasks and the fight against terrorism. Europe continues to lag behind in comparison with American military power, and we will not be able to catch up without a substantial increase in defence expenditure. And if we do not want this for political reasons, then fine, we should also accept the consequences. It is high time the rapid reaction force became operational. As it happens, a sound draft about cooperation between the European Union and NATO, which Turkey can endorse, is ready in Macedonia. Unfortunately, Greece continues to throw spanners in the works. In any event, Europe will remain autonomous in its decision-making. Unless we standardise and rationalise our resources, a European defence will never get off the ground. National egotism and commercial interests have for too long got in the way of creating a defence industry. If Europe is not prepared to pay the political and financial price for credible defence, it should stop complaining about its trivial role in the world, otherwise we will continue to yap without being heard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We in Parliament have now got used to the presence of an ex-general, namely our fellow MEP Mr Morillon, but to my knowledge this is the first time that we in this House are addressing true generals – high-ranking military, I assume. Gentlemen, a warm welcome to you. However, I should like to emphasise that security for the European Union is not only – not even primarily – military security. The civil aspects of security – the Commissioner was right to make reference to this – have once again secured victory for the European Union in Macedonia. This had nothing to do with military strength – or even yapping, Mr Van den Bos. It was about a good mix of civil and military elements. This explains the European Union’s success in Macedonia, and I should like to continue on that path.</p>
<p class="contents">Talking of Macedonia, we all know that the European Union would like to undertake its first major action in that country. This receives my unqualified support, but we also realise that there are still major problems with regard to the necessary cooperation, this time between the European Union and NATO. We know that a deal has been struck between the United Kingdom and Turkey, albeit not the most elegant of deals, while Greece is currently the only country to be obstructive. I should therefore like to make an urgent appeal to the Council, the President-in-Office of the Council, to make every effort in the foreseeable future to ensure that a first practice run does not end in a first major disaster. I repeat, the agreement that has been struck is not the most elegant of settlements, but the Greeks must be persuaded to sign up, because it would indeed be a disaster if internal division prevented us from taking our first action.</p>
<p class="contents">My final remark concerns the importance of common European plans where defence investments are concerned. At the moment, we in the Netherlands are facing the problems that arise when an individual Member State needs to make large investments in new military equipment. In the case of the Netherlands, these investments concern the successor of the F16. It is turning out to be almost impossible to make a well-considered decision in this area. And I am not referring to the American and European preference of aircraft. Cooperation is needed at European level, otherwise we will be investing in equipment which we have had for a long time, and when the chips are down we will have insufficient funding to invest in equipment that we really need. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that, when building Europe as a hopeful and exciting project, it is essential to recognise the need for a security and defence dimension. However, there are three aspects which I do not agree with and which may be crucial:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I believe we should move towards a concept of defence based on shared security: for example, it is true that we have to respond to terrorism, but a military response is not sufficient unless it is based on law – in this case, international law – and on the elimination of the causes of barbaric acts such as the events of 11 September. It is therefore essential that the concept of shared security is a fundamental element in this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I believe it is a mistake to focus our attention on treating NATO as an umbrella to protect us, and also on the special cooperation with the United States. I believe that that approach hinders and slows down our ability to develop the autonomous, independent and effective security and defence policy that Europe needs.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a third aspect: the role to be played, now and in the future, by the European Union in terms of defence and security, which should be the promotion of peace, the promotion of different relations in the world, and therefore the consideration of the United Nations and international law as the only references for the actions of the European Union. In fact, this aspect has either been ignored or not taken sufficiently into account by the President-in-Office of the Council and I believe that it should be taken up, since I believe it would be a mistake for us not to base our actions on international law and legality. This is precisely one of the most necessary aspects at the current time in order to introduce sanity, rationality and a notion of solidarity into the situation in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, in view of the instruments we would need, the concept of the OSCE should be recovered in order to guarantee security in Europe and we should focus all our attention on what Commissioner Patten and other speakers have mentioned: the need to remove the current budgetary ceiling, because it is impossible to make sufficient progress in relation to the defence industry and coordination and cooperation with the miserly budgets laid down by the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to mention the importance of parliamentary democratic control, both by the European Parliament and by the various national parliaments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Where Europe is concerned, these matters are, as we all know, regulated by the revised Treaty of Brussels under the so-called ‘left-over’ functions of the Western European Union. It should be added that, since 11 September, we have all been more keenly aware that a new definition of defence is needed, one which combines internal and external security. We must now find a way of dealing with enemies who, despite not having armies, manage to threaten the security of countries and of citizens and against the attacks of which traditional armies are insufficient defence. </p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, in the globalised world in which we live, politics, diplomacy, information, internal security and defence complement one another to respond to these new types of threat. Security has become a global and indivisible concept, quite different from traditional concepts. The obligation of the European Union and its Member States is, therefore, to rationalise their military and arms production capacities and to strengthen their resources for diplomatic cooperation, information services and also judicial and police cooperation in a genuine synergy of national and transnational policies. Where relations with the Atlantic alliance are concerned, we feel that efforts to develop a common security and defence policy must be viewed in terms of our partnership with NATO. The strength of European security and defence policy lies precisely in its cooperation with NATO and not in the dangerous and pointless temptation to compete with that organisation in any way.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a word on the parliamentary monitoring of the CFSP, which, as is well-known, is performed at two levels: the European level, which is overseen by the European Parliament, which deals with the prevention and civilian management of crises, and the national level, which deals with military crisis management. This type of monitoring is carried out by national parliaments. This issue was the subject of a recent debate and statement in this House. It is, therefore, entirely appropriate to call for the establishment of closer relations and for a greater exchange of information between the European Parliament and the national parliaments on issues involving the CFSP as a means of enabling the various parliamentary bodies to undertake democratic monitoring in a more appropriate and more suitable way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are no practical reasons to justify the EU’s now wanting to have these resources at its disposal. Cross-border crime could be combated through Interpol. Instead, Europol is to be the launch pad for a European FBI. The essence of currency union is not a common coinage for international trade, but the ban on national currencies which will lead to common economic government. Moreover, the purpose of the Rapid Reaction Force is not just that of peace-keeping, for that can be done through the UN and the OSCE. The ill-concealed agenda is the desire for a common EU military which in time will be able to supersede NATO. The EU is to be a state with a common police force, currency and military.</p>
<p class="contents">My group has another vision for Europe. We want a Europe of democracies in which independent countries cooperate on everything we cannot manage individually, but we do not want to see the EU developed into a new superpower with a superpower-style military. The EU is the world’s strongest trading block. It includes powerful countries which have been colonial powers in the past. It is not certain that people elsewhere in the world see us in terms as peaceful as those in which we see ourselves. For the sake of peace too, it is better that we be satisfied with the UN, the OSCE and NATO instead of constructing a new military power. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The sad fact that we must face is that, despite some positive signs, such as the decisions to establish the GALILEO satellite navigation system and to build the A 400 M military transport aircraft by 2008, following prolonged and arduous negotiations, we are not succeeding in providing European defence policy with a definite structure and we usually fail to get beyond semantics or comitology.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason why European defence policy is not going well is because we are not clearly applying the method of variable geometry, which would enable the Member States that are determined to take action to define some common strategic interests and thus identify the resources to use.</p>
<p class="contents">Since we are using the wrong method, we still do not have the essential elements to meet our common defence needs. We still do not have a European armaments agency. At the very time when combat air fleets are due to be replaced throughout the world, we in Europe are going to tackle this crucial problem in difficult conditions and in a disorganised fashion, unlike our determined and innovative American rivals. We have no anti-missile defence programme: we should be developing a European policy in this area instead of condemning the American project. Lastly, defence expenditure is falling throughout Europe, with the exception of the United Kingdom. Over the last ten years, most of our governments have used defence budgets as an adjustment variable, and the decline in both the amounts and the proportions spent is astonishing.</p>
<p class="contents">The shock of the events of 11 September and the realisation of having to engage in a now ongoing battle against terrorism have not provoked European leaders into taking the necessary action – which is strange, as we are all exposed to the same level of risk. It is high time, however, that we stopped using, once and for all, the misleading rhetoric of peace dividends. In order to respond to these new threats, our countries must make a substantial increase in their defence spending. The task will be even more difficult because we in Europe have become used to certain facilities; we need courageous politicians to fulfil this task. It may be worthwhile to stress this at a time when election campaigns are underway in many of our Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union, which did not play a part in resolving the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, was incapable of speaking with a single voice on this matter and engaged in a war in Kosovo which proved that it could not manage without American resources in a number of essential areas, is now absent from the international stage in Afghanistan and in the Middle East. This is because it was unable, in such a short timescale, to overcome its major shortcomings and, above all, did not have the necessary will to provide itself with the resources required.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Patten, we shall not be asking for a 14% increase in spending, but it has already been two years since Parliament adopted the own-initiative report on defence by our fellow Member, Mrs Lalumière, and since it approved a crucial paragraph urging the Member States’ governments not to rule out, a priori, the possibility of increasing budgetary appropriations, given the need for such a measure to ensure the credibility of the Union. We must recognise that this request is a dead letter and that, with the notable exception of the United Kingdom, European leaders have imperturbably continued to decrease defence spending on a regular basis, thus stripping their declared will of all credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the considerable effort made by the United States following the shocking events of 11 September, the European Union is now faced with its responsibilities: either it agrees to let its American counterpart deal with the military problems on its own and takes upon itself to continue to manage the peace problems, more or less in conjunction with the US, thus playing, Mr Wiersma, Mr Lagendijk and Mr Bonde, the role of the Athenians in ancient Rome. Or it decides, at last, not only to spend better by making a joint effort instead of the dispersed efforts made so far, but yes, Commissioner Patten, to spend more. By again proposing this difficult decision, I think it is worthwhile to reiterate that defence technologies developed today still have two purposes and that they will, therefore, have an impact on all the civilian and military capabilities of the European industry. Yes, we must prioritise the construction of a legitimate European defence industry which should, initially, as you said, Commissioner and Mr President-in-Office of the Council, be given a single European budget dedicated solely to research and development. What do you think, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, of the proposal put forward by Mr Bayrou, who is a candidate in the French presidential elections, of making contributions to this budget which are limited to 0.5% of the GNP of each Member State, with immediate effect? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, what we can have is much more efficient and effective defence expenditure. In Kosovo we learned that while we spend 60% of what the Americans spend, we only get 10% of their power projection. I, as a taxpayer, would like to know what are we spending our money on in that case. The answer to that is: waste, inefficiency and duplication, and that is the issue we have to address. It is the Commission's job to drive that forward. In the 1996 and 1997 communications the Commission seemed to be willing to do that. But where the Santer Commission was prepared to go where angels feared to tread, this Commission has been cowering behind its barricades, frightened to take on the Member States on this issue and, in so doing, failing in its responsibilities to defend the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Could Commissioner Liikanen confirm for me that the Court of Justice decisions C-70/94 and C-83/94 give the Commission the power to challenge Member States on their interpretation of Article 296, which they have taken as a carte blanche, which is not what the Treaty of Rome intends? We want the Commission to move forward. I welcome what Commissioner Liikanen has said, but I want to see more rapid progress. We cannot send our troops into action unless we have the capability to support them.</p>
<p class="contents">As George Robertson has said, being ready for battle is like pregnancy: you either are or you are not! You cannot proceed on the basis, as the Spanish Defence Minister has said, that we are addressing a third of our capability requirements. Why only a third? We have to address them all if we are serious about a European defence identity. So I want to see this agenda being driven forward. We need somebody with responsibility. In football terms, we need a Roy Keane to move this agenda forward to ensure that we have the capabilities we need. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What puzzles me is what exactly is the status of the draft agreement brokered between Britain, the US and Turkey, between the European Union and the non-European Union NATO European members? Despite the fact that the draft agreement remains fairly secretive, I read it with great care. It seems to me that it represents faithfully the conclusions of the Nice European Council, that the security interests not only of the European Union but also of Turkey should be guaranteed by the operation of the rapid reaction force. The draft agreement allows for the Council to decide to invite Turkey to play a part where NATO facilities are not required. That does not seem to me to represent a threat to the autonomy of the European Union. I should be most grateful for a clear explanation of precisely what the problem is inside the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On 15 January 2001, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling for a moratorium on the use of these weapons and munitions. More recently, on 27 March 2002, the United Nations Environment Programme published the results of a study on six sites in Serbia and Montenegro that had been affected by the use of depleted uranium munitions during the Balkans War of 1999. The study confirmed that five of the six sites concerned were contaminated; in two of the sites, particles of depleted uranium were detected in the region’s air. The results of the measures show that dust particles of depleted uranium have been widely dispersed in the environment as a result of the impact from these munitions.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the United Nations Environment Programme considers the level of radioactive pollution to be low, the fact remains that this pollution confirms the risks of using depleted uranium arms and munitions for soldiers, of course, but also for the civilian population and certainly for several future generations.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, although there is no official information to confirm this, there are many elements to support the theory that a large part of Afghanistan, which was heavily bombed, has been contaminated by depleted uranium. These include the statement issued by the US Secretary of State, Donald Rumsfeld, which mentions a contaminated site, the concern expressed by scientists in Pakistan and, more importantly, the confirmation of the use of guided missiles with extremely dense metal warheads, which are most likely made of depleted uranium.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the information at our disposal, the United Nations Environment Programme is due to begin a study on the impact of war on the environment in the coming weeks. I still have some questions, however, that I would like to put to the Council. Does the Council envisage taking any particular measures to protect troops and humanitarian missions on the ground in Afghanistan? What is the Council’s view of the long-term use of these weapons and arms, when it is aware that these weapons are used indiscriminately and affect both the civilian population and soldiers? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Two separate resolutions may be before us, but the link that is being sustained between them is an artificial one.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to see both topics separated from one another. Sensible things can be said about the defence policy in the context of the European Union. The coordination of national defence efforts, preferably within the larger framework of NATO, can do no harm. Member States do remain ultimately responsible, though.</p>
<p class="contents">However, European defence policy is subject to agreement on a strategic concept. And in my view, this is not about setting headline goals and outlining vague scenarios. What does Europe actually want from its defence policy? What are the concrete threats and how do we give an appropriate response? To this day, the Council has failed to come up with a unanimous answer.</p>
<p class="contents">It does not seem judicious to me to conclude agreements about the defence industry at European level. The argument that this would benefit European security and defence policy cuts no ice. It seems as if this is purely about the interests of large industries. In practice, defence material is often produced by joint ventures which transcend European borders.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, European industry is hardly unanimous at the moment. The interests of the individual Member States weigh heavily. In general, European projects do not run smoothly. The question therefore arises as to what would ultimately be of more benefit to our – currently very limited – military capacity: European materiel or other materiel? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every military conflict has a history. For example, we should not forget that the Taliban regime in Afghanistan was supported and promoted by multinational oil interests, which is no secret.</p>
<p class="contents">Back at that stage the dangers that could result from support of that kind should have been pointed out. The United States is now threatening to attack Iraq and possibly even other states such as Iran and North Korea; that is an incredibly dangerous game to play, and one that can easily get out of control. The European Union needs to play a stronger role than it has up to now as the guardian of international law, something that requires us to have a high degree of independence and the courage of our convictions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should remind ourselves that the founding fathers of the European Union did not create it because they wanted economic cooperation, but because its prime task was to ensure peace, so that there was a plan for a European defence policy as far back as the period between 1952 and 1954. It is a good thing that we are picking up where we left off then.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Patten has presented us with a challenge. He has asked us this question: would we be willing to demand that 14% should be spent on defence, as is the case in the United States? However, I would first like to make another demand, and that is the demand that the money we are already spending on defence should be spent more sensibly, instead of having 15 different policies in this area. We need to take advantage of the synergy that can be achieved if we work together in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">Part of this is that the rules of Europe's internal market need to be applied more in this field. There are some sensible exceptions here, but these exceptions are applied too widely, and we therefore need to make sure that these rules are applied more fully. For 15 different nations finally to work together implies a certain standardisation in this area, as otherwise there will be enormous problems of incompatibility. We have already developed standardisation procedures in the civilian world that could be helpful here, especially as regards dual use.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we should not lose sight of the fact that the most important pilot project in this field is the crisis management force agreed upon in Helsinki. The question is this: should the European Union actually take over the leading role in Macedonia in the foreseeable future? I believe that we need to consider that very carefully. We should not put the cart before the horse here. We should not let ourselves get into a situation in which we can be blackmailed by either side, because this first European intervention will be of the utmost importance for us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is now customary, with each presidency, for the Defence Minister to attend a parliamentary sitting. This marks real progress. I would also like to congratulate you on your effort to apply your slogan ‘<span class="italic">More Europe’</span> to the ESDP. In this respect, I would reiterate that the ESDP is very popular, since, according to the Eurobarometer surveys, more than 70% of European public opinion is demanding a European security and defence policy, on the condition that it is credible. I would also like to congratulate you on being ready to work on developing a Mediterranean dimension of the ESDP.</p>
<p class="contents">Along with these positive points, I would like to ask you two questions, the first of which is what is the Spanish Presidency doing to speed up the negotiations between the European Union and NATO, in order to overcome the resistance of some countries? You touched on this point, Minister. Could you elaborate on exactly what you have achieved so far? Equally, have you given any thought so far as to the future of NATO or as to what the effect of changes within NATO might be for our European security and defence policy, given the positions adopted recently by our American counterparts, the calls made by Russia and events since 11 September?</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to put my second question to both the Minister and the Commissioner. It relates to the consequences of 11 September, which concern both the civilian resources of the Commission and the military resources which are the Council’s responsibility. Minister, you mentioned the fight against terrorism, but you did not tackle the question whether our ESDP, as defined since Cologne and Helsinki, is adapted to this new fight. Can we count on our ESDP, not only to fulfil the Petersberg tasks, but also to combat terrorism? Should we not rethink our system, or at least certain aspects of our system and, if so, which ones? Is the Spanish Presidency prepared to consider this once more? It seems to me that this needs to be done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The defence industrial base is hugely important to the Union. For strategic military reasons of course but also for the advanced technology which can often be put to civilian use and for the contribution to local communities in terms of jobs, infrastructure and profit.

It was difficult for the outside world to take this in at the time. The wars in Yugoslavia ultimately proved this quite emphatically for everyone to see. High-ranking military representing more or less the entire European arm of NATO commented on television that the Yugoslav National Army, in a state of collapse, would prove invincible for us. This gave an extremely depressing insight into the extent of our capabilities as the European Union and as NATO’s European arm. Fortunately, we have learnt from experience. We have learnt to be ashamed of what has happened, and progress has quite clearly been made. We even have the courage to assume certain tasks ourselves and to take over certain tasks from the Americans. Mention is being made of Macedonia and a specific role for the European Union, specifically in Bosnia.</p>
<p class="contents">So progress is being made. The courage to promote military expenditure, however, is still lacking. As Mr Patten stated a moment ago, there may be widespread support in this Parliament for an increase in the defence budgets, but one has to be extremely good at reading between the lines to establish that this is the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Even more important is, in fact, the lack of return on our efforts. It was demonstrated a moment ago why that is. Many factors come into play: different lines of reasoning, national arguments of a less rational nature, the reputation of the speaker, the economic industrial benefits and all kinds of other arguments which play a role when we talk about defence efforts and procurement.</p>
<p class="contents">We have, in fact, a great need for European policy based on a clear vision. And this is very obvious to the population, as was evident from the figures brought by Mrs Lalumière, but as we heard a moment ago, this message is not all that popular yet in many regions. In my view, we must continue to drive the message home. National sovereignty is to be welcomed, provided that it serves public security. And if this is not possible with a pure and simple disregard for national sovereignty, we should learn to take a broader view. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One aspect of these relations is that ΝΑΤΟ is the collective security organisation on which Europe depends for its defence. European defence is not intended – nor is it able – to supplant ΝΑΤΟ in this role. That goes without saying.</p>
<p class="contents">Another aspect is that the European forces have no reason to acquire resources already supplied by ΝΑΤΟ, because we have no reason to duplicate costs. I am not sure if this second point has quite the same merit as the first. This view presupposes that there is a complete correlation and concurrence of opinion between the administration of European policy and the administration of NATO policy. We have no guarantee of any such complete concurrence. Of course, no one is contemplating opposition or hostility towards ΝΑΤΟ, but it only needs a minor disagreement for NATO to refuse its resources to the European forces.</p>
<p class="contents">A permanent agreement on the use of NATO resources by the European powers would of course be a step forward, but we all know that NATO itself is facing serious difficulties which we hope it will be able to overcome.</p>
<p class="contents">One speaker has said that Greece has to accept certain things. I am not sure what. The question of an independent European defence policy is not a local Greek problem and it would be ridiculous to assume that it is. There is much more at stake here; the credibility of this policy is at stake here and we all have a duty to defend it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that today’s debate may be a great help to the policy which the President-in-Office of the Council intends to pursue, because there is a slight discrepancy between his views and those of many of the participants: the President-in-Office of the Council has insisted on the intergovernmental nature of the defence policy and here – on the one hand Mr Brok and, on the other, various other Members such as Mr Titley, Mr Marset, Mr Morillon, etc., and Commissioners Patten and Liikanen – have indicated that there are elements for a European policy in the field of the arms industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 296 is a locked door which can be unlocked. There is a key; there is the possibility of implementing it: we already have case-law from the Court of Justice which opens up this possibility and I hope that the Council will consider the possibility of implementing Community law specifically on Community level, in addition to the actions carried out at government level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must confess frankly that I have been surprised by the degree of support from the European Parliament, which I imagine none of my Defence colleagues have enjoyed – given all the shades of opinion its legitimate plurality implies – for the European security and defence policy and the many possibilities and variations suggested in each and every intervention, and I thank you for them and have noted them very carefully.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that Mrs Lalumière is right when she says that we can forecast following this sitting, and the opinion polls she has mentioned – which basically agree with those in my country – a good future for the European security and defence policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to organise my replies according to whether they are considerations for the immediate future or those for the hopefully near, but rather more remote, future.</p>
<p class="contents">I was enormously interested in Commissioner Patten’s approach on the budgetary issues and also the reply he received, amongst others, from Mr Souchet. If only such things could be heard every day and in every parliament. We Defence Ministers of the Member States can only be grateful for any progress in the European Parliament and hope that it sets an example.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take up Mr von Wogau’s argument in relation to employing synergies. Ladies and gentlemen, it is not just a question of creating an additional budget within the Union. It is also a question of making an effort to harmonise our arms policies, because if we harmonise our requirements, programmes and management by means of a European agency which coordinates marketing and, of course, funding, we will be saving money. We will not just be increasing our efficiency, which is our obligation, but we will also be saving money. I confess that the gap that has been mentioned resulting from the 14% increase in the United States is unavoidable, but what can and must be avoided, are all those differences between our programmes, which must become common programmes. In fact, ladies and gentlemen, this does not hinder the SMEs, because every country has examples of small and medium-sized businesses being able to link their production to large programmes and to participate by means of their involvement with large European consortia, which are no doubt inevitably, and perhaps in a transatlantic sense, the future of companies. But I cannot go any further into this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I wanted to reassure Mr Marset in relation to the law. Our Union, if I may put it this way, is based on law. This has obviously been the concern of the Presidency in scheduling the Salamanca meeting. We believe it is essential, and no less urgent, that amongst all of us – and with the completely indispensable cooperation of this Parliament of course – we start creating this law for Petersberg tasks, which can be applied from the start of any mission.</p>
<p class="contents">You ask about relations with NATO. Mr Marset called into question the principle of subsidiarity, and this was taken up by Mr Katiforis. It is a fact that NATO is currently completely irreplaceable as an instrument for collective defence. Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot even talk about a European army for the moment. I am sure that, just as so far there has been agreement, there could be serious discrepancies. Today, the task of collective defence is conferred on NATO by means of the Washington Treaty. As Mr Duff pointed out in his speech, we have a vision which is complementary to the Atlantic Alliance, which does not prevent us – quite the opposite – from having to make progress on this European security and defence policy by increasing missions, integration, arms policy and institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Lalumière asks what changes are taking place within NATO following 11 September. I am obliged to speak very much in summary: firstly, constant meetings are taking place with Russia, which were unthinkable before 11 September. I must confirm here that without the cooperation of Russia, the operations carried out by the international coalition in Afghanistan would have been impossible and would not have achieved the results that some people say they have had in two months, although they are not yet over. Russia’s relations with the Atlantic Alliance are currently so excellent that it would be madness not to take this opportunity to establish stable mechanisms through the necessary institutional reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the enlargement of the Alliance, I believe that 11 September has left all of us with the feeling – certainly in the case of the Presidency and the Spanish Government – that enlargement should be oriented towards the ideological community rather than strict compliance with military requirements, because we have discovered that those common values we advocate and which are precisely those which underpin the European Union are not universally accepted, and they are at stake. Therefore, we must be particularly sensitive to those countries which have recently embraced democracy and the defence of those values and which wish to contribute to their common defence.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Patten pointed out firstly – and later many Members also pointed out – that the security and defence policy should be considered on an interpillar basis. Undoubtedly, I would like to say to Parliament – I did not do so before – that the Torrejón satellite centre, which has been incorporated into the context of the Western European Union, already has this status, and the Institute of Security Studies in Paris should also have it, and that, in fact, it is currently carrying out a study – promoted firstly by the Belgian Presidency and now by the Spanish Presidency – on the European Defence White Paper. This White Paper may be of great interest, since so far I believe we all agree on the same goal, but we have a different vision in relation to our understanding of what the objective of the European security and defence policy should be.</p>
<p class="contents">You spoke of the institutional reform which is being developed through the study of the PSC and the High Representative. I will end, Mr President, by making some brief comments in response to the questions by Mr Salafranca on what my strictly personal and humble vision may be of the near future of the European security and defence policy: firstly, the Convention must reconsider the institutional structure of this pillar, bearing in mind the interpillar aspect. Therefore, we will have to rethink the bodies whose nature has rapidly changed from transitional to permanent, but they will have to be reconsidered nonetheless. Secondly, missions. There is no doubt that we have to increase missions. In fact, the Seville Declaration that we prepared on the problem of terrorist attack from outside the Union only would mean an increase in Helsinki Petersberg tasks. We also have to think of strengthened cooperation mechanisms which have been mentioned here. In some countries we already have Eurofor, Euromarfor and certain other forms of cooperation under way in the amphibious field. And finally we will have to think – and why not? – of certain convergence criteria, which – although I am not the person to point out what they are – should prioritise quality over quantity and competition for certain requirements.</p>

More recently, and as I mentioned in my speech, the Commission is challenging 12 Member States over their misuse of Article 296 regarding customs duties on arms imports, preventing a common customs tariff from being implemented. The Commission will continue to follow this line.</p>

<p class="contents">Firstly, I must point out that the honourable Member’s information does not coincide with ours. According to my information, which should not be declassified at the moment, we can rest assured that ammunition containing depleted uranium has not been used in Afghanistan and this has also been indicated by the units with NBC detection equipment within Afghanistan itself, within the ISAF.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, and with regard to your question on what protection measures had been taken: apart from being supplied with NBC detection equipment, in the units which the various countries have deployed, either in Kabul, or – as in the Spanish case – in Bagram, the medical units observe very strict rules of conduct and carry out constant monitoring, both of this type of injury in terms of health, and of the risks resulting from the internal situation of the country and any resistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I must point out that the Belgian Presidency began a study, which is being continued by the Spanish Presidency, on the most appropriate measures for safeguarding the health of troops. And finally I must tell the honourable Member that the scientists who studied the problem in Spain – and they were independent academic and clinical scientists – guaranteed that no direct relationship between the use of depleted uranium and certain tumours observed amongst some combatants could be established. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
