<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sbarbati (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, it was with great pleasure that I agreed to be the rapporteur of this major European Parliament resolution which deals with one of the greatest problems of our European Community: the ageing of the population.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue requires considerable sensitivity on our part, and we must strive to create that intergenerational solidarity which is essential if we are to produce worthwhile, substantial holistic policies and bring about social security and social protection and, most importantly, to ensure that the idea that elderly people are not a burden on society becomes part of the cultural consciousness of society and that they are regarded as a resource: first and foremost a human resource but also a social resource, a cultural resource and, lastly, that it is recognised that the elderly have a great legacy of experience to pass on to future generations.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the factors that motivated the entire Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and I to develop this resolution and enabled us to approve the result unanimously. I therefore thank all my colleagues for their contributions, including those made at the amendments stage, and also the committee's experts, for these contributions were very valuable for the finalisation of the resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union took the problem on board in 1999, the year in which the United Nations proclaimed the International Year of Older Persons. We have now reached the stage of a Commission communication and are here today to vote upon a resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">This stage is extremely important. We feel that a policy which actively tackles the issue of ageing population, which regards the elderly not as people who are about to die but as people who want and intend to remain alive – alive in their affections, alive in their professional capacities, alive in the will to communicate at all levels not just their feelings but also their professionalism and their experience – is the best way to create and develop new policies, in particular to encourage social cohesion and intergenerational solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, there are complex issues to deal with: the issue of security, the issue of pensions and also the issue of care of the elderly which we have attempted to tackle, which I have attempted to deal with in this resolution as calmly and effectively as possible. We are all aware that families often have to bear the burden of caring for an elderly person and that this burden often falls upon women who have to bear it alone, moreover without any recognition from the social or employment policies of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States must therefore make greater efforts: they must unite and tackle this issue together. Above all, they must ensure that the future of the third and fourth ages is guaranteed. The future may consist of a single day, minute or second, but it must be a day, minute, or second which is lived in the knowledge that the life before an elderly person is a whole life, not half a life. An elderly person is a worker who has ceased to work, the elderly are men and women who have reached the point where they are navigating their way through the final stage of their lives and who must be able to do so with the necessary serenity and with the recognition from all of us but, most importantly, the recognition from the world of politics and authorities that they are people. This must not be forgotten.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the central theme of the resolution, which tackles different aspects of the issue ranging from leisure time to employment. In effect, when we talk of attitude, of learning and therefore of the willingness to be retrained and benefit from life-long training, we must ensure that this is a reality for the elderly as well, for older workers are often excluded from new working procedures and new technologies by technological progress. We therefore need extensive training to be available, non-discrimination in the workplace and non-discrimination during the time after retirement as well, when these workers, these people can enjoy the new wealth and new opportunities provided by all the time now available to them and live more serene lives.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we are moving in this direction and, in particular, why we are considering the older and very old people who, sadly, are liable to be affected by physical problems. Indeed, as we are aware, health does not last forever. The Member States must implement different policies to support these people, tackling both the issue of the care necessary and the issue of the reimbursement of expenses, especially for those invalids whose families are, in effect, unable to bear the whole of such a burden in the long term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This approach must include the guarantee of a dignified, independent, self-sufficient lifestyle.</p>
<p class="contents">This sort of strategy calls for well-coordinated objectives and is based on intergenerational solidarity, respect and recognition of the different roles which citizens play. The problem which arises and the political action which we need to develop in this sector are particularly important at the present time, as the European Union endeavours to modernise its social model and fuse economic development with social progress, the quality of life and the social integration of all its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">These challenges are common to all European societies, albeit to some more than others; this applies in particular to my own country, Greece, which has the highest proportion of poor pensioners: around 31% according to Eurostat. We were delighted that the European Council in Nice adopted the social agenda and we hope that the Member States will take this opportunity to promote the development and coordination of social security and welfare systems for the elderly and to promote other measures, such as lifelong learning, which ensure that they have an active lifestyle.</p>
<p class="contents">My political group has worked closely with the rapporteur, Mrs Sbarbati, and we are grateful to her for that. The report contains numerous common positions. We felt that it was particularly important to study the ageing phenomenon within various categories of older persons, because we realised that the elderly in towns face different problems from the elderly in island or rural areas of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We particularly supported the involvement of the elderly in various forms of voluntary work, without overlooking the need for social security in these areas, and we believe that the European institutions and the Member States should not miss the opportunity of conducting a broad information and awareness-raising campaign directed both at the government agencies responsible for applying social policy and society as a whole, because the citizens themselves must realise that a society needs intergenerational solidarity. Supporting the European Commission's initiative and enriching it through dialogue with Parliament will, I think, send a message to the people of Europe that the European Union is in a position to forecast change and crisis and to create a society of participation, cohesion and solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We agree largely with her ideas and we are satisfied with the result of the work of the committee. It is set against the background of the ‘International Year of Older Persons’, as proclaimed by the UN, and it is also very important that attention has been focused in various places on how the situation of the elderly will develop in the future, for example, in the countries of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, it is of primary importance that the elderly are seen as independent people and that they are supported as far as is possible in their independent active lives. All the countries of the European Union have the same problems and the same prospects. For us, the question is how we can keep elderly people in the job market and what that requires of the labour market in general. On the other hand, we see that, while the population is ageing and ageing in better health than ever before, there is a growing desire generally to stop work earlier. This means, then, that we have to take account of how the job market works for different people. How do we support older people so that they can remain in the job market for longer? How do we organise life-long learning in such a way that older people also acquire the new information, new skills and, furthermore, motivation they need to remain in active employment? In other words, there are complex factors involved that have to be considered when dealing with this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Very specifically, I would like to express a few views on ageing women. Everything that now concerns women in the labour market will obviously be visible in the future when they are getting older, for example in pension plans. As piecework, for example, is on the increase at present, this will be reflected in the fact that pension cover will decline in value. Although we have eventually reached a position where we have the same pay for the same work, we must remember that women need special treatment when it comes to social security as they have a different work history, and this must be taken into account as it will have implications later on, for example for their future pensions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is a most important topic, especially with a growing ageing population in Europe. The solidarity of different age groups and actors involved in this field is vital in this regard. One should emphasise that unity, not only between nations and regions but also between people, is an area in which the European Union has a very proud record, and this report emphasises that fact.</p>
<p class="contents">Low employment of ageing workers is a matter that the European Parliament should have tackled far earlier. I am very pleased with the emphasis in the report on reviewing the tax and benefit schemes to provide incentives to take up job offers: this is an initiative that is welcome. Promoting life-long learning – a topic that has already been mentioned by another speaker – is a matter I also support. With new technology and distance-learning possibilities open to older people, real, new opportunities offer themselves to them and they should be allowed to take advantage of this.</p>
<p class="contents">On social protection policies: in its work programme for 1999, the Commission paid particular attention to ways to reverse the trend towards early retirement, to explore new forms of gradual retirement and to make pension schemes more sustainable and flexible.</p>
<p class="contents">On policies against discrimination and social exclusion: the social action programme sets out the Commission's intentions to explore the possibilities for developing new Community action programmes based on Articles 13, 129 and 139, as modified in Amsterdam, and that is something we all welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">The attention given to medical and social research related to ageing is an excellent emphasis in the report. Perhaps – and I say this as a member of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport – sport and exercise should have been given more emphasis to keep ageing people fit and healthy – but that is something I am sure the rapporteur is well aware of.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the excellent initiative on the part of the rapporteur and give it every support on behalf of my Group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Those were the exception to the rule, for the large majority of people died at a relatively young age due to adverse conditions. Nowadays, an increasing number of people live longer thanks to better health care, provision of information, care, housing and pension schemes. Some researchers anticipate that people could actually live up to 120 years, but they invariably die earlier because a vital part of their body ceases to function. Provided we organise our care and social security well, we can allow an increasing number of people to reach the maximum age. Collective expenditure on public services prolongs our lives. Over the past decade in Central and Eastern Europe, we have seen a fall in life expectancy as soon as governments have withdrawn and left elderly people to their fate. The shortage of employees in a growing economy puts pressure on older people to stay in their jobs for longer. In fact, this shortage is being seized upon as an argument for increasing the pensionable age and for nipping in the bud such initiatives as there have been to lower it. That is a development in the wrong direction. Needless to say, people above the age of 60 or 70 can still do many useful things, but it is wrong at that age to make their income dependent on completed working hours. These people are far more useful as a bonding agent in society who help others function more efficiently. It is precisely in voluntary work that they can pass on their life experience and promote cooperation in their own living environments. By forcing them to continue in paid work, they cannot fulfil those useful tasks, and it is likely that their life expectancy will be reduced if we impose obligations such as these on them.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a feeling that the aspects which I have mentioned, namely the importance of collective care and the importance of timely retirement, are considered to be of slightly less importance by the rapporteur and that, moreover, she is too optimistic about the possibility of the elderly thriving without our creating the social conditions to match. One way in which we could strengthen their position would be to adopt Amendment No 4, tabled by my colleague, Mr Alavanos, which aims to better adapt housing and transport to the needs of the elderly. I hope that the House will adopt this amendment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But these recommendations continue to miss the mark. She urges Community action, whether that is appropriate or not. In this area of policy, European institutions hardly have any authority. It is mainly the Member States' governments at federal, provincial and local level which can put many of these recommendations to good use. We should not burden the European Commission with atypical work.</p>
<p class="contents">In the next few decades, an ageing and greying population will emerge, caused by a falling birth rate and an increase in life expectancy. As a consequence, expenditure on health care and pensions will soar dramatically. The OESO has been carrying out research into this area for some years now and has published reports on this topic.</p>
<p class="contents">Research in the Netherlands has shown that, up to the age of 50, the average cost of health care is approximately EUR 1 000 per person per year. This amount increases to EUR 4 000 for 75 year-olds and to around EUR 25 000 per year for 95 year-olds. To buck this trend will take time. After all, by excessively promoting the trend towards individualism, we have created a situation for ourselves where the elderly rely on care institutions to a far greater extent.</p>
<p class="contents">By the same token, the cost of pensions in a number of Member States has grown out of all proportion. In its monthly report for July 2000, the European Central Bank as already issuing serious warnings. In some EMU countries, the cost amounts to twice the GDP. This is in addition to the government debt, which is already very high.</p>
<p class="contents">To my great surprise, the report does not contain any specific recommendations on this matter. Many Member States will need to go on a serious economy drive and prioritise the setting up of funds in order to keep the cost of pensions affordable and to keep the rise in gross average earnings within limits. If this is not done, we will have no choice other than to reduce pension payments. Raising the pensionable age, as proposed by the European Commission, will certainly not prove sufficient as a measure.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the rapporteur’s view that every elderly person deserves respect and appreciation. Unfortunately, we are up against it on virtually every score. A person only counts for as long as they are young, progressive and fashionable. It is exactly the life experiences and wisdom of the elderly which we need in our here-today-gone-tomorrow society. We need to change our pattern of thought right across the board. People need each other’s care and attention; they rely on each other. The basis for this outlook on life is the family, in which each human being grows up. What is bizarre is that, these days, the family is generally no longer considered to be the nucleus of society and appreciated for what it is. Here, too, individualism has taken its toll.</p>
<p class="contents">Add to this the undervaluing of nurturing and caring responsibilities, which feeds the absurd thought that housewives are less productive. Their valuable contribution to our society is hugely neglected in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">The plea to combat age discrimination at the workplace has my support although, once again, I wonder if an EU Directive is necessary. In my opinion, it would be preferable for Member States to address this problem by using their own legislative instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, although the elderly can count on my sympathy and appreciation, I will vote against this report for the reasons cited above. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore congratulate her, as do all the pensioners and elderly people to whom I owe seat no 274 in this Chamber!</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw your attention to paragraph 18 of the report, which calls upon "the Member States to undertake the task of caring for older people who are in hospital and unable to look after themselves, or to reimburse the expenses of doing so to families who help them". This amendment was tabled by myself, Carlo Fatuzzo, and accepted by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. I would stress the importance of this paragraph. In many of our Member States – in Italy, certainly, and, I am sure, in the United Kingdom, Greece and other States – we work extremely hard: we work from morning to night, getting up at six o'clock in the morning and returning home, tired, worn out, at eight or nine o'clock at night. The years go by: our work causes us to fall ill, we pay pension contributions and national insurance contributions; we pay rates and taxes. It is a common occurrence, in the latter years of life, for a worker to become very seriously ill, often a total invalid, needing assistance from everybody. And the State provides no financial assistance at all, not even for those who have no property and no income. And the worker, who has given everything to society, has to sell his house to pay for healthcare, to use up all his money and to see his family reduced to scrimping and saving, at the very moment when one would expect the State and other people to be supportive, during the last years of one's life, when everything looks black and the only ray of light is the help of one's neighbour.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us therefore give hope to the elderly citizens throughout Europe by voting for this report, including paragraph 18.</p>

The rapporteur, who has examined the subject with a great deal of sensitivity, points out that we need to combat negative stereotypes and consolidate equality between the generations as a basis for a European social model. Thanks to her proposals for an active old age, society is enriched by a whole generation.</p>
<p class="contents">Encouraging the elderly to take up roles which they can fulfil on a voluntary basis will help overcome the objections of trades union, which view any extension of working life with suspicion. At the same time, the report encourages us to revise other policies designed solely for younger generations and aims to awaken the interest of other age groups by redefining the participation of all ages in local economic and social life and redistributing income between them.</p>
<p class="contents">This ambitious objective calls for a radical change in practices and the active involvement of the social partners. However, because the elderly do not form a homogenous group, as the communication rightly points out, it is mainly up to the social partners to put forward a system of classification of elderly people which meets modern requirements. It quite rightly combines this policy with the policy for the viability of pension systems. The redistribution of resources implied in the policy to modernise pension systems, an explosive problem, represents a further aim of the new policy for all ages. The proposal to make pension systems dependent upon demographic change in order to create a self-sustaining system is linked to a high level of employment among the elderly. However, extensive early retirement and various graduated terms of retirement presuppose a massive revision of these policies because not all of them are socially inspired.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to close with a word on medical care. A quality of life policy depends directly, especially in the case of the elderly, on the quality of medical care. The communication needs to clarify the problem of the increased cost of services from new medical technologies which create new forms of inequality in the face of illness and death. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the markets are only interested in young people and their purchasing power, it falls to politicians to attend to the issue of older people. In many EU countries it is being discussed whether existing pension rights and benefits can be safeguarded in the future. In many countries pensions have been promised although there are not the corresponding funds to pay them. When the single currency is introduced in the form of the euro and monetary policy is the same in all countries, those countries will be subjected to an enormous amount of pressure to cut pensions. Promises regarding pensions must be kept, but pensions must be secured with those countries’ own funds without payment of the pension being protected at the expense of the EU’s common monetary policy. It is a guaranteed income that will give older and elderly aged people the greatest sense of security. Employment is also one of the basic human rights, and Mrs Sbarbati’s report has rightly brought attention to age-based discrimination and ageism in working life. It is politicians who must safeguard the notion of equality in employment: the markets cannot. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Discrimination does exist. There are countries in the European Union whose national health services will no longer pay for operations on people above a certain age, as if to say what use is this operation to this old person now? In many cases rehabilitation following illness is no longer available to old people under the national systems. This is discrimination on the grounds of age.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one Member State whose parliament has discussed whether voting rights should not be removed from the over seventies. The debate is over now, but this was discussed. In all of the Member States there are laws which quite simply forbid people above a certain age from working. This is discrimination on the grounds of age. Please do not come to me with the popular cry: "But surely, then, we are taking away jobs from young people". That reminds me of the debate in the sixties about keeping us women out of the labour market. Then, people also said that women must not work so that the men could. This was the line of argument taken by the unions for a long time. And they are still banging the wrong drum today.</p>
<p class="contents">Can we not please finally put a stop to this! Almost all of the speakers have mentioned the "ageing workforce". Mr Blokland has even spoken of ageing and greying. One colleague has said that it is not we who are living for too long, it is not our society which is too old, but that centuries ago people had to die much earlier than the good Lord had preordained in our genes. 110 or 120 years is quite right! Over the last 100 to 150 years we have experienced the greatest social revolution of all time, for our human life span has doubled. We have been given a second life. 150 years ago, our average life expectancy was 40 years; today it is 80 years. A girl born today is likely to live for 100 years or more. We should not call this ageing or even “greying”. Stop using these words, because that really is discrimination. The future of all of you is old age. I would advise you to make provisions for your future!</p>

<p class="contents">That may appear to be a handicap as far as many people are concerned, in the first analysis. My own personal opinion, and that of an increasingly large number of people, is that this may be an advantage if we can manage to do what is necessary in order to ensure that every citizen, regardless of age, remains a full citizen and that experience becomes once again a key value in a society which, in recent years, has favoured what is speedy, ephemeral and fashionable over what has lasted, time served and wealth of experience, not to mention what is human.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, I can only be delighted, today, at the issue of this communication and this report aimed at building a Europe for all ages and promoting prosperity and intergenerational solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenges, particularly the economic ones, are well known. I shall not harp on that subject. To face up to these challenges and transform these very real problems into real assets, I believe we need great determination and great moral, philosophical and political commitment. We also need considerable financial resources. This last point, of course, runs counter to the fashionable individualist ideology which advocates less public expenditure and less taxation on the working population. This is a miscalculation, considering the current and future demographic situation, and also considering the fact that today’s working population will be tomorrow’s non-working population, in economic terms.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as far as I am concerned, and this is no doubt the most important aspect, investing in life is, in any case, a good economic investment, and adding life to the extra years is an approach which provides a foundation for human dignity. This alone gives meaning to the mathematical prolongation of life made possible by medical progress.</p>

As a member of the Friday Club – which admittedly is not an official group but in practice does exist – I am one of the hosts of the Members present today, as you are, and I hope that we will also manage this next year. We really will have to find the ways and means to achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">As someone who is not yet a senior citizen, the following struck me about the report on a Europe for all ages, including the elderly: neither of my committees – the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities – lament the fact that our society is ageing; they welcome it. Mrs Flemming has rightly pointed out that it is positive that people are able to live for longer and at the same time stay healthy. What is negative is that many of them are sidelined, and it is also negative that many of them are forced to feel marginalised.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that people are discriminated against on the grounds of age was, of course, confirmed in my report on Article 13, which I was able to present to the House in October. Older workers are prevented from going on to further education and training courses; they are also prevented from acquiring new technical skills even though they would be capable of doing so. Their ability to learn and even their ability to innovate are denied. They are harassed at work, with the result that, in the end, they give in and allegedly retire from their job voluntarily. Measures need to be taken to combat acts of discrimination. These must be developed through model projects which, in turn, need to be supported by Community initiatives such as EQUAL.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Sbarbati is right to call on the Commission to support the proposal to limit compulsory early retirement. I can amplify what she said with some comments on the German experience. The rules on early retirement, which were initially well intentioned on the part of politicians, were seriously abused by some companies. They accepted payments – the whole of society was therefore involved – and older workers retired, but younger workers were not taken on and many jobs were shed. If we talk about finance, anyone who retires from working life is entitled to a pension and not to be discriminated against with people saying, "You are getting a pittance". However different the national pensions systems are in Europe, they should all be earnings- and performance-related.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that there will be information campaigns in the Member States encouraging older people to get involved in society, in cultural and social activities, in community centres, in caring for children and the elderly, in associations and clubs. We need these people and not only the young, dynamic and successful people! Another part of an effective strategy is to foster an intergenerational dialogue. I am thinking of encounters in seminars and evaluation of best practices, where older people can pass on their knowledge and experience to younger people in the company. Many people are younger at 70 than others are at 17, who only want to go with the flow and not upset anyone or attract attention. Anyone who is satisfied with the average will never embark on the adventure of a committed life. The countless active elderly people should motivate us all to fight for a society in which the phrase intergenerational solidarity is not just empty words!</p>

<p class="contents">Our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs worked very hard to table its very long motion for a resolution. At my advanced age I am, of course, pleased that it says in the motion that the vast experience and skills of older people need to be used; this means that even when people are over 75 they should not be consigned to the scrap heap.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of efforts to combat discrimination on the basis of Articles 13 and 137 of the Treaty, there is a campaign for measures to be introduced to ensure that older people are no longer excluded from the workplace, which is actually saying that the obligatory age limit and also compulsory early retirement are discriminatory.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the Commission is then even called upon to draft a proposal for a directive which should make it possible to combat discrimination specifically on the grounds of age. Obviously we need to be careful that we do not contradict ourselves in the many long resolutions which we adopt here. You see, on the one hand, we are saying that we wish to use obligatory age limits to get rid of the elderly so as to free up jobs for young people, but, in other areas, we are almost demanding the abolition of obligatory age limits. I do not necessarily think that all women should go out to work either, because we are after all calling for the labour force penetration rate of women to be increased through changes in family and tax policy. I do not believe that all women – or all men – should have to go out to work if they decide to have a career break or to stop working in order to devote themselves to their family. Family and tax policy should be designed to ensure that men and women who have family commitments are free to decide whether they wish to go out to work or not.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad, however – and Mrs Flemming referred to this case of discrimination – that women are no longer discriminated against in this way now. When I started working for the unions I was told that I would be dismissed if I were to get married. As a result I am unfortunately still single today!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">If we really want to do something for older working women, then the pension companies in the Member States should be called upon to rectify the disastrous consequences of the wage discrimination which women were exposed to until 1975 by virtue of the fact that they were paid – entirely legally – only 80 or 90% of men's wages. They should be called upon to eradicate this discrimination, which has a knock-on effect on the pension, by using 100% of a man's salary at the time as a basis for calculating the pension.</p>
<p class="contents">This really would be a good thing, and in so doing the consequences of such dreadful discrimination would be removed. I have one final point: I should like to distance myself from paragraph 18 of the motion for a resolution. Surely we cannot call upon the Member States to undertake the task of caring for people in nursing homes. I believe that it is for the Member States to decide – in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity – how to resolve this problem, whether it be through a nursing insurance scheme or in other ways. I will, of course, be voting in favour of the report, but I thought it important to clarify these points.</p>

This is a serious, thorough study of the problems faced by the elderly, but it is also a bold, innovative report in terms of the proposals it puts forward to promote the active participation of the elderly in working, social and cultural life.</p>
<p class="contents">The ageing of the population is, today, an indisputable fact which places considerable pressure on the social security systems of some Member States. Enabling our citizens to age in an active and healthy way is one of the great challenges of our times and requires Community policies to match national social security and public health systems. We cannot simply limit the issue of intergenerational solidarity to the financial sphere. We must foster a global vision of support for the elderly and for their families, particularly for women who look after elderly people.</p>
<p class="contents">Our current social model makes a cult of youth. This is a deeply ingrained idea, which thoroughly pervades all areas of social life and which must be combated through the effective practice of intergenerational solidarity. Given the significant increase in life expectancy as a result of the enormous medical progress that we have seen, particular attention must be paid to demographic developments in the population. We must produce a coordinated strategy for employment in conjunction with measures to counter discrimination on the grounds of age and modernise pensions and health schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucial that we develop concrete policies and specific programmes for the various categories of elderly people. These measures will have to be appropriate to the different specific circumstances of elderly people in terms of standards of living and financial self-sufficiency. Because we cannot treat unequal situations equally, Member States will have to provide a response to the situation of elderly people who are completely bereft of savings and who are completely dependent on the help and care of relatives or others, and they will also have to ensure that a form of insurance is created that guarantees the elderly the right to see out their days with dignity and serenity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He is much of the reason why I am here – an MEP, a Scotsman, a European. In the early 1930s he spent much time in Germany. He had good German friends. He witnessed and worried about the rise of Nazism. While I was very small he was away for long periods, parachuted into southern Serbia to support the brave fight of the royalist Serbs against Nazism. Next he parachuted into the Hautes-Alpes of France to fight with the Maquis and prepare that part of Europe for liberation. I have photographs of him as the tricolour was raised anew in Mont-Dauphin and Briançon. Immediately after the war he went back to Germany to help restore agriculture and food supplies in North Rhine-Westphalia, Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein. My brother and I joined him there. We played in the rubble of Hamburg, we made good German friends in our turn.</p>
<p class="contents">On my first day in this Parliament, in 1979, one of our then German colleagues approached me. "Are you Purvis?" "Yes." "I remember rocking you on my knee in your kilt in Hamburg in 1946. We so respected your father," he said. "He could have taken advantage of us but he didn't. He did all he could fairly to share out scarce resources and restore our country."</p>
<p class="contents">Father is in his 90s. I am in my 60s, my children in their 30s, my grandchildren between 0 and 5 – four generations of a Scottish and a European family. It is this European Union, this Parliament, that are our families' guarantee that the peace and security for which my father has fought and worked in his lifetime will indeed continue for future generations – the solidarity of generations.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Verheugen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like on behalf of the Commission to congratulate the rapporteur and the two committees on this report. I am particularly pleased because it shows that the Commission and the European Parliament are to a large extent in agreement and have developed a common understanding of the challenges of ageing. The debate has shown that there is broad agreement on the appropriate political response to this in the fields of employment, social security, health and social integration.</p>
<p class="contents">We are certainly facing tremendous challenges. Only a sustained and joint effort can help us to meet them. I think that it is important to preserve a high degree of consensus so that we succeed in adapting to the process of ageing in our society in an appropriate way.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to stress the significance of this communication. It is true that the communication contains few specific proposals for measures and initiatives. However, it does offer an innovative diagnosis of the greatest challenges of ageing, out of which emerges an extremely important compilation of suitable political responses, responses to issues relating to employment, social security, health and social integration. Ensuing Commission proposals have adhered rigidly to this roughly sketched out agenda. It will undoubtedly also provide further information about political trends in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerns about closing the age gap in Europe's performance balance sheet have been reflected very strongly in the employment process, from the guidelines to the recommendations to the NLP and peer review procedures. They were also plain to see in the plans for the Community initiative EQUAL and in the allocation of ESF funds from 2001 to 2006. What is more, age-related issues are amongst the most important objectives setting the agenda in the new process of cooperation in the field of social protection. In the most recent communications on pensions, the central idea has been "mobilising society's full potential", because raising the employment rate of older people who are fit to work is crucial to providing sustainable pensions in an ageing society. Initiatives in areas such as equal opportunities, equal treatment and social integration are similarly outward signs of aspects of an active ageing scenario. At this stage, I should like to emphasise that the directive on equal treatment in the workplace, which was adopted on 12 October 2000, bans discrimination on the grounds of age.</p>
<p class="contents">Future initiatives in the field of public health are directed more at health- and care-related issues in old age and at promoting healthy ageing. Finally, part of the fifth framework programme for research provides for investigations into issues associated with old age, including the effects on health of an active lifestyle in old age. It is therefore clear that the political paradigm of active ageing is reflected in many important initiatives and we can safely assume that it will inspire a raft of further initiatives in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">With your permission, I will, in conclusion, respond to a number of points where Parliament has expressed concern about the effects of the measures proposed by the Commission. A constantly recurring concern in your report was whether an emphasis on political measures promoting active and healthy ageing did not necessarily mean poorer conditions and fewer rights for people in need of care, for the very old and for those unfit for work. I should like to give you explicit assurance that this is certainly not the Commission's intention. Quite the opposite: in the communication, the Commission has laid great stress on the assertion that political measures should address the differences between people. Early retirement must remain an option for those who are no longer fit to work. Not everyone can or should retire voluntarily from working life. There must be discretionary powers for individual preferences and decisions. Furthermore, in our view, over-emphasising active political measures has precisely the opposite effect. In fact it is a precondition for our ability to find sufficient resources for those in need of care, so that the wealthy amongst us are willing and able to pay higher contributions and become more independent in old age. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The problem is that, insofar as we as the European Union are concerned, we cannot talk about development because we do not have genuine population development: the birth-rate is extremely low while the proportion of elderly people is increasing.
