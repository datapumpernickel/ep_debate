<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Foster (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, the tragic events of 11 September in the United States have given new impetus to the reinforcement of arrangements for aviation security. The European Council meeting the day after the terrorist attacks on the USA instructed the Transport Council to evaluate the measures to be taken to improve aviation security and complete its consideration of those already proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft regulation itself was fairly straightforward and has been amended. However, the attached technical annex, Document 30, based on the European Civil Aviation Conference – or ECAC – was found to be out of date. Whilst Parliament has responded speedily to the challenge, we believe that this should not lead to a lower level of parliamentary scrutiny and we reserve the right to amend in second reading the revised annex to this regulation adopted by the Council in its common position.</p>
<p class="contents">I have met with representatives from the Council and Commission and have consulted widely with the industry. Due to the difficulty with the annex, as mentioned earlier, I chose to proceed with the report along the following lines: to work with the draft regulation and annex without amending the original annex as given to Parliament but to reserve the right to a second reading after the Council's common position has been adopted. This option accords with established procedures and ensures proper scrutiny.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft regulation concerns, principally, access control and passenger luggage and freight screening on the ground at airports and is outlined fully in my explanatory statement. The scope does not extend to on-board security which may need to be addressed at some future date. The technical standards themselves are those adopted by ECAC in 1992 in Document 30, part 2, relating to security issues revised in January 2001 and, as mentioned, currently being updated. ECAC membership extends to 38 European States including all EU Member States. It is worth pointing out to Parliament that this agreement reached by the 38 countries will set a precedent in so far as for the first time the agreement will have binding force upon its contracting parties. Document 30 had previously been used for general guidance only.</p>
<p class="contents">Following on from the joint resolution which Parliament adopted at the last plenary session on the subject of aviation, the key areas for amendment to this text are as follows: first, Member States assume responsibility for additional security costs in the light of the terrorist attacks; second, inspections of airports should be unannounced if airports are to be inspected under real operating conditions; third, Member States take responsibility in assisting employers in the screening of employees engaged in all security tasks, not least because employers are not always entitled to access personal data due to strict privacy laws; fourth, where there is a requirement for structural modifications at airports a six month time-limit will be implemented; and fifth, that a procedure be formulated, as is currently the case in ECAC, that would allow industry access to the Comitology Committee without running into problems of existing legal structures.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, on a general point, we are calling for more effective international cooperation in the area of exchange of information for security purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, we are all aware of the catastrophic effects on the aviation industry and tourist sector as a result of 11 September. Around 200 000 directly-related jobs have already been lost worldwide, 30 000 in the EU alone, and this is just the tip of the iceberg. It is not only big businesses which have been affected but also thousands of small businesses, such as small aviation clubs who produce the pilots of tomorrow. Airlines, airports, manufacturers, hotels, the transport sector are all reliant on finding a solution to this problem. This report is not the sole solution but it is a step in the right direction provided that the Member States recognise their moral duty to protect their citizens and accept their responsibility to assist in the financing of these additional security measures. It is quite clear that urgent action must be taken to restore public confidence which, in turn, would assist the aviation industry, the tourism sector and the European Union as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is self-evident after the events of 11 September.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, there are four points at issue which we included in our amendments. In this respect, we want to take account of the interests of the industry, in which security and a fair distribution of the burden and expenses involved, must be the overriding factor.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we must aim to achieve the highest possible level of security when it comes to the protection of airports and their users. This is also the least citizens can expect from us.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, additional measures which will probably be taken at a later date, must be verified against the implementation of present legislation. This means that we will need to consider very carefully whether what is being proposed will also be viable in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is that the Commission, in tandem with the ECAC and the ICAO, must determine whether airports in third countries, in other words, airports outside the scope of the Regulation, meet essential security conditions, for any loopholes in the new system will surface particularly at those airports. I know from my own experience how to board a plane in Albania without passing through bomb control.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth and last point is that we would like uniform rules to finance the proposed measures in order to prevent unfair competition. This could be government aid, provided that that is directly linked to the extra expenditure in connection with the present Regulation. It should also be demonstrated, of course, that the aid is really needed. The industry itself, operators and users, must also bear a proportion of the costs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The discussions that have just begun show, too, that we are fundamentally in complete agreement with this. The events of 11 September have, of course, revealed additional deficiencies, which we have to consider in isolation from the structural problems already suffered by many airlines. The two must not be confused.</p>
<p class="contents">We are of the opinion that there is room for improvement in all the areas relevant to security – the airports, the aprons, the registration and clearing of luggage, even on board the aircraft itself. My group and I also take the view that, since safety is in the public interest and must be guaranteed for every citizen who uses airlines, public funds must also bear their share of the costs that an increase in safety entails. This, of course, demands standardised European procedures, without which we will not solve the problem, and because competition would be distorted if the burden were to revert to the airports or the airlines.</p>
<p class="contents">We are, of course, aware that we have a problem. There is, generally in Parliament, constant discussion of liberalisation, meaning that we now want to use public funds to improve safety in this liberalised sector. This, of course, means that we have to talk in general terms about what standards can and must be applied in order to use public money to intervene in liberalised markets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank you for your promptness and speed in dealing with this subject, given the urgent nature of the current situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on having concluded its first reading of the Commission proposal in such a short time, because although this has been achieved very quickly, it must be added that this has not been done to the detriment of the quality of work carried out, and with regard to this I would particularly like to thank Mrs Foster, the rapporteur for this initiative, for the excellent work she has carried out despite the urgency of the situation, the lack of time and also for having carefully listened to all the sectors involved, which is the best way of undertaking such work.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking the gravity of the situation into account and the need to give an immediate response, and considering the mandate of the European Council of 21 September, our objective was to conclude an agreement before the end of the year. In her report, Mrs Foster fully recognises the need to strengthen, in a standardised way, the security requirements applicable to civil aviation since 11 September. I am pleased to be able to tell you that the Commission is, generally speaking, in agreement with the report, given that it supports our intention of introducing common security standards for civil aviation in the European Union, of establishing a Community inspection system aimed at checking the effectiveness and uniformity of these standards, and, therefore, and on this point I insist, at improving the security measures that, as Mr Wiersma or Mr Markov pointed out, are absolutely necessary and urgent.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the proposed amendments, we can, in principle, accept the first part of Amendment 14, which refers to the gradual introduction of specific security measures, although the measures involved and the timetable will have to be slightly adjusted.</p>
<p class="contents">A series of amendments is dedicated to ensuring that part of the implementation costs of the security measures are covered by the Member States of the European Union, on a permanent or temporary basis. With regard to these amendments, the Commission fully agrees with the spirit of Nos 1, 6, 10, 11, 15, 19, 21 and 22, and can accept them in principle, even though they raise important issues relating to the method of financing the security measures. We will have to take a look at the exact wording they will need in order for the Commission to adopt them.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the situation can vary between one county and another, even between one airport and another; however, the Commission does not think that this factor could improve the effectiveness of the security measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission communication of 10 October, on the economic impact of the terrorist attacks, suggested that the financing, with public funds, of additional security measures could be considered a positive move. However, I am sorry to have to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that this measure was not received with any great enthusiasm by the Council, to put it mildly. To tell the truth, it was not supported by the majority of States in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This is how I know that making such a reference in the current regulation will cause serious problems in the Council, although, I repeat, we agree with Parliament’s position, because we are aware of the tremendous crisis the European Aviation Sector is experiencing at the moment. This is a sector that is also having to face competition, often unfair competition, from American companies that are benefiting from significant direct aid, provided by the Administration of that country.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also possible that the financing of provisions that are not directly related to the improvement of security will not be included in this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, with the aim of finding a solution to the significant problem of financing additional measures, I repeat that I am ready to undertake an analysis of the need to harmonise the organisation and financing of security controls in Member States, given what is happening in the United States, and to make the proposals necessary to take the result of this analysis into account. With this action, the Commission would be taking account of the opinion demonstrated by this Parliament through the various amendments that will surely be approved tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Amendment No 7, which proposes the removal of a Community control mechanism aimed at checking the proportionality and justification of stricter security measures in civil aviation adopted by Member States, the Commission must reject this amendment, even though Parliament and Council are of the same opinion. We think that it is legitimate to grant the Commission the power to prevent artificial restrictions that are justified for economic reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 9 suggests that the results of the Community inspection reports should be sent to each airline. These reports, ladies and gentlemen, contain general information on the implementation of the regulation by European Union Member States, and on the functioning of their own quality control systems and their ability to detect faults. However, they do not include details such as the indication of the level of risk and its changes from airline to airline, and therefore, passing on these reports will not contribute to improving individual security, and with this in mind, the Commission cannot accept the content of this amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Other amendments have been rejected because they cause legal problems, as is the case with the last paragraph of Amendment No 14, for example, Amendment No 5, which changes the reference standards produced by an external organisation, the ECAC, Amendment No 12, which goes against comitology procedures, Amendment No 17, which would delay the entry into force of the regulation, making it subject to an impact study, without there being any indication of the final decision.</p>
<p class="contents">The remaining amendments improve or clarify the text and the Commission can accept them with slight changes to their wording. The Commission could also accept Amendment No 20, but would point out that implementing its extraterritorial effects on the basis of bilateral or multilateral controls would be a complicated matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has spared no effort to try to achieve, or to facilitate, an agreement between the Council and Parliament at first reading, on a subject that is so important and, above all, urgent. I fear that this may not be possible given the absence of prior agreement on tomorrow’s vote. I think, however, that in the near future, in March, we could be in a position where we have a text, slightly late, it must be said, but if this results in a better quality text and better proposals, this is not such a serious issue, since some of the methods we have discussed here are already being directly implemented by Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you, Mr President. I would like to congratulate Mrs Foster once again. And I would also like to thank Parliament for the urgency and effort it has afforded this measure, which is of fundamental importance, and I hope that in March we will finally reach full agreement between all the institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
