<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stihler (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Madam President, the background to this report is well known, but worth repeating as it is crucial. In November 2000, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) warned that cod stocks in the North Sea and west of Scotland waters and the northern hake stocks are at serious risk of collapse.</p>
<p class="contents">ICES estimates that cod stocks in the North Sea are at their lowest level since 1963 and that technical measures and TAC reductions alone will not be enough to restore them to within safe limits. Cod stocks in the Kattegat, Irish Sea and west of Scotland waters are in similar condition. For hake the decline in stocks has been less dramatic, but stocks are thought to be around only half of their 1980 levels.</p>
<p class="contents">At the December 2000 Fisheries Council meeting, it was agreed that more long-term conservation measures were necessary in addition to TAC reductions for 2001. The Commission was invited to submit proposals for a multi-annual recovery plan. During 2001, the Commission adopted various emergency regulations to restrict the fishing of these species and in June 2001, it issued a communication outlining its strategy for rebuilding cod and hake stocks in Community and adjacent waters.</p>
<p class="contents">The current proposed multi-annual recovery programme for cod and hake follows on from that communication. I welcome the overall approach, which includes targets for recovery of each of the stocks, total allowable catches allowing for an annual percentage increase of 30% for cod and 15% for hake, with an upper and lower limit to the permitted change in the TAC of 50% from one year to the next, a system of fishing effort limitation, enhanced controls in relation to satellite tracking for vessels over 50 metres in length, position reporting, landing conditions, retentions on board and conditions for weighing and transport. The potential use of temporary closed areas for up to 60 days.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that successful recovery of stocks must be a priority. We must at all costs avoid a Canadian-style disappearance of cod and hake from these northern waters. In Canada, a cod moratorium was introduced in 1992. Some 30,000 people lost their jobs, the biggest lay-off in Canadian history. The cod disappeared due to a complex mix of factors, including over-fishing, and a decade later the stocks have not recovered.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot ignore the ecological warning signs. At the committee vote, references to hake were removed from this report. I hope colleagues will support me as rapporteur in trying to reinstate hake in this report. Although there is disagreement over whether cod and hake should be treated together, the Commission's approach seems to me acceptable, provided that sufficient account is taken of the specific situation of the two species. The figures and the levels of hake stocks have been questioned and we should be guided by evidence. On the measure proposed for hake, new scientific evidence may allow a relaxation in the targets and the percentage stock increase expected.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a package of measures which first of all work and secondly minimise the pain to the sector. Finally, while the success of the recovery plans must be the priority, an annual review of their progress and socio-economic impact should be undertaken. However, if recovery is not achieved the outcome will be increased socio-economic hardship. In any event, without fish there cannot be fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask colleagues to vote for Amendments Nos 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15 and 16 and against Amendments Nos 1, 3, 5, 9 and 14. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe this debate is important enough to deserve his presence here today.</p>
<p class="contents">Rigorous, transparent, verified scientific reports, carried out together with the industry, should be the first pillar of the CFP reform in order to have credibility in the conservation of our fishery species. We need to diagnose the true state of the stocks precisely and accurately, because otherwise we could be using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union should be a global example of marine research, but it is not, not even – and I say this to Commissioner Fischler – with his proposed reform, which pushes science into the background.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week at a meeting of marine scientists, Mr Robin Cook, of the Aberdeen marine research laboratory and an advisory member of the ICES, stated that the fisheries reform proposed was based on scientific reports that were very poor and which lacked transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">John Molloy of the Dublin Marine Institute – as you can see I do not mention any Spanish scientists here – said that ‘fishermen are scientists’ and that we need to use the raft of first-hand information they have, which is currently being ignored.</p>
<p class="contents">The Canadian scientist McGuire has also rejected the hake catastrophe reports. The industry rejects them outright. We are aware that the ICES and the Scientific and Technical Committee on Fisheries do not agree, and they again brought up the review of current hake reports at Lisbon and Copenhagen. Mr Fischler, without an economic, social and regional impact assessment, proposes equating cod and hake, which are very different species and very different situations; and he adopts drastic, irreversible measures to cut down the fleet as if there were no other alternative measures that would maintain the stock while we wait for conclusive reports. I call on the Commissioner to think it over for once.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Fisheries approved Amendment 1 – I see the rapporteur is against separating the two species – and I hope the House will adopt it. If not, I hope the Council can bring it back in.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to protect stocks but not at just any price, not through just any measure. We want the ecological reports to include economic and social reports, and we must take into account the industry which has been fishing in the same waters for several generations, and they do not understand the Commission’s proposal, in view of the results they are getting, and they want other biological reference points to be selected that are broad in scope and more rigorous.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call on the Commission to go deeper into CFP reform and marine research, and to devote more human and material resources to it. I call on it to review the proposal for hake, since the industry that depends on it demands more transparency, more participation, more dialogue, more objectivity and more reliability before it will accept the proposals that the Commission puts before us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I cannot, however, agree with her desire, as rapporteur, to reinstate hake in this report. As she well knows, I had tabled 13 amendments in committee aimed at softening the measures for hake, and more than half lapsed when the committee adopted the amendment tabled by Mr Varela, which separates the two species. Therefore, if we now approved the report for both species together, it would be highly unbalanced.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community fisheries policy has to find a balance among the measures on stock conservation, the reasonable adjustment of the fleet to each Member State and the maintenance of economic activity in fishing-dependent regions. It is a complex approach. First of all, because overfishing is not the only cause of stock depletion: the indiscriminate catching of species for fishmeal production interrupts the food chain for cod and hake and to a great extent causes the situation both species are going through. There are certainly highly significant differences between these two fisheries as regards their mortality and growth rates and the conservation measures needed. The situation of cod in the North Sea and off Scotland is different, just as the situation of northern hake off south-western Ireland differs from that off the French coast.</p>
<p class="contents">Not all species – and this is something we have to say out loud – and not all fishing grounds are in the same state. In this respect, the Committee on Fisheries considered that the hake and cod situations are different, and that hake should have different measures from cod, which should be adopted based on confirmed scientific reports. There is no single, unified and indisputable scientific basis to indicate that the northern hake stock has fallen below the biological safety limit, and there does not seem to be a need for drastic management measures to save this stock.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot forget the great economic and social impact that these measures will have on the fishing communities. The Commission has not undertaken any study of these consequences or of those that must be taken into account when the plan is implemented, nor has it shown us an evaluation of the emergency measures it adopted in 2001. It must be remembered too that the TAC for hake was cut by 51% between 1999 and 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">The European fishing fleet quite reasonably needs to know what prospects there are for this activity. My group is therefore opposed to drastic cuts, which can be brought in over longer periods. We therefore support the rapporteur’s Amendment 8, and once again I sincerely congratulate her on the excellent work she has done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since this is the first time, it is very important that we get it right. We must make sure that the actions we take will reverse the declines in several cod stocks and northern hake and allow them to recover.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposals were tough and will definitely have an impact upon the fishing communities involved, but they had to be tough because the state of the stocks is so poor. As the rapporteur has said, if we do not do something about fish stocks, there will be no fishing industry in the future as there will be no fish. ICES says that cod in the North Sea is at its lowest level since 1963. While hake may not yet be in such dire straits, it is still far below the level which is appropriate, and the warning bells have been ringing now for quite some time.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, the Committee on Fisheries and the Council all claim to agree with the precautionary approach, which states that the absence of definite proof should not be used to refuse action to prevent a decline in fish stocks. In other words, as soon as there are reasonable grounds to believe that cod and hake stocks need a degree of protection, we should act. That is exactly what the Commission has done. However, what did the Committee on Fisheries do? It argued that there is no crisis involving hake and completely removed it from the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">We must vote against this amendment. I agree with the rapporteur on this point. It is completely unacceptable. This is not a precautionary approach to fisheries management. The committee is simply paying lip service to the idea and continuing with business as usual. We are not going to solve the problems if this is the way we go on. We cannot keep refusing to face up to reality. We must realise that these stocks are endangered and we must protect the fishing industry. It is doing the fishing industry no favours in the long term if this is the kind of simplistic, nationalistic short-term approach that has been taken. If the report goes through plenary as it is, the Verts/ALE Group will have to vote against it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">van Dam (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, during the course of 20 years, cod stocks in the North Sea have shrunk by three-quarters. At the same time, the number of cod fishermen has fallen considerably in my country. In 1980, there were still 310 cutters that fished for cod under the Dutch flag, while these days most fishermen have switched to flatfish, and there are only a handful of cutters left that fish for cod. Nonetheless, this reduction in the number of fishermen does not seem enough. The Commission is right to table proposals for multi-annual recovery programmes for cod and hake. However, in the Commission’s proposals on reform of the European fisheries policy which Commissioner Fischler presented recently, those very fish-stock related reductions are missing. The link in the case of cod and, to a lesser degree, of hake, is evident.</p>
<p class="contents">I share Mrs Stihler’s view completely when she states in the explanatory statement to the report that successful recovery of the stocks must be the priority. The package of measures must be effective, but must also take account of the socio-economic damage to the fisheries sector. There is no point putting the sector under pressure if the measures implemented do not have the desired effect on the stocks. This is why it is important to monitor the effectiveness of the measures. Measures must be reversed as soon as it is evident that they do not have any positive effects.</p>
<p class="contents">As a bad example of such a futile measure, I would remind the Commission of the cod contingency plan which it launched for the North Sea in the winter of 2000. This contingency plan, by means of which part of the North Sea was closed for fishing, had the opposite effect. In the open areas, fishing pressure rose enormously, while in the closed areas, the fish stocks were quickly caught following their re-opening. According to fisheries biologists, the closed areas did not correspond very well with the mating areas of cod. Due to the fleet concentration in the open areas, vulnerable areas are being over-fished. In my view, fishermen and biologists were right to conclude that the Commission was not so much concerned about effectiveness as it was about political viability. A repeat of this debacle and the lack of proportion must be avoided. It is unacceptable for Dutch fishermen who are allowed to catch 10% of the Total Allowed Catch, the TAC, for cod, to be far more restricted in their fishing activities than British fishermen who account for 40% of the TAC.</p>
<p class="contents">I will make a few observations to the measures included in the Commission proposal. First of all, the aforementioned area closures are a good example of how things should not be done. Real-time closures<span class="italic">,</span> closures in an area where a high concentration of young fish is found, on the other hand, can be an effective measure. Technical measures can be of particular importance for the fishermen who fish for cod as a secondary activity.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the reduction in TAC for cod entails the risk that the fishing pressure on unquoted species will increase enormously. Pro-active policy should ensure that unquoted species are quoted as quickly as possible. This is all the more important when in 2003, Spanish and Portuguese ships will also be heading for the North Sea. If the Commission abandons TACs and quotas for these species, we can expect recovery plans for these species in ten years’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, a reduction in effort is achieved most quickly by applying the sea-days’ scheme. It is delightful to see that a system used in the Netherlands, that was always met with criticism by the Commission, is now finally being adopted by the self-same Commission. I hope that the Commission will apply this method more widely. A weekend ban, well-known in the transport world, is being recommended by Dutch fishermen.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the Commission should not simply leave the details of the sea-days’ scheme and the financial compensation to the Member States. This would lead to unfair competition. The Commission must prescribe reduction figures for each Member State. These figures can be based on the quota and the observed over-fishing in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must ensure that fleets that have found a balanced relationship between effort and quotas do not undergo further re-organisation. By that, I mean that if a fleet, in the event of sound quota management, is capable of working profitably and effectively, then this should not be disturbed. It is therefore positive that subsidies for the building of new vessels will be abolished. But even when FIFG funds are used, the fishing capacity should not be maintained artificially.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important for the impact of the plans to be assessed in good time. It is also important that we then take account of the socio-economic damage to the sector. If the recovery plan fails, the damage to cod, hake and to fishermen will be incalculable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Everyone in this House is aware that fish stocks are in sharp decline across the EU. That is why the Commission has come to us with a radical new package of proposals for reform of the common fisheries policy. That is why we are facing an 18% cut in overall gross tonnage in the EU fleet, with the attendant massive impact that this will have on jobs in many economically challenged and remote peripheral areas of the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we also understand that the two species at most serious risk of collapse are cod and northern hake. There is at least no doubt about the state of cod stocks. I would admit that there are, however, some doubts about the state of hake stocks. The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) claims that hake stocks are on the verge of collapse. Other independent scientists claim the stocks are still at sustainable levels and they challenge the ICES findings.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs McKenna has pointed out in her speech this evening, we are pledged in this House to apply the precautionary principle whenever such doubts exist. In these circumstances, I would appeal to this House to reinstate hake in the Commission's recovery plan until such time as the scientific evidence can be analysed and verified in exactly the way Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna has called for this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, as we all know, a substantial number of Member States voiced their opposition to certain aspects of the Commission's proposals for reforming the CFP during the Fisheries Council. They want public aid to be used for building new vessels, they want open access to Community waters, they support short-term profits over long-term sustainability, they oppose change, they support the status quo. Theirs is surely a policy of despair. We cannot continue as we have done in the past. If we do so, it will not be only cod and hake that disappear, our fishing industry will disappear as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Because for centuries catching methods were of limited effectiveness, the idea arose that stocks were inexhaustible. This feeling still exists in some reactions against conservation policies. Nevertheless, in the face of a public opinion that cares about protecting nature and of the economic risks created by the collapse of some fish species, fishermen are realising that they must be marine life’s allies and not its enemies.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this context that any reform of fisheries policy must be seen, whether it is a wide-ranging reform or one designed to address specific situations, such as this one. The aim of the legislation currently under consideration, which is the subject of the excellent Stihler report, is to prevent the disaster that the extinction of fish as popular as cod and hake would represent. We can discuss the relative values of the recommended measures and the effectiveness of the method of implementing them; we can discuss the accuracy of the scientific data on which this method is based, but what cannot be underestimated is the danger threatening cod population units and, on a smaller scale, those for hake as well as the need to turn the situation around and to recover these population units.</p>
<p class="contents">In our debates on fisheries, we have frequently come up against the uncertainty and the unreliability of scientific data. This is the justification for the Committee on Fisheries’ decision to make its proposals for hake more flexible. I wonder whether this is a step in the right direction. I have my doubts. For these reasons, I call on the Commission to set up a system of scientific and technically credible research on which to base our decisions. It is crucial that the Commission does this. Cod, as everyone knows, is one of the cornerstones of Portuguese cuisine, but man does not live by haute cuisine alone. Cod fishing in Newfoundland is deeply ingrained in the minds of our fishermen and has left indelible traces in Portuguese literature. We must, therefore, fight to save the cod! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There must be no bowing to political pressures. They must ensure that the objective of sustainable fisheries is at the core of fisheries management. While I accept that recovery plans for hake must be specific to that fishery, I do not believe that hake should be excluded from the proposal. As to the details of the proposal, I have some concerns to highlight.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Commission must take greater account of mixed fisheries which are impacted by recovery plans. Crucially I am not convinced that the Commission has learned the lessons from the dangers of displacing effort, as we saw in the north of Scotland last year. The Commission must ensure that scientific advice is reliable and verifiable, not just in determining what areas should be closed but determining the effect of such closures. The removal of ceilings on financial contributions under the FIFG is to be welcomed. But the Commission has failed to propose a system which ensures that there is equal treatment of fishermen subject to recovery measures and that it is not promoting unfair competition between fishermen from different Member States. I hope the Commission will heed the committee's amendment calling for Community funding which is not dependent on cofinancing to compensate fishermen under these plans.</p>
<p class="contents">Safety is of paramount importance. While public aid for modernisation and renewal should not be a bottomless pit, it should be available for improvements to safety. A combination of ageing vessels and days-at-sea restrictions could be a lethal combination. It is vital that safety be taken into account when measuring the impact of recovery plans and, for that matter, fisheries management in general. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank Mr Albert Jan Maat from the bottom of my heart. That was a great occasion, and I can only confirm – as I think you will too – that fish are a good thing.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to talk up the vote on stock rebuilding as the fateful question in the run-up to the fisheries reform, but I do hope that those who reject the Commission's proposal for a regulation as submitted, will after all agree to a compromise tomorrow morning, a compromise that would again permit hake alongside cod, just as the Commission had rightly proposed. I, too, have had second thoughts in the meantime. Like others, I still have hope, as I have in the meantime re-examined the matter; I have not done this completely off my own bat, but have taken scientific bases, ICES for example, as my starting point. Who would seriously call their data into question? Has the Commission submitted a proposal including measures to recover the stocks of cod and hake? That stocks of both species are severely threatened has been disputed by nobody here this evening, and so, if we want to be consistent, hake must not be left out, and the sceptics should bear in mind that prevention is better than cure.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to get to grips with the biological realities and the problems nature creates for an exact analysis of the stock. Fish swim. That is why nobody can count their precise number, and also why casting doubt on ICES' recommendations is a popular sport. We have for a considerable time been able to see where that leads, not only with cod and hake, and not only in European waters.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like fisheries to be economically sustainable, environmentally responsible and socially acceptable. If this is to happen, our prime need is for healthy stocks. Action is needed to break the vicious circle of more and better boats chasing fewer and fewer fish. Now! Excess capacity is being cut back in other sectors of the economy as well, and that is something that fisheries will, unfortunately, have to get used to, as European fisheries have to be maintained, but standing on their own feet, not kept alive by Europe, and not without fish in our own waters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, I feel I must make my rejection of this regulation clear, particularly with regard to hake, which suffers irrational and unjustifiable damage as a result of being treated together with cod. On the other hand, however, I believe that this will provide a valuable tool for calling into question the reform of the CFP, which was proposed by Commissioner Franz Fischler and presented by the Commission to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The weakness of the Commission’s arguments becomes apparent simply from reading the Stihler report’s explanatory statement, particularly when the Commission attempts to base the regulation on supposedly reliable scientific studies. As the rapporteur points out, the proposal for measures was approved in 2001, on the basis of the information supplied by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, even before the drastic reductions of the TACs agreed for 2001 had been implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur points out, the scientific considerations are full of ambiguities and uncertainties. To quote from the text: ‘For hake, the decline in stocks has been less dramatic and therefore the scientific evidence is less clear cut and indeed the subject of some dispute’. I continue: 'Disagreement occurs over whether the two species [hake and cod] should be treated together, the speed at which recovery should be attempted and hence the severity of the measures necessary and what precisely those measures should be.’ etc.</p>
<p class="contents">The report highlights, furthermore and above all, the impact and the economic effects that have not been addressed in the draft regulation. These, Madam President, are the many consequences that will occur or which are already occurring, in a sector which will become much more crucial and dangerous as a result of the unfair and irrational Fischler reform of the common fisheries policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is going to be very painful for all fishermen, because it will mean that there will be many reductions in the catch and many job losses. She refers to that in her report. There are some measures there to help fishermen.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing we can be sure of is that fish do not recognise any border or boundary. We must also recognise that this is a cod and hake report. I want to make sure that we urge all colleagues to vote for hake to be reintroduced to this report. Otherwise we will be sitting here in the not very distant future saying that the hake stocks have been reduced so dramatically that we need even more draconian measures in order to reinstate them. The rapporteur said that hake stocks have been reduced by 50% since 1980, so we must take measures to make sure that they improve.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to accept that when fish are swimming in the sea they do not separate themselves out neatly, so when you go out to fish one particular species you cannot always be sure that is the only species you catch. We have to take a wider look at all the conservation measures. We must in particular find a solution to discards of fish, tradable quotas when you come ashore or whatever it may be. There must be a way to stop discarding healthy fish, because the stocks are not there and we must make sure that they are built up again.</p>
<p class="contents">We have only to look at what has happened in Canada to see that if you carry on fishing then there is going to be no fish for anybody. It is also wrong for one particular Member State to exert enormous political pressure to try and have hake removed from this report and then try to get more fish for itself. At the end of the day it does not matter what nationality we are. If there are no fish, there are no stocks and nobody will be able to fish. We have to be sure that these measures are put in place.</p>
<p class="contents">I again congratulate the rapporteur and ask that we all vote for what was originally a cod and hake report – and make sure that we do have a cod and hake report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do so because the situations of the cod and hake stocks are very different. If they are not excluded, we will be putting at risk thousands of jobs and an industry on which many coastal communities in the European Union depend for their living, on no verified, irrefutable technical-scientific grounds.</p>
<p class="contents">This socio-economic consequence should be a good enough reason to make us think, but there are other reasons too: the proposal is based on an alleged scientific study, but by November 2001 the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries was pointing out that the precautionary points of reference used by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea were not currently valid and, besides, recommended that they should be reviewed immediately. As nobody, no administration, has a monopoly on common sense and doing the right thing, there is an obvious need for a scientific advisory appeal mechanism, a need for peer review and, of course, a need to listen to and analyse in depth what the affected sector seriously has to say with their verified and verifiable arguments and studies. When decisions of great social significance are to be adopted, they need to be very well grounded; the studies on which they are based have to be irrefutable.</p>
<p class="contents">All that has been said so far, ladies and gentlemen, does not mean opposing other serious and responsible alternative measures for conserving and improving hake stocks until such time as the studies have been completed and confirmed, but we must not support measures that may have irreversible consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">It must, of course, be possible to apply the precautionary principle without causing economic disasters or social upheavals. A balance is possible, and the Commission must seek it. A first step will be verified, confirmed studies, which will show we are quite right and provide us with arguments. Things have to be done properly, especially when our fishermen are clearly at risk of being seriously harmed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As many here are aware, this proposal foreshadows many aspects to be discussed in future on the overall reform of the common fisheries policy. If we cannot collaborate to secure recovery of our fish stocks, the future of fish and fishermen cannot be ensured.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now comment on the amendments. On Amendment No 1, the Commission cannot accept this amendment, which would remove reference to hake from the proposal. ICES has advised that the stock of hake is in danger of collapse. If this is the case, the Commission must act to rectify this situation. The only alternative assessment of the state of the stock is that prepared at the request of the <span class="italic">Instituto Español de Oceanografía</span> by Canadian fishery scientist, Mr Maguire. During the discussions in Council working parties, Spain has not challenged the validity of the ICES assessment of the historical development of the hake stock or of the current state of that stock. Spain has challenged one of the so-called precautionary reference points against which the state of the stock is judged. In detail, the Spanish officials have proposed that the value of 165 000 tonnes in the Commission proposal should be changed to 145 000 tonnes. This position does not contradict the perception that the stock is in danger of collapse. It perhaps means that it is in less danger, but the dangers still exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Amendment No 2, the Commission feels that this amendment is unnecessary since account is already consistently taken of scientific reports on environmental effects, to the extent that these effects are scientifically documented and quantified. An example is the effect of low salinity in recent years on reproductive success of cod in the Baltic. The other factors mentioned in the amendment lie beyond the scope of the common fisheries policy and therefore it would be inappropriate to refer to them in this proposal. Furthermore it remains a fact that for cod, hake and many other fish stocks, fishing is the main cause of mortality and the reduction of fishing is the most likely way to achieve recovery of the stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Amendment No 3, the Commission is already working on improvement of all aspects of scientific advice. Any communication on this topic will be included in the second package of reform proposals, which will be presented to this Parliament in the near future. Furthermore, it is not correct to say that the necessary analysis of the correlation between fishing effort and mortality rates or the appropriate level of tax has not been made for the year 2002. For those reasons the Commission cannot accept that amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Amendment No 4, the Commission can agree in principle with this analysis, since TACs are not instruments which will necessarily solve the problem of discards. The problem will only be solved if selectivity of fishing gears is increased or if fishing is reduced or prohibited in geographical areas in which small fish congregate. That aspect has been dealt with in a series of Commission and Council regulations emanating from the emergency situation with cod and hake. Also the Commission is currently working on an action plan on discards in the framework of the CFP reform. This amendment is therefore not necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Amendment No 5, the Commission cannot accept this amendment, since it takes the view that public aid for vessel modernisation should be used only for the safety of fishing vessels, whereas the amendment implies that other objectives might also be eligible for aid. Aid which is likely to enhance the fishing power of fleets is no longer acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Amendment No 6, the Commission cannot accept this amendment since real time closures need to be enacted very rapidly. The inclusion of the Council in this mechanism would take much more time. Once the Council has taken a decision, real time closure would no longer be efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 7 is accepted: there has been a typographical error. Regarding Amendment No 8, the Commission is in the process of considering the impact of a lower annual variation in TAC level on stock recovery. That is a point on which the Council has also expressed some reservations.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Amendment No 9, the Commission cannot accept that amendment. Technical measures are dealt with in a different legislative proposal. Technical measures which are acceptable to Member States will bring about some improvement to the present situation, but do not go far enough. The Commission indicated earlier that only about 20% of the desired reduction in fishing mortality will be achieved by the application. A limitation of fishing effort is therefore also required. Compulsory scrapping of vessels is not mentioned in the proposal and it is not intended for the future CFP. TACs will be proposed at levels concordant with scientific advice.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Amendment No 10, the Commission cannot accept that amendment. Hake are not caught only by industrial fishing vessels and cod are caught in very small quantities. A proposal for 5% reflects the probable catches of cod and is therefore proportionate to the objective pursued.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 11. While it is difficult to calculate the amount of a supplementing premium needed to generate more interest in scrapping, 20% is already a significant increase and corresponds to previous practice in similar situations, for example structural measures for the ex-Morocco fleet in Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 12. We see no reason to restrict safety-related aid to smaller vessels, that is, those of less than 12 metres. The recent proposals for CFP reform propose that all vessels should be eligible for such aid, provided that it does not affect the fishing capacity of the vessel.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 13. This is a very expensive form of aid, which does not reduce the underlying problem of over-capacity. Only short-term measures of this kind can be justified. To accept Community co-financing for a longer period would significantly reduce the availability of Community funds for co-financing of scrapping, which is clearly the priority objective in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 14 is not acceptable to the Commission, since the Community cannot accept full responsibility for aid of this kind. Co-financing is a fundamental principle for structural aid.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 15. A specification of the duration of the plan is not acceptable. The stocks will be deemed to have recovered whenever, for two consecutive years, science indicates that quantities of mature fish have been in excess of defined levels. Reference is made in the last Paragraph of the explanatory memorandum to the Commission's intention to conduct an impact study within 18 months of adoption of the proposal. This might be supported by the addition of texts in an article of the proposal, but the reference in the explanatory memorandum should be sufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Amendment No 16, a review process can be envisaged, but not on an annual basis. It will take some time for the proposed measures to take effect. The earliest point in time would be after two full years of operation. Reference is made in the last paragraph of the explanatory memorandum to the Commission's intention to conduct an impact study within 18 months of adoption of the proposal. This might be supported by the addition of texts in an article of the proposal, but the reference in the explanatory memorandum should be sufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to refer to some additional remarks made by Members of Parliament. To begin with, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna referred to the scientific advice on which we base our proposal. That advice is the advice of ICES. Despite its shortcomings, which nobody denies, the ICES advice is by far the best available. The reform of the common fisheries policy prioritises the improvement of scientific advice. In the meantime we have to work with the best advice we have, which is the ICES advice. This is also in reply to Mrs Miguélez Ramos. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
