<p class="contents">We must bear in mind that policies relating to people with disabilities are national policies. What we were trying to do in 2003 was to find all the methods, tools and gateways which we can use to give European added value to national policies.</p>
<p class="contents">So far, the Year has achieved significant results to do with raising awareness about the rights of people with disabilities. We have had thousands of events in all the Member States at national, regional and local level, debates in parliament, fora and exchanges of best practices between the Member States, while of course the non-governmental organisations and the Disabled People's Movement have also made a real contribution to an explosion of events and to passing on the message about the rights of people with disabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament supported the Year without reservation right from the start. On 3 November 2003, the first reading about lifelong learning facilities was organised with young people with disabilities and a few days ago, on 10 and 11 November, the European Parliament of People with Disabilities sat and passed a resolution on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we should emphasise that the Year marks the start of a European procedure and that all the efforts and planning do not come to an end at the end of the year. It is especially important that we use the momentum created and we must say that today, in every country, initiatives and innovative action are being taken, which was not the case in the past, and we also have important, exceptionally advanced legislation in certain countries.</p>
<p class="contents">On 30 October, the Commission issued a communication about the follow-up needed to this Year. There are three basic objectives:</p>
<p class="contents">The first is to achieve the adoption and full application of the directive on equal treatment of the disabled in employment and at work.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is the successful incorporation of issues relating to people with disabilities in all policies. This relates to our agreement on mainstreaming, so that this policy is not just a matter for the ministries of social affairs or the ministries of health or the ministries of employment, but is a horizontal policy which concerns all the ministries in each country and all portfolios at the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The third is improving access for all people with disabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the first issue of the application of the directive is concerned, ladies and gentlemen, I would remind you that, in the year 2000, an anti-discrimination directive was adopted in record time, which was unprecedented in the European Union, but of course we have to say that its promotion by the Member States did not proceed at the rate we expected. Today, a large number of countries have still not adopted the draft directive on equal treatment for people subject to discrimination. The deadline expires at the end of December and, basically, only two countries have adopted the directive. However, we have to go beyond adoption to implementation, where important changes will be needed to the rules which apply today in certain Member States. This will have an impact on employers, in both the public and private sectors, and on the working practices applied to people with disabilities, because the directive, which concerns reasonable adaptations, will have to be applied to the letter. In other words, the workplace will have to be adapted to the needs of people with disabilities. The Commission will perform its duty in full as guardian of the Treaty, as regards the adoption of the directive at the correct moment in time, its proper transposition – not in the wrong way and not without there being specific references to the European text – and of course its implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication, as I said earlier, also focussed on the issue of horizontal policies relating to people with disabilities, in other words incorporation into all individual policies. We already have examples at European level, with an important step in the field of transport and in the field of electronic communications, for which Commissioners de Palacio and Liikanen are responsible. The incorporation of these issues into all the relevant policies must focus mainly on access issues, access to goods, services and buildings, and must be linked to the principle of 'design for all' expressed in the Commission communication which immediately preceded this communication.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication introduces a multiannual, rolling action plan. The first priority is employment, which is also the most important factor for the social integration of people with disabilities. I would say that our philosophy is essentially encapsulated in the slogan that people with disabilities must have the right to work and not to benefits. Consequently, the first stage in the application of the action plan, which is to be developed between 2004 and 2005, will concentrate on putting the necessary conditions in place for promoting the employment of people with disabilities. Today we calculate that there are 3 million people with disabilities in Europe who could be integrated into the labour market. There is an even bigger number who, with special policies, with investment in these people and with skills which matched their capabilities, could be integrated into the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">Our policy for the workplace will focus on four priorities: access to and staying in employment, lifelong learning, new technologies – which we consider to be one of the most crucial elements – because, with innovation and research, a series of new tools really can give people with all sorts of disabilities the power to deal with their disabilities. At the same time, however, these tools must be cheap and accessible to everyone. Today, the European market is extremely difficult for these people. Every country has its own specifications to a large degree, each social system is linked to its own undertakings. This results in the same tools being cheap in one country and expensive in another. Hence, this field of new technologies and access for people with disabilities to the technologies in question at European level is one of the challenges and, finally, the fourth priority is access to public buildings.</p>
<p class="contents">As one way of supporting the successful incorporation of these issues in policies, the Commission is proposing the publication of a biennial report on developments in each Member State, focussing each time on planning and new choices of priorities. We think that this report, the first of which will be published in 2005, will be an important tool for exerting pressure on the Member States, who will have to announce developments at institutional level and at implementation level, which we shall publish every two years.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission is proposing to further strengthen the contribution of all the interested parties and of the basic protagonists in the policy-making dialogue, so that we have major and permanent changes in the economy and society as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to express my satisfaction about the facility being given to carry out a study, as called for by Parliament, on the situation of people with disabilities living in institutions, who make up another large category of our fellow citizens, with special problems of another sort. Of course, this type of problem has a very large dimension in the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the expectations of the Year were great. I believe that we have significant results, especially if we think – as I stressed in my introduction – that these policies are, to a large extent, almost purely national policies. I believe, however, that with all this activation during the Year in 2003, the issue of people with disabilities became a top priority on the political agenda both of the Member States and of the European Union itself. Most importantly, however, it brought the policy of the Disabled People's Movement itself to the forefront, by putting into practice the slogan 'Nothing about us without us', meaning they must be involved at all planning and decision-making levels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He explicitly stated that the Union Presidency would take steps to lay the foundations for legislative measures to combat discrimination, producing, in practice, a directive protecting the independence and equal rights of millions of people with disabilities in all aspects of daily life in the new Europe, giving them genuine hope for the future. However, to date, the Commission has neither provided a timetable for a future horizontal directive on the rights of people with disabilities, covering not just work but all aspects of life too, nor even given specific undertakings to integrate the rights of people with disabilities into policy, as confirmed in the recent communication, which would seem, rather, to be no more than the announcement of good intentions. Indeed, it is not clear how the objective of boosting equal opportunities is to be achieved if such opportunities are only available in certain aspects of life such as work.</p>
<p class="contents">Here are some examples: with the directive on employment, the Commission’s aim is to achieve full employment of people with disabilities, which would be a step towards eliminating discrimination. This is all well and good, but how is a person to penetrate the labour market nowadays and work towards getting a worthwhile, high-quality job if people with disabilities are not provided with adequate teaching, education and training, for instance? Integration starts early on, as you can see; indeed, it has to start at school. People with disabilities are not divided into sectors or compartments of inactivity, they are girls and boys, men and women who are entitled to full integration, not integration in some areas: thousands of children with disabilities in Europe still live in institutes rather than with their families, for example. The coordination method could come to our aid here too, but there is too little mention of it in the communication.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would say that the European Year is certainly closing with quite a positive result as regards the goals set of raising awareness of disability issues. I feel that what was lacking was a specific, effective measure from the Commission, which did not act diligently on the strong, firm pressure from Parliament or the calls from the Council Presidency. I will end by calling on President Prodi, if Mrs Diamantopoulou will relay the message, to be, perhaps, a little more active and more diligent, even though the Commission is at the end of its term of office, as regards an issue, the issue of disability, which is of such great importance in human, social and cultural terms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gillig (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is true that 2003 is drawing to a close and with it the European Year of People with Disabilities. It is the perfect time to take stock of the situation, but also to reflect on the future of Community policy in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">The achievements of this year should be welcomed, Commissioner; it has been a unique opportunity, as you hoped it would be, to promote the rights of people with disabilities and to take into account their legitimate claim to play a full part in social, economic and political life. The momentum created by this year, with thousands of varied events on offer at national, regional and local level, is considerable, and we are grateful to you.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, however, we need to capitalise on this momentum and use this experience as a launching pad for new measures, both at the level of the Member States and at Community level. The communication that you are tabling does, I believe, properly reflect what is at stake here. I welcome this, but think that it also needs to be said, as one of my fellow Members already has done, that, given the reticence of Member States, greater affirmation of political will is still needed in this field. The lack of enthusiasm shown by Member States to transpose the directive on equal treatment in employment, for example, should be widely denounced, and compels us to do even more.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the Party of European Socialists has a clear position in this regard, and my colleagues and I are convinced that difficulties related to disability should be addressed across the board in an integrated way, taking as our model existing legislation on equal opportunities between men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">We were very keen to improve a number of legislative texts. You mentioned transport. I should like to say that where corporate social responsibility is concerned, companies’ policies on disability should be one of the criteria for assessing that responsibility and the quality of their contribution to society.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the European Parliament of Disabled People, which met last week, regretted the fact that a specific European directive on disability would not be concluded during this important year. Admittedly, the gamble taken on the employment issue is absolutely fundamental – no one can dispute that – but we want to believe, Commissioner, that this is just one step towards implementing Community legislation that needs to be even more ambitious.</p>
<p class="contents">Where disability is concerned, perhaps more than in other areas, I think it is appropriate to finish by sharing with you a personal conviction. These Community legislative measures are essential, and we recognise this, given the impetus that they should unleash, but we also know that it is at national, regional and local level that a whole series of coordinated policies need to be brought on stream, policies that must be accommodated within civil society by industry, the social partners and – let us not forget, where school-related issues are concerned – teachers.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, allow me to say, Commissioner, Mr President, that where rights are concerned and where the dignity of those who today live with a disability is concerned, we cannot afford to rely solely on Member States’ goodwill. We need to come up with greater incentives, as I hope you are doing in the communication. We are counting on your multiannual report, Commissioner, precisely to exert pressure on those Member States that are not moving in quite the direction that we are recommending. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As rapporteur for the European Year of People with Disabilities, all of us set out with very high hopes for this year. We wanted to see positive outcomes and indeed that is what I wrote in my report. We need to mainstream disabled peoples' rights, get away from the medical model of disability once and for all and move to the social or rights-based model of disability. We also need to highlight the achievements of disabled people.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of those things have been done, but I did not want this just to be a pat on the back for the Member States for having held conferences in major cities, or for them to say simply 'how wonderful we are to have had a European Year of People with Disabilities'. We must make sure that disabled people really are at the top of the political agenda and that means that the employment directive must be fully implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to know which countries have not implemented the employment directive, which countries have not put into place anything to start to implement that directive and what sanctions the Commission is going to take against those countries to make sure they implement it.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we need, as Mr Mantovani and Mrs Gillig said, a specific disability directive. If we do not get that specific directive, I, along with a lot of disabled peoples' organisations, feel that the European Year of People with Disabilities will have been a failure. I am sorry to have to say that because we have made some progress, but without the commitment to a disability directive we have not gone far enough. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Everyone had hoped for much more, however, at both Community and national level, particularly in my country – Portugal – which suffers from serious social problems, the highest rate of poverty in the European Union, many forms of discrimination and has seen cuts in fundamental public investment in areas such as education and health. These factors have hit people with disabilities particularly hard, in the name of complying with the irrational criteria of the Stability Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">Regrettably, we are reaching the end of this European Year without having made any progress on a disability policy and without issues relating to discrimination and the human rights of these individuals being made the top priority of the various Community policies. Until this is done, there can be no real social inclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">I must point out that the report I drafted on the scoreboard on implementing the Social Policy Agenda, which Parliament adopted in September, focused on the need to present a proposal during this Year of People with Disabilities for a directive based on Article 13 of the Treaty to combat discrimination on grounds of disability. Regrettably, this did not happen. In the documents adopted by the European Parliament of Disabled People last week, priority was also given to the call for this new directive to prevent the raising of further obstacles and to stipulate that the existing obstacles faced by people with disabilities must be eliminated throughout the European Union. This should really happen in the near future. The directive on equal treatment in the field of employment and occupation should also be transposed, establishing a broad definition of disability and laying down strict and effective penalties to be applied if the law is broken. We hope that this year will spark effective policies in this field of supporting people with disabilities and bring recognition of their rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What do we see? Can a year really make any difference? Have we been able to achieve anything concrete that could help us to have an impact on the day-to-day existence and quality of life of disabled people? I would hope after this year some permanent changes will remain in the way at least some disabled people cope in their everyday life. A good example would be the use of assistance dogs throughout the Union, which, along with technical tools and information technology, mean greater scope socially, educationally, and professionally for people with visual, aural and motion disabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">I will take this opportunity to thank Commissioner Diamantopoulou for her genuine interest and encouragement regarding this issue, which I hope will continue to make progress and extend throughout the new Member States too, possibly with the aid of EU funding.</p>
<p class="contents">There is nevertheless the question of how to incorporate accessibility, non-discrimination, and full citizens’ rights for people with disabilities in major policy lines at all levels. Right now too we are introducing more major areas of policy for the future. I am involved in adapting a proposal for a directive on public procurement and we are now trying to settle two important issues for people with disabilities and the enforcement of their citizens’ rights. To what extent can we take the special needs of disabled people into account in planning the built environment and its other physical aspects and developing transport and other services? Another essential question that remains unanswered is the criteria for production methods.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, it is also mainly a matter of democracy. These two directives involve taking important decisions on just how great the power of decision of the local authorities should be. Furthermore, there is an implied danger under the new draft constitution that healthcare and other social services would be opened up to competition. How then would the special needs of people with disabilities be affected? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would, in fact, like all of us, as much as possible, to try to act on the recommendations that this Parliament made. Despite the fact that a large proportion of the policy for the disabled – particularly its medical component – is national policy, it is, however, the case that employment policy, social exclusion policy and internal market policy are of key importance to people with disabilities. I therefore hope that the Commission will give this due consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">The main reason why we are here today is, of course, as various speakers have already mentioned, this specific directive. I believe that we should really go ahead and adopt it. Mr President, there is something I fail to understand. The Commission has, after all, always referred to the fact that this directive would be too controversial at this point in time, but, Commissioner, you yourself adopted a draft directive two weeks ago that is much more controversial than what we have here. By so doing, you have, in effect, totally undermined your own argument. If you are prepared to table very controversial directives in another field, then I applaud this, for I am always pleased when the Commission is brave. However, you should at least commission the studies so that it is possible to submit this proposal as soon as possible. That is, after all, what we have asked for.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as you indeed already indicated, we will need to give a great deal of attention to the new Member States. I think that it will be some time yet before we know precisely how policy is conducted over there. I found out this week that certain categories of people with disabilities in some countries are not even entitled to identity cards. A great deal still needs to be done there, but this also applies to the current European Union, because people with disabilities are still too much the invisible citizens whom we forget all too easily. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am myself always sceptical when ‘European Years’ devoted to social policy objectives are declared, and, at the end of them one cannot actually point to anything having been achieved. Such was not the case with this one. This may be because this ‘Year’ was something special, above all in that it promised much, and because the idea for it was put to politicians by non-governmental organisations and associations of handicapped persons. There were discussions of a wide variety of topics, in which disabled people themselves discussed national and European approaches. Rather than having discussions about disabled people, we discussed things with them.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own country, too, a debate has got under way, which has as its objective, not only legislative measures but also, of course, the raising of public awareness. We want unrestricted participation, no longer to be cared for outside society in the way we once were. We want full equality rather than the former demeaning sympathy, and, instead of being patronised by well-meaning people, we want the right to autonomy. For that, of course, we need legislative measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I might add that we in this House agreed that this Year should not remain a one-off, a concern that the Commission’s new action plan takes up. I think the Commission is still being a bit too hesitant as regards the timescale, as we should make use of the present commitment, which is evident everywhere, rather than putting things off for another two or three years. I am also glad that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has managed to get a line inserted into the Budget, not merely for a survey, but for following up all the things that have gone well in this European Year.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to close with a very fine slogan that you, Commissioner, mentioned at a recent event, when you said that we should use ‘Getting on Board’ as a slogan. I would like to end with a slogan for the future, when disabled people will not just be ‘Getting on Board’ but also ‘Staying on Board’.</p>

<p class="contents">In Greece, only 7% of disabled children attend special schools, which are financed by the insured, not the state. For autistic children over 14 years old, there is not one rehabilitation centre, while few children with mental health problems attend some sort of school. Of the 2 000 rehabilitation centres which should exist in Greece, there are only 200 sub-standard centres in Athens.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem of people with disabilities is deeply class-based. Equal opportunities for people with disabilities mean a free national health and welfare service, special education, assistance and dignified work for everyone. It means a different policy, which the European Union, by its very nature, is unable to practice. That is why it takes refuge in ‘lying on a massive scale’, as we say in Greece. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no argument that could justify why this directive has been neither transposed nor implemented. The ultimate deadline is early December, and as far as I am concerned, you can initiate proceedings against Member States that have not done anything by then, and, with the help of Parliament, put pressure on those Member States. Following this, however, a broad directive must be adopted immediately, not only in the form of studies. Studies are a start; something must certainly be done about that too. However, we would like your word in the mean time that this directive will actually be adopted. This was also a request that was made by the European Disability Forum. They have, in fact, got the directive all ready on paper, and we would ask for progress to be made in that area in the meantime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Demands have been made in a number of areas. Now, it is a question of implementing them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner said that mainstreaming should apply to disability issues. I share that view. Disability policy is not a policy area. Disability issues are part and parcel of all policy areas. In those areas in which the EU has competence, disability issues are therefore also an area of responsibility for the EU. For example, one area of competence for the EU is people’s freedom of movement. That applies to everyone, including people with disabilities. Transport is also one of the EU’s areas of competence, and transport for all, including people with disabilities, also falls therefore within the EU’s competence.</p>
<p class="contents">It is regrettable that the Member States have not implemented the directive concerning the equal treatment of people with disabilities in the workplace. That must not be used as an excuse for not producing directives in other policy areas. What signal would that give to those Member States which do not want to do anything? They would, of course, imagine that, if they did not do anything, no further measures would be put in place. We know that directives are needed that cover all the relevant policy areas, and that is what we demand.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude by mentioning two other important areas to which attention should be given over the next few years. The first is the new Member States. Even though we face challenges in the present Member States, the challenges are still greater in the new Member States. The second is the debate about the future. We must push our demand for majority decision-making when it comes to anti-discrimination. The country that is least ambitious where discrimination is concerned must not be allowed to determine the agenda. That is why majority decision-making is needed in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Generally speaking, we have a wealth of material before us which, however, needs to be mastered if we want to have an integrated policy on people with disabilities. This is the most difficult point of the entire strategy. If we want to be efficient, we need to focus our policy on three objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">First, we need to persuade the constitution writers that it is high time we moved on to a new generation of rights which are recognised in the countries' constitutions as an integral part of fundamental rights, because only if people with disabilities are recognised as having special rights will they too be able to enjoy the fundamental rights which are generally recognised for all citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need to persuade finance ministers to recognise that expenditure on people with disabilities should be seen not as consumer spending, but as an investment in human potential and, consequently, as productive expenditure. This will pave the way for taking the measures needed to stop the exclusion of these people.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, but equally importantly, we need to introduce a strategy to convince the rest of the population that the problems of people with disabilities relate not to a specific category, but to society as a whole, if we want to have a society with cohesion and superior living standards. In other words, the indifference or even, on numerous occasions, the negative attitude of our fellow citizens towards the special characteristics of these people needs to be overcome. Only if the problem of people with disabilities becomes a common problem will it have an auspicious outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, as far as the employment sector is concerned, we need to persuade businessmen that they stand to gain a great deal from becoming involved in measures to support these people and make use of their potential in undertakings because, as experience to date has shown, these people are the most loyal of employees.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I should like to congratulate you on the initiative which you have taken and on the programme which you have announced; however, both I and my fellow Members would say that, if it is to be successful, it needs to be integrated straight away and to include legislative measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For example, the boy from the north of England who had learning difficulties and was written off by the education service, but was then found to have musical ability. Whereas had he had a job in industry he could not have read the safety signs, he went on to play in the orchestra at Covent Garden. Then there is the dancer who trained at the Ballet Rambert School. She was profoundly deaf, but learnt to dance through the rhythm of her feet and went on to dance with the Portuguese National Ballet. I knew a tiny, frail, 23-year-old girl who had been confined to a wheelchair all her life and had undergone 26 lifesaving operations. She was a trainee at the SHARE community. She decided to do a sponsored wheelchair push, self-propelling the wheels with her tiny hands. As she herself said, it was the first time in her life she had the opportunity to help other disabled people.</p>
<p class="contents">People can and do achieve, despite severe physical and mental disabilities. For a few that means successful careers in business, politics, the arts or professions. For most it means more local, private, domestic achievements: coping with living and contributing to the lives of those around them. We have a duty to help not in an intrusive or invasive way, but by removing legal, physical and psychological barriers. They bring the courage. They deserve from us the opportunity and the dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">In government I was able to bring in a system of direct payments so that a person was not provided for by social service departments if he or she preferred to have the cash equivalent to purchase the services from the supplier of their choice. If you buy your own services, meals, transport and so on, then you are in charge, you have a form of dignity and independence which too often is lacking in the relationship between state services and citizens. That is the route we should be seeking from this year on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At the weekend, I was told by one group in my constituency that they are happy that the European Year will have some follow-up, but they want clarity about what that will be. As Mr Bouwman said, they were promised an employment directive that would be implemented by Member States, and yet they see the Member States still dragging their feet. That is not to say that the Commission and colleagues have not pushed those Member States to implement the employment directive in its disability provisions, but it is not being implemented. They are therefore concerned that implementation will be lacking in other spheres. They want to see action after 2003, not merely more words. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That, at least, is the message in speeches made on solemn occasions. Actual practice leaves a lot to be desired, however. The European Year of People with Disabilities is coming to an end. In the course of the year, the searchlight has been directed to a more than usual degree upon the situation of people with disabilities, and it has revealed a lot of shortcomings. It is excellent that these deficiencies are being brought to light, but something also needs to be done about them.</p>
<p class="contents">The equal value of every person must, then, also be the criterion for what needs to be done. People with disabilities are still discriminated against. It is not a matter of isolated cases. Instead, discrimination is the rule, rather than the exception. What is at issue is being able to cope successfully in everyday life, faced with a lack of jobs and problems using shops, post offices and banks, buses, trains and ’planes. It is about being able to use public services and to read newspapers, watch television and listen to the radio. The fact is, there is a host of difficulties for people with disabilities, making clear the need there now is for a new, all-embracing directive concerning the rights of people with disabilities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like, however, to say that this European Year has already been an enormous success, because never has there been so much discussion about this issue in so many different places and never have we been so aware of everything that we need to do, at all levels of responsibility, wherever we happen to be in the European Union. The year has, therefore, been a great success. This is a first step towards the future, as has been said, and I therefore wish to conclude this debate on a note of much-needed optimism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Allow me too, however, to express my disappointment at some sort of criticism which was voiced. I imagine that, not only the Members of the European Parliament, but also the Commissioners sometimes have the right to express such disappointment. I shall explain what I mean at once.</p>
<p class="contents">I have repeatedly supported the need for there to be a horizontal directive. And I have explained the reasons. I shall certainly come back to why this could not be proposed at this specific moment in time. However, I want us to focus on what has happened, on all the policies developed, all the fights fought, because I want to assure you, Mr Pronk, that I at least believe that I have shown considerable courage – as much as my position allows – in order to put forward the directives proposed. They were not easy, I can assure you. When I submitted them to the Commission, there were public administrators who bet their positions that they would never get through the Commission. They passed the required majority of 12 votes. When they went to the Council, there were public statements that there was not one chance in a hundred that these directives would get through. Yet the directives got through in record time. The directives in question – and to be more specific the workplace directive – are now a huge wager which we, the European institutions, have against the national administrations. I have been in contact for the last two years with all the ministers in all the Member States. I have set up a team of experts, which has recorded the difficulties in applying these directives in each Member State. These difficulties are not simply a question of political will. It is not that the ministers or some governments are refusing to apply something which they agreed on three years ago. There are constitutional problems, there are political problems, there are legal and economic problems, because this is the first time we have had this sort of directive at European level and the majority of Member States did not have the basic experience needed to apply or, more to the point, adopt it within their legislative framework.</p>
<p class="contents">So here we are, one month before the adoption of the legislation, which means, Mr Bouwman, that I do not have any facility to take the Member States to court. Wait until the end of December and then you can check if the Commission is doing its job. One month before the deadline and we only have two countries with the legislation. We are not talking about application. We are talking about adopting the legislation. There are many countries which have not yet drafted a bill. That is because there are huge problems in their parliaments. So that is the situation today.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective, the political objective, must be for us to focus on the implementation of what we agreed on. I would ask the honourable Members, as I have repeatedly asked the Disabled People's Movement, to make this their top priority in their countries. Governments need to be criticised for failing to honour their obligations. There needs to be a public debate as to why we are not applying European legislation. A number of Members said that the European Union is all about grand speeches, nice resolutions, communications and conferences. I have spoken about legislation. I shall tell you what we have done in practice for mainstreaming over the last two years.</p>
<p class="contents">With the Commissioner for competition, Mr Monti, we are making exceptions for the first time from the state aid rules and allowing subsidies for workers with disabilities. For the first time, we are making an exception with Mr Bolkestein, the Commissioner for the internal market, for VAT on tools used by people with disabilities. For the first time, Mrs de Palacio is submitting legislation on access for people with disabilities to transport, and with Mr Liikanen we are organising the whole e-accessibility programme giving people with disabilities access to the electronic sector. And we can take it for granted that these often involve real acrobatics at the level of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">When we come to the content of the proposed directive, I should like to remind you of the areas apart from employment. They are education, health and welfare, the social systems and benefits, taxation and, as Mr Mantovani mentioned, the question of political participation. As I said, honourable Members, I have talked to all the ministers about these matters, so that we can see how to prepare the next step. I leave it to you to assess the reactions of the ministers for education to interventions by European legislation in education and of the ministers for health and welfare to interventions by European legislation in health and welfare and social systems. I consider the question of taxation far easier and I consider the question of European legislation on the participation of people with disabilities in the political systems of the Member States impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason I am referring to individual policies is to show how difficult the second step is. By which I mean a directive which relates to anything apart from employment, when we are totally unable to apply the first legislative act.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Pronk criticised me because I demonstrated courage and because, with so many clashes, I proposed article 13 on equality of the sexes and because I have arguments for one and not for the other. I shall explain to you at once, Mr Pronk. Legislation on sexual equality in the workplace goes back thirty years. For thirty years now we have been passing European legislation, implementing, improving, reverting and cooperating and now we are completely reforming, recasting the legislation on sexual equality so that we can take the second step. With the second step, I think every Member of the European Parliament has been following not the clash, but the furious attack at the mere announcement of the proposal. It is not a question of courage here. I think that for a politician to put forward clashing issues also has its positive side. Knowing the extent to which what you propose is implemented is a matter of responsibility. I can assure you that I had no problem whatsoever with being the good Commissioner, compared to all the other bad Commissioners who rejected the directive in question.</p>
<p class="contents">I took a little longer, but after one year of the ‘Year of People with Disabilities’ and after four years with policy for people with disabilities firmly on the European agenda, with specific achievements and not just words, with legislation and with policies which are changing the daily life of European citizens, I really do think that what Mrs Lynne said about it being a failure if there is no proposal for a directive was truly unfair. I really cannot accept that statement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
