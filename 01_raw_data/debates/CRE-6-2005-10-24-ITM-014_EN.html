I would like to thank Mrs Pack in particular for the commitment and expertise she has brought to the report.</p>
<p class="contents">In the present political climate our policies need more than ever to be directly relevant to citizens’ real needs. Education and training is where the benefits of European integration are directly felt by millions of citizens. Therefore, I am very grateful also for Mr Böge’s report for the temporary committee on the financial perspective. It is an important statement of support in a difficult financial context. My thanks are due also to the rapporteurs of the other committees that contributed opinions on this Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me comment briefly on the amendments proposed in this report. I am pleased to say that the Commission is able to accept, either word for word or in substance, 39 of the 79 amendments proposed by Parliament. These changes improve the text, either by introducing new elements and priorities or by clarifying existing ones.</p>
<p class="contents">There are 16 amendments which, I regret, the Commission cannot accept because they either go beyond Community competence or are not compatible with the structure of the programme, four of which relate to the Parliament’s resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">That leaves a further 20 amendments which raise some substantial issues on which I would like to comment. Regarding amendments which derogate from the Financial Regulation or its implementing rules, four amendments to the annex to the decision – amendments 67, 68, 69 and 71 – would derogate from the existing implementing rules for the European Union budget. They would introduce the sort of simplification identified as necessary by the Commission in its explanatory memorandum to the programme proposal, such as extending the use of lump sums or lump-sum grants, reducing the administrative requirements on applicants for small grants and so on. So we have no argument with the substance of these amendments. However, the Commission believes that such provisions should initially be sought by revising the Financial Regulation and its implementing rules themselves. Changing the Community financial framework in sectoral programmes makes this framework much harder to read and to understand. Therefore, the Commission believes it is too early to include such provisions in the decision on lifelong learning.</p>
<p class="contents">On the named institutions: the new programme will support the operating costs of some institutions which do high-quality work in education and training at European level and which are important partners for the European Union. The prime criterion for their selection will be quality. This means using calls for proposals where the grounds for selection are set out in advance and every applicant can measure itself against these criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Exceptionally, the Commission has proposed four institutions as eligible for operating grant support without a call for proposals. These four involve Member State governments in their governance and funding. Government involvement guarantees an important degree of quality and of commitment to the objectives, purpose and future development of these designated institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at the six institutions Parliament proposes for nomination, the Commission concludes that the European Agency for Development in Special Needs Education, which has intergovernmental funding and governance arrangements, is consistent with the logic of our original proposal. Therefore, we accept the amendment to this effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Briefly, on the budgetary amendments: a group of amendments relate to the budget of the programme. I am most grateful, as I have said, for the rapporteur’s proposal to increase the budget to EUR 14 600 million, and I can fully subscribe to her underlying reasons. However, the Commission cannot, pending an agreement on the Financial Perspectives, amend its original proposal, so I must reserve the position on the 10 amendments concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in order for the programme to start on time, the decision needs to be made and adopted as soon as possible in 2006. I know this is a challenging timetable and depends very much on the timing of an agreement on the Financial Perspective, but I can assure you the Commission will do everything it can to help this Parliament and the Council reach agreement rapidly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even so, as there are, proverbially, many roads that lead to Rome, this House has included even more new approaches, and we should try to take a good look at all of them at least once.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me explain, for the sake of completeness, what sub-programmes we are dealing with here: the programme has to do, overall, with general and vocational education, and it is a good thing that vocational education is now included. The programme enables everyone to take part in educational programmes virtually from the cradle to the grave.</p>
<p class="contents">The first programme open to all is ‘Comenius’. It is aimed at those who have to attend school in any case; to those for whom school attendance is mandatory, it gives the opportunity to discover at an early age what is meant by cultural differences, or a common approach, to particular issues in different countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Next comes the Erasmus programme, which gives these pupils the opportunity, once they have become students, to spend part of their course in another European country and to take their achievements there back home with them. Running in parallel to that is the Leonardo programme, which enables apprentices and trainees to complete part of their training in the form of a work placement in another European country.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth programme, ‘Grundtvig’, deals with the education of adults, and the fifth, named after Jean Monnet, provides support. This involves the celebrated institutions to which you referred, and to which we want to add two more. I hope that Parliament will agree to this. We do, however, want to continue to support the Jean Monnet chairs and all those things for which your programme already makes provision.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also the horizontal programmes in support of these activities, which overlap with the sectoral programmes that have already been mentioned, particularly in the development of material for language learning, <span class="italic">e-</span>learning and the dissemination of best practice in general and vocational education at national, regional and local level. We have made further improvements to your proposals and have, in particular, emphasised that the Comenius partnerships should enable one pupil in fifteen, rather than one in twenty, to spend a school year abroad, which would add up to a total of 6 million pupils in junior secondary school having the possibility of spending a year as guest students at a school in another EU country.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with my fellow-members of the Committee for Culture and Education, I have also ensured that teachers’ European awareness can be enhanced through the new Comenius Regio programme. We have also proposed that the Erasmus programme’s mobility grant, which has remained unchanged since 1993, should be increased, for EUR 150 is an insufficient sum of money with which to go and live and study in another country, and makes support from parents, grandparents and relatives indispensable. We should, however, be enabling all students to take part in an exchange of this kind, and so we suggest that the monthly grant should be increased by rather more than the Commission has suggested.</p>
<p class="contents">It is of course as important to me as it is to the Commission that there should be a decent reduction in the amount of red tape involved. Administrative and financial constraints on the award and payment of grants must be commensurate with the amount paid out.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me briefly consider the issue of finance. Only indicative figures have been given for the financial resources we are talking about today. Nobody knows how much we will have at our disposal after 2007; that is why the figures – the Commission’s, the Böge Committee’s and our own Committee’s – are no more than indications. We have to wait and see what we will get from the next Presidency of the Council, and so the Culture Committee has taken the liberty of going beyond the figures proposed by the Commission, and also a bit beyond those agreed by the Böge Committee. We should put down a marker; education and training are a vital part of the Lisbon process. We need them, and in order to have them we need more money than the national governments in the European Union are prepared to make available. Many thanks, Commissioner, for the work your staff have done!</p>

I argued that there should be a gradual opening-up of the various programmes to all of our neighbourhood policy countries. It has been proposed that they should be opened up to a number of neighbourhood countries but, given the very good work these programmes have done in encouraging the strengthening of people-to-people contacts, a general consensus should be reached on opening up these programmes more widely, where this can be done effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">I am keen to ensure that the Erasmus Mundus programme will be continued under this heading post-2009, together with the inter-university programme set up last year, which aims to develop democracy and understanding between our various countries. One of the obvious failings of the current proposals, in my view, was the almost complete lack of any reference to developing democratic citizenship. Mention was made of citizenship, but I felt that there was a lack of emphasis on the democratic role. Given that the Commission and the Council had already accepted that this was a necessity and had already agreed to set up the inter-university programme in Venice, this should be supported. I am disappointed that there appears to be a dispute between two Commission DGs as to who should fund this programme in the future. I hope that the problem can be resolved as a matter of urgency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In our opinion, we welcome the proposal’s intention to simplify administration and financial procedures, while criticising the fact that they are still too burdensome and too slow.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to point out that the budget figures are provisional, but the Committee on Budgets does take the view that the amounts proposed by the Commission for this vitally important priority area cannot be regarded as other than very modest. Formal comment on what the Commission has proposed is one thing, but the vote, which is a political matter, will be far more to do with the need to move on in this area and achieve Europe’s vital educational policy goals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Bringing the two together in this way signals our desire not to single out students according to their field of study, be it academic and general, or vocational.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Pack, on the quality of her report and thank her for having taken account of the greater part of the opinions of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, in particular as regards lifelong education and training, which together are acknowledged as being one of the keys to growth and as guaranteeing the quality of jobs. Lifelong training should be a right and should be the specific responsibility of businesses, and these factors should be recognised at Community level as a fundamental social right.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to these programmes, a European space for training and education is gradually being created, and we have a great need of this space to support the labour market. We need greater harmonisation and convergence of qualifications, and we need the skills of European employees to be guaranteed throughout the EU, and thus rewarded appropriately. This seems to us to be an effective guarantee against social dumping. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Equal treatment for different generations, for the non-young, for women, and especially for single mothers, and in this respect we naturally expect an understanding attitude from employers, as well, who must treat life-long education as a strategic interest. We expect that ethnic discrimination will come to an end and those living with disabilities will be able to participate in the education process with full rights.

The Erasmus programme owes a great deal to her tenacity, and the budget increase that she is calling for fully reflects her commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I should like to remind you of the speech made by Mr Barroso in Berlin and of the speeches made by all of the group leaders within Parliament as part of the 70 cents for culture campaign, all of whom promised an increase in the ‘culture’ budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">Three remarks need to be made on the subject of the reform as it is presented to us. The internal market would be more competitive and businesses more mobile if young apprentices were better prepared for being mobile. The protectionist instincts of many small-scale businesses would be thwarted by the practical experience that the Leonardo da Vinci programme gives to young people by allowing them to carry out work placements in other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget estimate that has been made for 150 000 apprentices is insufficient. The Erasmus programme is too elitist, as the sums allocated to the recipients are not enough to fund the total cost of their mobility. The only people who are therefore eligible for this programme are students whose parents can pay the remaining sum, unless the Member States assume responsibility for doing so, which is not the case at present.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, university students would be more mobile if the Council tackled the real problems, namely those relating to the transferability of grants, students’ status, their social security and the right to work, which are all issues that could be addressed, given that they were mentioned in the Commission Green Paper of 1996. The Commissioner will perhaps be able to inform us as to how the work is progressing.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, culture is priceless, but it does come at a cost. If we want to give Europe a soul, funding has to be granted. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will be supporting Mrs Pack’s proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although this programme is an educational one whose components – Comenius, Erasmus, Grundtvig and so on – address different priorities, the one thing these all have in common is that they promote mobility, and enhance quality, giving recognition for achievement and education, for multilingualism and knowledge of other countries. In so doing, they add value to Europe. These things are precisely what we need to achieve – or at least to get closer to – the Lisbon objective by 2010, that being to have 3 million Erasmus students and 150 000 Leonardo participants.</p>
<p class="contents">While I agree with Mrs Pack that the grant for Erasmus students needs to be increased, that must not result in those Member States that top up scholarships from national funds – as Austria does, for example – reducing their contributions; on the contrary, they should adapt to the new requirements. In the EU, 25% of the population have a university degree, and 75% a certificate of completed secondary education. Many of the citizens have completed vocational training, although it is unfortunate – and something I wish to criticise now – that the Lisbon documents include no figures on them. Mobility at work or in the course of initial training involves many administrative and linguistic obstacles, and so the Leonardo programme urgently needs more support and promotion; what is needed is not a new Erasmus programme for trainees, but a Leonardo programme that works properly, and if it is to do that, more funding needs to be provided.</p>
<p class="contents">We are waiting in eager anticipation for the individual Member States’ Lisbon action plans, while being no less eager to find out what is in the Financial Perspective and the budget proposals for all these programmes for 2007. What is clear is that it would be a disaster for the students, school pupils, teachers, and trainees, just as much as for cultural organisations, artists and young people if the beginning of the new generations of programmes were to be delayed; it would also be in flagrant contradiction to the Lisbon Strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If we want to bring Europe together, it is through education that we are most likely to be able to do so. We have here the most diverse range of educational initiatives, which promote the exchange of knowledge and skills between the European states, make it easier for citizens from different cultures to meet one another and provide them with support in learning languages, above all the languages of their neighbours. I particularly approve of the attempt to bring the various measures under one roof, am glad to see the Balkan states being made eligible for grants, and welcome the explicit intention to support initiatives for political education.</p>
<p class="contents">I do think, though, that there is room for further improvement, in that more account needs to be taken of those who are socially disadvantaged and in that procedures need to be simplified – and let me observe that not all the difficulties are of the EU’s making. I have practical experience of running projects, in the course of which I discovered that the problems in the Member States themselves are often even worse than at EU level.</p>
<p class="contents">What I do not agree with is the cuts made to the Leonardo programme. I am opposed to any reduction in funding for vocational education. The fact that practical training costs more than purely theoretical education cannot be a reason for cutting funding for it. It is both dishonest and inconsistent to announce 2006 as the European Year of Job Mobility while at the same time making funding cuts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Constant calls are being made for greater private investment in the sector of scientific research in order to serve the needs of big business. At the same time, innovation and novelty are not orientated towards promoting technology and the quality of life. The Lisbon Strategy formulated overlooks the increased need for public spending on and investment in education, for bursaries and for detailed programmes for lifelong learning supporting informal education which, at the same time, are not accessible to a large slice of the population.</p>
<p class="contents">The extension of lifelong learning, in cooperation with the business element is one of the basic objectives set by Lisbon. With this programme, universities will open their doors for the purpose of specialising workers in new professions, who will then provide cheap manpower for businesses which invest their money in the university in question. This will create a vicious circle for young people, who will be dismissed and then, once they have been retrained, will be recruited as cheap workers in new professions. It proves that the Commission's objective is not lifelong learning; it is lifelong exploitation.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, it is obvious that, if these policies are implemented, we shall basically start making education subject to the whims of enterprises and sacrificing it to competitiveness and profit. It will mean the subjection of research to the commands and needs of businesses and a reduction in the state's contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider that the Member States of the Union can develop education and lifelong learning without it being coloured by speculation and unilateral adherence to the so-called needs of the market and to competitiveness. That is why the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left cannot vote in favour of the proposal to establish a programme in the field of lifelong learning. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition we cannot disagree with the proposal that the average grant be increased from 210 Euros to 300 Euros by 2007 at the end of the programme.

<p class="contents">The Lisbon Strategy reiterates the objectives of education adapted to new technologies, to multilingualism, to diversity and to reinforcing programmes.

<p class="contents">Encouraging the teaching and learning of two foreign languages and increasing grants for participants with disabilities and the learning and use of sign language are fundamental proposals by the rapporteur, Doris Pack.

<p class="contents">Furthermore, we must not forget that nowadays the demands for highly trained manpower are a necessary precondition to the strengthening of competitiveness.

<p class="contents">That is why it is extremely important for these programmes to be extended to as many more young and, more importantly, less privileged people as possible. Pupil exchanges within the framework of the Comenius programme must cover at least one in fifteen pupils of the programme. At the same time, the amount of Erasmus grants needs to be doubled, given that it has remained stagnant since 1993 and is too low to meet the needs, mainly, of less well-off students, as our rapporteur, Mrs Pack, has quite rightly called for.

<p class="contents">Our future lies in the young people who will soon be making decisions on politics, economics and all the other aspects of our life. It is therefore all the more important that as many young people as possible are involved in international education programmes even at an early stage of their education. In this way they also become much more motivated to learn languages, to get to know other countries and to display greater tolerance towards other nations and cultures.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we have found that those countries that have invested greater funds in education have advanced more rapidly and now rank amongst the most highly-developed countries.

For many students, these exchanges are, in actual fact, the most practical advantage of the whole EU project.</p>
<p class="contents">By studying abroad, they not only gain new knowledge and new experiences of another culture, but also disseminate knowledge and in that way help increase the quality of European education which, in turn, is one of the cornerstones of the Lisbon process. Through tomorrow’s vote, we shall simplify the administrative routines, which may lead to quite a few schools and universities participating more actively in the programmes and encouraging more students to study abroad.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased that, during this process, we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have protested against the proposed cuts in vocational education and training desired by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and that we have also supported continuing to provide plenty of opportunities for people who have already completed their professional education to study abroad. Vocational education and training do in actual fact make a very important contribution to the EU economy and to the way in which the labour market operates. Thus, encouragement needs also to be given to people who have completed their professional education to move around more. It should not only be those at university who get to study abroad.</p>
<p class="contents">Where funding is concerned, I should also be delighted to contribute money to these programmes but, at the same time, I think that all the budget issues should be dealt with simultaneously so that we really are forced to prioritise what is important. I shall therefore support those amendments that are in keeping with Parliament’s report on the budget as a whole, that is to say the Böge report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is because most of us understand that the proposed integrated action programme is one of the steps that must be taken if the European Union is to become an advanced knowledge-based society with sustainable economic growth, more and better jobs, greater cohesion and stronger culture.</p>
<p class="contents">I must stress, however, that in my opinion it is essential for each Member State to draw up its own national lifelong learning strategy if the lifelong learning system is to function effectively. The financial instruments under debate today are and will be necessary for the implementation of these strategies. It goes without saying that they are also indispensable for the successful implementation of the various components of the action programme, and I therefore fully support the rapporteur’s calls for more funding for this initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the many reasons why this proposal deserves our support is that it makes provision for the mobility of individual secondary school students and adult learners by introducing new types of mobility action into the Comenius and Grundtvig sub-programmes, and provides new opportunities to make contributions in kind to the implementation of projects. Those involved in organising lifelong learning programmes and applying for funding under the associated financial instruments will undoubtedly welcome any reduction in the red tape associated with these procedures. I therefore support the proposal to simplify administrative procedures according to the level of grant.</p>
<p class="contents">Education is cited in key EU documents as a crucial component of future prosperity and growth. Without adequate funding, however, the latter goals will remain out of our reach, and will never make it off the drawing board, as is the case in a number of Member States. I should like to thank the rapporteur for her work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should just like to say a few words to point out that the vote within the Committee on Culture and Education has enabled significant progress to be made, in particular with regard to the mobility of apprentices. The specific conditions attaching to the status of apprentices are today preventing these apprentices from fully participating in the Community mobility plan. Only 0.15% of a given age group in France and 1% in Germany today benefit from the Leonardo da Vinci programme. The vote within the Committee on Culture and Education represents significant qualitative progress, as it has made eligible for this programme the support measures taken by all of the organisations involved in promoting the mobility of apprentices. Such progress should enable the objective set by the European Commission – that of securing at least 150 000 work placements by 2013 – to be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">We are hopeful that this progress will not be called into question. Mobility of young people – and particularly of apprentices – in vocational training constitutes one of the tools enabling a real spirit of enterprise and innovation to be created in Europe. This is one of the prerequisites for achieving the objectives set by the Heads of State or Government as part of the Lisbon Strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Erasmus, Comenius, Comenius Regio for secondary schools, Grundtvig and Leonardo are part of the integrated action programme called ‘Lifelong Learning’ <span class="italic">–</span> ‘L L L’, which Mrs Prets will find easy to remember!</p>
<p class="contents">Although I congratulate Mrs Pack on her report, in which she attempts to strike a balance between the various sectoral sub-programmes rather than playing them off against each other, I have to say that the Committee on Culture’s proposal that only 23% of the lifelong learning programme be allocated to Leonardo, rather than the 25% as originally envisaged, is a cause of disquiet among trainees, chambers of crafts and stakeholders in vocational education. If the present 45 000 work placements per annum are to become 70 000 or even – as the institution represented by the Commissioner has proposed – rather more than 100 000, a solid financial foundation will be needed. Leonardo gives long-term support to vocational education, makes individuals more empowered and, as Mrs Pack pointed out, is fully in line with the objectives of the new Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The first all-clear signal is that students’ work placements are no longer to be run through Leonardo, but through Erasmus, so there alone – in a vitally important area – we are saving some EUR 600 million. Small and medium-sized enterprises are also to be more closely involved in Leonardo than they were before. As I have pointed out in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and also in conversations with businesses and interested parties, the fact is that the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013 has not yet been adopted, and so it may well come to pass – and I can tell Commissioner Figeľ that I hope, for both our sakes, that it does – that there will be substantially more money available for Leonardo than was the case in the past. The reason why these EU education programmes are so effective is, after all, because those involved take to them immediately, and because the programmes make language, culture and different educational values visible and can therefore persuade the public of the added value that a European orientation can provide. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This shows the kind of maturity that is needed in order for education and vocational training to be put at the centre of European Union policy and cooperation among Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some suggestions and remarks that I would like to make. We must realise that it is still premature to comment on budget figures, although the initial level of political support has been very strong. Thanks to the position adopted by Parliament, both the budget and the two budget-funded programmes for culture and youth are receiving strong support, and this is giving rise to the expectation that they will be successful areas for future cooperation within the enlarged Union. An appeal to launch programmes for third countries is also under way. The programme itself is expected to receive 1% of the total amount budgeted for cooperation with other countries. These countries are as yet unnamed, but I would like to stress that just as Erasmus Mundus has included and will continue to include cooperation with third countries, the Tempus and Tempus+ programmes will also provide for such cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Several speakers referred to lifelong learning as a right. This represents a great change. We are striving to create the systems, conditions, strategies and programmes for lifelong education in the Member States, and to ensure participation and a real place for people within this system. By comparison, although there is considerable scepticism and apathy in Europe, there are continents where the debate is still focussed on the fundamental right to basic education, while we are now talking about the right to lifelong learning. This provides an excellent example of cooperation among the States.</p>
<p class="contents">From the standpoint of vocational courses or training, the ‘Copenhagen’ process and the Bologna process are now much more visible. I am convinced that the current proposal to introduce the European Qualification Framework, which is the subject of consultations with the Member States, will give a great boost to mobility and to the recognition of qualifications. I would also like to reiterate what has been said by Mr Thomas Mann, that part of the quota for the placement of university students in companies will be shifted from the current Leonardo da Vinci programme to the Erasmus quota under the future programme. This is something that also deserves notice.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude with a few words concerning the institutions mentioned by Mr Pavilionis – institutions earmarked for support. If the European Parliament and the Council reach a consensus, the Commission can support the inclusion of institutions in the list of nominees. In the European Inter-University Centre in Venice discussions are taking place on how to adapt the regulation on human rights, and we want to be prepared for the future and to find a solution that will enable the continuation of financing for this institution.</p>
<p class="contents">This is basically all I wanted to discuss. I am pleased to note that education has become a matter of consensus between the committees, as well as between political groups and individuals. This is a sound premise for success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
