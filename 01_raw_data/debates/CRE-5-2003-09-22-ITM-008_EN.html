<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kirkhope (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, as a former United Kingdom Immigration Minister, I would be the first to recognise that one of the most difficult processes in the immigration system arises when one has to remove a person who has gone through all the legal processes and no longer has a legal right to remain – or has not provided a legal reason to remain – in a Member State and has to be returned to the place from whence they came. This is a difficult decision for everybody involved in the matter. It is difficult for the officials as well as for the ministers themselves. It has to be done in a way that is both humane and effective. Up to now there have been considerable problems in achieving this. The travelling arrangements require that assistance be afforded by moving those particular persons by air and transiting them through other European countries on the way back to where they have to go.</p>
<p class="contents">A lack of coordination or cooperation has often meant much more suffering for the people concerned. It has also meant that this operation has not always been carried out successfully. Therefore this German initiative – one for which I am very pleased to be the rapporteur – is aimed at trying to bring the matter effectively and efficiently to a conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Our real objective here is for the persons concerned to be afforded the necessary support, if required, in terms of sustenance and medical assistance, when transiting through airports on their way to their destination. We also need to make sure that the airlines carrying them are aware of what they are carrying and the progress of the procedures. That has not always been the case in the past. This report should assist in achieving that end. Similarly it is important that the documents sent with the persons concerned are properly dealt with during the transit process. This is by no means the case at the present time. This is something we also wish to achieve through our work.</p>
<p class="contents">The difficulty has consistently been that it has always been someone else's responsibility to ensure the proper handling of these matters. Officials have experienced frustration and difficulty over this, not only in Britain but indeed in most EU Member States. I know that this measure would be greeted with considerable support and enthusiasm by those who will see that we are at last beginning to realise that we have to work together to achieve such ends.</p>
<p class="contents">This does not in any way affect the individual Member States' procedures. Nor is it a measure that tries to be ambitious or reviews the whole issue of asylum procedures as such, or indeed asylum criteria. That would be very ambitious. It is not something that I aim to pursue in this report. The report is a simple and practical measure that will be necessary from time to time once proper legal processes have been exhausted.</p>
<p class="contents">I have made my position clear. I have tried my best in committee to make sure that all political groups and Members are taken along with me in the work that I have done. I am proud to be the rapporteur of this report because, in my view, it clearly demonstrates that, regardless of differing political views on Europe, its future role and so on, there are many areas like this where we can work together in friendly and effective cooperation, in a way that makes a real practical difference to many people: both those who are dependent on our care and those who have to implement our rules and regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason alone, I am very pleased with this report and the reaction to it. I hope that it will be fully supported in the House tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The German initiative on the table today, on transit for the purposes of removal by air, has been described as one of the implementing measures required to that end. The Commission does in fact believe that a common framework should be laid down for questions pertaining to transit during the repatriation process, which is why the Commission supports the German proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Airports in other Member States very often have to be used due to the lack of direct air links to the country of origin. It is important to establish a clear legal framework for transit procedure in such cases, relating, for example, to the use of escorts and the individual competences of the transit airport.</p>
<p class="contents">This text, produced by the German Government, has already motivated the Italian Presidency to table initiatives advocating similar assistance in cases of land transit and joint removal operations. Negotiations on these initiatives have already begun among working parties in the Council. Despite the emphasis currently placed by the Council on operational cooperation, however, it should be observed that a genuine common policy for repatriation should also be based on medium-term legislative measures (such as compulsory mutual recognition of repatriation decisions, for example) which will not only facilitate cooperation between Member States but also establish a certain number of common minimum standards on deportation, detention and removal, ensuring humane treatment for repatriated persons, as the rapporteur mentioned a little while ago.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, therefore, intends to table a proposal for a Council directive on minimum standards for repatriation procedures and mutual recognition of repatriation decisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a subject we have debated many times over the years, arguing that any such policy should proactively promote legal immigration, running alongside an effective campaign against illegal immigration and the traffic in human beings. We have also championed a European asylum system which respects our international obligations on the one hand while, on the other, safeguarding the stability and security of the Union’s Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This initiative relates to the mutual assistance which should be provided in situations giving rise to the need to remove third-country nationals who are the subject of removal orders ending their illegal residence, bearing in mind that air transport has become the most commonly-used means of removal. This proposal for a directive aims, therefore, to lay down measures that may be taken by the competent authorities to assist with escorted or unescorted removals at European transit airports.</p>
<p class="contents">The requesting Member State must always ascertain, first of all, whether removal to the state of destination is possible using a direct flight. If that is not possible, the requested Member State must provide assistance with the transit of third-country nationals to be removed. Transit may be refused if the third-country national faces the threat of inhumane or humiliating treatment, torture or the death penalty, or if his life or liberty would be at risk by reason of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political conviction. In other words, Mr President, we must remain true to our principles: we cannot countenance violations of the principles and fundamental rights on which we base European integration. We cannot, however, move away from the substantive motives for granting asylum as laid down with binding effect in the Geneva Convention on refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also remember that we cannot implement policies liable to encourage waves of illegal immigration, involving the trafficking and exploitation of individuals. With this in mind, then, a great many of Mr Kirkhope’s proposals are brimming with good sense and relevance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Effectively fighting illegal immigration certainly requires a returns policy but returns should, however, be undertaken in a way that respects all people. We would like to mention the fact that the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the Charter of Fundamental Rights prohibit collective expulsions. We are calling for an ongoing study of common definitions in the field of refusals of admission and expulsion measures.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards illegal immigration, we have seen an increase in the number of initiatives by Member States. The many initiatives that are implemented are not harmonised at Community level and are not consistent with each other. We cannot, therefore, respond in a satisfactory manner to the human tragedies that are unfolding on our soil.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States are adopting punitive measures to facilitate exclusion, but there is not yet a European will to define an immigration policy. It is difficult to make progress in the area of illegal immigration management without having a general framework for legal immigration, which we should already have under the Tampere agenda. For the credibility of the EU in this area we have to respond to the expectations of the public, who no longer understand what is happening with our immigration policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council must continue to press for the adoption of the proposals which remain on the table. The three directives in progress on legal immigration must be adopted as quickly as possible. The proposal for a directive on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purpose of paid employment and self-employed economic activities was blocked in the Council. That is unacceptable. The proposal for a directive on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purposes of studies, vocational training or voluntary service has not yet been presented to the Council working group. Just as the proposal for a directive on the short-term residence permit issued to victims of action to facilitate illegal immigration or trafficking in human beings who cooperate with the competent authorities may not be able to be adopted at the Justice and Home Affairs Council at the end of November as planned.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know, however, that we urgently need this weapon to fight organised crime. If the Council does not move forward on the issue of legal immigration, the degree of harmonisation risks being reduced to the lowest common denominator and any action against illegal immigration will be neither effective nor inclusive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As many Members have pointed out, the proposal fails to address the very important issue of how we deal with people who are deemed to be illegally within our countries in the European Union. This, in our view, includes what happens to those people on their return to their countries of origin. It is not at all clear who has responsibility for ensuring that they are returned safely and continue to be safe. We have no monitoring system for that at all, and therefore it seems to us no real way of knowing whether our policies for judging who is a refugee, and who is an illegal immigrant, actually work.</p>
<p class="contents">That point has come to the fore in the part of the debate about safe third countries. Different countries have very different perceptions. For example there are some Member States that consider Iran to be a safe third country – which will come as news to many Iranians.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also be aware that people are being removed from some of our Member States for the very reasons for which we are supposed to protect them, for example on grounds of ethnicity in the case of the Roma. When we look at the conditions of return by air, it is not surprising if people resist when they believe they are being returned to intolerable conditions. It is also no surprise, for example in London, the region I represent, that the Metropolitan Police wants to distance itself from the role of the immigration services when it comes to deportations, because the issue of measures necessary for self-defence is highly contentious in virtually every Member State. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The objective of Germany’s initiative is to improve cooperation between Member States where the implementation of deportation orders is concerned. Although direct flights are always preferable, this is not always possible in practice. Sometimes transits through other countries prove necessary. As the rapporteur has already pointed out, this initiative goes about regulating this tricky topic in the right way.</p>
<p class="contents">The deportation of people – as the minority opinion clearly demonstrates – remains a contentious topic, but, in for a penny, in for a pound. An asylum and immigration system is of no value whatsoever if it is not enforced from start to finish. This can lead to people being deported. In my view, the proposal safeguards the rights of these people and at the same time, facilitates cooperation between the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to take this opportunity to say something about the selected legal basis, Article 63. The appended opinion from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is right to see this legal basis as consistent. This is a third-pillar procedure in which a Member State takes the initiative and Parliament has only an advisory role. The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs often finds this difficult to deal with, and understandably so. In my view, though, a political wish for more power should not stand in the way of, or slow down, effective legislation drafted on the basis of the correct legal basis. We should let the political wish prevail, for then this will diminish our actual influence on the content. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If the European Union is to establish and implement, in a credible way, a policy on legal immigration and an effective asylum policy, it must ensure that illegal immigration and the abuse of asylum meet with consequences and that those whose applications for asylum have been rejected, who have gone right through the legal system and have not been recognised as refugees, must leave the country. This means, quite simply, that a common removals policy must form part of an EU immigration policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal that Mr Kirkhope has submitted is a very balanced one, demonstrating due appreciation of the concerns that individuals have and taking them into account, whilst, however, guaranteeing that the rules imposed by immigration policy are actually complied with in the way that they must be. A removal policy is an essential component of immigration policy and the proposal put forward today adds a piece to that jigsaw, enabling it to be properly implemented. Mr Kirkhope and his excellent proposal therefore have my wholehearted support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am afraid to say that this issue has made the front pages in Belgium recently: let us remember the way in which Semira Adamu was treated and the fatal consequences, of which we are aware.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that these expulsion measures are, in practice, rarely carried out with the respect and dignity that each individual has the right to expect, in particular from this European body, which so often sets itself up as a paragon in the field of human rights. On the other hand, when we send back or remove these people, we often ignore what is awaiting them on their return to their country and I think that we are showing a shameful indifference to the responsibilities that we have been given.</p>
<p class="contents">Underlying this text, at the heart of the expulsions there are people in transit, men and women who have a right to safety and respect.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards more specifically the conditions for expulsion and residence of third-country nationals, I would like to bring to your attention two very important points. Firstly, the unacceptable, even inhumane, living conditions of some adults and children in closed reception centres serving as land transit zones. I believe that it is equally urgent to solve the problem of asylum seekers living in airport transit zones. These zones are not designed to accommodate them and no one can and should live in a zone where the law does not apply. Would it not be possible to consider other methods that are more respectful of human dignity?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to conclude by saying that we need to put the various directives that we have been dealing with for almost two years into practice, so as to ensure that our policies show our unconditional respect for the right to dignity, fundamental rights and our rejection of any act that could be an attack on physical or moral integrity of people and so that we can finally have a credible and honourable immigration policy at European level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
