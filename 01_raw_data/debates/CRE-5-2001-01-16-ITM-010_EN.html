<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Parish (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to be able to present to you today the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development’s own-initiative report on the situation and perspectives of young farmers in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Twenty years ago, I, myself, was a member of my local young farmers' organisation in the county of Somerset in England. Even in those days it was not easy for young farmers to carry on the family farm or get started in the industry. Today the situation has become even more difficult, and we are witnessing a big drop in the number of young farmers coming into the industry. We have reached a point where it has become vital to take action in order to stop this decline. Not only for the sake of agriculture itself, but also to safeguard existing structures in our countryside. The last thing that we want to see is a depopulated countryside where the green and pleasant landscape which we take for granted will not be looked after properly any longer.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to thank the European organisation CEJA for its help and cooperation in enabling me to produce this report. I was given the opportunity to visit young farmers in five Member States which gave me a better and wider understanding of the practical ways in which young farmers could be helped in the industry.</p>
<p class="contents">I would further like to thank Commissioner Fischler for his backing and I would also welcome the draft opinion on the report produced by the Committee of the Regions because it is going to do a report on young farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, I would like to express my thanks to Ross Gordon Consultants who produced an excellent study on the situation of young farmers in the European Union last year and whose publication has been of great help in producing today's report. The report puts forward a series of ideas and ways of assisting young farmers starting up or carrying on in their businesses. I have, however, tried not to reinvent the wheel. Basically I would like to see the introduction of a guaranteed standard level of assistance for young farmers throughout the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I am fully aware that it is not an easy task to come up with one solution covering all the different conditions facing young farmers in their respective countries in a Community of 15 Member States. To name just two examples: land values can vary from EUR 12 000 per hectare to EUR 15 000 per hectare. Levels of taxation vary greatly with some Member States imposing considerable inheritance tax which renders the survival of young farmers very difficult, especially where land values are very high.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not have the time to go through all the recommendations made in the report, but I will list some of the measures which should be given priority: the continuation of start-up grants of up to EUR 40 000, in combination with subsidised interest rates for start-up capital of up to EUR 120 000 for eight years. Two of the major difficulties encountered by young farmers are the raising of start-up capital and subsequently the danger of overstretching their financial abilities by providing regular interest payments.</p>
<p class="contents">We are living in a computer age. Access to education and training needs to be further encouraged in order to allow young farmers to take full advantage of the potential advantages offered by modern communication technology and business operation techniques. The changing face of agriculture, increasingly determined by global WTO agreements, means that agriculture will continue to change. It is in our best interests that young farmers are well prepared to anticipate and to manage these future challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">Food safety measures and production methods are being thoroughly analysed these days. There is greater emphasis on organic production throughout Europe. Here again, young farmers must be placed in a position which will allow them to embrace a new upcoming culture and to be aware of the benefits attached to maintaining consumer confidence and support for agricultural products. There is tremendous scope for innovative and creative local high-quality production.</p>
<p class="contents">The European agricultural industry is going through a difficult economic period with a great deal of restructuring going on at the same time. There is a great need to assist some of the older farmers to retire in dignity. In this context, I would very much like see a retirement package for existing farmers linked to bringing in young farmers to carry on the industry. I would like to ask Commissioner Fischler to recommend to Member States that they introduce such a policy throughout the EU. We are seeing the average age of the farming Community increase with falling numbers of young farmers. This trend must be reversed.</p>
<p class="contents">Young farmers need greater access to production rights. It is not easy to balance the delivery of additional production rights to young farmers if they have to be taken away from existing farmers who themselves are already facing financial difficulties. When, in future, production rights are changed, I would like to ask the Commission to take into greater account the need to increase the amount of extra production which is given to young farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">With the emphasis in the CAP on giving increasing importance to rural development schemes, it is crucial to recognise the young farmers as the key players and main executives responsible for the implementation of such new rural redevelopment policies.</p>
<p class="contents">With the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union, I would strongly advise the applicant Member States to start creating supportive measures for their young farmers already at present, especially in view of the introduction of production controls required by the Commission. In many parts of the world, share farming is a common practice. I would like to ask the Commission to investigate the possibilities for developing share farming within the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already mentioned, this report is an own initiative report of the Committee on Agriculture, and I hope all parties will be able to sign up for this report and make sure positive practical help is given young farmers in the future. I would also like to thank Commissioner Fischler once more for his support and also ask him to introduce an audit to be carried out every two years on the availability and success of measures put in place to support young farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important that we do not just pay great lip service to helping young farmers, but actually deliver policies within the common agricultural policy that increase the number of young farmers coming into the industry.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Casaca (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, I wish, first of all, to congratulate the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and, in particular its rapporteur, Mr Parish, on the timely initiative to bring the debate on this issue to the European institutions. It is 32 years since Sicco Mansholt, the Commissioner responsible for agriculture from the time the Commission was formed until 1972, presented his draft reform of the common agricultural policy, the Mansholt Plan.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my view that the European institutions have not paid sufficient tribute to this great figure in European politics. I still read this classic work today and I still find that it contains many of the answers we need to the problems faced by young farmers, which are accurately described in Mr Parish’s report. We have created a major common policy based on support payments per hectare, per animal or even according to production achieved; we have limited production rights and established quotas; we have imposed complex mechanisms for standardising production and we have created intricate systems intervening in international markets. The results have been varied, with some positive aspects but with many other negative aspects. Amongst the latter, I would highlight the effect this policy has had in creating major problems for young people wishing to establish themselves in farming. The bold study drawn up on this issue by Parliament confirms that land is still the major investment for European farmers. The study also shows difficulty of access to land to be the main problem facing young farmers. According to this study, for each percentage point increase in subsidies for wheat crops, the price of land goes up by 0.4%. This effect is significantly magnified by quota systems and by production-limiting schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot, therefore, contemplate the need to protect and support the modernisation and reinvigoration of agriculture unless we consider changes that could be made to the current CAP. The alternative to this model of agricultural policy will necessarily require a policy focused on farmers and their incomes and not on the produce, the land or the livestock by means of which the income is obtained. It will require an agricultural policy that is defined in regional rather than sectoral terms and will require priority for the environment, rural development, vocational training and early retirement.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I should like to suggest to Mr Parish and to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that this report should not be seen as a finishing line but rather as a point of departure for a thorough study into overhauling agriculture and reforming the common agricultural policy with the specific participation of young farmers’ associations. Revisiting the Mansholt Plan would be a good place to start. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many thanks indeed go to him, then. In this short speech I would like to focus attention on a couple of points. The report takes excellent account of the problems of young farmers. Social problems are dealt with particularly well. This is to be welcomed, because it is young men who are mostly keener to continue farming than young women are. The problem that has come about is what is referred to as the hundred-hectare solitude factor.</p>
<p class="contents">In agriculture we need sustainability, especially with regard to change-of-generation factors. The average age of European farmers is worryingly high. It must be financially feasible to sustain the change-of-generation system. Young people must be induced to start farming. There are not enough young starters, however. It would be very important if we could get young people to continue in a profession that is important to us all. Young farmers are very skilled and are not prejudiced about using modern technology in their work in the fields and in rearing cattle. Similarly, they can make use of the latest information technology in their planning. We are on the threshold of great change, which the rapporteur brought to our attention here, and it is the young, if anyone, who are best equipped to lead us through this revolution, which we will inevitably have to face within a few years.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusions and measures proposed in the report are largely matters that have to be decided upon nationally, and this is good for flexibility. The EU can and must promote policies that work as incentives for the young. Bureaucracy must not become a barrier to improving the position of young farmers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In these times when the younger generation can see that the quality of life is no longer closely linked to industrialisation and cities and large commercial centres, we have the obligation in the Union to encourage and help the younger generation to take over from the older so that the cycle of life and people in agriculture may be completed by means of new Community initiatives that have the young farmer as their priority objective.</p>
<p class="contents">We must put into practice the principles and actions proposed in this own-initiative report so as to make rural life more attractive to young people, thus preventing depopulation of the countryside. This social group is the future basis of the Common Agricultural Policy; we have to increase installation aids and supplementary investment grants for this group, particularly in those structurally less-favoured areas where abandoned holdings and deserted villages are common, where young people can revive the rural economy. All this will be thanks to the development of new products of regional interest, such as agro-tourism and rural tourism, or through repopulating these natural spaces with animal and plant species, contributing to the sustainable and lasting development of the area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, no mention is made of why this should be so, given that the previous two Community support schemes promoted two programmes for the benefit of young farmers, which the European Union vaunted as a panacea which would solve all the problems faced by young farmers and reverse the negative trend. This conscious omission runs throughout the resolution, which fails to mention three basic factors which, unless they are dealt with, will render the third Community programme for young farmers equally ineffectual.</p>
<p class="contents">These factors are, first, that the CAP, especially in its post-1992 form and following Agenda 2000, does not safeguard a viable income for most small or medium-sized farming households, or a survival income for the heads of these households, which is why no one wants to invest anything at all in the farming sector, however many grants there may be – not that there are that many – because not only is it unprofitable, it does not even afford a basic income.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is usually nobody to apply the incentives to; in other words, because of the quotas, young farmers have no reason to work, given that the quotas have been used up for all the products and they must wait for a national stock to be created and distributed to young farmers or buy quotas, in which case, good luck to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, however high the incentives, the terms and conditions are such that they are more suited to large farmers and exclude small and medium-sized farmers. The requirement for very large cultivated areas, even in island regions, is a typical example. This requirement becomes prohibitive when combined with quotas. In other words, the Community requires young farmers to have a large farm and large-scale production, but nigh prevents them from producing anything with the quota system. This incongruous situation is not, in my view, an inadvertent, random choice by the European Union. It is deliberate policy, the purpose being to ruin poor, medium-sized farmers and support large farms or rather large companies in the agricultural sector.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we cannot vote in favour of this report; it is because it conceals the real reasons. Even these grants, when they are given to poor, medium-sized farmers, are meted out in drips and drabs and Greece is a typical example here. I do not know, for example, if Mr Fischler is aware of the fact that our grants for young farmers have still not been received, despite the fact that the government used this type of argument to saturation point in order to win votes last April. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the context of Agenda 2000, very credible efforts were made to deal with the serious problem of succession in European agriculture. A re-vamped farm retirement scheme, installation aid and other measures may not, however, achieve our desired objective and in my view the problem must be revisited as a matter of urgency, otherwise the continuity of family farming will be put at serious risk. Apart from the seriously upsetting and devastating consequences of BSE, which I believe will be overcome, the real problem for young people who in normal circumstances would take up farming as a career is the availability, welcome though it is, of alternative and certainly more financially rewarding employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Farmers and non-farmers must face this reality and do so before it is too late. Farming as a profession has the onerous responsibility of guaranteeing our citizens food security and quality, and we must act to safeguard the productive base of European agriculture by ensuring that young people with the ethos of farming in their blood are appropriately encouraged and compensated.</p>
<p class="contents">I realise that many small farms do not have the capacity to generate sufficient income for their owners because of scale and enterprise. I believe we must do more to assist those interested in a restructuring programme – and the rapporteur made reference to it in his report – through the pooling of land and human resources, which would lead to greater efficiency and improved competitiveness. Likewise, the opportunity of rural development and new technology in terms of creating farm and part-time employment for both women and men must, in every case, be vigorously pursued. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The situation is even more serious in my own country, where these figures are 66% and 15% respectively. In the mid-1980s, the CAP began changing in order to improve measures for direct control of production with the aim of preventing surpluses and guaranteeing the stability of prices and incomes.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the other side of the coin as regards opting for stability in this way has been less flexibility in access to farming, which particularly penalises young farmers, first of all because of the difficulty in gaining access to quotas, production or premium rights. Secondly, young farmers are penalised as a result of increases in land prices due to the increase in value created by the quota systems. Furthermore, it is well known that many Member States have not implemented measures that in any way address the concerns of young farmers. I shall give the example of my own country where, after an initial phase of enthusiasm when we joined the EU, in recent years we have become more sceptical and the activities of the organisations most representative of young farmers have even been penalised.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason we must, as a matter of urgency, adopt certain fundamental measures which are, in fact, in line with the rapporteur’s proposals. These are, specifically, to create special reserves for quotas and production rights solely for young farmers, to increase support for setting up a first farm and investment in farm properties, to establish a special scheme for low-interest loans to supplement other investment aid, to establish conditions for the proper functioning of an early retirement scheme for older farmers, which will speed up the process of renewal and, of course, to adopt training and information measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must now urgently table proposals for measures for action and the Council must adopt them. Unless this happens, we will be taking an irresponsible attitude that will put the continuity of farming in Europe, with all that this means for our culture, at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I wish to thank Neil Parish for his outstanding work on this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One measure of the complexity of the situation can be found in the courses which are now offered at agricultural colleges. At the two colleges in my region the number of courses relating to farming has now fallen to 40% in one case, and the remaining 60% of the courses relate to horses and small animals. Significantly, 70% of the students, however, come from farming families, so there is still that link. The report spells out that there is a strong case for measures to encourage new entrants to the industry and for achieving a much greater degree of standardisation across the European Union, and the issue, as the rapporteur mentioned, was well dealt with in the excellent STOA report at the beginning of last year. There are many good examples in that document of the valuable background material which we were able to use during discussions in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that the rural development programme is in place it is important to examine how this programme can be used to strengthen training and re-training facilities in our agricultural colleges. I would emphasise the need for training in farm diversification, including low-volume products for niche markets, and cooperative marketing techniques where, by coming together, individual farms can seek to match the commercial bargaining strength of the supermarket chains. I would also wish to see such courses paying special attention to the needs of the smaller farm where new entrants are most likely to be found.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Commission and the national governments will take note of the many excellent suggestions in this report and thus give a boost to the future prosperity of farming in the rural areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to focus upon the small number of young people going into farming in recent years and, at the same time, the unduly large number of people who are also leaving it, because, if young people do not come into the industry, there will come a time when agriculture no longer exists. I think that the image of farming – due to the many outbreaks of disease, dioxin scandals etc – is, at the moment, one of the really major problems. It puts the whole industry in a negative light and seems unfair to the many farming families who would, of course, get top marks for the way they look after their farms. It is undoubtedly very important that there should be transparency and that people should be made more aware of production methods and of the modern stalls and cowsheds that now exist, as well as being given information about the common agricultural policy and about the ways in which fields and animals are looked after. Efforts must be concentrated on providing support – moral, educational and financial. No one has in recent years questioned the many millions of euros we pump into training lawyers, engineers and doctors. There is a clear parallel with young farmers who, of course, are responsible for the land and the animals we have and, especially, the food we eat. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the brief time I have I wish to stress that one of the greatest difficulties facing young farmers entering the business today is capital and cash-flow problems in the first year of operation. I am backing this proposal because young people must be given the opportunity to come into the industry on a sound financial footing. After all, young farmers hold the key to the future of all our rural communities. The lack of young people entering the agricultural industry in the UK is a very worrying problem. Statistics show that in Ireland 14.8% of farm owners are under 35, in France the figure is 13.2%, but in the UK it is a mere 6.8%.</p>
<p class="contents">I stress that farms are also important employers in our rural communities. Employment protects our countryside, it keeps our post offices, schools and services open there. Farming and the viability of farming is the life blood of the future of our rural communities as we know them. If all small businesses – which includes farmers – were to employ just one more person each, then the whole unemployment situation throughout the European Union would be solved overnight.</p>
<p class="contents">Of all the European Union countries, only the UK and the Netherlands do not operate a specific aid scheme for young farmers. European rural development regulations allow a grant of EUR 16 500 to be made available for people under 40 years of age to establish themselves in a viable farm holding. Yet the Labour government in the UK has not taken advantage of this excellent scheme.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore fully support making installation aids mandatory across the European Union. The farming industry needs young blood in order to inject a new vibrancy into an industry which at present is aged and disillusioned. Young farmers are the future of the farming industry and vital components in urban communities.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank Mr Parish for his report and wish his report all the best to ensure that we can follow up these important decisions taken by him in a specific and constructive manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is no coincidence that, after the launching of Agenda 2000, in the current phase of WTO renegotiations and with the now imminent prospect of enlargement, we are still here today debating the future of young farmers, of those young people who, in so many countries in Europe, are placing bets on whether they will be able to remain within the agricultural sector for good.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we help them? One of the best solutions can only be to revoke the measures laid down by the CAP. It is time to evaluate carefully how the distribution of contributions – as, by definition, income support – reaches undertakings able to compete on the global market. This would make it possible to direct the finances towards a vision which is more targeted towards lowering general costs, encouraging the formation of consortia. We could also work on the joint farming of lands; after all, this is the change which will mark the evolution of farming. From this point of view, it is then essential to stipulate that incentives should be provided in the form of reductions in the relevant interest rates for investments made by young farmers. In this way, we would be implementing the provisions of Regulation 1257 of 1999, which encourages the combining of several actions when they are aimed at bringing about greater use of the resources provided by development plans for rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that, if this debate were to send out these sorts of signals, we would be able genuinely to start building the framework for a new European agriculture structure based on young people which, most importantly, would certainly not mean abandoning and forgetting those who are seeking possible alternatives in the new environmental and multifunctionality opportunities.</p>

Young farmers do indeed need urgent attention. First, because we must support our young people in all areas of activity, and secondly because it is in our interests to keep the rural population, most of whom are connected with agricultural activities, in the countryside. In approaching this issue, we have to appraise elements that lie at the roots of our social structure, our territorial organisation, our economy, our culture and our civilisation itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the problems that affect these farmers are substantially concerned with one of the bases of the dominant economic model in Europe; private land ownership and the forms of land transfer. This report contains an appeal for institutional action benefiting a specific group and also for the implementation of concrete measures to give rural land ownership a meaningful social function.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the opinion of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport seems to me highly appropriate when it states that young farmers are not a very homogeneous group. A distinction must be drawn between students at agricultural schools and colleges, young people who wish to set up in rural areas as an alternative to the urban environment, and the children of farmers. Even within this last group I would distinguish between those who are the children of farmers who work on the land and those who are descendants of farmers who, from the size of their holdings, are really agricultural businessmen.</p>
<p class="contents">While accepting that measures should be taken to reduce charges on inheriting property, I would highlight other actions also mentioned in the Parish report to help make holdings viable, which are based on socio-economic formulas.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to stress another aspect of the report: we must try to ensure that when our future co-Members of the Union incorporate the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> they do not bring in hidden habits that hinder the development of the rural environment in their countries. The change from collectivised farming economies to situations that can be merged with the Community situation may trigger off speculative processes that will artificially raise market prices for land and thus increase young farmers’ difficulties in setting up or keeping themselves in the countryside. This report, Mr President, will certainly be important in so far as we can also disseminate it in our own countries, in the candidate countries, and in particular in the sector it specifically addresses. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">But if we now examine the situation, we could ask ourselves whether there are any young people left out there who are mad enough to become farmers in the European Union.

<p class="contents">They seem to be fighting a losing battle, if we consider the adversities which young farmers face, as well as the achievements they are expected to deliver. To quote just one example – and I am just considering my own country for a moment – dairy farming is a sector where absolutely everything is being scrutinised, from the blade of grass right up to the moment that the milk hits the supermarkets. I cannot help drawing a comparison with arable farmers and horticulturalists who have been required to keep tabs on the implications of their actions on the environment and consumer front for a long time, and do so with great enthusiasm. At the same time, we have to say that in many European countries the requirements for animal welfare are among the world’s most stringent.</p>
<p class="contents">So whoever wants to become a farmer in Europe must outstrip their counterparts elsewhere in the world. They need to give the landscape and cultural conditions due consideration. They must apply the strictest consumer conditions, supply a wide range of products, both regionally and in terms of quality, make animal welfare a top priority and be responsible for the product, even once it has left the farm. This is what we call social enterprising as a top-level sport. It requires entrepreneurship, a love of nature and the environment, social orientation and perseverance. For this reason alone, it would be desirable if a specific policy were set up for young farmers which is focused on the future. Some of the focal points could include a premium scheme linked to quality, landscape and environmental protection, but also the introduction of an eco-tax in other economic sectors, not payable by the farmers but by the consumers, to finance those extra requirements which farmers need to fulfil, and to reinforce the market position of farmers and consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">What strikes me in the European Union’s competition policy as a whole, is that although it is enjoying a great deal of attention, in the food sector, for example, the consumers, the supermarkets that is, are gradually gaining a monopoly position, and that at the same time sales from farms, the small-scale dimension, are still fragmented. In that sense, it would be desirable if both Commissioners Monti and Bolkestein were more critical in their assessment of this area in terms of competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, nobody can survive for one day without food; it is life requirement number one. This requires motivated producers. This means that food does not just stand for market forces, but also for public health, landscape and nature. In short, if we realise this, then we will know that, in future, young farmers will need to be five-legged sheep, and in that sense, deserve more support, more political support than they are receiving at the moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I ask you, what shall we do when there is no one to take over our farms? Structural change is important and it is right, but that should not result in a mass exodus from the farming profession.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want farming to have a future in Europe, then we must secure its succession. We are in favour of a multi-functional farming model, i.e. a model whereby farmers are not just responsible for producing food and a large part of their work benefits society as a whole, a society which can take pleasure in seeing nature unspoiled and enjoy rural areas which are worth living in. The agricultural policy and the policy for the countryside as a whole lives for and from its inhabitants.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need to create framework conditions which ensure that young people look on the countryside as somewhere worth living in and are willing to continue the farming tradition. Setting-up aid and investment grants are essential for young farmers, but modern technology has an equally important part to play. Young farmers need to be as familiar with computers and the Internet as they are with seed and the animals in their stalls. This means that training and further training for young farmers are becoming more and more important and I, for one, support lifelong learning in farming and among farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to say a few brief words on the social aspects. Time and again I hear farmers using various arguments to put off leaving their farms to their children or successors. Letting go is difficult, as I know from personal experience, but it is the only way of ensuring survival. So I call on the older generations to help the young and to give them and, hence, the whole farming industry the same chance which they had. Of course, and I say this quite openly as a farmer myself, it is no help when all we hear about is the down side of the profession. Let us be quite clear about one thing: there is not a single profession which is either all good or all bad.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say that it gladdens my heart when I see established and young farmers working together to develop the farm, exchanging experiences and creating and putting innovative ideas into practice. Their dedication and commitment will be needed in the future even more than ever and we must encourage successive generations to be optimistic and take their future into their own hands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think this is a very constructive own-initiative report. There is a rather nice saying that the future belongs to the young, but we can turn this around when we talk of European farming and say that, without young farmers, there is no future. The future of the countryside, and especially the future of young farmers in Europe, does not look good. The numbers alone should set our alarm bells ringing. The number of farms in the EU has fallen constantly over recent years. Of course, we welcome the structural change but, at the same time, the extent of the change does give us cause for concern. The biggest decrease has been in the number of farmers under the age of 35. Thank God that young people from farms have the same career prospects as their peer groups and siblings.</p>
<p class="contents">The tradition of handing farms down from one generation to the next is disappearing. The question of what becomes of the older generation left on the farm is often still unanswered. Unfortunately, farms standing empty have become a familiar sight – even in my country, which I would never have imagined possible. How many young people want to have to keep making excuses because they are farmers? Young farmers want fair prices for their products. It is not because of the subsidies that they choose to be farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Parish report may help to improve the overall image of young farmers. The public pays scant attention to the services of farming. I should like to take this opportunity to thank you, Commissioner Fischler, for repeatedly highlighting the multi-functional task which farming fulfils. But apparently bad news makes better news.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, you can read about the current BSE crisis blow by blow. But no one bothers to mention, for example, that consumer associations in my country have been wantonly campaigning for food at rock bottom prices for years now. Of course I disapprove of the criminal machinations of the feedingstuffs industry, the lack of controls by the authorities and so forth, but it is all this together which has resulted in the chaos in which more and more members of the profession find themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">If you belong to this profession, if you are a farmer, then you will easily understand why young people ask, do I really need this? With the current BSE situation, it is quite out of order to pillory our farmers and young farmers. We have set standards. So-called ‘good professional practice’ has been continually developed by our excellently trained young farmers. Essential services in the production of foodstuffs and raw materials, the development, further development and preservation of the countryside and the protection of the natural bases for life are all areas in which Europe will need farmers and young farmers in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to close by saying that these young farmers do not just need reliable policies; they also need good wives and strong families. Only this sort of environment can give them the strength they need to perform their important function in society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an indication of the concern of this particular group for the problem we are discussing.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to thank Mr Parish for his contribution, the thorough research and the very extensive report he has produced. I was just thinking of my youth when I was a member of the Young Farmers of Ireland; I started my political career in that organisation. I remember a plan was produced which was based on two simple things: intensive advice and a little bit of financial incentive. It was based on the geographic unit of organisation, which was most popular in Ireland, it was a church community called the parish. It was the parish plan. So I started off my political life with the parish plan in my hand and today I have another Parish plan. It is much more comprehensive and, indeed, I have to confess that I do not see as many simple answers to the questions raised in this one as in my Young Farmers' organisation in Ireland 40 years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Something that comes to mind is that we ought not to get carried away with emotion or lead people down the wrong path on this whole subject. The 1926 census in Ireland found that more than half of the entire population of the country was engaged in agriculture and yet the country did not produce surpluses and there were people short of food. There are still people harking back to the days when, as an Irish poet said: "every rood of ground maintained its man". However, we should not imagine that this was an ideal world in which to live. Over the years, as the number of farms was reduced and farmers became more efficient, food obviously became more available to the poor who could buy it at a lower cost. The reduced farm numbers have produced a lot of well-being in Europe. We should not forget that.</p>
<p class="contents">Since Ireland joined the European Union – I only mention Ireland because I am very familiar with what happened obviously, but you can draw lessons for other areas – our many small farms were reduced gradually in number. If it were not for the common agricultural policy, that would have been very painful.</p>
<p class="contents">It was a good thing that the number of farms was reduced and that we had the common agricultural policy to ease that. We must be concerned about the human problems that arise out of the squeeze-out of excessive labour, but at the same time, we should remember that the cost of food has been reduced. Emphasis, in the future, must be put on quality, while in my time limitless quantities were needed. Today we need more quality and we need to consider the environment. All these are things Mr Parish has underlined. But we should not offer the prospect of young, energetic people in greater numbers producing the quantity of food that Europe needs today because they will not eat it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know very well that he put a lot of time and effort into it and I am happy it can be debated by Parliament today.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a very difficult subject to address and there is no easy solution to the problem of young farmers, as any of us who have any knowledge of the problem and the background would accept.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, everybody likes to say we must help the young farmers. The problem is when you ask them how to make the help really worthwhile, they are very slow to come forward with answers. How can you encourage young people onto the land? You have to address the problem within the situation in which young people find themselves today. Many young people from rural areas some 20, 30 or 40 years ago, at the time Mr McCartin was speaking about, would naturally have gone on to become young farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">Nowadays those young people have many other options open to them. They look around and they see their friends going into jobs where they may quit working at lunchtime on Friday and not start work again until the Monday morning. But the young farmer will work seven days a week for very little money. You only have to look at the financial situation right throughout the European Union at the moment to see that we have a terrible problem here and one that is not going to be easy to address. The reality is that if you do not get young people into the industry, you will not bring the new ideas in and you will not allow the industry to develop and take on the challenges that it faces in the future, relating not just to the production of food, but to how that food is produced and to ensuring that it is produced in a way the consumer finds acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not enough just to give financial assistance to young farmers because then all you do is put the price of lamb up out of reach. We in the European Union have brought in milk quotas, we have brought in suckler cow quotas, we have brought in sheep quotas, all now with a financial value that the young farmer could not even begin to contemplate. So I believe the best way is to make it easier for young farmers to inherit the family farm at an earlier stage, be it through an early retirement scheme or through a bond scheme. I certainly feel that the European Investment Bank should be encouraged to help young farmers into the industry through the bond scheme.</p>
<p class="contents">But, if you are going to bring this scheme in it has to be mandatory and it has to be introduced in every Member State. It is not enough to introduce it in one Member State alone.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are spending a lot of money on rural development and the Commission would do well to look at other ways of spending that money, because, as I see it, we could make better use of it. We could encourage young farmers, who face so much red tape and bureaucracy now. Young farmers have computers. Farmers' wives know how to use computers and could use them on the farm. That is the way forward for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It certainly highlights the bleak future facing young farmers within the European Union, despite the support provided by the Union and Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The current unfavourable economic climate for farming in general and young farmers in particular, the obvious lack of prospects for young farmers, the decline in the number of full-time farmers and the consequent ageing of those who remain – these are all general trends which underline the problem. It is clear that we will experience a drastic drop in the number of young farmers over the next couple of decades, unless appropriate and effective measures are put in place now.</p>
<p class="contents">Young farmers face enormous problems such as the massive financial burden when they start up and often this can be compounded by difficulties associated with inheritance. Training is often deficient, and for young people it can be an isolated life in rural areas, with limited social activity in comparison with those of a similar age who work in more urban settings.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this begs the question: what can the European Union do? A European policy aimed at supporting young farmers and linked to the CAP is essential. Up until now there has been little evaluation of EU assistance measures either by the Member States or the EU Commission. Greater attention must be given to interest rate subsidies and loans, installation aids and investment grants must be paid more speedily and the implications of enlargement on young farmers need to be considered and integrated into any future policy approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Other measures that could be considered are supplementary investment aid for farmers under 40, production rights, assistance with credit terms, better education, training and networking opportunities – one could go on. But the point I want to make is that we need to do something now. To take up the point made by Mr Nicholson: why should young people in the Celtic Tiger economy in Ireland remain on the land? Why should they face an anti-social life? Why should they be in a career which has economic uncertainty when other occupations offer a much more attractive life, much more security, work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., with week-ends off and with long holidays? That is the problem we have to address and we must address it now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for its work.</p>
<p class="contents">We have endeavoured in Agenda 2000, especially by developing the second pillar, to take account of the concerns of young farmers. In some organisations of the market, we have at least managed to grant special terms to newly established farmers or young farmers. I need only mention the sheep premium or the administration of national milk quota reserves or planting rights under the programme to restructure and convert vineyards. But, without doubt, the real issue here is the future of farming per se, because if young people are no longer prepared to take up farming, then any further debate on agriculture is superfluous.</p>
<p class="contents">And, without doubt, the attractiveness of farming also depends a great deal on the political framework conditions which apply to agriculture, not just agricultural policy as a whole, but also the specific terms on which a young person can enter this profession. Measures to promote rural development are particularly important here.</p>
<p class="contents">Agenda 2000 increased the maximum setting-up grant by 66%, meaning that up to EUR 25 000 can now be paid in aid, and loans to finance setting-up costs qualify for interest rate subsidies. At the same time, the terms governing investments in farming operations include the option of increasing the maximum rate of aid for investments by young farmers within the first five years of starting up. These aid rates may be as high as 45% and, in disadvantaged areas, as much as 55%.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from this specific aid for young farmers, there are, of course, all the other forms of aid which young farmers can claim just as any other farmer can. On balance, the rules for promoting the development of the countryside are extremely flexible but, according to the principle of subsidiarity, it is up to the Member States to implement them. The Member States are responsible for deciding what priority should be given to promoting young farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should also like to point out – and several Member States have already gone for this option – that the early retirement scheme, the eligible sums for which have again been raised under Agenda 2000, can be linked to setting-up aid for young farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, like Parliament, feels that we need adequate statistics if we are to make better policy assessments. The information which the Commission compiles via the information network of agricultural accounts and structural surveys should, in fact, suffice in order to analyse the situation of young farmers and I do not think that we need, nor does it make sense to set up a new database especially for young farmers. What we do need is for the assessments in question to be made available. The Commission services are currently working with the Member States evaluating the arrangements for which provision is made in the earlier 1997 regulation, especially with reference to young farmers. I am sure that we shall glean some useful facts from this exercise, but I must point out that we shall be unable to submit an initial assessment of the programmes still being examined by next year because we quite simply do not have the necessary data.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States are able to amend plans to develop the countryside, especially in order to take account of the results of interim assessments. The Commission does not intend to introduce any new Community initiatives now; it prefers to keep to the seven-year term prescribed in the Agenda and the relevant legislation. But we must not forget that the young and women are priority target groups under the LEADER + Community initiative and that the assessment system which the Member States need to work out in order to select pilot projects needs to take account of this focus in Community policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the questions addressed in the report and the motion for a resolution, such as land prices or the availability of farmland or inheritance tax or the tax status of farms, are matters for which the Member States alone are responsible. However, despite a great deal of criticism, the Commission will examine the conclusions of the Parish report within the limits of its powers and right of initiative in a bid to help improve the conditions of establishment for young farmers and revive the countryside. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
