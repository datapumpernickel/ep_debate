<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Nisticò, as well as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, for the work and effort they have put into this report. Mr Nisticò is a well-known expert in the field, but it has been quite a challenge for me and my services.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me start with the objectives. What are the main objectives of this proposal? There are three. First and foremost, to guarantee a high level of health protection for European patients. They will have access to the medicines of their choice, as long as all necessary safeguards are met. Secondly, to promote the Single Market for herbal medicines. Laying down harmonised rules and procedures will facilitate the cross-border trade in herbal medicines, which currently is very limited. Thirdly, to create a clear and favourable environment for the mainly small and medium-sized companies working in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as specific proposals are concerned, I will concentrate on three key issues. First, the scope of the new simplified procedure. The use of herbal medicines is a long-standing tradition in Europe. Back in the Middle Ages they were already well known and widely used. For new medicines, providing fresh scientific data is indispensable if patients are to be treated with safe medicines.</p>
<p class="contents">But if we already know enough about a medicine, new pre-clinical and clinical tests impose an unnecessary burden and unnecessary testing on humans and animals.</p>
<p class="contents">To protect the patient’s health, the information on the product’s traditional use must be reliable enough to enable us to conclude that the product is safe. Such information exists for many traditional herbal medicines. For that reason, the new procedure should initially be limited to herbal medicines.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the minimum period of use. To ensure that the information is soundly based, we consider that 30 years should enable us to decide whether the product can be considered safe and effective. The assessment has to be for use in the EU. I stress this because the effects of a medicine depend on the setting in which the product is used as well as on the product itself. As a rule, therefore, the product should have been used for 30 years within the EU. At the same time, we recognise that there are important medicinal traditions outside the EU. For that reason, we propose that up to 15 years of the use can be outside the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the new Scientific Committee. Herbal medicines are different from other categories of pharmaceuticals in various respects. For some years now, an informal working group has been working on herbal medicines at the European Medicines Evaluation Agency. Our proposal offers an opportunity to establish an explicit legal basis for this working group and to give it a clear mandate for herbal medicinal products. This will also allow us to rely on specific national expertise to ensure quality, safety and efficacy of herbal medicines on a European level. At the same time it helps to improve the free circulation of these medicines.</p>
<p class="contents">I am looking forward to the debate in the House today and call on the European Parliament to support this initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nisticò (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Mr Liikanen, we are delighted that, at last, after so many years, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has adopted the proposal for a Commission directive on traditional herbal medicinal products, which I am pleased to see takes a responsible, scientific approach.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I must thank the shadow rapporteurs of all the groups, particularly Mrs Roth-Behrendt for her competent amendments, as well as my other colleagues, Mr Bowis, Mrs Doyle, Mr Schnellhardt, Mrs Müller, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and Mr Whitehead, for their constructive help in improving the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to the directive we are examining, it will, at last, be possible to register traditional medicinal herbs in the individual European Union Member States through a simplified procedure, provided that – as the Commissioner stated – they meet certain effectiveness and safety requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive both recognises the full worth of medicinal products of plant origin and, at last, puts some order into a highly confused and controversial field. For instance, the scope of the directive is specified and the use of traditional herbs in other areas, such as foods, food supplements and cosmetics is excluded. In addition, for the sake of safeguarding consumer health, certain features of quality and good manufacturing practice are specified that must be complied with by both medicinal herbs produced in European Union Member States and those imported from third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has decided to recognise that medicinal herbs are still an inexhaustible source of active ingredients for therapeutic use. Nonetheless, while the therapeutic value of drugs of plant origin must be recognised, it must not be forgotten that improper use can give rise to a whole range of undesirable and seriously toxic side effects, which, I am afraid, may even be lethal. In this respect, Commissioner, the US Food and Drug Administration has so far recorded about 2 900 cases of toxic effects, including 104 deaths, principally due to the misuse of ephedrine, a drug that releases catecholamines, causes tachyarrhythmias and can lead to heart failure. The Food and Drug Administration has also stressed the lack of quality control for such herbs that come onto the market from distant countries like China and India: most of them are, I regret to say, adulterated with a number of contaminants.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why Parliament and the Commission have attempted to ensure that the directive will be directed mainly at consumer health protection, both by requiring high quality and safety standards and by making it compulsory for labels and information leaflets to provide citizens with simple, clear information on the product’s potential toxicity and possible interactions with other drugs and foodstuffs.</p>
<p class="contents">We draw the Commissioner’s attention to the fact that, by traditional medicinal herbs we mean those that have been used for at least 30 years, at least ten years of which within the Community and 20 outside, as suggested by Parliament. As a specialist in the area – I am a pharmacologist – I believe that ten years’ use in Community Member States added to 20 years’ use outside the Community is sufficient to assess any potential toxic effects. I am therefore in favour of reducing the 15 years laid down in the initial Commission proposal, but I do not agree with Chris Davies’s amendment, which does not provide for at least ten years’ use in the European Union, not least in that, given the genetic make-up of different populations, without extensive use in the Member States severe toxic effects might still emerge.</p>
<p class="contents">Another positive aspect is the creation of a Committee for Herbal Medicinal Products at last. As you will have noticed, Commissioner, Parliament is concerned that this committee should be independent and given the same powers as the Committee on Proprietary Medicinal Products. I hope Parliament’s request will be accepted so that the EMEA can, as always, carry out its work calmly and efficiently. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have very considerable experience of the use of traditional herbal medicinal products. In the European Union, consumers attach ever greater importance to the use of them. This is why, in my view, it is time to establish a harmonised legal framework for traditional herbal medicinal products.</p>
<p class="contents">For far too long, trade in these traditional products within the Community has been hampered by differences in the national provisions. I think that in its current form, the directive will correct this imbalance, thanks not least to the excellent work carried out by the rapporteur, Mr Nisticò.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me touch upon two points which are, in my view, especially important. Firstly, the establishment of a new committee on herbal medicinal products within the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products: I believe this is a necessary step, and I welcome the fact that the Commission has opted in favour of this approach. One of the committee's most important tasks will be to set up a list of herbal substances. However, I also think that the classification into various groups, as called for by the committee, is especially important. I very much hope that we can achieve this further classification. The phytopharmaceuticals with what is termed 'well-established medicinal use'<span class="italic"> </span>should be included in the group of rational phytopharmaceuticals. Let me briefly explain the significance of this distinction: in the case of phytopharmaceuticals with well-established use, monographs containing generally available data can be presented as evidence for an application. No extract-specific data are required in this type of evidence.</p>
<p class="contents">A different situation applies to rational phytopharmaceuticals. In this case, evidence is provided through the presentation of specific extract-related data which describe the precise effect of the individual extract. In order to avoid distortions of competition – and I think this is especially important – the manufacturer, who has invested substantial sums in researching the effects of rational phytopharmaceuticals, should be permitted to draw attention to his special efforts as part of the registration process, thus benefiting consumers through the provision of better product information. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have had our arguments – indeed, we have had some today – but not about this.</p>
<p class="contents">Herbal remedies are bought and trusted by millions and by many of us here. Their use goes back over millennia. This directive allows the basic registration of traditional remedies. It should be generous in its interpretation of how and where this traditional use established the safety requirements that are necessary. Equally, the use of these products in combination with others, including drugs, requires scrupulous attention to the possible side-effects where they may occur.</p>
<p class="contents">This basic safety requirement is a modest proposal indeed. Professional herbal practice associations and consumer groups support it across Europe. All it requires is that we know about quality and content. The better the product, the more the maker should welcome this directive. What is in it? What will it do for me? These are questions asked by consumers, which you would indeed ask of anything you took – even a wine gum.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that we are here now facing a very simple process and yet there are petitions, paranoid talk of plots and industrial lobbies mimicking consumer concerns. What do they fear? The European Medical Control Agency has estimated that in the UK, for example, out of 207 notified substances, all but 2 or 3 would sail through the process of registration without the expensive proof required for chemicals. I would ask this industrial lobby, which has embarrassed many herbalists, are your own products so safe and legal? Or could they too be adulterated, irradiated or substituted? How many tests have been conducted on side-effects? How many off-the-shelf shops offer expert advice? When the Consumers' Association in Britain tested this out on a random sample of 30, only 5 were able to offer knowledge in terms of the recommendations they made.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an opportunity to blend tradition and the modern rediscovery of ancient skills. It gives the consumer a wider choice and offers expansion for the quality producer. Let us welcome it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we need any reminder of that, we need only look at the thousands who die each year from taking authorised prescription medicines. By comparison, the risks posed by traditional herbal remedies are minimal. So let us keep a sense of proportion and make sure we do not throw the baby out with the bath water.</p>
<p class="contents">Nobody should object to rules intended to safeguard health and to ensure that the consumer can make informed decisions. However, excessively restrictive application of regulations may threaten the future of some producers and specialist suppliers such as health food shops, possibly encouraging consumers to buy from unregulated internet suppliers. I therefore ask the Commission to be careful in its application of these regulations and to take account of these genuine concerns. In particular, I ask the House that if a herbal medicine has been used anywhere in the world for more than 30 years and there was clear evidence that its normal use is safe, then we should not deny it to the people we represent. We must not be so arrogant as to imply that Europe has nothing to learn from others. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I share their view that we should support the Commission’s objectives and that, taken as a whole, the rapporteur’s proposal is good. My group will therefore support it.</p>
<p class="contents">Take the example of the proposal to establish a committee on herbal medicinal products. This committee would be independent, have the same power as the committee on conventional medicines and would come under the European Agency. Clearly, this is most certainly a good idea. It is in fact an excellent idea, which will, I believe, allow us to use high–quality herbal medicinal products in complete safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Another significant and additional benefit is that we will have real experts in herbal medicine on this committee, which is clearly essential.</p>
<p class="contents">The second positive element of the proposal is the amendment distinguishing between food supplements and medicines. We must ensure that we do not establish too strict a recognition system, as this could lead to some food supplements being classified as medicinal products when they have no medicinal effects.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to comment on the amendment proposed by Mr Davies. I believe that his amendment is sensible. I agree with him that we need to set a single period of traditional use for herbal products, regardless of their origin. I think it is somewhat arrogant to assume that third countries could not supply correct, high–quality information, enabling us to use these medicinal products without any risk. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Even in present-day medicine, despite the advent of modern pharmacology, herbal remedies still play an important role. It is therefore logical for European quality standards to be laid down for herbal remedies just as they are for synthetic medicines and for steps to be taken to ensure that citizens are informed in a comprehensible manner about the effect and possible side-effects of these remedies. We are therefore satisfied with the proposal to set up a separate committee for herbal remedies within the EMEA and to make the provisions relating to the monitoring of medicines applicable to herbal remedies as well.</p>
<p class="contents">For many herbal remedies that have long been in use new tests are unnecessary however. The associated high costs are difficult to justify, especially if many years’ use has never given rise to any problems. I consider it right, though, that consumers are given honest information. Where the effectiveness of a remedy has not been proven, it is useful to mention this in the instructions. This encourages the consumer to make a well-informed choice of the kind which the European Parliament also wants other legislation to promote.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I want to stress that scope must be allowed for the different needs of different Member States. For this reason I would like to propose voting for the proposal in order that if a Member State takes a decision about an application for registration of a herbal remedy it recognises the registrations or licences granted by other Member States. With this provision it will be easier for small businesses in particular to market regional products throughout Europe, so that all European citizens can benefit from regional products that have been proven to have therapeutic value. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Europe, too, consumers' interest has extended far beyond the household remedies which are customarily used in individual regions. Many people swear by these natural products, whether they are Chinese ginseng root or Indian tea tree oil. In the European Union, however, herbal medicinal products are not yet regulated on a uniform basis. In some Member States, they have to be authorised, whereas in others, facilitated evidence of efficacy is sufficient. Mr Nisticò has presented a very good report which creates broadly uniform provisions governing the manufacture, marketing and labelling of herbal medicinal products and sets high quality and safety standards.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the following points are especially important. First of all, there is the issue of quality and safety. The manufacturers of herbal medicinal products must provide evidence of their safety in the same way as is required for chemical medicinal products. In the simplified authorisation procedure, the efficacy and harmlessness of a product are proven through its long, that is, traditional, use.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need a new committee on herbal medicinal products within the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products. This committee should take over responsibility for the full range of tasks relating to herbal medicinal products. It will establish herbal monographs relevant for the precise but speedy evaluation of the applications for authorisation. The proposal before us not only enables us to achieve broadly uniform authorisation criteria in Europe; it also allows us to facilitate the marketing of herbal medicinal products in all Member States while maintaining subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">European consumers can continue to choose from a broad range of products which have been submitted by the manufacturer in accordance with the legal provisions and have been carefully scrutinised and authorised by the authorities. This guarantees product quality and protects human health to the greatest possible extent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like millions of other EU citizens, I am a user of herbal medicinal products. I want a guarantee that when I go into my local health food shop the echinacea or ginseng I buy is of a high quality and standard.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, in the UK at the moment you cannot guarantee that this will be the case. In front of me I have four certificates of analysis and four different types of echinacea products. The first has on its label echinacea root. However, the others simply are not good enough. One failed to comply because of excessive amounts of acid insoluble ash in the product. Another was apparently free of echinacea root altogether, and the last had not been solely manufactured from echinacea root powder as claimed on the label. This means that the next time I go and buy my echinacea, I have a 25% chance of actually purchasing what I want.</p>
<p class="contents">This lottery has to end. These inferior products on the market are cheating consumers and bringing herbal medicines into disrepute. However, we also require a flexible approach, especially on herbal nutrient combinations, traditional herbal medicines from outside the EU and non-herbal traditional medicines. Herbal nutrient combinations for products are not classified as medicines. Currently they may normally be legally sold as foods and that position would not change. Where these combination products are classified as medicines, currently they are not covered by the present UK regime for unlicensed herbal medicines and therefore require a marketing authorisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU proposal would offer greater flexibility than what is offered at the moment in the UK because the directive would permit the inclusion of nutrients which were non-active. Traditional medicines from outside the EU, such as Chinese medicines, will be able to satisfy the 50 year requirement. However, I agree with those in the herbal sector who would like greater flexibility in taking account of evidence from outside the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The key point is that the quality and relevance of evidence of traditional use is more important than geographical origin. This directive deserves to be considered in the light of all the facts, in the interest of public health, consumer confidence and expanded choice on the market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, British courts suggest that this requires weighing costs against the measures necessary to eliminate the risk. If we are to believe the rapporteur, the risks from uncontrolled use of herbal medicines are considerable. But I have looked at just one of his claims: that is that in the US products based on ephedrine have accounted for more than 1 200 cases of toxic effects, including 70 deaths. However, the dietary supplement industry estimates that as many as two billion doses of this product are consumed each year in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">As to Mr Nisticò's claims, the US General Accounting Office has examined the FDA data which he uses. To reach its conclusions the FDA used a combination of scientific evidence on the effects of ephedrine and a set of adverse event reports (AERs). According to the GAO the FDA relied upon 'poorly-documented AERs and weak information'. Furthermore, it did not perform a causal analysis to determine whether ephedrine products caused or contributed to the adverse effects. It did not document which AERs were serious and did not establish criteria to determine which events were serious. It did not perform any reliable assessment of its analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">These are just brief extracts from an 83-page report. I have similar reports on other risks that Mr Nisticò cites. The risks have been seriously overstated on the basis of scandalously poor evidence. There is hardly a measurable risk from the use of herbal medicines and it is, in any event, far less than that arising from conventional medicines.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the minimal risk, the cost of this measure clearly outweighs the benefit. There is no justification for it. I declare an interest. I use herbal medicines every day of the year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the other hand, it must not be imagined that natural substances cannot be a great danger to health when they are abused or prepared without care. Finding just the right sort of balance is a challenge for us, and I am convinced that my colleague Mr Nisticò, to his credit, has done so in his report.</p>
<p class="contents">Stringent quality and safety standards should be set for herbal medicinal products and clear labelling and instructions are required. The instructions must contain information on the potential toxicity of the substances and their interaction with food, drink or other medicinal products. In addition, for herbal medicines to be authorised for sale on the market the same practices have to apply, where possible, as with synthetic medicines. This is not meant as an attack on traditional medical remedies: on the contrary, the goal is to ensure there is a safe framework within which the herbal medicine industry can thrive in the Europe-wide market. Entrepreneurs in the sector will profit as the market grows and reputations are protected, and consumers will gain in terms of safety and price.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur raises some problems that have been encountered with irresponsible manufacturers, especially in third countries. Toxic vegetable substances or poisons such as arsenic and mercury, or other medicinal substances such as hormones, have been found in medicinal products. When there is such indifference combined with good faith on the part of the consumer, human lives are in danger. People associate herbal medicines with something natural, good and safe, and they do not imagine that if the dose is wrong or if there is any other form of abuse this can cause serious harm and even death, or that there may be serious problems of quality with the product.</p>

A full listing of the Commission's position on each of the amendments is provided in writing to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, on the extension of the scope of the simplified procedure. Let me underline that I am grateful for your support to limit, in principle, the new simplified procedure to traditional herbal medicines. It is crucial that we gain sound experience with this new procedure before we can plan any possible extension.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I understand the request from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy to slightly extend the scope of the procedure to those herbal medicines, which contain additional non-herbal ingredients. In principle, the Commission could support such additives as vitamins and minerals. However, we have to be prudent and exclude certain substances such as biological ingredients, which involve particular risks. For such substances we must insist on getting the standard scientific data.</p>
<p class="contents">Many speakers have mentioned the minimum time of use. As a general rule, 30 years of traditional use in total and 15 years within the Community are the minimum to ensure safety and efficacy of the products. However, there will be exceptions. It may be that a product has been used outside the EU for thousands of years, but has been available within the Community for only 10 years or less.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment proposed to shorten the minimum usage time within the Community from 15 to 10 years. The Commission is ready to lay down specific rules for such exceptions. From a European perspective, however, it is preferable to provide a European solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Where a product does not fulfil the general criteria of 30 and 15 years, we could empower the new committee to look into this product and to assess if the available information is sufficient. This way of establishing flexibility would have the advantage of meeting the double objectives to ensure the protection of public health while at the same time facilitating the free movement of these medicines within the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal already gives the new committee considerable powers. The Committee on the Environment wants to go even further and replace the committee which generally deals with medicines for human use (CPMP) with the new 'herbal committee'.</p>
<p class="contents">In principle, the Commission could support part of the proposed extension. We agree that the 'herbal committee' should deal with deciding mutually recognised procedures where divergent national decisions on herbal medicines are involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
