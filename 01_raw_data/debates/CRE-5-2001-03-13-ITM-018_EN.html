<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Myller (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FI) </span>Mr President, representatives of the Commission and the Council, I would like to warmly thank all the members of the committee for the constructive debate this part of the directive fuelled in committee, and I also wish to thank the division responsible for servicing the committee. We are in a rather special situation in the sense that the committee in the second reading was even able to improve on the results of the first reading, and this is due – thanks again to the committee members – to the adopted amendment, which combined the best aspects of the first reading and the Council’s common position. We have therefore drawn up some very ambitious aims for limits on emissions by the year 2010 to present to Parliament. Last summer’s common position took the results of Parliament’s first reading into account only to a very limited extent. However, the committee’s own vote on the issue shows how much it wanted to support the results of that first reading, and so we now have adopted a good and purposeful position with regard to tomorrow’s vote. I hope this position will prove successful tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive is an attempt to reduce the quantity of certain pollutants in the air, which are sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds and ammonia, so that in the long term we reach a situation where there is no danger to people’s health. This is to be achieved by setting some interim targets for the year 2010. These interim targets should help us to get to a point at which areas where the critical acidification loads are exceeded will be halved, where the ozone load that affects health is reduced by two thirds, and where the ozone load in excess of critical levels for vegetation is reduced by a third.</p>
<p class="contents">Regrettably, these decisions will not, however, enable us to achieve the targets that were agreed in the Community’s Acidification Strategy. For this reason, the parliamentary report now being dealt with is proposing a deadline until 2015, when these critical loads may no longer be exceeded, and a target for the year 2020, when critical levels should not be exceeded either. The proposal for a directive also contains the call for a review of the situation in 2004. The point of this is to better enable us to steer a course towards the 2010 deadline, see if we are on the right track, and consider what to do to achieve the targets.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a directive under discussion places a demand on Member States to reduce the proportion of pollutants in the air to a level that is safe for people’s health, although the Member States themselves can choose the remedies they need to attain results. The biggest threats, and thus the most challenging problem for the Member States, are emissions that result from energy production, and in this respect Mrs Oomen-Ruijten’s report, which has just been debated here, was a most important one, and I genuinely hope that in tomorrow’s vote we can achieve the best possible results, as that will have a direct impact on how the emission ceilings this directive deals with can be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Other causes for concern are industry and traffic. Industry is the only area that has been able to reduce emissions in the last few decades, while traffic only appears to continue to produce increased emission levels. Member States therefore have to do something about it. Traffic is a real challenge. We must be able to reduce traffic and change our behaviour, favouring alternatives that are less polluting, rail traffic and public transport, and, at the same time, lend support to technical developments that will have an impact on cleaner transport systems in other ways.</p>
<p class="contents">And lastly, I would like to say that the costs of this directive have been set too high in various connections. If we take into account what was decided in the Kyoto Protocol, for example, we will get to a position where we can halve the proposed costs. If then we compare them to the benefits we will derive as a result of this directive in terms of improved health, they will be worth many times the costs incurred. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The salient points of this directive, therefore, concern the reduction of emission levels of the said substances to below the critical levels and loads. The directive’s key element, or rather the most talked-about part of this proposal is, of course, the table which lists per country the permitted annual emission for each substance. A key concern in the discussion on this subject matter was that when at UN level, the 36 countries, including the EU Member States, agreed upon other, and often less strict, standards for the same substances, this met with a storm of protest. Consequently, at first reading, many argued in favour of replacing the European Commission table, which may have been ambitious, by the UN’s so-called ‘Gothenburg table’, which allowed higher ceilings.</p>
<p class="contents">During the discussions at first reading, I already indicated that the line of reasoning was rather weak. After all, UN agreements always have a lower level of ambition due to the fact that it is difficult to compare the situations in rich, prosperous, and thus often more polluting countries, with the situations in developing countries. Moreover, our continent suffers the direct environmental effects of the emission of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and volatile organic substances and, albeit to a lesser extent, ammonia.</p>
<p class="contents">At first reading, the PPE-DE Group adopted the European Commission’s ceiling at first reading. However, we have improved the ammonia table, partly because the risk of spreading is less pronounced.</p>
<p class="contents">My instinct tells me that the Council’s compromise proposal with regard to SO2, NOx and the VOC will lead to higher emission levels. Only with regard to ammonia can I identify with the Council’s compromise. The Commissioner is as aware as we are of the problems involved in implementing the nitrate directive: in actual fact, none of the Member States meet the standards specified therein. The Commission’s proposals to further reduce the ammonia ceiling are not feasible, in my opinion. I would add to this that the effects of ammonia emission are also partly a local phenomenon, and that a lower goal can therefore also be justified.</p>
<p class="contents">That means that we largely go along with the rapporteur: we support the first eight amendments; we do not endorse Amendment No 9. In the table, we support the SO2, NOx and the VOC and, where ammonia is concerned, we would refer to the Council’s proposal. We are also struggling with the rapporteur’s notion that what we want to reach in 2010 should, in actual fact, be reached in 2004. That seems highly ambitious to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I must also say that the working relationship with this rapporteur was highly successful, and that the work on the large combustion plants was excellent too. I would like to express my gratitude in this connection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A lot of what was said in the previous debate is of great relevance to this directive too. These two documents form the basis for the acidification strategy that we adopted three years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">When measurements were taken last Monday in my own home district, the level of acidity was higher than it had been for a very long time. Acidification is still a problem to which we cannot avoid drawing attention.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to begin by thanking Mrs Myller, who has done a magnificent job, as well as my fellow MEPs in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, who have contributed to our now having a proposal which is looking really good. The problem, however, is that the path between the committee and the plenary sitting of this Parliament is at times fraught with obstacles. The closer we get to the day of decision, the more afraid some of us seem to become. Once again, we see the conflict between industry, employment and the environment rear its head. Many who have previously been environmental campaigners are transformed into preservers of the status quo in their own countries and regions and embrace the old coal-fired power stations in their home districts. The long-term view and acceptance of responsibility are suddenly things of the past when the issue arises of how we are to obtain a sound environment for life in the future too.</p>
<p class="contents">At Parliament’s first reading, we supported those emission ceilings proposed by the Commission. In this connection, it must also be pointed out that the ceilings and figures presented by the Commission were based upon countries’ own reporting to the Commission. These were not invented figures, plucked out of the air. Certain people appear now to be denying these figures. The figures were not over-optimistic and, just as Mrs Myller said earlier, the economic calculations were, in actual fact, a good reflection of the reality.</p>
<p class="contents">When, now, the Council contributes its own points of view, it will come as no surprise if, this time too, a much more meagre result is arrived at, a result very close to the figures in the Gothenburg Protocol. In this connection, I would also remind you that – to begin with, at least – the Commission refused to sign the Gothenburg Protocol because it thought it was so inadequate and not ambitious enough. I really do hope that the Commission will now show that it supports what Parliament has said, above all in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. If we opt for the Council’s line, we in actual fact choose poorer health for our citizens in a situation in which children and asthmatics are among the most vulnerable. We also choose to exceed the critical loads and levels over a further several hundred thousand hectares of land. The list could extend much further. I hope that, tomorrow, we shall have the courage to approve the proposal tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We want to see a significant reduction in air pollution within a period of time that reflects the serious environmental problems we face. The Commission argued that the economic benefits would far outweigh the costs involved, but Member States dissented and said that they could not go beyond the targets agreed at the Gothenburg Protocol. Parliament was right, then, to back the Commission. I am pleased that in negotiation the Commission was able to overcome Member States' resistance, make some progress and secure more ambitious targets.</p>
<p class="contents">But at second reading we are in a rather different position. The Commission has said that it has made a firm agreement with the Council and is sticking to it. It will go no further, it says. It will not support the amendments tabled by the PPE-DE or the Socialist Group. I would like Member States to be more ambitious. But at first reading, Parliament supported proposals based on a Commission model which I find fiendishly complicated. In the absence of the Commission's support now, I do not see how we, as legislators, not technical experts, can propose more ambitious targets for individual countries unless we pull figures out of the air, which seems to me a rather poor and amateurish way of making law. So I have accepted that this is as far as we can go for the time being.</p>
<p class="contents">But I am also aware that this is a poker game and I am a rotten poker player. It may be that Member States have cards up their sleeves which they are prepared to offer up if pushed in conciliation. It may be that the Commissioner secretly wishes Parliament to pursue its original agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">If that proves to be the case then I have misread the game. I am waiting with interest to hear from the Commissioner whether she has been keeping cards close to her chest or whether her public position remains the same. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are four polluting substances involved. For two of the substances, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, an adequate solution can be found in Mrs Oomen-Ruijten’s report on large combustion plants. The problem of ammonia must be solved at local and national level. As for volatile organic compounds, we are, in actual fact, still missing part of the legislation. There are now rules which apply to volatile organic compounds which are released when filling up with fuel, as well as for substances of this kind used in industry. However, for volatile organic compounds in households, which, after all, account for one third of all emissions, such rules do not yet exist. That is why I am asking the European Commission when it will at long last come up with an EU directive on paints. We must move towards water-based paints, and it is time that rules were drafted to that effect.</p>
<p class="contents">The Gothenburg Protocol has been signed by 36 countries, and is subject to the right of veto. The common position is hardly more ambitious than the Gothenburg Protocol. The right of veto on environmental legislation has been abolished within Europe. It would be disgraceful if the European Union were unable to prescribe environmental standards which are substantially stricter than the Gothenburg Protocol. Tomorrow, Parliament has the opportunity to prevent this disgrace. I hope that 314 or more of my fellow MEPs will be voting for Mrs Myller’s excellent report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is nothing personal. This is one of the very few proposals I can recall which has come with a price tag attached. It is true that it is printed on page 112 of the original proposals. It does not appear on the Internet version any longer, but it was there on the version that was originally submitted to Parliament. This shows us the actual cost of implementing the proposed directive on national emission ceilings. It was news to the Belgian members of my committee that this proposal would cost them EUR 1 000 million a year. We showed it to the Belgian members and they did not like the look of that at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commissioner state whether the cost of what is being proposed has been discussed in the Council and what, for example, the Belgians have said about it? What about the French, for whom this measure will cost an additional EUR 916 million a year? What about the Greeks? According to the Commission's estimate, this will cost them an additional EUR 338 million a year. So how far are they actually willing to pay the cost?</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Müller has addressed this problem. In her Amendments Nos 1 and 6 she rejects the word "broadly" and says that the Member States must actually agree to remain "exactly" within the emission ceilings. If Parliament accepts that, we have an even greater right to ask how far the Member States will actually agree to abide by these proposals. When the Commissioner comes to reply, could she perhaps say something on Amendment No 8? Does subsidiarity apply here or not? If it does not apply, then presumably we have to await proposals from the European Commission. If so, since the instruments cannot be taxes, which would not be agreed, what will they be? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Almost all acid rain comes from the burning of fossil fuels used in energy production in other European countries. Acidification is therefore a problem ‘imported’ into our country.</p>
<p class="contents">The natural environment in large parts of the north of the EU has little capacity to act as a buffer against pollution. That is why acid rain causes a lot of damage in Denmark, Sweden and Finland. Major efforts are made each year to reduce the damage by liming lakes and watercourses. Without being able to put my finger on the exact figures, I would venture to maintain that, over the years, Sweden has, in financial terms, invested more in liming in order to combat acidification than certain Member States have invested in reducing acidifying emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">Certain areas are extremely vulnerable to acid rain, such as south-western Sweden, certain mountain areas in northern Sweden and, especially, southern Norway. I would address all you MEPs from different Member States. If we are to be able to save the valuable countryside in these areas, we need your help. We appeal to you to see the issue from a European perspective and to help us with the major problems caused by acidification. Moreover, reducing combustion emissions is an important health issue in quite a few EU countries. Many people in my own country with an interest in the environment are pinning their hopes on the European Union. The UN has proved to be poor at tackling environmental problems in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that taxation is an issue for the individual nations. The national parliaments must choose the best and most practicable ways of achieving the national emission ceilings that have now been proposed. I cannot therefore support the proposal for EU taxes to combat emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to comment on the unemployment argument. Overall, a good environment and better health do not lead to unemployment. In the long run, efforts in favour of a sound environment and better health are a good investment, leading to reduced costs and a better economic position. The situation in Russia would have been much better today if there had been no need to inherit the ill health and the environmental catastrophe left behind when the Communist system collapsed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council’s common position is remarkable for its lack of ambition and for the fact that the Council does not want to set a date for when the measures are to come into effect. So we know how the directive is to be complied with. It will quite simply not be complied with at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament should therefore again be as ambitious in combating acidification as the Commission was in setting what have been called emission ceilings. With Parliament and the Commission shoulder to shoulder on this issue, the Council’s position is becoming rather embarrassing for the governments of the Member States. Finally, I want to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Myller, for her efforts to achieve results in this important area of environmental concern. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Effective national emission limits must therefore be set for the main pollutants.</p>
<p class="contents">After some long and hard negotiations the Council achieved consensus on national emission ceilings. The Commission, for its part, supports the Council’s common position. The Council’s common position would mean a significant reduction in emissions. It is perhaps not as ambitious as Parliament, in its first reading, would have liked, but perhaps it is the best possible compromise in this situation. Our Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has unfortunately finished up by making some proposals that are so dramatic and ambitious that, if they were implemented, the general consensus that has been reached would be jeopardised. In this respect I am in agreement with the views expressed earlier by Mr Davies.</p>
<p class="contents">When emission limits were being discussed in Parliament’s first reading in March of last year, I stressed that new targets should not be set before the earlier ones had been achieved. The Commission must check that there is continued improvement in all Member States, and promote measures to help industry to make the necessary changes. It is important that environmental targets are achieved as cost-effectively as possible. For that reason, Mrs Jackson’s question is more than justified.</p>
<p class="contents">As worthy as the tighter restriction on emissions as proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy are, we should be aware of the possible adverse effects of our hopes and voting behaviour. Delaying this directive and embarking on a course of prolonged conciliation, the poker game which someone mentioned, would certainly be the worst alternative from the point of view of the environment. And besides, the environmental benefits gained from more stringent measures would be very slight in comparison with the costs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know you have a lot to do on the Sixth Environmental Action Programme and other things. The proposal for a directive on national emission ceilings aims to tackle acidification, eutrophication and ground level ozone simultaneously. It is therefore highly significant for two of the four priority areas identified in the Commission's proposal for a Sixth Environmental Action Programme: nature and bio-diversity and health and the environment. There are still important areas of the Union where nature and biodiversity suffer from the impact of acid rain eutrophication and citizens are affected by ground level ozone, as has already been commented on by Members of Parliament. We must solve these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 10 and 13 seek to reinstate the emission ceilings originally proposed by the Commission. In their common position the Member States endorse both the long-term goals and the interim objectives of the proposal. They have re-examined the commitments that they made in the Gothenburg Protocol and have signed up to more action. But they all consider that there are uncertainties and other factors that may change the picture in a few years time: energy plans, accession and so on. This is why Member States have agreed to look again at these issues in 2004. The Commission can accept this as a first step on the understanding that our aim in 2004 will be to make up the shortfall.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very concerned that it would be exceedingly difficult to have successful discussions on Amendments Nos 10 and 13 with the Council. There are different requirements for each Member State and fifteen points of view in the Council. The Commission therefore does not accept Amendments Nos 10 and 13. The Commission can, however, accept Amendments Nos 11 and 12. We will indeed have to look again at the Commission's original proposal for emission ceilings in 2004 and decide whether it would be better to share the burden differently in the light of more recent developments. Amendments Nos 11 and 12 explain this very clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">In answer to Mr de Roo’s questions, I want to say that the Commission has completed two studies on volatile organic compounds. We are now doing preparatory work and expect to be able to discuss potential proposals with experts actually before the summer. That is perhaps important information. As regards costs, and how far the Member States, Mrs Jackson, are willing to pay the costs? As you know costs were discussed at enormous length in the Council. Member States believe we can meet the target and they have signed up to what they feel they can do now. They want to look again at the costs in 2004 before signing up to more. Of course the costs are higher for some countries than for others because of where the pollution emissions come from. All emissions are not equal because of different weather patterns. That was also noted in the discussions in Council.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the remaining amendments are concerned, Amendments Nos 1 and 6 are related to Amendment No 10. The Council inserted the word "broadly" in recognition of the fact that the emission ceilings of the common position will not go all the way to meeting the goals for 2010 and the Commission does not therefore accept these amendments. Amendment No 4 would set dates by which the long-term goals of this directive should be met and it is still the Commission's view that, with our present knowledge, any date would be mere guesswork and we should not put it in a legal text. The Commission must therefore reject Amendment No 4. I hope we will have a clearer forecast when we review the directive in 2004, but then – if you will forgive the joke – some emission figures will have to be taken out of the air.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission agrees wholeheartedly that emissions from international shipping are important and must be tackled effectively. We must also look at the effect of aircraft emissions. The Commission can accept fully Amendment No 2 and can accept in part and in principle Amendment No 3. We would however prefer to quote Directive 99/30 more directly. We cannot accept Amendment No 5, nor the first part of Amendment No 7. Emissions from international maritime traffic and cruising aircraft cannot be assigned to individual Member States. We must instead follow up action already taken in the International Maritime Organisation and decide what else is needed. The Commission can accept Amendment No 8 in part and in principle. Bringing forward proposals on economic instruments is something that we will look at as part of our review of the directive in 2004. We can accept in part and in principle the second part of Amendment No 7 and Amendment No 9. Again, the Commission cannot accept the requirement to bring forward proposals. All the issues highlighted by Parliament should be considered during the review. I thank Parliament for its time and look forward to progress on this very important dossier. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
