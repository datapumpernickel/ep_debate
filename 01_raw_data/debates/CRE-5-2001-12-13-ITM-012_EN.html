That was the most important message to come out of the Afghan women's summit convened in Brussels on 5 and 6 December with the support of the EU. Around 50 leading representatives from every social group in the country attended the conference, in a bid to make the voice of Afghan women heard in the current international political debate. We are delighted that the UN-Afghanistan conference held in parallel in Bonn decided to appoint at least two women, including one as deputy prime minister, to the transitional government. Our summit in Brussels certainly helped here. They can count on our support, but more needs to happen. We insist that women be given a good chance and be selected as candidates in future elections at all political levels. That means they need support and practical help now in a special democracy programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Care must be taken in any future negotiations to ensure that Afghan women are fully integrated in efforts to resolve conflicts and in ongoing peace talks. The whole world and the media are watching at present and this must be used to build up new structures and ensure that the voice of Afghan women is heard. My group will use International Women's Day in 2002, just as it did in 1998, to maintain the wave of support in favour of averting a humanitarian disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">The new watchword of the Social Democrats, who have been highlighting the plight of women under the Taliban regime for years, is this: no project for the future of Afghanistan and no form of political agreement will be accepted unless women are fully involved. We are calling for a group of leading Afghan women to be set up to coordinate international support, with a corresponding contact for assistance from the EU. The women and girls of Afghanistan have had to withstand 20 years of war and constant infringement of their human rights. But that does not mean they were condemned to silence. Afghan organisations such as the RAWA have worked hard to resist the Taliban regime.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no reason to believe that things will be much better under the Northern Alliance, which is why we must support the courage and determination of the RAWA today. This morning we put budgetary arrangements in place to support NGOs such as the RAWA. But we need staying power and committed women to ensure that women get peace, freedom and equality in Afghanistan. We must not let up until women's rights are fully respected as human rights under the future constitution.</p>

<p class="contents">I should like to recall their Declaration of the Essential Rights of Afghan Women, which they adopted in Dushanbe on 28 June 2000. These were women issuing a call to action and not only victims. I should also like to recall, as Mrs Gröner has just done, the Afghan Women's Summit, which concluded on 6 December 2001, last week, and which issued a proclamation which it is important to be familiar with. This proclamation says: Afghan women want their rights now, not tomorrow, not later on. All these rights have been returned to them; we therefore need to restore these rights now.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I have tabled an amendment which I would ask you to support, calling for these rights to be re-established as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to give them the means to travel and to receive education and healthcare because ultimately we, the women of the same world as them, are a little anxious. We are a little anxious and we call on the European institutions and the UN institutions to be vigilant. Paragraph 5 of the resolution calls for the UN to focus particularly on establishing equality between men and women in Afghanistan, because these women have really been the symbols of many things. They have been the symbols of their own oppression, but they have also been the symbols of famine. Six months ago, when we were debating the situation in Afghanistan, they were the symbols of the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddha statues, and even of their own oppression. It is not therefore a question of discarding the symbol once it has served its purpose. It is a question of acting in such a way that the women are able to rediscover their rights and, for those who feel able to fight actively as representatives of all of the people, to participate in the government.</p>
<p class="contents">These women are active participants in this process and we live in the same world as they do. They are demanding the freedom to travel and the recognition of habeas corpus; I believe that these freedoms are the same as those enjoyed by Westerners and that we should not seek to draw a distinction between them. That is why there is no secondary issue here, just one thing which I am asking you and that is, if possible, as an institution, to work to ensure that these freedoms are respected, because we are not sure that tomorrow will be any better than yesterday for these women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Afghan women have good reasons to be afraid, for we know that the Northern Alliance too has perpetrated crimes such as forced marriage.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that women and children should survive the winter. At the same time, it is important to proceed with the measures referred to in this House: full access to education and healthcare for women and young girls. We must immediately proceed on the basis of a rights-based approach. Afghan women should not have to beg for the right to education as a favour. Instead, this must be a right. In that way, they will achieve the dignity and receive the education that they require.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to earmark funds but, in this area, equality between the different ethnic groups is required. We are delighted about the outcome of the Bonn Conference, but the work must go on.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to draw Mr Nielson’s attention to the special report prepared by my predecessor, Mrs Rehn, on the UN’s peacekeeping activities and ask him to note that there is a lot to do when it comes to the treatment of women by the peacekeeping forces. Women are needed in the peacekeeping forces, and an understanding is required of how to treat women who have suffered violence. I hope that the UN will support the proposal tabled by Mrs Rehn in her report to Kofi Annan.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of guilt also needs to be examined, that is to say who bears responsibility for what. It is the only way in which to bring about healing. I believe there is a lot of international experience in this area that we can draw upon.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, quite a serious issue, Commissioner Nielson. Mine dogs, which are extremely important in clearing away all this devastation, are also needed. I hope that the EU can offer support in this area, too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The 29-strong transitional government will include two women. This is a fundamentally important message and a first step towards social recognition. With the end of the Taliban's reign of terror and its mediaeval regime in sight, the brutal suppression of women's rights will also come to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">They have been the main ones to suffer under the caste of self-appointed warriors of God. They have been denied an education, training, career and the right to any say-so whatsoever. They were banned from public life. The painful result: only 5% of women and girls can read or write.</p>
<p class="contents">From now on, women will acquire equal opportunities in access to jobs, medical care and the right to vote on a par with men. In Parliament and the government they need seats and a voice. I am convinced that they will succeed in building up their own organisations so that they too can influence the economic and social decision-making processes. They will be unstoppable in finding their new identity, but they need staying power and our support.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the women whom we honoured on 8 March 1998 in our campaign "A flower for Kabul" will be able to return to their professions as doctors, teachers, professors and managers. On behalf of the PPE and as a member of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, I support the proposal to make the 8 March next year Afghan Women's Day.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has supported Afghanistan alone to the tune of EUR 400 million over the last 10 years. In future, we must invest more in programmes and projects for women. As far as reconstruction is concerned, we call on Afghanistan's neighbours to take an active part in this process.</p>

This was well before they, and their tragic country, became the focus of the world on 11 September, as the Taliban's link with the perpetrators of the attack on the USA became clear to everybody.</p>
<p class="contents">Afghanistan is now at an historical crossroad. I, as a British MEP, am proud of the role played by the courageous troops from my country in helping America rid Afghanistan of its oppressive masters and end their harbouring of international terrorists bent on the destruction of western values, including women's rights. I salute particularly those who have been wounded in the campaign and hope, as the UK is about to become a major component of the UN peacekeeping force, that no further casualties will ensue.</p>
<p class="contents">Two weeks ago I was invited to meet a representative from the Revolutionary Association of Afghan Women and I, as a Conservative, baulked initially at the title "revolutionary". However, after my meeting I decided that, in Afghanistan, my western views on social and political rights for women would no doubt, in the eyes of the old mujaheddin guard, such as President Rabbani, classify me, too, as a revolutionary. I welcome the participation of two women in the interim government and I am hopeful that the new generation of younger, progressive and modern political leaders will see the way to establish a new order based on equality of the sexes and on full political and social rights enshrined in their international treaty obligations, and cease to regard women and their role as a purely economic one and a procreative one and banish them to invisibility in their burkas. Women were once, in the 1960s and 1970s, welcomed by the government of King Mohammed Zahir Shah as full participating members of society in their professions, in higher education and in politics. I hope that Afghanistan can return to this form of moderate secular government again, and make use of the huge pool of talent residing in more than 50% of its population. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Saudi Arabia is one of just three countries which officially supported the Taliban regime. It has been promoting and financially aiding Islamic fundamentalism and it seriously violates the human rights of women.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, given Saudi Arabia’s anti-women pedigree, is it coherent that at the meeting in Washington on 20 November, that country should be named as part of the group that will lead the reconstruction of Afghanistan?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Afghanistan is now entering a hopeful stage and they must begin to change the harsh living conditions for women. We need a plan containing urgent measures in order that Afghanistan may embark on reconstruction and the road to peace and progress. The European Union must concern itself as directly as possible with imposing order in the distribution of humanitarian aid and establishing speedy measures and structures so that girls and women may receive education and healthcare.</p>
<p class="contents">My final recommendation, Mr President, is that we remember those women’s organisations which resisted the Taliban – such as RAWA – and it is those organisations which must now play a decisive role so that women are fully involved in the reconstruction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Fatima was talking to me on the telephone from Kabul: she is not a refugee but a RAWA leader. She says the streets in Kabul are once again crowded and the markets are full but there is no money and widows still live on charity and children scavenge on rubbish heaps. Everyone is still afraid. A few women have removed or raised their <span class="italic">burka</span>, some men have had a shave, music has started to be played again, but there is fear of punishment and vendettas. That is why, said Fatima – and I agree with her – there should be a United Nations force there, without Russians, Americans or the British but with contingents from other countries: a multi-ethnic and multi-religious force working at disarming the military groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Everybody is talking about the rights of Afghan women. That is excellent, provided women are not used yet again to justify acts of war. For years, Afghan and also European women have been denouncing the oppression and violence of the Taliban regime to deaf ears in the West. The war is not over; we cannot pretend it is and talk just of the future and reconstruction. Important steps have been taken for women to be included in the formation of the government, but that is not enough and the process is not finished. We must support those democratic women who have a secular view of the Constitution and who rise above ethnic and tribal divisions, but without denying their own identities.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of us have met them; together – as other Members have mentioned – we have drawn up demands, but we have also put our own responsibilities on the table. The mines that maim were produced in western factories; the cluster bombs, dropped in their thousands in recent days and lying unexploded, are products of our factories; ours are the perverse patents allowing mines to be designed in the shape of butterflies or dolls; ours are the pretty yellow cluster bombs, the same colour as the packets of food dropped from aircraft.</p>
<p class="contents">A shared road links us to the Afghan women, the road to freedom and justice for everyone, men and women.

This was recognised in the nature of the aid programmes which we financed at that time and which had a strong focus on the provision of health care, education and employment creation for women.</p>
<p class="contents">With the arrival in power of the Taliban in Kabul in 1996, the EU agreed a Common Position on Afghanistan. The Common Position is renewed annually and clearly sets out among its objectives the promotion of respect for international law and human rights, including the rights of women and children. In addition, the EU undertakes in the Common Position to support aid programmes which integrate gender concerns and actively attempt to promote the equitable participation of both men and women and promote peace and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, the Commission, through its ECHO-financed programmes and through its budget for aid to uprooted people, continued, even during the Taliban period, to finance actions which provided health care and education for women and girls and provided employment opportunities and training for women. I met many of these women and men in Kabul last week. It made me start talking about what I call the 'other Afghanistan'. We all know the Afghanistan of the warlords. But there is an alternative Afghanistan. We also have heroes and heroines of peace and compassion. Many of them work in projects that we are funding, did so during the Taliban regime and have continued doing so since September 11.</p>
<p class="contents">In an ECHO-funded project for vulnerable children, I met the girls sitting there learning to read and write and asked how many wanted to become housewives when they grew up. Only a few hands were somewhat hesitantly raised. Then I asked how many wanted to become schoolteachers or doctors. Everyone put their hand up – they all wanted to do something. A very nice moment I would say, and their lady teacher was proud.</p>
<p class="contents">Another project involved a woman producing quilts which we use for refugee projects. She was alone, her husband had died in the conflict, and when the Taliban came to power, she had to stop working as a crane operator in the construction industry. She has 10 children and her home was being used. They sat on the floor sewing these quilts and that was a very nice experience. At the end, when we left, I could not resist giving her a hug to express my feelings – clearly not politically correct when the neighbours could see or, indeed, at all. But it was well received, and I was quite happy to be part of a civilised and nice meeting of cultures in the centre of Kabul.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we are fortunately in the post-Taliban era. Changes are now possible and we hope that what was achieved in Bonn on December 5 will pave the way for a big improvement in the situation of women and girls in the country. Women were included in the delegations in Bonn; women will hold office in the Interim Administration. The Provisional Agreement makes a number of specific references to the guaranteed participation of women in the next phases of the political process – the Loya Jirga and the Transitional Administration. All of this will be overseen by the UN which has a constitutional role, recognised in the Provisional Agreement, to monitor the conduct of the Interim Authority and the emergency Loya Jirga, as well as providing for the development and implementation of a programme of human rights education to promote respect for and understanding of human rights in Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is currently processing new, additional aid programmes worth EUR 28.5 million, which will start being implemented in the coming weeks, for emergency aid and aid to uprooted people. Gender will, of course, be either a specific or horizontal issue in all of these programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">ECHO is already present in Kabul and we will formally inaugurate the ECHO office there in the middle of January. Commission officials plan to start being there permanently from 1 February 2002. It is therefore important to ensure follow-up also in view of what we are discussing here. Progress will provide crucial indicators to allow the EU and the rest of the international community to judge the commitment of the new Afghan administration to the engagement that they now have entered into. I must warn you not to expect miracles. It is a very traditional society, especially outside Kabul. The reality on the ground does not reflect the elite in Kabul that we easily get in touch with. There are many deep-seated differences. We must take a very broad-based approach and make sure that we deliberately include women in the many decentralised activities that we carry out across the country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has training camps in, among other places, Sulawesi, the island to which I shall confine myself to referring in this speech.</p>
<p class="contents">Using the Islamic terror group Laskar Jihad as a front, thousands of these fighters, some of them foreign, recently arrived on the island of Sulawesi. The thirty-nine-year-old Ya'far Umar Thalib from Yogyakarta, Pakistan-trained leader of this terrorist organisation set up in the late 1990s, denies the presence of Bin Laden’s followers. The opposite turns out to be true. Only yesterday did the head of the Indonesian national security service, ex-general Hendro Pliono, after a meeting with President Megawati Sukarnoputri, confirm that Al Qaeda is operating on Indonesian territory.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Indonesian authorities will not content themselves with making these statements. I call on them urgently to act decisively against Laskar Jihad and this offshoot of Al Qaeda, as there is no time to lose. Since the conflict first erupted on Amboina on 19 January 1999, one day before the Islamic festival of Idul Fitr, Laskar Jihad has murdered at least 10 000 Christians and has put many times that number to flight in terror of their lives.</p>
<p class="contents">I am extremely concerned that after the Moluccas this anti-Christian force should have found its way to Sulawesi too. I still have a vivid recollection of the story documented this autumn of the eight-year-old Christian boy. The boy was sitting on the bus with his mother. En route, some 50 Muslim terrorists forced the vehicle to stop. The attackers checked the passengers’ religious identity. Two turned out to be Christians, the woman and her son. They dragged the boy off the bus with brute force, leaving the mother behind utterly distraught. The young victim’s terrified screams were to no avail. The terrorists dragged him over the asphalt into the jungle, and nothing more was heard of him. Just one of the countless documented attacks on buses by Laskar Jihad in Sulawesi.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask both the Council and the Commission to do their utmost to contribute to the combating of terrorism in Indonesia, to explore in what way they could support a process of conciliation on the ground, and to examine what measures they can take to promote economic development in this region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When we talk of Indonesia, we are talking of an empire in which, under dictatorship, whole sections of the population were forcibly transported to other parts of the empire, the transmigration. That still underlies many complex conflicts.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time the transition from dictatorship to democracy is an enormous step. Since 1999 there has been some democratisation, but that is proceeding terribly slowly: on the one hand attempts are being made to strengthen democracy, on the other hand fierce ethnic conflicts are raging in many areas. The Jihad, which was previously active in the Moluccas, is now operating in Sulawesi. And every time one sees that the army has difficulty in really detaching itself and accepting the rule of law and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">This is clear in Papua. The island is still further from the capital and although legislation on autonomy is in prospect, as well as a special court for investigating certain events, it is still clear how much effort it requires to take this step. Therefore we must strongly condemn the murder committed and do all we can to facilitate that process of reconciliation. The same applies to Sulawesi.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us therefore distance ourselves completely from the terrorists, the Jihad, and at the same time support the Indonesian authorities. The fact is that the vast majority of the population want reconciliation, want to live and build a society together. Ordinary citizens, whether Christian or Muslim, are not interested in the Jihad. For this reason, given all our experience, and with due modesty, we have an important part to play there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like first to say a few words about the murder of Theys Hiyo Eluay, which took place on 10 November after he had had discussions on behalf of the Papuan community with the senior command of the Indonesian military forces in West Papua. Theys Hiyo Eluay was not only a charismatic leader of the Papuas, but was also a moderate man, who did not seek complete independence for his province, but whose aim was autonomy within the Indonesian state and who had succeeded in achieving this autonomy via the Indonesian parliament. In October autonomy was ratified in the Indonesian parliament and after a dinner with the regional military staff he was murdered on the evening of 10 November. It is typical of relations in Indonesia that military units are able to frustrate a constructive process of peace and reconciliation in this way and that this kind of murder can take place. Many people believe that it was an act of revenge, because an autonomous Irian Jaya would never have given the military the power and financial rewards that they had previously enjoyed.</p>
<p class="contents">My request to the Commission and the Council is that they should ask the Indonesian Government to investigate the murder thoroughly and punish the culprit, so that justice is done in a country where injustice prevails. In addition I should like to request help for the regional government of Irian Jaya, for example for the setting up of a civil service academy, so that people have a real chance of administering the region.</p>
<p class="contents">And then there is the situation in Sulawesi and Celebes. These are the same Laskar Jihad groups that previously caused such misery in the Moluccas and were responsible for thousands of deaths and hundreds of thousands of refugees. In this case too we would request that the Commission and the Council ask the Indonesian government to protect the Christian community in Indonesia and keep better control of the fundamentalist Muslim groups.</p>
<p class="contents">If Indonesia wishes to retain its respectable and important position, the present government really must call a halt to this violence and the European Union must make it clear to Indonesia that political murders and violence are not acceptable; otherwise the relationship between the European Union and Indonesia will in my view be put under strain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are informed that this is now being investigated as a murder case, which may not be sufficient to give us full confidence but at least they are taking this approach. Further action is also needed to restore calm and to develop confidence in the democratic process.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the Commission warmly welcomes the adoption last month by the Indonesian national parliament of the special autonomy law for Papua and encourages the Government of Indonesia to proceed to full implementation of the new law with determination and with due speed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also shares the deep concern of honourable Members concerning the recent deterioration of the situation in Sulawesi. Since December 1998, there have been several instances of violence between Muslims and Christians. The two communities are increasingly segregated – and both are armed. While reports from the area are sometimes unclear, the situation is certainly serious. Intercommunal violence has flared up recently around the town of Poso.</p>
<p class="contents">A report by a local humanitarian fact-finding mission, which visited the area (including Poso and Tentena) last week, suggests that the situation is now relatively calm, but that it remains very tense. While the TNI and police are making efforts to maintain security, to collect weapons and arrest those responsible for violence, the presence of a large and vociferous group of Laskar Jihad gives rise to continued fears of escalating violence.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s Delegation in Jakarta, together with the diplomatic missions of the EU Member States, will continue to make every effort to monitor developments in these areas and to draw our concerns to the attention of the Indonesian authorities in EU <span class="italic">démarches</span> and other contacts.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission fully shares the stated position of the European Union, which firmly supports the territorial integrity of Indonesia, while encouraging the government to make urgent efforts to address and resolve peacefully Indonesia’s internal conflicts, whether separatist or sectarian in character. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A year ago, it was 58 foreigners who were found dead in Dover; the year before, Yaguine and Fodé, two young Guineans, were found dead in the undercarriage of a Sabena plane. It seems to me that this keeps happening and that, faced with these tragedies, we actually only have one policy, which is to lock the door and throw away the key.</p>
<p class="contents">And, as Bernard-Henri Lévy would say, it seems to me that increasingly people are losing interest in what we might call the suburbs of the world. It would appear, Mr President, that there are two ways of tackling immigration issues today. The first, which is increasingly common, is to want to keep our borders wide open so as to have a source of cheap labour, liable to be ruthlessly exploited; and the other is not to want any immigration at all, which is neither preferable nor desirable.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is high time, Mr President, that we had some effective legislation, which is rigorous, of course, but simple in terms of form and common to all European countries, which takes account of the needs of both the southern and northern countries. We cannot continue to strip the countries of the south of their intellectual assets whenever we need them, cynically importing brainpower as if it were just another commodity which we need, as it were, to safeguard our pensions, while at the same time speaking the language of repression.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not about repression or charity; it is dignity which is at stake here. I believe that this is how we should tackle the issue of immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand – and we have seen illustrations of this throughout the afternoon – if we do not take into consideration the fact that today three quarters of the earth's population is living in the most absolute poverty; if today we do not cancel the debt of developing countries and if we do not discipline ourselves to invest in health, education and infrastructure, I am convinced that, once again, we will have failed to learn the lessons of history, as recent as it is.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, these destitute men and women, who are totally neglected, form a breeding ground for terrorism, a place where terrorism thrives. Fighting terrorism today also means fighting this poverty. Mr President, I have been so bold as to intervene without taking notes because I really do not think that we can continue to treat these people with such great inhumanity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There may well be further deaths unless we change our approach to this whole issue of immigration and refugee status. I would like to convey my deepest sympathy to the survivors of this tragedy for the loss of their spouses and their children.</p>
<p class="contents">The discovery of eight bodies, plus the five people who are seriously ill, in a container in Wexford in Ireland was an appalling tragedy which has shocked people, not just in Ireland, but all across Europe. Regrettably it is not the first time that this has happened. The suffering and terror endured by the injured and those who died – including four children – during the several days they spent in this sealed metal container is barely conceivable. They spent 53 hours at sea in a Force 10 gale in a container surrounded by furniture. The deaths all occurred as a result of lack of oxygen. The very thought of little children being put through that kind of terror is inconceivable. I urge the Irish Government to enable the survivors to remain in Ireland, to help them rebuild their lives, and to provide them with refugee status if that is appropriate. It may be that under law they do not qualify for refugee status, but if this is so they should get it, and they should still be allowed to remain in Ireland in any case.</p>
<p class="contents">The tragedy demonstrates once again the desperate lengths to which people are prepared to go to try to improve circumstances for themselves and their families. We hear much about the privileged treatment given to asylum seekers and I hope we will hear no more of this. The reality of the terrible experience facing many immigration and asylum seekers is revealed in eight people dead and others who are seriously ill. Lessons have to be learnt from this tragedy. There is clearly a need for more thorough checking of containers at the point of departure and arrival and for closer cooperation between the authorities in different countries. But, given that it will not be possible to check every single container, given that inevitably others will try this desperate journey, we should look seriously at the question of obliging those who own these containers to put air vents in them. Otherwise we are going to face this kind of horror yet again.</p>
<p class="contents">Ireland and Europe have to adopt immigration policies based on full respect for human rights as set out in international conventions, such as the Geneva Convention. Our policies have to address in a much more forceful way the political, economic and social reasons why people are fleeing their homelands. We must also relax immigration laws to prevent people from being driven to take these desperate remedies.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much regret this but I must condemn a statement made by Ireland's Minister for Justice last Monday, where he accused those who argue for a more rational and open immigration policy of simply proposing an open door policy on immigration. I am quite happy to engage in debate with the minister but the problem is that, in adopting that attitude and in adopting that frame of reference for this debate, he is feeding the paranoia which is at the root of much of the abuse that immigrants and refugees face in their host country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Doyle (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – I would like to thank you, Mr President and colleagues, for the moment's silence for the awful tragedy which took place only this week in my own home county of Wexford in Ireland. The tragic death of these eight people, including four children, found in the freight container just highlights the daily plight of many asylum-seekers and refugees throughout the European Union. Witnessing it last Saturday will remain with me forever. I would like to join personally with colleagues in this House in expressing my condolences to all those associated with this tragedy.</p>
<p class="contents">Since that awful incident, the bodies of four dead Romanians have been found inside a container bound for Canada in the Italian port of Livorno. The scale and European-wide nature of this problem have been tragically highlighted by these episodes and it is up to us as a European Community to respond far better than we have done heretofore.</p>
<p class="contents">Since its inception the European Union has always been based upon the values of solidarity and community. If the EU Council Summit at Laeken this weekend only addresses the issue of the strengthening of borders as a response to this modern day slave trade, it will have failed not only to respect these values but also to fulfil its leadership role.</p>
<p class="contents">These appalling incidents highlight dramatically the contradictory attitudes to migration and refugee policies in the EU. Europe and Ireland increasingly need immigrant workers to do the jobs left vacant by greater prosperity and shrinking populations. But sadly, at the moment more political effort is being put into erecting stronger border controls to keeping migrants out than to developing policies for structured flows of immigration. Tragedies such as that in Wexford will continue to take place until this contradiction is seriously addressed by all Member State governments of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome efforts this week to finalise an EU-wide arrest warrant to deal with these criminal 'people smugglers' who benefit financially from the misery and desperation of others. The single market has brought many benefits to our citizens, but it has also provided the criminals with just that – a single market for their activities. Today, more than ever, we need Eurojust and Europol to deal effectively with the individuals who prey on the misery and desperation of others.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the historical legacy of Irish economic migration throughout the world in the past two centuries, particularly during and after our Irish potato famine of 1845-1849 is one which we as Irish Europeans should not ignore. We should now be generous enough to take our share of those fleeing persecution and those seeking to make a better life for themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">If the deaths of migrants in freight containers, on the undercarriages of trains or in ship holds in recent months demonstrates anything, it is that responses to economic migration based solely on the monitoring of the illegal movement of people will not prevent people from resorting to desperate measures to travel to Europe. It is imperative that we also address the underlying problems within the countries from which these desperate people flee. Perhaps then the tragedy last week in Wexford of the Turkish, Algerian and Albanian economic migrants will not have not been in vain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Sylla pointed out that this is not a one-off incident and that problems such as this occur year in year out, which is why I do not intend to go through all these measures again on behalf of our group. We know what the problem is and we have already voted in numerous resolutions on what needs to be done and what needs to be implemented, some of which is already being implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to address a different aspect, an aspect which I should like to link to your one minute's silence, Mr President. We honour victims with one minute's silence. These victims deserve not just the honour of our one minute's silence; they also deserve the following consideration: the people who turn to the criminal elements who take money from them to get them to what they see as paradise, are people with hopes. They have hopes for a better life. Generally, it should be said, they have hopes for a better life not for themselves but for their children. They give everything away, all their worldly goods, their property and their hopes. There is a German proverb which says, "Hope is the last to die". The people in this container still hoped they would reach their destination until they drew their dying breath.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to another aspect of my thoughts on the subject. The people who gamble on these hopes, the people who take money for these hopes, the corrupt border officials who allowed these people, who were from Kurdistan, to cross our external borders, the criminals who want to capitalise on people's desperation, have also earned one minute of the deepest contempt of which we as a civilised society are capable. I should like to follow on from your one minute's silence by dedicating this contempt to their victims. Their children should know that the perpetrators have the full contempt of the civilised world.</p>

We talk about illegal immigration to Europe and about people who try to make their way here without valid travel documents. It is, however, we who make their status illegal by constantly making the visa requirements more stringent, by constantly sending out the signal that they are not welcome, by forcing the airlines to accept their liability as transporters and by giving shipowners the task of assessing who shall be allowed to seek asylum. This situation cannot continue.</p>
<p class="contents">We must agree upon a common, humane and generous refugee policy and a migration strategy for the whole of Europe. I hope we do not again have to sit here in this House in two weeks’ time following a similar event and express regret about the deaths of more people. We must look forward.

<p class="contents">This is something that we are going to see happening again if we do not look at our whole policy – this fortress Europe mentality – the fact that we are building the barricades and the walls higher and higher. We are trying to prevent people from coming in and we need to implement measures which will prevent asylum-seekers resorting to traffickers in their effort to reach a country where they can seek asylum, as they are entitled to do under the Geneva Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">There is quite a lot of hypocrisy concerning this issue, and I would like to refer to my own Minister for Justice in Ireland, John O'Donoghue. He was crying crocodile tears at the weekend over this event yet he has tightened the laws in Ireland in every possible way to ensure that asylum-seekers do not come to Ireland to file an application for refugee status, which I would like to reiterate is something that they are entitled to do under the Geneva Convention. To highlight this minister's hypocrisy further: yesterday, for the first time in the history of the Geneva Convention, there was a meeting of the 141 countries that signed that Convention in 1951. Our minister, who was crying over what had happened at the weekend and saying that it was one of his worst fears, did not think this meeting was important enough to attend.</p>
<p class="contents">We really need to change our policy on how we treat asylum-seekers and refugees and we have to stop building the barricades higher and higher to keep them out. We have to realise that there are people who are desperate to get out of their countries and that there are reasons why they want to leave. They are human beings, they are not the so-called undesirables that some people would like to think. They are exactly the same as the Irish who were desperate to get out of Ireland at one stage going to America and other places – where they were well treated. We have a duty and an obligation to treat everyone in this world equally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Everyone has in mind the tragic deaths of 58 Chinese stowaways in Dover last year, but unfortunate people die almost every week trying to reach what they consider to be a unique area of peace and prosperity. Smuggling and trafficking of human beings are nowadays increasingly carried out by criminal organisations which profit from the distress of women, men and children in search of a better life or in need of international protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Although many measures have already been taken at national level and under Schengen cooperation to tackle this horrendous form of crime, the Commission can understand the frustration expressed by Parliament when confronted with the apparent failure of existing instruments. There is definitely a need for enhanced action and cooperation at national, European and international level. This is why the Commission put forward in November a communication on a common policy on illegal immigration, aiming at creating synergy of national efforts by adding a European dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the main messages flowing from this communication is that preventing and fighting illegal immigration is part and parcel of a comprehensive migration policy. It is crucial in building up support for a common asylum regime based on the highest humanitarian standards, as well as genuine immigration policy in line with our tradition of hospitality and solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">More efficient controls at the external borders, improved consular cooperation and reinforced police and judicial cooperation, are key elements. Nevertheless, there is more to it than that: partnership with countries of origin and transit, a policy of sustainable return for illegal immigrants and the fight against undeclared work are all essential in this regard. All this must be achieved in full compliance with international obligations and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The framework decision on combating trafficking in human beings, the directive on carriers' liability and the directive and the framework decision on the liability of smugglers, already approved by the Council, are only first steps. In a broader framework, it is crucial to ensure a swift ratification and a coordinated implementation of the UN Palermo Convention against transnational organised crime and its two protocols on trafficking and smuggling, which now form the basis for a global recognition of the problem and a stronger approach to tackle it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Laeken Summit is now only a couple of days away. This will be the occasion for a mid-term review of the implementation of the Tampere conclusions. This should provide a unique opportunity to give a new impetus to a much needed common immigration and asylum policy. The Union is indeed behind schedule in these areas. A major political effort to fill these gaps as soon as possible would be our best tribute to the memory of the victims of Wexford.</p>
<p class="contents">But rather than looking at the global perspective, the rich world has some soul-searching and wallet-searching to do. The general level of development assistance flowing from north to south is an unsatisfactory 0.22% of the GNP of the rich countries. There is a link between this and what we are discussing here and this also defines the challenge we have to face. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The regular condemnations issued by the European Parliament, the most recent of which dates back to September, have had no effect. Human rights are constantly disregarded and democracy remains an elusive utopia. The leader of the students' union, Hounjo Mawudzuro, has been imprisoned. Last August, the chairman of the main opposition party, Yawovi Agboyibo, was sentenced to six months in prison on fallacious grounds. New threats of legal action are hanging over him and President Eyadema will not release him unless he applies for a pardon. In fact only someone who is guilty can apply for a pardon and Yawovi Agboyibo is not guilty. His only crime is to have criticised the regime. He should be released unconditionally and be able to stand as a candidate in the parliamentary elections which are to be held next March.</p>
<p class="contents">Democracy does not consist solely of holding elections. These are dependent on what happens upstream, and in particular on the rules stating who can vote and who can stand as a candidate, just as we saw in the past in Côte d'Ivoire and as we see today in Congo-Brazzaville.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament should strongly condemn these new developments and see to it that the elections run smoothly. Only if human rights are respected and the rule of law upheld will it be possible for normal cooperation relations between Togo and the European Union to be resumed. It is necessary to establish a dialogue with the regime and the opposition. This is why the Joint Parliamentary Assembly should send a mission to Togo to report on respect for human rights and the smooth running of the electoral process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is creating common regional, economic and political structures. If everything goes according to plan, we shall be able to talk and hold discussions with parliamentarians from the new West African regional assembly of the regional parliament at next year's ACP assembly. We shall be able to organise our practical cooperation. But there are a few serious constraints, one of the most serious being the authoritarian regime of President Eyadéma in Togo.</p>
<p class="contents">We are calling for the immediate release and restoration of the democratic rights of Yawowi Agboyibo, who was arbitrarily arrested and is now serving a six-month sentence which he has done nothing to deserve. Having served over five months of his sentence, the president should release him without further ado. We are not calling for a pardon. He did nothing wrong, he merely highlighted abuse in the system and he should be released from prison as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We are devastated that the attempt by our President, Nicole Fontaine, to meet President Eyadéma in Paris last week and ask him, as a favour, to arrange for this release, proved fruitless. Eyadéma is playing cat and mouse with us. We can no longer allow provision to be made for more development aid here. We support the Commission in suspending development aid. But we hope that we shall soon be able to provide further humanitarian aid for the people of Togo and we also hope that democratisation will continue next year, despite all the obstacles, and that it will be possible to hold parliamentary elections and then presidential elections a year later.

Though Mr Messan, a local journalist, and Mr Olympio, leader of an opposition party, have recently been released, Mr Agboyibo remains in prison. Recent reports suggest that more journalists have been arrested.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has several times conveyed its concern about the political climate to the government of Togo. It made representations to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 17 August. On that occasion, the Union emphasised its desire that political parties and the media be able to operate freely. On 18 October, the Union issued a declaration reiterating its concerns, emphasising the importance it attaches to the freedom, openness and transparency of the electoral process and calling on President Eyadema to have Mr Agboyibo released.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has taken note of the government's decision to schedule parliamentary elections for 10 and 24 March next year. The Commission has earmarked about EUR 1.56 million to help prepare the elections. The funding will pay for electoral equipment and the printing of ballot papers. The financing agreement has been signed, the first contracts concluded and the first deliveries received.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has also accepted the invitation of Togo's Minister for Foreign Affairs to take part in the election observer mission. That participation could be coordinated by the United Nations, should it decide to take on that role. The conditions for organising and conducting the observer mission have yet to be established. The European Parliament is obviously very welcome to take part in the election observer mission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is, however, disappointed that the government has still not signed the memorandum of understanding required for the deployment of EU observers, and it is continuing to urge the government to sign promptly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission continues to monitor political developments and respect for human rights closely, especially in view of the early parliamentary elections. It is ready to provide assistance for the preparation and conduct of the elections. The main objective of such assistance is to help the government establish the conditions for transparent, free and democratic elections that would enable the European Union to resume cooperation with Togo.</p>
<p class="contents">We have still to note that cooperation with Togo, save of course for operations directly benefiting the vulnerable and weak part of the population, has been officially suspended since fruitless consultations with that country ended in the latter half of 1998. We hope change is possible, but this is a very difficult case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are all aware of this. They are also both female politicians. I wish – if you do not mind – to stress first of all the word female, because these two women are politicians in countries where it is very difficult to attain this rank and to break into this field. Gender equality amongst politicians is not either Turkey’s or Burma's strong point, as you know. If I say two female politicians, however, then I must also say that these are two women who have been elected. They have therefore been elected democratically and are the representatives of a nation, of a section of a nation, of a political movement in one case and a Kurdish minority in the other.</p>
<p class="contents">In both cases, these are, at any rate, women who represent people other than themselves. I have to say that this is already a considerable achievement: they are women, they are politicians and they are elected. I must also add that these are two women who are courageous. This is not a moral judgement; it is a political judgement that I am making when I say that these two women are courageous. Why? Because one of them renounced exile precisely because she was a representative of her people, and the other does not want to be released on health grounds because she is not the only one in prison and she represents a Kurdish minority; other militants are in prison too and she does not want the freedom which her captors are prepared to give her, or which she is said to have been offered because of her health.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is important to stress that these two Sakharov prize-winners obviously ought to be received by our Parliament but also have their fundamental freedom restored to them. We should also recognise, however, not only that Articles 10 and 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights should apply to them, of course, but also that it is real-life democracy that is at stake here, and that in one case we are dealing with Turkey, a candidate country for accession to the European Union. I ask you: can we accept that the violation of fundamental rights is as important as this while at the same time agreeing to this country's cooperating with the European Union? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The awarding of the Sakharov Prize is not only a grand ceremony but also an important demonstration, with echoes around the world. Hopefully, it also gives further courage to brave people coping with oppression and slavery. The prize is an expression of the basic values characterising EU foreign policy: respect for democracy and human rights throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who were awarded the prize last year live under difficult circumstances, but they live in peace. That is not so in the cases of two former recipients of the prize: Aung San Suu Kyi, who received the prize in 1990, and Leyla Zana, who received it in 1995. These two courageous women, both parliamentarians, have been kept locked up by their respective governments year after year, despite international pressure. Aung San Suu Kyi has been kept in solitary confinement and under house arrest for an unimaginably long time. It is eleven years since she was elected as her people’s legitimate leader. We have seen some softening of attitudes on the part of the Burmese regime. A small number of political prisoners have been released recently. That is not enough, however. Together with the other political prisoners in the country, Aung San Suu Kyi must be released immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">Leyla Zana is held prisoner by a country that is applying for membership of the EU. I hope that Turkey will be able to play its part in this House one day. However, radical and genuine improvements are required in terms of human rights before we can even begin <span class="italic">negotiating </span>about membership. Leyla Zana and all the other political prisoners in Turkey must also be released.</p>
<p class="contents">In this House, there is firm cross-party resolve to keep on reminding the world, including Burma and Turkey, of the fate of these two women and of the struggle for human rights, democracy and freedom of expression that they represent. I hope that the Commission can also talk about what it intends to do to ensure that next year is a year in which we help secure the release of these two women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For ten years she has lived permanently either in prison or under house arrest, while her homeland has turned into one of the most violent countries on earth. Over half the members of parliament have fled, are in prison, have been driven into exile or have been killed, and several million Burmese have fled to India, Bangladesh, Thailand, Malaysia, the United States and Europe. In Burma wholesale repression is being carried out against the members of Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi’s party and members of minority groups. There is also use of forced labour in the construction of infrastructure, and meanwhile Burma has become the world’s second largest drugs exporting country after Bolivia.</p>
<p class="contents">This military dictatorship is kept afloat by drugs, forced and cheap labour, terror and that situation has persisted for over ten years. Our question is again: European Commission, institute an investment embargo or an economic boycott against this country, as the United States has now done. It is perhaps the best punishment for this violent dictatorship and the best gift that you could give the elected president of Burma, Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi.</p>
<p class="contents">My sympathy also goes out to Leyla Zana. It is not good for a country seeking to join the European Union to allow such an affair to drag on for so long. Let Turkey show that it wishes to be a country governed by the rule of law and that it wants to grant Leyla Zana as soon as possible a full place in its society and in the parliament to which she has been elected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The two female winners face the same barrier: they are still without their freedom – Leyla Zana is in a Turkish prison and Aung San Suu Kyi is under house arrest in Burma. This is an intolerable situation and, at the same time, a reminder to us that human rights work needs not only to be celebrated but requires us to persevere and remain vigilant. Furthermore, as both women – in the eyes of their governments - are dangerous criminals, I cannot help asking myself whether Sakharov prize winner Nelson Mandela and the ANC led by him at the time would not seem to fit the definition of terrorism now being put together by the EU.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Mr President, it may sometimes be necessary to take more time to say less. Still, I must say what I had planned to say. We attach great importance to this. I would add that the activities of Parliament on matters such as this are important in themselves and also important to the way in which Europe is perceived both by Europeans and globally.</p>
<p class="contents">The General Affairs Council, in the conclusions of its October meeting, called for the release of all remaining political prisoners in Burma including Aung San Suu Kyi. The Commission strongly supported – and continues to support – that call. It was ten years ago last Saturday that Aung San Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. She is a past winner, of course, of the Sakharov Prize. She remains, today, a formidably powerful symbol of the principles those prizes represent, as she did before – an inspiration to her own people and to the world at large. I know how much support she enjoys in this House, support with which I want strongly to associate myself.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a measure of both her courage and her commitment to non-violent action that Aung San Suu Kyi has decided to remain in her country under detention and to engage in discussions with the authorities responsible for that detention in order to pursue her goal of establishing democracy in her country.</p>
<p class="contents">Her persistence, her passion and her wisdom have been instrumental in the positive developments that have occurred in Burma over the last year, even though it must be recalled that these developments are only the beginning of a process which needs to be further deepened and to evolve into a constructive and more concrete dialogue based on respect for internationally accepted standards of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, while we salute Aung San Suu Kyi and assure her of our continued admiration and support, we also encourage the government to pursue this groundbreaking dialogue actively. We have already underlined the readiness of the European Union to consider positive measures in response to concrete results from the present talks. But we need to see these results, not least the early release of the many hundreds of political prisoners still held in Burmese jails.</p>
<p class="contents">The case of Leyla Zana is very well known to the Commission, as stated in several Regular Reports on Turkey. The case has been a cause for concern raised with the Turkish authorities on many occasions. The Commission is aware that the case of Mrs Zana has been discussed many times at the European Parliament and has recently received renewed attention in the framework of the EP report on Turkey as well as during the EC-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee recently held in November.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the renewed attention of the European Parliament to this case. In this context, as stated in the Regular Report for Turkey 2001, the Commission expects that Turkey will observe the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights of 17 July 2001 on the absence of a fair trial in this case. This would be a significant step by Turkey with respect to the actual implementation of the recent constitutional amendments whereby the right to a fair trial was explicitly guaranteed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
