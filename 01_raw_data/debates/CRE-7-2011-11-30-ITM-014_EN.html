<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mikołaj Dowgielewicz, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(PL)</span> Mr President, honourable Members, it is clear that this European Council meeting is exceptionally important. On behalf of the Polish Presidency, I would like to say, first of all, that at this meeting of the European Council very responsible and important decisions need to be made – decisions which will determine the shape of the European Union in the next few years. This European Council and its decisions can shape the European Union to a large degree. It is not just another meeting of leaders who will decide the direction of the Council’s work, but it is a point at which we have to decide whether we can demonstrate single-minded determination and use every available instrument to defend the European project and its greatest achievement – or one of its greatest achievements – the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">So, having agreed these matters with the President of the European Council, I would like in more detail, but in a few words, to introduce the main topics which will be discussed at this Council. </p>
<p class="contents">If you look at the agenda of the European Council, you will, of course, see that the European Council will review the overall economic situation and will revert to the question of promoting growth in Europe. Furthermore, Heads of State and Government will track progress on the implementation at national level of the commitments under the Euro Plus Pact, with particular attention to jobs and tax issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to remind you that the President of the European Council will inform Heads of State and Government of the reflections on the strengthening of economic convergence within the euro area, on improving fiscal discipline and on deepening economic union, including exploring the possibility of limited Treaty change. As you know, the Presidency will also contribute with ideas on strengthening the unity and convergence of the European Union and we will do this in the light of the forthcoming General Affairs Council on Monday.</p>
<p class="contents">On energy, the European Council will track progress on the implementation of guidelines set in February 2011, in particular as regards energy efficiency, the internal energy market, energy infrastructure development and external energy policy. It will also assess the initial findings of the nuclear stress tests.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, in addition, a number of other items to be addressed by the European Council. The European Council will take the required decisions on the possible next steps for accession countries. It may well also have to come back to the issue of Schengen accession by Romania and Bulgaria. Finally, it may also need to address the situation in Iran. I should also mention that the European Council is expected to take note of the Presidency report on the multiannual financial framework. Now, if I may, I shall say a few more words on economic policy and on enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">On the European economy, it is clear that the economy has taken a turn for the worse. Deteriorating confidence and intensified financial turmoil are affecting investment, exports and consumption. It is important that the Union’s new economic governance be fully implemented with a view to building confidence in the strength of the European economy. The Presidency fully agrees with the Commission’s assessment in its recent Annual Growth Survey that now the stress must be on implementation. We have taken on many commitments. In some areas progress has been good, but in others it has been more measured or – basically, in less diplomatic terms – it has been quite weak.</p>
<p class="contents"><br />Structural reforms and differentiated fiscal consolidation efforts must continue to lay the ground for a return to sustainable growth and thus help to improve confidence in the short term. Measures are also required in order to help restore normal lending to the economy while preventing excessive risk-taking. The priority must be to boost jobs and growth; this is why the European Council is expected to support the principle of a fast-track programme of measures, as set out by the Commission. This would mean the Council and the European Parliament working together to ensure the rapid adoption of a number of key legislative proposals, something which I know is also dear to you, Mr President.</p>
<p class="contents">The Annual Growth Survey launches the next European semester, which will be the first to be implemented as part of the recently strengthened economic governance, including the new procedure for monitoring and correcting macroeconomic imbalances. This is really crucial. We strongly believe that those new mechanisms can make a real difference. The spring European Council will review progress and adopt the required guidance.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the Euro Plus Pact and its objectives, the Heads of State and Government taking part in the Pact will review progress made in implementing the commitments at national levels; they are expected to focus on employment. Let me just mention, to close this part on economic policy, three principles that the Presidency would like to see guide this European Council. Firstly, more unity within the twenty-seven. Secondly, more Europe, so enhanced coordination and strengthened economic governance. And thirdly, strengthened institutions, so that whatever we do, we do it within the institutional framework of the European Union and we ensure that there is a proper legitimacy for the measures which we adopt if we decide to go forward with the Treaty revision. There should be an appropriate enhancement of the role of the European Commission, but also there should be a place for the democratically elected institution of the European Union, obviously the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">My final remark is about enlargement. I would like to inform the House that we expect Prime Minister Kosor to take part in the European Council as observer after the signature of the Treaty of Accession of Croatia. As you know, enlargement has been a priority for the Polish Presidency, to show that despite the difficult times, the European Union is still open and we are still very serious about our open-door policy. We look forward to Croatia becoming the 28th member of the European Union on 1 July 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">On Monday, the General Affairs Council will discuss the situation of the other candidate and accession countries. This will not be an easy discussion. The Presidency has worked very intensively to prepare a set of conclusions for the GAC, which once agreed should be endorsed by the European Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Olli Rehn, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission. −</span> Mr President, I have been invited to discuss the preparations for next week’s European Council with you on behalf of President Barroso. The European Council will, of course, take place in an extremely challenging economic and political environment. Its focus will inevitably be on the economic situation and on the measures we have proposed to restore confidence in the euro area and the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that our room for manoeuvre is now much more constrained than two years ago. To respond to the current situation, the Commission has utilised the current Treaty’s scope to the maximum and proposed forceful measures to complete the Economic and Monetary Union. Economic governance is being strengthened and mechanisms to address the financial crisis have been already been put in place.</p>
<p class="contents">Last Wednesday the Commission adopted the Growth and Governance Package, which consists of three parts. The Annual Growth Survey spells out our view of the policy priorities in the coming 12 months to restore macrofinancial stability and boost sustainable growth. Two proposals for new regulations will further reinforce economic and budgetary surveillance in the euro area. The feasibility study on stability bonds examines the potential benefits for financial stability of jointly issued bonds and the preconditions for their possible introduction.</p>
<p class="contents">The Annual Growth Survey launches the next European semester of economic governance by setting out the Commission’s views on the challenges and priorities for next year. This survey is being published at a time when the EU is going through the most challenging times of its history. It sets the following priorities for 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">First, to continue with fiscal consolidation, which has to be differentiated across countries, as we agreed in October. We also have to pay more attention to the impact of consolidation on growth. In this respect, it is essential to analyse carefully which expenditure we can reduce and how we can raise revenue in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, that normal lending to the economy has to be restored. It is necessary to strengthen the banking sector via appropriate regulation and recapitalisation and set up credible financial backstops for banks and sovereigns in order to break the negative feedback loop between the two sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, structural policies are key to reviving growth at the current juncture, when macroeconomic policies are heavily constrained. This means that structural reforms have to be stepped up, especially in services, network industries, the public sector and the digital economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth, unemployment and other social consequences of the crisis have to be tackled. Reforms are necessary to make labour markets more flexible and conducive to job creation.</p>
<p class="contents">The final priority of the survey is to modernise public administration at all levels in the Member States and in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">You may say that some of these priorities are not new. This is correct and it is deliberate. We have already made so many commitments that now we have to really focus on their implementation and concrete results.</p>
<p class="contents">The discussions of the Annual Growth Survey will culminate in the March European Council, after which the national programmes are prepared in the light of the guidance from the Heads of State and Government. In parallel, you in the European Parliament should also debate the Annual Growth Survey and make your views known before the work on Member States’ programmes starts. To my mind, that is a very important opportunity for the European Parliament to influence policy-making in the Member States in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude on the Annual Growth Survey, I want to underline the following once more. Without swift and determined implementation these priorities will do none of us any good, nor help achieve sustainable and inclusive growth. I have full confidence that in the European Parliament you will help accelerate the adoption of what is currently on your desks in the codecision procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of the package we also proposed two regulations based on Article 136 for the euro area Member States. These present a major step forward in euro area fiscal and economic integration. They build on the ‘six pack’; they complete the European semester with rules for the second part of the year and establish a link between intergovernmental financial assistance and Treaty-based surveillance.</p>
<p class="contents">The first regulation proposes the introduction of binding rules for balanced budgets into national legislation, preferably at constitutional level. It also requires independent forecasts to be used as the basis of budgetary plans and draft budgets. But, most importantly, it proposes tight monitoring of national budgets, which you have been calling for. We propose a harmonised budgetary timeline with draft budget laws to be submitted to the Commission by 15 October every year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will then assess these draft national budgets against the Country Specific Recommendations and against possible EDP recommendations. Should the draft clearly not be in line with the recommendations, the Commission can ask for a new draft. The Commission is ready to present its opinion in the national parliament of the country concerned if requested.</p>
<p class="contents">When a Member State is in the Excessive Deficit Procedure, the Commission can issue recommendations for additional measures. The second regulation specifies the modalities for enhanced monitoring of euro area Member States – those Member States who are receiving financial assistance or are suffering from risks to their financial stability and to that of the euro area as a whole. It allows enhanced surveillance of a country that is considered to be at risk with regard to financial stability, even without a programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it proposes that the Commission will have the right to propose to the Council to recommend a Member State to seek financial assistance if the Member State concerned is posing a risk to financial stability, especially that of the euro area or Europe as a whole. This should be done on the basis of the Commission’s analysis in liaison with the European Central Bank. This proposal stems from recent experience, as we have seen that this has posed a genuine problem to the financial stability of the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">The fragmented European sovereign bond market is currently under great stress. Investors require substantial risk premiums on the sovereign bonds of some euro area Member States. This situation has revived interest in jointly issued euro area bonds to create a large and liquid bond market in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of the deal on the ‘six pack’ between the European Parliament and the Council, the Commission presented a Green Paper on stability bonds last week. Its key findings are, firstly, that jointly issued stability bonds would be likely to produce substantial benefits in terms of reducing and stabilising borrowing costs for Member States by providing better shock resilience for the financial sector and improving market efficiency over time. Secondly, however, as common bonds would reduce the market discipline of individual Member States, their introduction would only be meaningful on the condition that euro area economic governance were to be substantially further strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">The ‘six pack’ constitutes the foundations for reinforced economic governance and last week’s proposals represent a further step in the direction of stronger economic governance. But we would have to go far beyond these reforms to facilitate a safe introduction of stability bonds, which would most probably require amendment to the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Before concluding, let me say a few words on Treaty change. Let us be clear: a Treaty change cannot offer an immediate contribution to the solution to the current crisis. But it is true that, by working to embed stricter discipline and stronger governance into the euro area in particular, we may help to prevent a future crisis by creating a real stability union.</p>
<p class="contents">The President of the European Council was asked, with the Presidents of the Commission and the Euro Group, to identify possible steps on further reinforcing economic convergence within the euro area, including exploring the possibility of limited Treaty changes. These deliberations are ongoing and an interim report will be presented to the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s view is that any Treaty change should be based on the principle of one Union, based on the current institutional framework, which is clearly exemplified by the Community method. European integration can only be achieved by a single legal framework of one Union. That is the best way to build a real stability union, in fact a true economic union.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally importantly, only the Community method can guarantee consistency between European economic monetary policy and all other EU policies as well as the completion of the Single Market. That is the guarantee of the fair and just treatment of the Member States and EU citizens. I trust both the European Parliament and EU Member States will stick to this and be ready to justify the benefits of the Community method vigorously in future negotiations too.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in the event of any of revision of the Treaties, balance has to be maintained. We all know that there will be diverging views – some will want to put more weight on stability, while others might wish to place more emphasis on stimulating growth. Some will call for more solidarity and others will want more discipline. It will be essential and extremely important to incorporate all these elements in future work so that the end result will be a balanced set of rules ensuring both stability and solidarity, which are at the heart of the European social model.</p>
<p class="contents">I can second what the Minister said as regards energy policy, that this is a key element on the agenda. Likewise the European Council will take important decisions concerning the Schengen accession of Bulgaria and Romania. Let me express the Commission’s view on this. It is very clear: we expect that the Council will take the decision to lift internal border controls with Romania and Bulgaria without any further delay. We fully support the efforts made by the Presidency for a compromise solution. Splitting into two phases the decision on lifting internal border controls is feasible and politically sound. The second stage – the decision on the lifting of internal border controls at land borders – can then be taken without undue delay.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a word on enlargement and the Accession Treaty of Croatia, which is very close to my heart and to which Commissioner Stefan Füle will return after this debate. Real progress has been made during the last year with all countries – progress in which the cooperation with the European Parliament plays a significant role. The Commission has already given its favourable opinion on Croatia’s accession and we hope that the vote tomorrow will pave the way for the Council’s decision and the signature of the Treaty on 9 December. But I will leave the details to my colleague and will just say that this is a historic turning point for Croatia and a very important benchmark for accession by the rest of the Western Balkans to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude. In terms of the European economy and economic policy, we have indeed arrived at the point in time where serious choices and commitments have to be made. The economic and monetary union will either have to be completed through much deeper integration or we will have to accept a gradual disintegration of over half a century of European integration. This is a choice that needs to be consciously taken by the governments of the euro area Member States and by all European citizens and their representatives in the national Parliaments and here in the European Parliament. Our choice is clear. It is a choice for an ever closer union for the sake of sustainable growth and job creation in Europe and thus for the sake of legitimacy and, not least, for the sake of the future of European unification. This is what is at stake. I trust you will also make the choice for European unification and for these objectives, because that is what our citizens expect.</p>

<p class="contents">I should like to start my speech by saying how pleased I am that, following the green light given by the European Parliament, the European Council is now preparing to sign the Accession Treaty with Croatia.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate the Prime Minister of Croatia on the political determination she has shown in bringing her people to this historic point, and I am sure that her political resolve will have a positive influence on her European peers.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the situation in the European Union, we can say that the lights have changed from amber to red. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) predicts a recession in Europe in 2012. There are fewer and fewer buyers of sovereign funds. Rising unemployment rates are causing despair among Europeans, especially young people.</p>
<p class="contents">Confronted with these challenges, the European Union must at the same time take action and decide on its governance. There has been much talk recently of reforming the Treaties, but as far as I am aware the crisis is not to do with the Treaties; it is a debt crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) believe that the priority is to take action on national deficits in order to balance the budgets once and for all, and not to settle for a 3% deficit. The priority is to create growth opportunities once again by making the internal market a reality. The priority is to put our faith in the European Central Bank so that it behaves in a way that benefits our countries, by allying itself with the International Monetary Fund. The priority is to ensure that Eurobonds see the light of day, provided that the national budget effort is not only maintained but also increased. The priority is to listen to Radek Sikorski, who is urging us to take action and to deliver on the commitments we have made.</p>
<p class="contents">The second pillar of EU action must be governance of the euro area. This has been sorely lacking ever since the euro was launched, which explains the markets’ distrust. The development of such governance is therefore the <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> of any crisis resolution plan.</p>
<p class="contents">By governance, we mean a reduction in budget deficits, fiscal convergence and, if possible, social convergence. This governance must be European. What I mean is that governance between two or three countries, or even among the group of AAA countries – which is becoming ever smaller, incidentally – will not suffice. No, this governance must apply to all the countries in the euro area, in the Euro Area Plus.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be based on the Community method, which means at least two things. Firstly, that it must be the subject of an agreement, not just in the Council, but between the Council and two other EU institutions: the European Parliament and the European Commission. Secondly, that the only institution that can legitimately assess whether or not the new rules have been applied and, if necessary, refer the matter to the Court of Justice of the European Union, is the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, this governance must be democratic. What does this mean? Quite simply, it means that this House and the national parliaments, elected by direct universal suffrage, must be fully involved in the negotiations on the arrangements for European governance and in the decision-making process that will follow. Such participation by elected representatives in the decision-making process is the essence of our system of the rule of law; it is what our parliamentary democracies are founded on.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I shall conclude. While we are debating institutional reforms, the water continues to rise: to chin level for some, to knee level for others, but the flood is now affecting the entire euro area and is in danger of spreading to other parts of the world. As the German Finance Minister said, we need to act fast. Ladies and gentlemen, we need to act fast.</p>

We are doing so following the historic leap forward made by the European Council of 26 October, which in turn followed a historic breakthrough in the summer. What actually remains of the historic breakthrough of 26 October, Mr President and Mr Rehn? The long-term solution, the turning point we were hoping for, has not materialised. I believe that we can now see that.</p>
<p class="contents">The predicted leveraging of the EFSF by four to five times has – on this scale at least – proved impossible to put into practice. It is being widely realised – I think more so here in Parliament than in the Council and the Commission – that it is not a solution to now talk about a lengthy revision of the Treaty, because this will not solve the current problems. We have been looking for security and confidence – in fact we do that every day. What do we find? Uncertainty! Every day we find a bit more uncertainty.</p>
<p class="contents">The current debate is characterised by a perception problem in the capital cities of the European Union. This perception problem in our capitals in connection with this peculiar tendency to want to go it alone, which excludes the European institutions, can be summarised in one sentence: our neighbours’ debts are no concern of ours! That is a serious mistake, however. Our neighbours’ debts concern us all; they burden all of us together.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, instead of talking about the stability union, a growth union, the debt union, we perhaps need to come to the conclusion that we do indeed need the stability union, but we need to realise that without a growth union there will be no stability union in Europe. These are two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Our neighbours’ debts concern us because, in a monetary union in which we all stand together, they represent our shared fate. We can talk at length about who caused the debt. In the current situation, however, it is more important for us to discuss how to get rid of it. How can we limit the debt in order to regain the confidence of investors in the euro area and in our currency? I therefore believe that we will only regain this confidence once we achieve joint debt management.</p>
<p class="contents">Surprisingly, the Council of Economic Experts of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany made a proposal yesterday for joint debt management, in the same way as in other cases during similar monetary crises: pooling the debt and defining the timeframe within which we will reduce the debt in order then to concentrate on how we achieve what Europe urgently needs more than anything else – growth. We need growth that creates jobs and growth that creates fiscal capacity in the Member States allowing them to obtain their own income once again.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need for the next few days, weeks and months is to take bold steps without a revision of the Treaties, because, let us be honest, what would be the result of a revision of the Treaties? We can revise the Treaties, there would be nothing wrong with that, it would all be well and good. However, the argument that a revision of the Treaties will win back the confidence of the markets in the euro means that we would need two years to win back this confidence, because that is how long it would take for the Treaty revision to be complete, with a convention, an intergovernmental conference and a ratification procedure, including referendums in 27 Member States. However, we do not have that much time.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need to do now is to answer the following questions: do we want Eurobonds – yes or no? Do we want to support the Commission with regard to Eurobonds? We certainly do, but does the Council too? What is the role of the European Central Bank? Is it a ‘lender of last resort’ or not? It is interesting to hear the German Chancellor say that it is not. It is not a ‘lender of last resort’. She is, of course, acting completely independently, however. That is a direct quote from Ms Merkel. We all know that, with the complete independence with which the European Central Bank acts, it buys government bonds every day. It is already acting as a lender of last resort.</p>
<p class="contents">Answering the question of whether we should actually classify it in that way, or of whether we should really bring the debt into a system of management and reduce it, or of whether we are actually in a position to finance the investments we need by means of bonds in order for the triple A rated states to keep their rating and for those that do not have this rating to achieve it, that must be the goal of the euro area and not a debate about an artificial Treaty reform, which will not ultimately bring about confidence in the euro.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Guy Verhofstadt, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the ALDE Group. </span><span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, I think that the end game is coming closer. According to the specialised press – I am quoting the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> of today – international companies have started preparations for the break-up of the euro zone. That is the reality today. Italy yesterday managed to raise EUR 8 billion on the markets at an interest rate of 7.56% and the yield for three-year bonds was even higher, nearly 8%. And it is not only a question of Italy or a question of Spain or a question of Greece or a question of Ireland, for a few days now it has also been a question of Germany, which is not capable of raising the necessary money in its own auction that it launched a few days ago.</p>
<p class="contents">So I think that we are fast approaching the breaking point of the euro. Let us be blunt about this, it is not because of Greece and it is not because of Italy. It is because of the incapacity of the two main players today in European politics, the incapacity of Merkel and Sarkozy to deal with this crisis. That is the euro crisis of today; their incapacity to find a solution.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause and heckling)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I think there are a few Germans here, the supporters of Mrs Merkel. Well, today Merkel and Sarkozy are not the solution; I think they are the obstacle to the solution of the crisis. Let us be clear. Merkel is excluding Eurobonds, is resisting a bigger role for the European Central Bank; she is even against the idea of her own wise economists. In other words she is denying greater solidarity. That is the German position.</p>
<p class="contents">Sarkozy, for his part, is opposing a real fiscal union. In other words, yes, he is in favour of a fiscal union but in reality he still wants a political reading of the sanctions mechanism, and he is even opposed to the fact that the Court of Justice of the European Union should have the right to intervene in the budget. So in fact the French position of today is still defending the old ‘Deauville deal’, as if Parliament had not changed the Deauville deal and the ‘six pack’, and has voted another ‘six pack’ a few months ago as if there were no euro crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">So let me say it very openly. It is true that Germany and France have, in the past, made agreements which have been beneficial and important for the Union; today, however, they form an obstacle to the survival of the Union. Today all who do not want to give up the Union and the euro have, in my opinion, to stand up and to say no to this; we have had enough of their half measures, their bad compromises and their deals that only calm the markets for 24 hours, which is the only thing they are capable of doing for the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The time is right today to say yes to an economic union, to a political union, yes to a Eurobond market and yes to the proposal of the five wise Germans. It is time to say yes again to the euro.</p>

At the moment, I have the feeling that we have at least two councils: one council is the formal one which is represented by 27 Member States and takes place occasionally according to an agreed schedule. The other one has only two members who are Mr Sarkozy and Mrs Merkel, and it seems to be in session permanently. This is the one which really decides.</p>
<p class="contents">That, by the way, is a good example and good evidence that when hard times arrive the whole so-called Community method turns into a big illusion and it is the powerful ones who decide. Please do not get me wrong, this is not sarcasm. I have a certain understanding for Mrs Merkel because – there are many quotations in many languages and I will use the English one – ‘he who pays the piper, calls the tune’. And Germany pays. Mr Schulz is right, Germany pays. But it also wants some pay-back. That pay-back is the ultimate control over fiscal policy of all the eurozone members. If all of you in the eurozone want to keep the same currency you must be prepared for that; you must be prepared to give up your fiscal sovereignty.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps you can even save some public money by dissolving your national finance ministries, because you will not need them anymore. Your national budgets will be drawn up somewhere else. Anyway, this is your responsibility in the eurozone. I can only wish you good luck.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I cannot agree with one thing. I cannot agree with this fiscal protectorate being spread over all 27 Member States, as Mr Schäuble proposed only very recently. That is something which is unacceptable because one thing is clear from now on: today, there are two European Unions within one. We definitely have a two-tier Europe: we have the eurozone and the non-eurozone.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not disintegration. That does not mean an end to the European Union. This is just a reality that should be not only admitted but should be also reflected in our actions. Therefore both parts of the European Union must remain equal. Eurozone members should not be superior to non-eurozone members and the eurozone cannot just automatically drag the others with them.</p>
<p class="contents">Any further arrangement must recognise this reality. It does not matter whether this is a Treaty change or some other ways and means, such as an enhanced stability pact. If the eurozone states want to move forward in one direction, they must allow the others to move in their own direction as well. This is no longer a one-way street. This is reality. No longer do we go at the same speed and in the same direction. To use this crisis only as a platform in order to pursue further the project of political union and to further centralise power is short-sighted. It is wrong and in the end it will tear the EU apart.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also wrong to accuse others of wanting to destroy the euro. No one wants to destroy the euro here, definitely not my group, because our countries are very much dependent on the stability of the eurozone. We are not opposing the very existence of the euro; what we are opposing are wrong measures which will not save the euro. The EU must either be flexible or multispeed, whatever you wish to call it, or unfortunately very soon there will be no EU – with or without the euro. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we also have to deal with Mr Van Rompuy, who is closer to you in political terms than either of them. I would like to hear some clear words being spoken, particularly among the Belgians.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling from Mr Verhofstadt: ‘He is a Member of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats).’)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Yes, I know, but to me you nevertheless seem to be very close. I would like us to persevere consistently with the subjects that we are debating here today. It has rightly been pointed out that the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) is in government. Also, in the Commission, as we have often remarked here, there are many liberal Commissioners whose influence always seems to me to be lacking.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree on our assessment of the most recent summit and we have already made that clear after the night of crisis. Unfortunately, the events were exactly as described in the European Parliament. The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), which is being used as a lever, is a complete failure. It does not work at all. I am expressing my feelings more forcefully here than Mr Schulz. The recapitalisation of the banks, which is so urgently needed, has proved to be as ineffective as all the strict banking regulations which we have been carrying before us for the last year like the vessel containing the consecrated host. The debate on Greek debt reduction is stagnating. A bitter dispute is going on in Greece, but no one is talking about it. In contrast to the period when the crisis summit was held, we now have so-called technical governments in Italy and Greece, but for different reasons. Everyone has praised the fact that Mr Monti, for example, has taken over the government in Italy. What is happening now? As a result of following the rules laid down by Brussels, Mr Monti has the same problems as Mr Papandreou had before him. The country is in the same disastrous interest spiral, because the situation cannot be improved simply by putting in place austerity measures. We have been aware of this for a long time.</p>
<p class="contents">What is to be done? I would like to repeat the answer to this question from the perspective of my group. In the short term, the European Central Bank (ECB) must play a different role and the Heads of State or Government must commit to this. Poland has rightly called for this to happen, but it must not always be the only Member State which is doing so. I would like to thank Mr Rostowski once again for intervening. What he said was exactly right.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to get ready to issue Eurobonds and we are already too late. We should be starting with the ECB, but nevertheless we need to prepare for the Eurobonds. Also, we must ensure that people do not go on spreading the lie which is rife in Germany that Eurobonds mean that we in Germany will, for example, be taking over responsibility for the risks of the deficit countries and that the people in these countries will go on living the life of Riley. The Eurobonds are, of course, accompanied by a policy of solidity and solidarity. That is part of the idea behind them. Anyone who disputes that is simply running roughshod over the future of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The points quoted by Mr Verhofstadt are really alarming. The real economy and large companies are already preparing scenarios for the end of the common currency. The same article today in the Financial Times says: ‘Traders prepare for the end game’. I am not sure whether Ms Merkel and Mr Sarkozy are reading different newspapers or different analyses from the ones that I am reading. However, when I heard the fire alarm ringing here in Parliament today, I thought that it was an amplified version of the alarm signals which we should be sending out to the capitals of the Member States. It would at least be worth a try, because so far all the arguments have failed.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say a final word about Treaty change. I know that this is all about acute crisis management. I hope that I have made that clear. However, when you realise that democracy cannot function under the terms of the Treaty and has fallen by the wayside, although it is still possible to say that Treaty changes take too long in an acute crisis, if a change is really needed, then it would be wrong to postpone it. I do not believe that the enemies of European integration, in other words, those who are opposed to democracy and the right-wing nationalists, would have a stronger position if we were to discuss Treaty change and a reorganisation of sovereignty now. They are not the problem. I believe that we are not doing ourselves any favours in our debates with those on the right if we delay the democratic new beginnings and the implementation of sound democratic regulations. We have debated this at length this morning in the Conference of Presidents. However, if something takes a long time, it makes no sense to put it off even longer just in order to discuss it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even the countries with the best triple A ratings, such as Germany, France and the Netherlands, are feeling the adverse effects caused by the financial markets, which are playing cat and mouse with the euro countries. All the measures that we have adopted so far to regulate them have had hardly any effect. We can therefore legitimately ask whether it is time to change the rules of the game. However, the decision on this needs to be made by the EU institutions and not by means of intergovernmental agreements, such as those envisaged by Ms Merkel and Mr Sarkozy.</p>
<p class="contents">The vicious circle of downgrades to countries’ ratings and rising interest rates has to be stopped. Therefore, we are making a decisive call for the evaluation of sovereign states by private rating agencies to be qualified and for the creation of an independent European agency. In addition, the European Central Bank must be allowed to buy bonds without restrictions. Ms Merkel seems to be ready to exchange her resistance to this for closer supervision of the budgets of individual countries and automatic sanctions. However, this involves allowing intervention in the sovereignty rights of individual states, in this case budgetary rights, which means that the inherent rights of national parliaments will be disregarded.</p>
<p class="contents">In future, the Commission aims to be able to force countries to make social security cuts, lengthen working hours and increase the retirement age. I can only warn against implementing this policy. The results in Germany show that it puts a very one-sided burden on the majority of the population. Consequently, the social divide will become even wider. The low-wage sector now covers 20% of all working people. More and more people are finding themselves living in poverty in their old age. By contrast, a few rich people are becoming even wealthier. As a result of this policy, social equality is no longer functioning and society is threatened with collapse. I am opposed to a future of this kind for the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us clearly acknowledge that. Drastic intervention by the European Central Bank and the introduction of Eurobonds can only temporarily relieve the pressure on the financial system.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe should use the time bought with this stopgap measure to address the underlying problems. Firstly, there must be an orderly reduction in the unsustainably high debt levels of governments, the private sector, and, in particular, banks. Secondly, the financial system must be cushioned from the destabilising effects of large differences in economic competitiveness between Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The question that now arises ever more urgently is: can the measures that have already been agreed or those that are being discussed in preparation for the European Council of 8 and 9 December adequately address these issues? Will more stringent fiscal discipline and help from the International Monetary Fund be sufficient? I certainly hope so, when it comes to financial stability in the short term, but I have serious concerns about the longer term.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is whether it is possible to avoid taking steps towards a euro area governed by more stringent conditions: conditions with which I fear a number of Member States would currently fail to comply. Working on the necessary solutions will take time. Perhaps, we might jointly have to undertake a temporary, but thorough, reorganisation of the euro area, in order to ensure greater stability in the financial system and economy in the medium term. That will create good prospects for all the countries of the euro area and for the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This House always claims to set great store by the implementation of treaties. I would, therefore, like to ask Mr Rehn what he thinks about the ECB’s buying activities. Would you not agree that the ECB should immediately stop buying up Italian government bonds? If the ECB continues with this disastrous policy, I ask Mr Rehn to do everything in his power to stop it – including even possibly taking legal action.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the enlargement of the Union to include Croatia is, of course, absurd at the current time. The European Union is bankrupt. The European Union is struggling to combat massive corruption, and Croatia’s current score on the Transparency International Index is 4.1. Enlarging the Union to include such a corrupt country is obviously absurd at the present time.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Verhofstadt, you should learn to keep your big mouth shut. You do not remotely speak on behalf of Dutch VVD liberals, and your own party, the Open VLD, has betrayed Flanders by making it possible for this terrible socialist government led by Mr Di Rupo to get into power. I would, therefore, request that Mr Verhofstadt keeps his big mouth shut for a while. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If the Commission does not have the courage to press ahead with convincing proposals nor the resignation to turn back the clock and hence to make national policy choices and adopt a nationalist approach, it will inevitably be caught in the current, dragged under and swept away.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, however, the signals coming from our institutions are unclear. Of course, we realise that the Commission is engaged in a reform process, but it is equally true that a few weeks ago Commissioner Barnier’s proposals were scaled right down by the College of Commissioners, and we would like the opportunity to discuss in Parliament which Commissioner objected to the proposals, for example, on rating agencies, or rather on the creation of a European rating agency, and why.</p>
<p class="contents">Why am I asking this? Because, right now, the real debate concerns not only economic and financial measures, but also the nature of our democracy, and if we lack the strength to explain to our fellow European citizens what we are debating and who is on which side and with whom, then we will be swept away by another, far worse current, that of increasingly widespread indifference towards politics, of increasingly widespread scepticism that will distance itself from the European project as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When the diagnosis is wrong, the medicine has no effect. In the case of the euro area, successive types of medicine have been leading it to the brink of death.</p>
<p class="contents">Successive miraculous solutions that have been suggested have been equally discredited by the markets. The European Financial Stability Facility, the successive constraints to strengthen the Stability and Growth Fund, the <span class="italic">troika</span>’s measures in countries covered by bailout programmes, and the blind discipline without growth have created a wave of recession between economies that are totally interlinked, which have, therefore, contaminated each other with bankruptcies and unemployment. One by one, governments are falling into the clutches of the markets – in other words, the credit rating agencies – and solvent countries are becoming insolvent.</p>
<p class="contents">Treaty change now is yet another step along this disastrous path, but it is worse than that: we risk destroying the remnants of national sovereignty, by putting countries into the hands of the Court of Justice of the European Union. There is no need for Treaty change. What we need, in this emergency in which we find ourselves, is to make two decisions. Firstly, we need to set out a genuine agenda for sustained growth and cohesion. Where is the Europe 2020 strategy? Where is the budget for relaunch? Where are the projects and project bonds for Europe’s key investments? Secondly, we need to protect sovereign debt. Naturally, there is a need for Eurobonds, but in this emergency in which we find ourselves, there is an urgent need for the European Central Bank to, directly or indirectly, defend sovereign debt from speculators. This should not be done shamefacedly, but with a definitive, decisive position, as is incumbent on any central bank defending its currency and the economy that supports it.</p>
<p class="contents">What is needed, to this end, is not Treaty change: what is needed is political will and belief in Europe. Let us change the Treaty when we have learned all the lessons from the present crisis: there is no shortage of lessons to be learned, but this is surely not the time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that our fellow citizens are very aware of the fact that we are living in difficult times and that significant efforts are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Three conditions must be met if our fellow citizens are to agree to these efforts. Firstly, these efforts must be fair. Yet experience shows that there is a very long way to go before the criterion of social justice is met in the adjustment plans and the structural reform plans that your Commission and your Directorate-General are imposing on Member States that are today following a programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the required efforts must be credible enough to be seen as offering a solution. Here too, there is a long way to go. Two years have passed since the start of the sovereign debt crisis, and it does not feel as though we are overcoming it.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the efforts required must be done so in accordance with a democratically legitimate approach. I wish to say something to you regarding the two proposals that you made last Wednesday. I am genuinely concerned about your intention to give the Commission, the Vice-President of the Commission, the power to oversee Member States’ budgets, the power to intervene directly in Member States’ affairs, with no regard whatsoever for what the United States calls checks and balances, in other words the democratic legitimacy of the solutions proposed. As a democrat, I have no problem in recognising that I may be in the minority, ideologically speaking. However, I do have a problem when an ideology is imposed without any democratic oversight whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents">If the measures that you are recommending are adopted by this House today, I shall accept them. However, when they are decided behind closed doors by a Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs that operates without any supervision, that is something that no one in Europe can accept. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This could prove a huge sacrifice for those who, every day, or at least during celebrations, such as the 150th anniversary of the unification of Italy, flock together and pride themselves on symbols of national unity and flags. It may be less of a sacrifice for us representatives of Padania, but I ask President Van Rompuy and the other exponents of the European elite: what will we get in return for renouncing our national sovereignty? A bluff, because where are we going to get, for example, the EUR 400-600 billion in aid that Italy is being promised, at least according to the rumours that are circulating? Certainly not from the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards intervention by the European Central Bank, there is the seemingly insurmountable obstacle of the Treaties, and so we ask ourselves: are these requests genuine, or are they a bluff? Are we taking things seriously? What are we talking about?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Italy’s present situation, with its three-year government bonds standing at 8%, does not offer much in the way of hope, at least not in the short and medium terms. This is extremely worrying! I should also like to learn more about the Plan B that various States are rumoured to be preparing – it is even being said that Germany is preparing to mark euros with an indelible inscription that is supposed to guarantee the German character of those euros. We should like to learn more from Mr Monti’s mysterious advisors.</p>

<p class="contents">Next week, in the Council, our Heads of State or Government are going to have to take decisions that will be crucial to the future of the euro area, to the future of the Union. They are also going to have to give serious thought to boosting growth.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, it is clear today that financial stability has become the top priority and that the pressure on euro area countries that is coming not only from outside, but also from within, the euro area is destroying our credibility and undermining confidence. If we are to have any hope of restoring confidence, we need to restore financial stability and stop the terrible increase in national deficits and sovereign debt.</p>
<p class="contents">Financial stability has therefore clearly become the top priority and an urgent requirement for us all. Moreover, our democracies have all invested in very courageous programmes to consolidate their public finances and reduce their debt, and financial stability is also the prerequisite for any return to growth. However, when we say financial stability and budgetary restraint – because the two go together, of course – we should also include in that solidarity. I feel it is important to ensure this interplay between financial stability, budgetary restraint and solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">One final word on democracy. We must be careful not to disempower our democratic institutions. Rather than contemplating the use of a judicial mechanism to, say, punish countries for any budgetary excesses, let us think about supervisory and penalty mechanisms that democratic institutions can use.</p>

<p class="contents">Relying on the miraculous effect of a Treaty reform announcement would be pointless and counterproductive. Embarking on the risky road towards an intergovernmental treaty would have a quite devastating effect on the markets. Reforming the Treaties takes too long; an intergovernmental agreement will not result in any kind of fiscal union. The truth is that the problem facing the EU today is a political problem, not an institutional one.</p>
<p class="contents">It is possible, under the current Treaty, to strengthen economic convergence, enhance fiscal discipline, maintain stability in the euro area and boost growth. The two new proposals for regulations tabled by the Commission demonstrate this, and with that legal basis, Article 136, it is possible to go even further, including with regard to the role of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The flexibility clause would make it possible to increase the powers of the euro area, and Article 122(2) is an appropriate basis for that extraordinary Eurobond-based debt redemption fund proposed by the German Council of Economic Experts.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, one has the feeling that Treaty reform is being sought so as to avoid codecision, so as to have less rather than more Europe. Hence there are no excuses: immediate action must be taken and the foundations laid for the full creation, with the citizens’ consent, of a fiscal union based on stability, growth, solidarity and democracy, one that ultimately serves as the basis for that reform of the Treaties, which is too important a goal to be compromised by a clumsy, ill-timed reform that would be legally unnecessary, economically insignificant and politically harmful today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First, the problem we are facing is excessive debt and the macroeconomic imbalance of some eurozone Member States and some candidates. It is not a problem of the euro as a currency. It is problem of excessive indebtedness and the problem of healthy and unhealthy countries. It is therefore a horizontal problem of the whole Union and not of a euro club. Therefore the answer should be given at EU level, not at a subgroup level. Attempts to organise or institutionalise a small Union within the big Union are detrimental to European unity and destructive for overall EU architecture, as well as for growth.</p>
<p class="contents">After the great success of reuniting our continent, we risk dividing, unravelling, undoing reunification and risk starting ‘détricotage’ as the French say, negative spillback, encouraging divergence rather than convergence. Candidates, mostly from Central and Eastern Europe, are worried about being excluded and relegated to second-class membership and bound to enter the core Union for the second time. A large or small Treaty change should be done by all 27 countries – or at least 23: eurozone members and candidates willing and committed. Instruments like Eurobonds and the ECB’s new role should eventually be open to all of them.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we should save the euro in the whole boat of the European Union, not only the first-class compartments of the European vessel. Cutting the vessel into pieces is not a solution: all of it will sink. We need more Community Europe and not to go back to two Europes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You are absolutely right but, as time clearly is of the essence, why do we not say, directly and openly, that it would be a mistake to start debating changes to the Treaties at this point in time? It would be a mistake, not only because institutional changes cannot and must not be made under conditions of pressure and crisis, given the risk of giving birth to a monster, but also because they will inevitably prolong the uncertainty and reinforce intra-European differences and, hence, the misgivings of the markets.</p>
<p class="contents">We need stability and fiscal discipline, but we also need growth and social justice; we need fair cost-sharing. We need a combination of solidarity and responsibility, not only between the Member States, but within the Member States. In other words, Commissioner, we need a new package that includes stricter fiscal discipline. We have the rules; we adopted the six-pack and the Commission presented its new proposals last week.</p>

<p class="contents">I am very pleased that the Council has finally defined the priorities in connection with which fast steps must be taken. However, this is where we stopped. Somehow these fast steps were not taken. Much greater attention should be paid to aspects that encourage the growth of European policies. We need to do this in order to be able to maximise the EU’s contribution to its economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">In this situation there is no doubt that Member States’ budgetary consolidation is of outstanding importance, as is the reduction of debt. If we fail to do this the problems of the European Union will be re-created again and again, giving further cause for concern.</p>
<p class="contents">At the meetings of the European Council, you outline large-scale ideas and long-term plans in every case. Unfortunately in the short term these initiatives have no calming effect on the markets at all. In fact, they achieve the opposite effect. As a result of the negative feedback and incorrect statements it is becoming increasingly more expensive to finance the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, much more determined action is required in the interest of realising the concrete objectives. In the interest of this it is of vital importance to harmonise the measures taken by the Member States and your plans. However, this requires credibility and determination. Determination and action. Commissioner, I have looked for this determination. I have looked for it very much in your speech. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, that is not the truth of the matter. We have reached the point of discussing changes to the Treaties without having exhausted the possibilities in terms of Treaty of Lisbon case-law and, at the same time, we are calling for changes to be made to the Treaties on a limited number of issues, even though we know that they cannot be made, because that would mean setting up a European Convention and issues cannot be limited in a political body. No one can do that.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need to clarify our position. We need to clarify precisely what we want, because changing the Treaties is a question of procedure. It is not a question of reality or essence. We need to clarify what each of us wants. In other words, we need to clarify if we want a more advanced, more political Europe with standard economic rules, with fiscal discipline, with a single <span class="italic">modus operandi </span>– in other words real economic and monetary union – or if we want something else. All the members of the European Union have a say on this issue, not just the members of the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">Without doubt, the December Council will be crucial. I think that we also need to exercise a little self-criticism. The delays that have occurred have given the markets the opportunity to take control. Therefore, we are at risk of a sort of indirect abolition of democracy. It is therefore vital for the European leaders to all pull together and determine their stance on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I totally concur with what Commissioner Rehn said, which was that the credibility of the European Union and all its actors also depends enormously on how we implement the decisions which have been made. On this score, unfortunately, things are not going too well. Let me give you the example of the European Financial Stability Facility. The decision was made in October to increase this facility’s commitments, but it is not happening. For the moment, we do not have very good news either about the progress of the negotiations between the private creditors and the Greek Government, with the private creditors committed to reducing public debt by 50%.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that the decisions which we have made need to be implemented with the utmost rigour because the credibility of the European Union and that of the euro depend on this as well. I would obviously be pleased if I could receive some communication from the European Commission by the end of this year about how these decisions are being implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is our duty today to present them with a credible way to escape from the current crisis situation. What is needed is the truth. We need to tell them the truth, and we need to be in contact with the citizens and civil society. This is why after the Treaty of Lisbon we gave ourselves such instruments as the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and the President of the European Council, so that the voice of the European Union would be heard, and so that there would be people with whom the idea of a united Europe could be identified.</p>

Recent events – problems with selling German debt securities, the pillar of the European economy – provoke the question as to where this will all end. Recent events have confirmed that no country in Europe is safe in the face of the unprecedented panic in the financial markets. It is high time that radical and rapid action be taken, and we should call on the European Council to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">We hear the Council is to consider proposals to revise the Treaties. So I have a question about how these revisions are to be ratified. They cannot, after all, be carried out using a simplified revision procedure because of the strong interference in the sovereignty of the Member States. We must remember that any kind of change requires in some countries that a referendum be held. How does the Council intend to convince the people of Ireland that the proposed changes are in their interests and not in those of international banks? There can be no doubt that the time has come for radical decisions and original ideas to ensure financial stability. Nothing can be rejected or precluded in advance. Every measure should be put in place which can help give greater internal strength to the whole of a Europe of 27 countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So far, important decisions have constantly been promised, but when made they have turned out to be limited, fragmentary and overdue. This kind of response does not lend credibility to further decisions which are made or announced. The eyes of many of us have been turned on France and Germany. Their leaders have met very often, but these meetings have not produced concrete proposals. We understand their situation, which is caused by the fact that elections are soon to be held in these countries. In this case, the President of the European Council Mr Van Rompuy should begin to play a more prominent role and come up with specific proposals.

<p class="contents">The major trigger was cataclysmic financial market failure in 2008, subsequently fuelled by deepening asymmetries between the centre of Europe and its periphery. State-led intervention to rescue the banking system then precipitated a sovereign debt crisis made unsustainable by the current architecture of the euro. The reason why I often choose to reiterate this exercise of hindsight is the fact that it seems to be forgotten when our European leaders meet to resume their exercise in crisis management. Instead the focus has been on dealing with sovereign debt as if it were the cause of our predicament rather than a dangerous symptom of a serious malady. The systemic nature of external trade disparities and current account imbalances when Member States are bound by the same currency while at different stages of economic development has not proved self-correcting and it is in fact self-aggravating. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In real life, however, what we have is the exacerbation of inequality, unemployment and poverty; it is a path towards economic recession and social disaster. Meanwhile, the attacks on the sovereignty of countries with weaker economies, on the most basic principles of democracy, and on social and labour rights are intensifying. That is why there is increasing frustration with the policies of the European Union and social struggles are intensifying in various Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The intention behind the measures they are proposing – specifically, Treaty change – is to speed up the concentration and centralisation of economic and political power, so transforming the outlying countries into mere protectorates, subject to relationships of veritable colonialism.

It is not about providing help for the Greek economy, but about sacrificing the Greek economy for the integrity and prestige of the eurozone.</p>
<p class="contents">If Greece and other ailing countries were allowed to withdraw from the zone and revert to their own currencies, the value of those currencies would fall, reducing the price of their exports – visible and invisible – such as tourism, and bring about an export-led boom.

European citizens are calling for decisive action from leaders in order to protect sustainable growth and employment and in order to counter the contagion that is currently going on in the financial markets, which is threatening our jobs and growth.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that countries under market pressure need to continue to put their fiscal house in order and reform their economies to generate growth and jobs. This work is going on, not only in the ‘programme countries’, but more recently, for instance in Belgium and Italy with new governments, new budgets and/or other new perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">In parallel we must reinforce our economic governance and strengthen massively our financial firewalls to counter the speculation in the markets. To be credible and effective these efforts must be based on the Community method. That is the Commission’s position on how to tackle the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to work on all relevant fronts. Yes, the decisions of the eurozone summit of October need to be fully implemented. That is a necessary, even if not sufficient, condition of overcoming the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the Treaty-change debate, let us be clear on that. A Treaty change cannot offer an immediate contribution to the solution of the current crisis. But it is true that reinforcing fiscal discipline and economic surveillance, in the euro area in particular, may help to prevent any future fiscal crisis. Thus it matters to the confidence in the construct of the euro, which has been questioned in recent weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, the Commission has taken the initiative and we have proposed new legislation that will strengthen economic governance significantly. We have done that within the scope of the current Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The two regulations which I introduced today, based on Article 136, will ensure closer monitoring of fiscal and economic policies. They add another building block onto the economic and fiscal union and especially onto tighter fiscal surveillance based on the ‘six-pack’ legislation which you have recently approved. I sensed yesterday in the Euro Group and today in the Ecofin meeting of Finance Ministers that there is strong support for these proposals – and even going beyond these proposals – among the Ministers. I trust that is also the case here in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning our financial firewalls, the Euro Group yesterday took important decisions on the leveraging of the EFSF and thus reinforcing the financial firewalls. These have already been welcomed by several market participants, including the Institute of International Finance. In the very short term – or rather immediate term – this work must continue and we must consider further means to reinforce this leveraging effect, for instance through increasing resources available from the IMF for the European Union. In the longer – or rather already medium term – the Green Paper on stability bonds lays out credible options which to a different extent, depending on the option considered, could bring us closer to a fiscal union, could protect us better against speculative attacks, and would also reassure markets to have confidence in the credibility of the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me underline again – as I said in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs a few days ago and I have said several times before other compositions of Parliament – the necessary condition for considering any serious move towards Eurobonds or stability bonds is a further and very substantial reinforcement of economic governance to ensure fiscal discipline and economic stability, in fact to build a real fiscal union or an ever-closer economic union.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council will at this critical juncture need to take bold and determined action to reverse the current negative dynamics in the financial markets. It calls for immediate decisions both to ensure fiscal consolidation and growth-boosting reforms in the Member States. It calls for further reinforcement of our financial firewalls and for a road map on how to further reinforce economic governance and in parallel to put in place new stability instruments and thus to create a true economic union. Our citizens expect us to do whatever is needed in order to protect jobs and growth and we can best do it by deeper economic integration in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think we will best use the 10 days left before the European Council to prepare it in such a way that we can find the right responses and that it will be a set of decisions that will bring confidence and will allow us to set the course for long-term solutions for the eurozone.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I also want to reiterate what Commissioner Rehn stressed: that we believe very strongly that solutions must be found in full unity in the circle of twenty-seven; they must be found in a very ambitious way, with open minds and, when I say this, I also think that the European Council will have to balance a number of positions and interests to deliver a solution – a package deal – which will mean that delegations will also have to shift.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of Members of Parliament have today referred to their national discussions on the Eurobonds, on various consolidating measures, on the role of the Commission in the surveillance of national budgets. I think we all have to realise that the stakes are so high that everybody will have to show flexibility and I think this is very much the appeal that the Commission, the President of the European Council and the Presidency share and try to promote.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to say that in fact I find in this debate today a very large degree of consensus on what needs to be done. I think this is exactly what unites us: the determination to provide more solid economic governance, to provide more stability and at the same time to provide more solidarity. I think that this is the message that we all share: solidity, solidarity, stability, three ‘S’s.</p>
<p class="contents">My last word is on the MFF because I did not mention the MFF in my introductory remarks. As you know, the Presidency has started those difficult negotiations; I would just like to inform the House that we have advanced them and we have prepared the Presidency report, which will be presented and discussed at the General Affairs Council but also presented to the European Council for information.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not believe this is the moment for the European Council to discuss the MFF; nevertheless the Presidency is finishing a certain very important stage of those negotiations and, as we pass the baton to the Danish Presidency, wishing them much good luck with this file, I hope that we will also be able to set out some guidelines concerning the timetable of the work on the MFF for next year. I think that the objective, shared also with Parliament, should be to agree on the MFF by the end of 2012. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first group of causes relate to the expression that the unequal development of the capitalism characteristic of the EU is taking on: asymmetrical interdependence, which relegates the outlying countries and weaker economies to a subordinate and unfavourable position in the process of international division of labour. In this process, the links between the countries’ systems of production are broken, leading to increased external dependence, to the various deficits and to external debt. The second group relate to the conditions created by financial speculators: as other speculative bubbles have either dried up or burst, these have focused on sovereign debt. Free movement of capital, tax havens, derivatives and related speculative practices, lack of taxation of financial transactions, and the role given to the credit rating agencies; all of this creates a framework that makes it possible to speculate on sovereign debt.</p>
<p class="contents">Summit after summit, debate after debate, these causes remain untouched. That is the fundamental issue that has been ducked in this debate, both by the Commission and by the majority in this House; worse still, what they are doing is taking steps to entrench some of these causes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no parallel to the current situation in post-war European history, and it is now a question of the survival and preservation of the European project. The main item will be how to halt the eurozone crisis. I was interested, however, by one phrase in the meeting agenda referring to a discussion on the ‘economic convergence of the eurozone’ at the meeting. I would very much like to know what sort of convergence the EU leaders wish to discuss. A convergence which does not exist? A convergence rendered impossible by way the eurozone is set up? The way the eurozone was modelled from the beginning has contributed to the fact that we are now talking about structural imbalances in Europe. It is simply a logical consequence of the eurozone set-up that we now have countries with a surplus, such as Germany, and countries with a deficit, such as Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain. Therefore, not only does eurozone convergence not exist, but, on the contrary, the eurozone contributes to the worsening of internal imbalances. If the leaders really want to talk about 'strengthening convergence', they cannot avoid the fundamental question of what to do about the eurozone. The meeting agenda also includes the item ‘deepening economic union’. If the Council is going to insist that budgetary discipline is the priority, and if the leaders do not realise that some form of transfer union is inevitable, then the meeting will get nowhere. It has to be understood that the time has come for fundamental decisions to be taken. If we hesitate, we may never get a chance like this again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, besides short and medium-term crisis management, I find it important that sufficient attention be devoted to the Europe 2020 strategy and to the EU energy policy as well, as a possible gas crisis would just pile up the negative effects of the financial crisis even further. I am very pleased that in spite of the financial difficulties, investments are made as part of the continued efforts aimed at creating the EU energy market. An excellent example of this is that on the eve of the Energy Council meeting of last week the countries of the Eastern European region signed the declaration of intent on the creation of the North-South Energy Corridor. The fundamental objective of the Member States participating in the collaboration is to reduce the import dependence of the region by making north-south energy transportation possible. They wish to achieve this through the appropriate linking of the gas, oil and electric energy networks. The urgency of the signatory countries is understandable, as the citizens of the region still recollect clearly the winter of 2009, when Russia shut off the gas taps precisely at the coldest time of the year. However, narrow cross-sections do not only represent a significant problem during a gas crisis, but during our everyday lives, too. The infrastructure between the Central Eastern energy markets is inadequate, which is why energy flow is frequently not free of obstruction. In my opinion this collaboration is an excellent example of the need for coordination at regional and EU level, even at the time of an economic crisis. This also highlights that we have no time to waste if by 2014 we want to create a unified energy market that really does work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The unemployment rate in the eurozone has risen to an all-time record. According to Eurostat, which is responsible for statistical data on the EU, unemployment was 10.3% in October. It is feared that it will increase even further in the near future. The worsening situation is cause for grave concern.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, the EU is preparing for a ‘decisive’ summit meeting. Over this past year, there has already been an untold number of meetings considered ‘decisive’ from the perspective of the economic crisis. It is important to try to save the euro and the EU, but this cannot be allowed to happen at the expense of everything else.</p>
<p class="contents">Our society today is rapidly becoming less equal, with people dividing more and more into winners and losers. The rich get richer. The poor get poorer. One wonders where that famous social Europe is exactly; or, rather, where it has actually gone. The time has come for EU leaders to roll up their sleeves. We need to start working together properly for a socially fairer Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council must assess this situation in light of the EU legislation and Treaties and make a decision which it will issue to Europe’s ministers of justice and internal affairs.

However, solidarity cannot and must not be one-sided: being part of a Union with shared ideals and values means committing oneself to growth and development and supporting each other even in times of trouble. I ask myself and I ask you, therefore, how fiscal and budgetary discipline, how oversight by the institutions, can be correlated with growth and development. In this context, we can and must introduce the system of Eurobonds. The European economy cannot be kick-started without the strength of the euro being used at the same time. Eurobonds act as a link between budgetary rigour and continent-wide development; they are the ultimate objective of that interdependence that today characterises European coexistence, strict fiscal discipline notwithstanding. We have a European Union with uncertain operational capacity and a huge democratic deficit rather than the strength of a structure in which the States’ responsibilities, as those of a federal entity, are clearly identified. A shift from the European Union to the United States of Europe is required. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, Europe’s leaders ought to adopt urgent measures promoting economic growth and job creation. In this context, the measures relating to increasing energy efficiency, completing the internal energy market and developing the energy infrastructure are becoming of paramount importance to energy security and to stabilising the EU’s balance of trade. The European Council should examine the results of the resistance tests which nuclear power plants in various Member States underwent, and adopt decisions aimed at increasing the safety of Europe’s nuclear reactors. Furthermore, the development of the transport and information and communications technology infrastructures is vital to completing the internal market and to the EU’s economic and social development. All these measures which are aimed at economic growth and job creation should be correlated and supported via the 2014-2020 Multiannual Financial Framework. I welcome the inclusion on the agenda of December’s European Council meeting of an item concerning the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen area, as well as the signature of Croatia’s EU Accession Treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
