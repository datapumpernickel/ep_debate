<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, I will be extremely brief, just making a few points regarding the document presented today on proximity policy. This is an extremely important document which clarifies our proposals for European and Mediterranean relations after enlargement. The enlargement process has, in fact, given the countries near to the Union great hopes, but it has also generated frustration and tension which can be summarised in a number of quite clear, quite comprehensible comments made by the countries of the East excluded from enlargement. They have reproached us for merely shifting the iron curtain eastwards, while the Mediterranean countries have reproached us for concentrating primarily on the East rather than on the Mediterranean countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Our neighbours have many hopes and I have always believed that they must not be disappointed, that we should create a proper policy for the Union’s relations with them too, both in their interest and in the interest of the Union. The communication approved by the Commission today on proximity policy meets this need, the need to create a reference framework within which we can develop ever closer relationships with our neighbours to the East and South, to create what I have described on several occasions, initially intuitively and then after increasing analysis and reflection, as the ring of friendly countries, the ring of friends which stretches from Russia to Morocco, a ring with which we can share everything except the institutions, in other words with which we can share programmes, market, rules and political dialogue but not Parliament, not the Council and not the Commission. In short, our aim is to develop a policy for these countries which are calling for a special relationship with the Union but for which the Union cannot foresee an enlargement strategy, at least in the short term.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, then, the western Balkan countries are not included in this ring: the prospect of their membership has already been agreed, although the date has not yet been set. The reference framework we have outlined in the communication complements rather than replaces the relationship the Union has with individual countries or groups of countries. Clearly, the intensity and, above all, the speed with which relations between the Union and the individual countries develop within this reference framework will depend on the abilities of each individual country. In other words, the principle of differentiation will apply in this case too. The objective is twofold. Firstly, to create, together with our partners, an area of prosperity and stability based on the principle of economic integration, strengthening of political bonds and cultural cooperation, and on this last – cultural cooperation – I insist. Secondly, to make the development of these preferential relations dependent upon the gradual adaptation of the countries to our rules and our set of values in both the economic and political domains. Thus, we want to develop with each individual country, on the basis of experience and our current contractual obligations, an agreed action plan which sets out the path we intend to pursue together.</p>
<p class="contents">These action plans will include objectives, timeframes, procedures and monitoring mechanisms applying equally to both parties. With a view to this, therefore, we will assess whether there is a need for us to create a specific contractual instrument – a proximity agreement – and an <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> financial instrument – a proximity instrument. In practical terms, we will work with our neighbours to create a single market, to promote the free movement of persons, goods and services, to strengthen cooperation in the fight against common threats, to strengthen our cooperation in conflict prevention and crisis management, to promote human rights, to step up dialogue between cultures and religions, to integrate transport, energy and telecommunications networks and to create a wider research area, in short to bring about ever greater integration based on the shared values and principles of tolerance, peace, freedom and solidarity – the very principles on which our Union is founded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I fully endorse the proposals that Mr Prodi has outlined here.</p>
<p class="contents">What would interest me is this: what will be the institutional framework for all this? You mentioned the financial instruments and the treaties with neighbouring countries. However, my question to the President or the Commissioner is this: are any specific institutional arrangements required?</p>
<p class="contents">Theoretically, after all, there is still the European Conference. There are various possibilities. In connection with the Mediterranean region, we have discussed the option of establishing closer parliamentary cooperation as well. We must not leave this in abeyance, and we must also ensure that the responsibility is clarified within the Commission, for what we are dealing with here, really, is an interim phase between normal traditional foreign policy and integration in the European Union. In my view, this interim phase must be defined very precisely, and the Commission should submit specific proposals to deal with it, setting out detailed arrangements and describing which institutions are involved. Will the European Conference be revived? Will there be specific responsibility within the Commission for this area of cooperation? Will it remain with Commissioner Patten? These are the questions that interest me. Perhaps you could explain the situation in more detail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The honourable Member will see from the communication we are publishing today the practical ways in which we try to give expression to this notion. It is not easy. We have tried it in the past. To some extent it has been like the philosopher's stone; we have never quite found a way of expressing our views about our neighbours that does not involve offering them all membership of the European Union. That is not the subject of this communication. However, the honourable Member will see from our proposals that we have put forward sensible and concrete ways in which we can encourage our neighbours, both on our land and our sea borders, to share in our market, to share in our policies, not to share in our institutions but to share in the prosperity and political stability which have been the hallmark of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The simple answer to his question is that there is no disagreement. The Commission believes that this is a responsibility for the whole Commission and that responsibilities will have to be shared between us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is a ring of friends in which Morocco and Russia will be treated on the same terms, in the same way. My question – it is an open question to the Commission – is whether it is not better or would be better to say in even clearer terms: ‘in this ring of friends there are friends who are ever so slightly closer to us’. Ukraine and Belarus might become members in the future for example, while we cannot imagine the same of Russia. We must be perfectly clear about this. The same applies to North Africa for example. Does that not create the clarity that these countries demand of us and is it not better to make a distinction between potential members and countries or neighbours who will never be eligible for membership? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I understand perfectly well what the Commission is doing and also what priority it wants to give its policy with regard to the countries around us. In this Parliament we shall be returning in detail to the announcement that the Commission is making today. I really only have one question. The objective of course is to prevent the creation of a new divide, a new Iron Curtain, in Europe. If this is what we want to prevent, then we are going to have to help countries such as Ukraine or Belarus to undergo the same development as countries such as Hungary or Poland.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission think it will be able to develop sufficient influence on and cooperation with these countries with its proposal, so that the same reform processes take place there as in the present candidate countries and in time a kind of equality will develop that opens the way to answering the question as to whether these countries can also become members of the Union?</p>
<p class="contents">For me, what it comes down to in the end is whether, by means of what you are proposing, we can achieve the same positive effect on those countries as we have achieved with the enlargement process in a number of other countries in Central and Eastern Europe. Given what is currently happening in those countries, I think that this is the only way to prevent a new divide in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We find it hard, however, to imagine enlarging Europe even further without launching a debate which is now urgent: ultimately, how wide can Europe’s borders stretch? If we look southwards, towards the African shores of the Mediterranean, we see situations which have always been such as to make it clear that those countries cannot share development criteria, ideologies or political or religious beliefs with Europe, except, perhaps, Libya and Israel. If we look eastwards, we might consider granting membership to the Republics of Ukraine and Georgia. The same may be said of Norway, to the North, while, to the West, the Atlantic is in itself already a border.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the widest borders that we can consider if we are not to drown the Union in an area of free trade, given the need to have a Union which does not go under whenever it has to address major international issues, as, I am sad to say, has been the case in recent days? The debate on which countries will be destined to become part of the Union and with which countries we should just form preferential cooperation relations will have to be addressed very carefully, given that cooperation cannot concern trade measures alone but must cover relations on sensitive issues such as respect for human rights and the control of migration flows too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want it to be clear that this objective of building a ring of friends does not imply any commitment or any exclusion as regards enlargement: none of these countries has the right to membership and none of them is excluded. However, clearly, this does not resolve the issue raised in the last question. Here, I want to reiterate a request – which I have already made to Parliament many times and which I am told has been heard – for a debate to be held in the near future precisely on the Union’s borders. However, the ring of friends is a different project, a project which is not concerned with the enlargement of the Union but which still offers a relationship of close cooperation, which offers gradual integration, which genuinely offers the Union and the countries around it a future of economic and political security. Membership is something different.</p>
<p class="contents">To turn to the second question, Mr Wiersma<span class="bold">,</span> this was done precisely in order to avoid the accusation that we have merely moved the iron curtain eastwards, as I said in my previous speech. There is no longer an iron curtain. There is no exclusion any more. There are Member countries, but countries which have a relationship of increasing active cooperation with the countries around them, with the ring of friends. It is an organic strategy that will increase the number of Members of the Union through enlargement and create an ever stronger and closer proximity policy through the ring of friends. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This will undoubtedly be a key issue for the future after enlargement and the accession of ten new countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask two questions. Firstly, I am not altogether clear whether what is being proposed is a flexible system of bilateral relations between the EU and the various countries, or a multilateral approach – a kind of a ‘European Economic Area plus’. I think this is an important point. My second question relates to the Balkans. I know that a highly differentiated approach is essential when considering the Balkan countries and that some of them will be able to join the European Union earlier than others. However, the other countries will still need a long period of internal development. It would therefore be wrong not to include them in a strategy of this kind, for during the interim period – which could last a long time – they could be included in this network as well. Perhaps the Commission could review this position once again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This being so, I have two questions: first, what other good can come out of relations with the Mediterranean countries of North Africa in practice, when general policies have not, in my opinion, been particularly successful. And secondly, on the subject of the candidate countries of the former east bloc, because the quality of relations is sometimes determined by neighbouring countries rather than general principles and because, as we recently realised, many of the candidate countries have proceeded as they see fit on strategic policy matters – we are talking about the problem of Iraq, irrespective of what position you agree or disagree with – the question is: how can we influence these countries so that they do not set their own criteria for relations with their neighbours, which we see as countries of collaboration and peace and which others perhaps see as enemies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy will recall that I have agreed to come to the committee on 25 March to have a full discussion on the Commission communication, which will enable us to follow up in more detail a number of the points being debated this afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">He raised a couple of points. Firstly, what we want to provide is a coherent global framework. However, we recognise that one cannot argue that there should be a one-size-fits-all policy. We must have a policy that is able to accommodate the different levels of economic development and of commitment to our value system. Therefore I hope that there is coherence which is sufficiently flexible to ensure that the policy works.</p>
<p class="contents">He also referred to the Balkans. We have specifically excluded from this communication the countries that are involved in the stabilisation and association process, i.e. Croatia and the countries of the west Balkans, Turkey, Romania and Bulgaria. They have already been given the perspective of membership of the European Union and we are focusing in this document - as we were asked to do by the Copenhagen European Council - on those countries that do not have the perspective of membership. As the President has said, I am sure there will be a debate in due course on the geographical limits of the European Union. The President was making speeches about this around three and a half years ago. However, this is not the time or the document for that debate. I would just add that it is our intention that the accession candidates themselves should be involved in this debate in which many of them have a larger stake than us.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of how the Mediterranean countries and the Eastern European countries can be involved in our policies, we very much hope that we can involve them in everything from the internal market, trade, migration and the movement of persons to justice and home affairs, financial assistance and issues like governance, human rights and the rule of law. We have been trying to do that through the Barcelona process by, for example, giving more encouragement to those countries that are already involved in the Agadir process, encouraging them to move on from that and to start trying to harmonise their regulations with ours, and involving themselves more in our own internal market. That will be the policy that we continue.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of countries in Eastern Europe - the western NIS one could call them - who have been unable to join the European Union, even though, like Moldova and Ukraine, they express their European vocation. I hope that what we are proposing to them in terms of trade, economics and political dialogue will increase the size of the common economic and political space around our borders. However, we do not seek to resolve the question of membership for those countries of the European Union in this document.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am pleased to have the opportunity to answer the honourable Member's question on this because it is one we have discussed in the past. She quite sensibly asks about coherence in our financial instruments for dealing with cross-border issues. I can assure her that she will find in our document the proposal for a neighbourhood instrument, which will deal with the sort of problems she has referred to. My colleagues who work on enlargement and regional matters will be working with my own directorate-general and others to try to bring this new instrument into operation in the most effective and least disruptive way possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The President of the Commission introduced the communication in broad outline, so perhaps I could ask Commissioner Patten about two points of detail since he has touched on them. Could we have an assurance that, as the President has said, we are not attempting to create a new iron curtain and that, for example, the present visa arrangements between Poland and Ukraine will not be made more difficult once Poland becomes a member of the European Union? I see the President of the Commission is nodding, so that will cut down the time for his answer.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question to Commissioner Patten is that, since the acceding Member States have tremendous experience of relations with countries such as Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, would it not be timely now to set up some sort of working party? Those acceding Member States could then begin to feed in their experience in foreign policy relations with our new neighbours, perhaps reporting to Commissioner Verheugen or indeed to Commissioner Patten himself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Will Commissioner Prodi retract his statement - if it is true - that Ukraine is no more European than New Zealand? It was clearly seen by the Ukrainians as a geographical nonsense and a signal to their government that they were much better off making their bed with the Russian bear. Fortunately Russia does not want to join the European Union, but Ukraine does. We should not exclude this possibility, particularly if at the end of next year the Commission sanctions the much weaker case - to my mind - for Turkey's membership.</p>

I feel, however, that the issue of borders constitutes an element of discord in this climate of rapprochement. We have established a series of measures relating to relations with third countries, particularly our neighbours, in order to integrate the management of the flow of migrants. These concern border controls, the control of illegal immigration and agreements on readmission. I wonder whether we are really in the process of subcontracting the management of migration to our neighbours, so creating a buffer zone between the European Union and the rest of the world, which would probably be less laudable. In my opinion, these measures serve to promote the establishment of detention zones in these neighbouring countries both within and on the borders of Europe. I am referring to zones run in a heavy-handed and arbitrary manner, where the kind of rights enshrined in the founding values we wish to share, are, more often than not, flouted. I would therefore urge you to consider the risks currently involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The current enlargement round depends on the outcome of eight referendums which have yet to be held across central and eastern Europe. Does the Commission believe that it is right for these countries to be left to take that decision on their own, or does the Commission believe that it is acceptable to intervene politically and financially in that decision? So far there has been one referendum, in which the European Commission admits to having spent EUR 700 000, a sum which in per capita terms is equivalent to spending EUR 100 million in Commissioner Prodi's native Italy or in Commissioner Patten's native United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">If the terms that we are offering these countries are so favourable, why do we need to deploy colossal resources on this scale in order to help them make up their minds? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, I should like to assure Mr Beazley that there is no question of us seeking to create another iron curtain in Europe. Indeed, part of the intention of this communication is to prevent any notion of a fortress Europe being created with the 25 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">When one talks about easing visa regimes, it is important to consider the conditions under which interior ministers are likely to regard that as a tolerable option. One of the things that they look at is not simply the border between the country making the application and Europe, but the other borders for which that country is responsible. When, for example - I hope after we have concluded a re-admission agreement with the Russian Federation - we begin discussing the question of visas, one question which will be raised again and again is the security of the thousands of kilometres of borders which Russia has with other countries. There are a number of conditions precedent to any serious discussion of visas.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Member also asked whether we were going to try to involve the applicant countries which have not yet joined, and whether we were involving those countries in the debate. We have the democratic process to go through, as the honourable Member said a moment ago, but the simple answer is 'yes, we are'. A number of applicant countries, for example Poland with its recent discussion document on the eastern dimension, have made very sensible and thoughtful proposals. From April the candidates for accession will be sitting in the meetings of the General Affairs and External Relations Councils and listening to the debates, so I hope that will inform their contributions in due course.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware of Mr Tannock's concern about the Ukraine which he has expressed on a number of occasions. As Mr Prodi said, this document itself is not a definition of the geographical boundaries of the European Union, but I hope that our friends in the Ukraine will recognise the real efforts that we have made to help create a common political and economic space which will be to their advantage.</p>
<p class="contents">I would wish that we were able to have a closer and more benign relationship with Belarus. It is not our fault that does not exist. The honourable Member knows the style, objectives and policies of the regime in Belarus which led to the unfortunate visa ban not long ago. At the moment we can still provide Belarus with support for civil society developments, and I look forward to the day - perhaps after the next elections if they are conducted freely and fairly - when we can develop our relationship with that country. We do not want any country on our borders to be isolated by its own will, or by the will of its regime. I have attempted to answer the honourable Member's point about a buffer zone. One has to take account of all the borders of other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I say to the honourable Member - whose interest in these matters I readily acknowledge - that he should recognise that many of us believe passionately that when we discuss enlargement we are not just talking about a matter of money. We are not just talking about commercial, economic or even geostrategic interests. For many of us the case for enlargement is a moral one.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Member should not worry too much if we think it is worth expressing that case as vigorously and as comprehensively as possible. Though I have intervened in their debate myself, I do not believe that the people of Malta, who have a certain reputation for courage and independent-mindedness, are likely to be swayed by the occasional advertisement in one of their newspapers, or even, I must confess, by the occasional interview with the Commissioner for External Relations. They might be much more swayed by interviews with the Commissioner for Enlargement who has a much more silver tongue than I do, but I hope, as this democratic process rolls across Europe, that the honourable Member will see one country after another voting to come home.</p>

<p class="contents">I reiterate: this offer, this proposal, this political strategy does not mean accession for these countries, it does not mean that they will become members of the Union. It certainly does not imply that but nor does it exclude it. I would also, however, like to make it quite clear that I do not accept – or rather, I accept up to a certain point – the argument that the possibility of becoming a Member of the Union furthers the democratic process and the internal development of these countries. This gives me great pleasure, it is beneficial, but it is certainly not a sufficient basis on which to judge whether or not a country should become a Member of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Membership of the Union means sharing specific political objectives too, sharing roots and identities, sharing much more than just democratic sentiments. This was the point I made with regard to New Zealand. I have never said that New Zealand is more European than Ukraine. I merely said – and I will say it again – that, if we consider democratic criteria alone, there is no reason why New Zealand should not become part of the Union. However, there are geographical and historical considerations and political goals that a country must share in order to become a Member of the Union. It is therefore clear that this possibility must be conferred where these goals are identified and consolidated and are shared by ourselves as well as the countries involved. That is why I am anxious for the debate on the Union’s borders to be opened.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to reassure Mrs Flautre that the objective is precisely the opposite of creating detention centres for immigrants from these countries, which has rightly been identified as a dangerous course of action. There are different ethical considerations where immigration is concerned: cooperation with these countries would make it possible to deal with the issue of immigration more compassionately, more thoroughly, less traumatically and with greater involvement of the countries concerned. Clearly, this can only be achieved with the ring of friends, while we know that immigrants are now coming to Europe even from very distant countries. Having a group of countries with which we can cooperate on these sensitive issues too is extremely important, and it is, of course, our responsibility to ensure that this is achieved with due regard for the rights of the migrants. It is much easier to achieve this objective where there is cooperation than where such cooperation is lacking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
