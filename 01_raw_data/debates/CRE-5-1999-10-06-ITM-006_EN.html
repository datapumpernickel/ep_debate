<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lamy,</span></span>  <span class="italic"> Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Members of Parliament, those of you who requested the debate today on the subject of the Seattle Conference did not want, if I have understood correctly, an exchange of technical proposals but rather a political presentation. I think you are right. Public opinion in our countries clearly feels that the liberalisation of trade – in which we hope to enter a new phase – is part of a greater movement, which invites questions and interrogations and in relation to which we must therefore adopt a stance. So, let us ask the question quite bluntly, is internationalisation a good thing or a bad thing?</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission’s view, it is positive, for at least three reasons. In the first place, the internationalisation of markets makes the economies of scale possible, which are essential to the industrial revolutions in progress within information technology, biotechnology and transport. These are the advances which should make it possible to reconcile demographic growth and economic growth with a limited pool of natural resources, for it is technological progress which pushes back the frontier of the long-term use of these resources.</p>
<p class="contents">In the second place, it is access to our markets and the liberalisation of direct investments which have supported the industrialisation successfully initiated in South-East Asia, opening up new and growing outlets for our own exports and demonstrating that there are strategies to overcome underdevelopment. It was also the successes achieved, thanks to liberalisation of trade, by industrialised countries and emergent economies in Asia which shook the confidence of the communist regimes and led to their radical transformation both in Europe and in Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, internationalisation comes back to the perceptions of the rising generations, those of the next century, who, through the media and through their own wandering, will experience the world as the global village where mutual dependence entails solidarity and where the taste for differences and for encounters can be expressed.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, I do not intend to confine myself to a lyrical and idyllic vision of internationalisation here. Like a number of you, I can perceive the costs and the risks of free trade without regulations and without strong multilateral institutions to control it. I can see inequalities gaining ground to the extent of creating social exclusion in our countries. I can see the growing divide between continents. I can see the instability of the financial markets. I can see the threats to the local and the planetary environment. But if our role here is to reflect the concerns, the questions and the expectations of our fellow citizens in Europe, let us keep in mind the world-wide dimension of what is at stake, those of developing countries divided today between the hope of integration into the world economy and the fear of marginalisation. Our responsibility is also to separate millenarian fears and resistance to change from the opportunities to be grasped in internationalisation for growth, human development and the protection of the environment. Through the new cycle of negotiation, what we are preparing is the multilateral organisation of the world markets of the 21st century, with the firm intention of achieving better balance.</p>
<p class="contents">You know the reasons which induced the Commission to propose a long agenda and a short schedule for Seattle to the Council and to your House. Although I am jumping onto the bandwagon, liberalisation by means of rounds of negotiations rather than through the routine WTO channels seems to me to be advisable for three reasons. Firstly, à la carte liberalisation just does not work. Real progress requires a comprehensive approach and a single ultimate commitment. That does not mean that we cannot quickly garner the first agreements as they come to ripeness. Secondly, new subjects must be integrated into the WTO missions, subjects contributed by society, such as the environment, culture, health, food, and also competition and investment, henceforth an integral part of international trade. Thirdly, the world economy needs direction, after the financial crises which emerging and transitional economies have experienced over the last two years. A round of negotiations thus seems the safest defence against the temptation of protectionism.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us quickly go into these points in further detail. In our position – as the Council President has just rightly mentioned – there is first and foremost the concern of the Union not to get caught up in the sectorial negotiation, enshrined in the conclusions of the Uruguay Round, concerned only with agriculture and services. Our strategy is to make negotiation more balanced by opening it up to all sectors, so as to cover our offensive and defensive interests and to persuade our partners – particularly, developing countries – to do the same. As regards agriculture, the orientations provided by the European Council in Berlin on Agenda 2000 give us a solid basis to achieve, in the field of liberalisation, progress which is compatible with the European agricultural model.</p>
<p class="contents">There is then the concern to define the rules and consolidate the institution of the WTO, so as to strengthen its multilateral nature, to improve the impact of internationalisation on sustainable development and prevent the risks to the environment and to health inherent in unrestricted competition, between different national standards and different levels of production. These regulations concern investment and competition primarily, two areas where some of our partners show a certain reluctance, for very different reasons, and which, given the precedent of the MAI – I prefer to spell it out A.M.I. (rather than call it friend “AMI”) in French – give rise to reservations on the part of some developing countries and reluctance, even outright hostility, in some of our non-governmental organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to expand briefly on these two subjects. On the matter of investment, let us be clear: we are not looking to impose our own investment codes, the ones which predominate in our countries and which suit us, on developing countries. We hope to convince them by means of negotiation that the most effective way for them to attract direct external investment, the special access route to technology and international markets, is first to create a safe and predictable framework for foreign investors, whether they come from industrialised countries or from other emergent nations.</p>
<p class="contents">With internationalisation, the concentration of economic power and the extra-territorial impact of decisions taken on competition policy by states, competition presents all economies with challenges. But for developing countries the stakes are even more formidable. In this area, these countries face a twofold problem: their internal markets are too often cornered by monopolies or by oligopolies whose first effect is to inflict prices which are far too high on the local consumers, the mass of the very poorest in the main, and whose second effect is to prevent the arrival of newcomers and to force them to confine themselves to the informal economy. Restrictive practices in access to markets, credit and energy are among the main causes – generally not acknowledged by us – of underdevelopment, of the perpetuation of social inequality and corruption in these countries. The inclusion of competition on the WTO agenda is not intended to transform the WTO into a world authority on competition but simply to establish a body of principles and procedures intended to promote the implementation of internal competition policies and to make them mutually compatible.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us look at three more subjects, protection of the environment, consumer health and the audio-visual sector which, beyond the tensions between technical progress and cultural traditions, refer back to the features of civilisation which characterise Europe – the demand for quality, food quality, for example, cultural identity in an open world, the preference for the non-commercial in a number of areas.</p>
<p class="contents">It is evident that we suffer, in this respect, from a lack of regulations and procedures, and indeed primarily, I must say, in our own countries. The European Union has undertaken to define policies for the protection of the environment, health and food safety. Indeed yesterday, right here, Romano Prodi committed the Commission to a fundamental revision of food legislation by 2002. Everyone knows the complexity of these questions, involving scientific knowledge, with its share of uncertainties, national legislation and the WTO procedures. We are all aware of the problem presented by the interface between national standards, WTO regulations and those of the other multilateral agreements on the subject of the environment or health protection. With the new round, we must, on the one hand, prevent any abuse of these gaps and differences with a protectionist purpose and, on the other hand, stop leaving the arbitration between competitive national standards to market forces. The precautionary principle must serve as our safety valve to adjust for scientific uncertainty. Furthermore, progress in the labelling and traceability of products, indissolubly linked, would serve to better inform the judgement of the consumer. European opinion also considers it necessary to reinforce the capacity for artistic creation within the audio-visual media, a key sector in our culture, and the Union must respond to this expectation.</p>
<p class="contents">I come finally to the issues which most polarise opinion today and our Member States’ Governments, to wit, the link between commercial liberalisation and the progress in the fundamental rights of workers. For the European Union, it is evident that these objectives are not only compatible but also, in our experience, deeply coherent. In Europe, the return to free trade since the post-war period has been accompanied by social progress in which the relations between productivity and collective negotiation have been the two main driving forces. In raising this question, then, our intention is by no means to open up the possibility of setting wage standards or to bear down on the comparative advantages of developing countries, as Mr Sasi said so well just now. We have, in addition, become particularly sensitive to the risk of protectionist abuse that the unilateral imposition of social standards would entail, potentially. Nor do we wish to make the WTO the forum for the drawing up of these standards, for which the International Labour Organisation is responsible. Our only concern is to achieve progress in the observance, by our partners, of fundamental social standards, as defined at the Copenhagen Summit for Social Development in parallel with progress in the liberalisation of trade. In Seattle, we must therefore attempt to convince developing countries of the political legitimacy of this objective and the interest which social progress offers in their own development.</p>
<p class="contents">If I have referred several times already to developing countries, it is for two reasons. Firstly, because the chief target of this new round of negotiations is indeed sustainable development and this is primarily of concern to developing countries. Next, because, in order to achieve our own objectives within this round, we need the consensus of all our partners and, of course, of developing countries. But it is self-evident that this round must be included in the wider context of global government. Henceforth a stronger and stricter connection must be ensured between the new pillar of the international system, the WTO, and the pillar already formed by the Bretton Woods institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Members of Parliament, this debate on the new round which you requested leads to a question of great importance, in my view. Does the Union, by means of its own action, offer the governments and citizens of Europe any additional means to adjust successfully and gain control of internationalisation? Do we have the will, by exploiting our position and our weight in the world economy, the institutional advances which we have achieved, to regain the sovereignty, which world markets rob us of occasionally, and to contribute to effective global government? If the response from the Council and from Parliament is positive, our negotiating position will be stronger. This will mean, in fact, that we are capable of gaining support for our views and transforming the fears we perceive here and there into a meaningful project. My wish is that one day, your legislature will be called upon to give an opinion on the results of this new round, entailing a great deal of work and not a little dialogue for us all. Once again I undertake, on behalf of the Commission, to pursue this dialogue with you, on an ongoing basis, in the months and years to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the last 50 years, trade throughout the world has increased by a factor of 17, and has expanded by more than twice the level of macroeconomic production. Increased prosperity and the creation of jobs in Europe are an important consequence of this. Freer and fairer world trade within the framework of a strengthened multilateral world trade system formed a successful foundation for this. Progress to an exceptional extent and at an exceptional rate in the globalisation of real activity now makes further development of this multilateral body of regulations, which was based on GATT and is now the World Trade Organisation, the WTO, imperative.</p>
<p class="contents">The focus of the Millennium Round is this objective. A comprehensive European Union Strategy, which embraces all the areas concerned in a dynamic way is being proposed by the Commission and, I feel I can already say this as a rapporteur, is widely supported within the European Parliament. We are defending the European Agricultural Model, food production, the maintenance of farms as family businesses, preservation of the countryside and environmental protection in equal measure.</p>
<p class="contents">This Millennium Round should not be characterised by a defensive attitude towards the American position on imports of agricultural and genetically modified products into the European Union. Instead, the European Union should be finding confederates for its dynamic global strategy. The usefulness of globalisation should be measured against its usefulness to the regions and nations of the world equally, so that a better balance is achieved between the interests of the European Union, of the other European States, of the USA, of other industrial countries, and newly industrialised and developing countries. The framework now available to us, established with the World Trade Organisation in 1995, must be developed further in this direction and its instruments must be perfected. The essential bases for negotiations and solutions mentioned in the Commission document of July 1999 have so far met with a predominantly positive response in our discussions within the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, I would like to touch briefly on our guidelines for content. In November, we have the opportunity to discuss this again in detail. Our draft resolution will predominantly include the dynamic elements which the President of the Council and also Commissioner Lamy have already mentioned and which will include our ideas on the improved incorporation of financial services, on investment and competition policy within the framework of the WTO, on the further reduction of duties on industrial products and on the improved integration, indeed the “mainstreaming”, of environmental and consumer protection in the body of regulations of the World Trade Organisation and vice versa. The protection of copyright must be improved in many developing countries. Labour standards should be taken into account more in the world trade system, and our markets must be opened more to developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">There are still, however, some outstanding questions regarding the cooperation between the Council and the Commission, on the one hand, and with the European Parliament, on the other hand, within the scope of the Millennium Round. Let me stress one thing at the outset. The European Parliament gratefully accepts this dialogue with the Commission and hopes that this dialogue will also include the Council. It will represent its position within the framework of its resolution, which will certainly be adopted in November, in an energetically coherent but also responsible manner. You can assume, Mr Sasi, as President-in-Office of the Council, and Mr Lamy, as Commissioner, that in the position determined in our November resolution we will present ourselves as energetic and coherent both to you and to our partners in the Millennium Round. We shall strive thereby to be true to our responsibility as the elected representatives of the peoples of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we are assuming, a previously justified assumption, that the Commission and the Council are representing the interests of the European Union with equal coherence. The strength of the European Union as the largest trading power in the world resides in its joint position, which is represented by all elements. We are therefore somewhat concerned to hear rumours that in the Council, even before the start of negotiations, some delegations are now ...</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mann, Erika (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Lamy, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to talk about some fundamental aspects of the Millennium Round which my party considers to be important. My colleagues will deal with this in greater detail from their own respective points of view.</p>
<p class="contents">The new round of World Trade negotiations which will open in Seattle on 30 November, offers the opportunity to partially extend the blueprint for world trade, in some fundamental aspects. The round will automatically take on a symbolic character and should contain a clear message from the European Union. Our aim must be to achieve growth, employment and prosperity for everyone, and at the same time to reduce the poverty which exists throughout the world. The concept of opening up the market further only makes sense if everyone is able to profit from it.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need is a new sense of direction, which leads to a reconciliation of trade and social components, without thereby setting up new barriers of discrimination by means of a concealed form of protectionism. We therefore have to ensure that social and employment standards, standards for health and food as well as env0ironmental considerations form an essential part of the negotiating package.</p>
<p class="contents">The new WTO Round may lead to a further push towards globalisation which will make many people anxious. We must make it clear that everyone has something to gain from an open system of world trade. As far as this is concerned, it is particularly important to establish improved integration of the developing countries into the world economy and into the multilateral world trade system. The Group of the Party of European Socialists particularly supports the Commission’s attempt to combine the concepts of globalisation and sustainable development. This is the only way to ensure that the basis for world trade is formed in a balanced and socially just way.</p>
<p class="contents">We also agree with the Commission and the Council, in that this round of negotiations must be comprehensive, that is, one that includes all subjects. This is the only way to guarantee a sensible consideration of the specific advantages and disadvantages. This is also the only way that the interests of the European Union and of its citizens can both be assured.</p>
<p class="contents">This time, the European Union must show that it is in a position to play some role in these marathon negotiations, if not a leading one. It would be disastrous for the European side to respond passively to the current weakness of the American political leadership. This is an appeal particularly to the Council to come up with a united European position and to the Commission to express complete confidence that a comprehensive mandate for negotiation will be granted in time, which will allow it to be submitted officially to Parliament for approval at the same time. Only if the European Union is strong at the negotiating table, will it be able to ensure that, within the framework of the World Trade Organisation, there will be a better balance in the globalisation process, between the European and the American models for liberalisation. </p>
<p class="contents">Comprehensive information and transparency are necessary to win the public’s confidence in and agreement with the new negotiating rounds. We particularly welcome the consultation with unions and non-governmental organisations. Confidence is also essential because the continuing development of the European Model amongst other things depends on what scope for arrangements national and regional administrations will have in the future. Just consider that the World Trade Organisation is a leading player, if the leading player, in shaping global economic processes. Only by combining transparency, the involvement of the public and official, extensive means… </p>

In order that the right compromises can be made between the different and complex issues facing the international trade system today it does indeed seem essential that the talks should cover a comprehensive agenda from traditional tariff reductions to crucial issues such as the environment and labour standards, and new topics such as competition and investment.</p>
<p class="contents">You can count on large parts of this Parliament to give you robust support when arguing against those who may wish to confine the round to no more than a narrow series of sector-specific commercial trade-offs.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the openness with which Mr Lamy has commenced his working relationship with this new Parliament, and I also welcome his support for changes to the Treaty in the forthcoming intergovernmental conference to strengthen the role of the European Parliament in the common commercial policy. It would be a benefit to the Union as a whole if the Commission and Parliament could increasingly stand together in international trade negotiations. However, if the European Parliament is to play a new and more responsible role it must be given greater access to the information governing trade issues than is presently the case. New responsibilities should be accompanied by new rights. For that reason I would like to ask the Council two specific questions.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the Commission has already stated that it has no objections to the inclusion in the conclusions which will be adopted at Seattle of wording on the role of the European Parliament in the conduct and completion of the new WTO round. Could Mr Sasi confirm the presidency will draft such new language?</p>
<p class="contents">Second, could Mr Sasi confirm that the presidency will come forward with new proposals to facilitate the fullest possible provision to the European Parliament of documents discussed in the 133 Committee in the Council, accompanied, if necessary, by special procedures to protect confidentiality? Since Mr Sasi has kindly agreed to come to the meeting of the European Parliament’s Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on 12 October, I suggest he presents his formal response to both these points at that meeting. If we could move forward on those two points, I feel both the accountability and legitimacy of the European Union’s negotiating position in the Millennium Round will have been significantly strengthened. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We unanimously recognise the need for such rules. The problem, in my view, is to know whether the World Trade Organisation is functioning on the basis of rules which are equitable and able to help the world, and not just Europe, to progress towards sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">The replies that I have heard from the Council especially, and to a lesser extent from Commissioner Lamy, make me think that it is begging the question. We have started from the hypothesis that there is clearly no contradiction between these two objectives and therefore the desire is to extend the field of competence of this organisation without having answered, through reasoned argument, what seems to me to be a fundamental question. We have five years of experience from which we can say that, in a certain number of significant cases such as hormones in animal rearing, bananas and GMOs, the record is far from brilliant. We note that the consequences are negative upon the functioning of the European Union’s policies and also, I feel able to say, those of certain developing countries. Also, we note a lack of action on the part of the European Commission when it senses the possibility of conflict with the WTO. We therefore in advance give in to certain demands which may be made by trading partners in order to avoid conflicts. So much for internal policies.</p>
<p class="contents">As for foreign policy, I think we should insist on the fact that we do not only have commercial commitments, but we are also bound by multilateral agreements on the environment and international conventions on respect for human rights and that these commitments, in my opinion, an opinion which I believe is shared by many colleagues, have a value on both an ethical and a political level which is more important than free trade.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that these values cannot be called into question by the functioning of the WTO. We have no choice but to state that there is contradiction at the very heart of the texts of the WTO, the agreements and the statutes. Two principles form the basis of the functioning of the WTO. On the one hand, the prevention of discrimination between products for which the production processes are different, that is to say in particular the environmental or social conditions under which the product is produced. On the other hand, the fact that it is necessary to reduce to a minimum the negative effects on free trade of any political measure aimed at public health, the protection of the environment or social protection. These are two examples of the basic principles of this organisation which go against the objectives which we are trying to defend.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we believe that an evaluation prior to any expansion of the competences of the WTO is essential and that, otherwise, we are doing nothing more than applying a liberalist ideology. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, all the indications available to us show a desire to turn the future negotiations of the WTO into a further stage in the imposition of rules of liberalisation on a global scale. The European Commission has in fact announced, in its communication in July, that it wishes to liberalise new services, such as health, education, but also investments and public contracts. This wave of liberalisation is clearly justified in the name of the general interest and employment, as you stated, Mr Lamy, in your hearing, indicating that the progressive opening up of markets, both for goods and for services, is in the interest of the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is not the results of the liberalisation initiated at Marrakech which are going to calm the fears which you spoke of just now. Did the Union make a serious appraisal in Marrakech? What I observe is that the poor countries are trapped in wretched circumstances and that here we are seeing an increase in unemployment and instability that goes hand in hand with huge profits. We are seeing great mergers and take-overs on a European and global scale. Yesterday and today, the employees of Michelin have been here, in this Parliament building, to dramatically illustrate this idea which governs relationships on a European and world scale. Financial viability comes first. But what about the human beings? What about thought? What about nature? What about solidarity?</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that the choice is between liberalisation and protectionism. I am reassured by the fact that the MAI has been rejected, which shows that intervention is possible. A front could be developed to demand a change of direction. To this end, this Parliament has adopted an amendment from my group which requested a review of the mechanisms of the WTO and the rules procedure, in order to take more account of social, health, environmental and cultural questions. Today, 1,800 organisations are addressing us and calling for changes to the system. Developing countries are demanding a review of the previous agreement. I am also pleased to see that an Intergroup on WTO issues is about to meet. With my group I have taken the initiative to organise an open meeting on these matters during next November’s part-session. Many people expect the European Union to stand up in these negotiations for the values of cooperation, solidarity and the pre-eminence of human beings, as against financial values and the dictates of the market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission claims peremptorily that for 50 years, this GATT and WTO system has contributed to stability and the pursuit of economic growth, with all the advantages which result from them. A malicious mind may point out to the Commission that this phrase destroys our illusions since we thought – and God knows we have heard it enough times – that it was to the construction of Europe that we owe these fifty years of stability, economic growth and the peaceful settlement of disputes etc.. However, a purely curious mind may ask the Commission what it thinks of the continuous decline, decade after decade, of the average annual rate of growth in developed countries.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the OECD report, the average annual growth rate of OECD countries was +5.2% between 1961 and 1969, +3.9% between 1970 and 1979, +2.6% between 1980 and 1989 and +2.1% between 1990 and 1996. These statistics hardly support, and this is putting it mildly, the idea that the progressive dismantling of barriers to trade, after the eight rounds of negotiations from the early fifties until 1994, have favoured economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Would it be too much to ask the Commission to communicate to us the relevant economic studies on which it bases its current recommendation to proceed to a new round – as Mr Lamy has said – of dismantling? Would it be impertinent also to ask the Commission whether it has taken the care to ascertain whether the possible projections which it established on the launch of the Uruguay Round have been achieved? Could you give us written documents containing figures, sources and dates? It is, to say the least, strange that the Brussels Commission, at the point when it is inviting the Member States to give the green light to the immediate launch of the new round of multilateral trade negotiations, does not feel the need to make an appraisal of the WTO which is the least bit objective, particularly of its provisions for the settlement of disputes.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission really more modest than our friends across the Atlantic who regularly weigh up the pros and cons of a procedure? Is this a procedure you hoped and prayed for? It is noticeable, furthermore, that in reality it is above all the Americans who achieve a certain degree of success within the system which has been put in place. I will not go on, given the short time allotted to me.</p>
<p class="contents">I would however like to say this: unless we are blind and have no idea what is being said and what is happening on the other side of the Atlantic, we cannot help but be struck dumb by the similarity between the terms used by the Commission and the words of President Clinton.</p>
<p class="contents">The opening of the new round of multilateral trade negotiations is first and foremost a decision of the President of the United States of America, who himself has set the tempo – I translate: accelerated negotiation, a tight agenda – and the objectives ….</p>

<p class="contents">These negotiations should be aimed at the promotion and prosperity of our peoples and not simply at the defence of the great financial powers. We must leave behind this ultra-free trade logic which standardises the market. It does not guarantee the fair defence and promotion of our interests, which are European interests because they are primarily local, regional and national. It falls to us to ensure the continuity of our employment, our production and our quality of life. Europe will thereby find its justification.

No freedom exists that is not also the freedom to trade and the freedom of movement. In my opinion though, in this context of international trade and also in the Millennium Round, there are well founded risks that Europe will hang back and will not instead take on a role as a leader of civilisation, a leader which wants to guide, within the scope of clear rules for everyone, the changes in international trade in 2000. In the first place, these risks must be averted for the good of the European citizens. I am thinking, for example, of the excessive emphasis on the social protection clauses and social dumping when we know full well that these will be mere words which nothing can come of. They will not lead to effective checks and for developing countries and recently industrialised countries, this can only represent the protectionist sword of Damocles which can be used when the old Europe, the old Europe of bureaucracies, of union bureaucracies and industrial decline is in a fix.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point concerns audio-visual production and cultural production. I think that this protectionism which is felt in Europe – in France and Italy – is completely out of place and obsolete. We need only think of how the Internet represents the chance to disseminate audio-visual and cultural products. To insist on protectionist values means imposing low quality audio-visual and cultural products on the European citizens, which are almost always state-controlled, and financed and aided by the public purse. I think that European citizens have the maturity and the right to make choices in this area too, from within the supply available on an international level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Elles (PPE).</span></span>   – I would like to contribute to this debate by making three remarks of the following nature – general, specific and political.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, a general remark. From the outset we should be in support of this round, we should have a positive outlook to ensure that we can avoid protectionism, promote free trade and extend prosperity in the world system to other parts of the world. It is a pity that Mr Pasqua has gone. He said that there was no debate in this Chamber, but I would refer him to results of the economies run by Britain and the United States where they are achieving in a world trade system high rates of growth, low rates of unemployment, low rates of interest. The French economy and one or two other continental countries could learn from that particular experience.</p>
<p class="contents">Might I say too, in terms of the general debate, that the communication of the Commission has indeed laid down four major principles for the Agenda of the round which we fully support in my Group. Not least we support the need to have a comprehensive round because if the round is as broad as possible, we will be able to make progress in the end.</p>
<p class="contents">On specifics, there is one comment I would like to make about agriculture. Quite clearly, this is going to be one of the most sensitive areas to be investigated, in terms of export subsidies, in terms of the vital need to maintain the rural areas, but also in terms of food safety. These are three of the main issues which the round will have to deal with. It may be, Mr Commissioner, that the Commission together with the US administration could come up with some kind of Green Paper sketching out where the differences are and where the common interests are between America and Europe because as you know, in your previous role, unless America and Europe agree on the major outlines in an international round such as this, we will never conclude. And therefore, maybe an informal document such as this would be useful for Seattle.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, of a political nature, there are a number of networks and non-governmental organisations now which are indeed in favour of world trade and would like to take a responsible part in these negotiations. There are others, which are much less responsible, more militant in nature and likely to be present in Seattle. It is for those reasons that, if we want to ensure that consumer and social and labour issues are part of the agenda, we must ensure that these networks do not actually take over our agenda. We therefore need, I believe, to have a large parliamentary delegation in Seattle from this Parliament at least equal in size to that of the US Congress to make sure that we can represent what the views of this House are there as well as being able to ensure that as this negotiation takes place on non-tariff as well as tariff issues. These are legislative problems and therefore legislators need to be present. I therefore endorse those colleagues who have said that we should have a strong parliamentary presence. The three institutions of the European Union must cooperate and it would be very interesting to have the both the Council’s and the Commission’s view on the need to have a strong European parliamentary presence in these negotiations.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I just have two observations which I would like to share with the Council and with the Commission – and they are two sides of the same coin. These are, to be precise, the need to include our citizens in this important exercise, and to deal with their legitimate concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">My first observation concerns the need to include the European Parliament in the forthcoming negotiations. This is not simply a matter of making a claim for this institution, and nor is it a childish desire to be in the limelight. It is a question above all, of ensuring that the problems that this round poses for our citizens can reach the European Union’s negotiator at all times, as we have seen from what previous speakers have said, as well as the solutions that these citizens expect of the negotiators. This is the only way to ensure that these demands reach the Union’s representatives. And these demands will have all the more force if Parliament presents a united front with the Commission and with the Council. This therefore, is my first observation.</p>
<p class="contents">My second observation justifies my first request and that is that our citizens’ main concerns are heading in an apparently opposing direction. On the one hand, we are perfectly aware that this round should not result in empty words, but should instead provide a net benefit for everyone, especially for the developing countries. On the other hand, our society has legitimate concerns about the challenges that the phenomenon of globalisation poses for us: respect for human rights and of fundamental social liberties, the protection of the environment and the preservation of nature, as well as the protection of our consumers’ health.</p>
<p class="contents">My question to the Council and to the Commission is this: how can we reconcile these two apparently contradictory issues?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For that reason, with the meeting at Seattle drawing near, the EU must not be too modest in its demands. Europe wants to practise a social and sustainable agricultural policy and, above all, produce food which is pure and of good quality. That is why the environment, people’s health and that of animals, and the question of fairness must be a proper basis for the talks.</p>
<p class="contents">The agenda for the negotiations must be broad in scope from the outset. The European agricultural model has to be forcefully promoted in the talks. The quality and purity of food cannot be put into jeopardy as the result of a liberalised market. In future, food production must be able to comply with the principle of caution. In addition, I think it would be best for all if food could, in the future, be produced near to where it is to be consumed. Regional food chains would help us to monitor the quality of food in the best way.</p>

In the last five years, since the WTO was set up, the differences have become even more marked, and those countries which cannot count themselves amongst the leading industrial nations have become even more dependent. That is why we do not need new rounds on liberalisation, instead we need a fundamental analysis and evaluation of the effects of the Uruguay Round on countries, people and the environment. The WTO Round of Ministers is the right place for this. A fundamental reform of the institution itself is also called for. Transparency, democratic control and the equal participation of all countries, amongst other things, must be guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">Now on the subject of agriculture: if we stay on our current course, as the Commission and the USA would like, farmers with small- and medium-sized holdings will be the ones to suffer, both here and also in developing countries. They cannot be made to compete with one another. That is why better conditions for entering the market must be obtained for developing countries and at the same time, all export subsidies for farm products from the EU should be withdrawn. The recognition of safeguarding food as a ‘non trade concern’ according to Article 20 of the Agreement on Agriculture must also be accepted. A whole raft of Southern countries is quite rightly demanding a renegotiation of the TRIPs Agreement because they are losing the right to use their own resources. We are also completely against the patenting of living things. We must also refuse to accept any agreement similar to the MAI agreement on investments alone at a WTO level. Other international institutions such as the UN and the ILU must unite on this issue. By combining their forces they would be able to say that the welfare of all people will come to the fore in Seattle, and not the interests of big companies, of the rich and powerful such as well as the interests of the European Union and various elites and oligarchies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should not accept a mandate for negotiation which goes against human rights, social rights and the environment. What developing countries need, as they are not equally strong economic partners, is a special position laid down by agreement, and this should be the rule, not the exception. It is not only to them that we owe this, but also to all of us here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Take, for example, Mr Lamy’s predecessor, Sir Leon Brittan, whose commitments in this Parliament to oppose the American steamroller were often disregarded – just think of the case of Helms­Burton and the WTO.

It is clear that the World Trade Organisation has removed barriers from commercial activities, meaning ideological barriers have been broken down which has helped peoples to communicate with each other. But liberalisation cannot be an uncontrolled process, but must be steered by rules which will safeguard the specific values of each people and the characteristics of each country. We must therefore also defend European agriculture and the traditions of those typical products which also encompass the textile sector, shoe sector and industry. We must remember that the demise of certain products also means a change in traditions or even landscapes – just think of olive oil, hops and malt. Another requirement is to guarantee food safety. We cannot, in the name of freedom of trade, allow non-approved products to circulate. Hormones in veal are not a very good recipe. So removing barriers must not include removing the safety and quality of products. The last imperative is to prevent small businesses being eliminated. Let us ensure that the Millennium Round is not a round in which Europe gets knocked out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, the Commission’s proposals in important areas such as agriculture and TRIPS reflect an old-fashioned trading policy designed to promote one’s own export opportunities at the same time as retaining protectionist arrangements within the EU. It is not therefore difficult to understand why developing countries form the impression that the EU’s policies in other areas are just as heavily characterised by our own interests. If the negotiations are to cover employees’ rights, the environment, consumer protection, investments and competition, the EU must send out a clear signal that common interests are being given priority over and against our own narrow interests. For developing countries, this must mean free access for all goods, compensation for rising prices for basic foods, exemptions from the TRIPS agreements and a situation in which the EU removes the subsidies which result in unfair competition, especially in connection with agricultural products. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all with regard to principle, why have a new round? There has already been Tokyo, Kennedy, Nixon, Uruguay! Has humanity gained anything from them? If the rounds had not taken place, would we have been worse off? The MAI has not been signed, the transatlantic contract has not been signed! Yet, there has been no catastrophe. On the other hand, the GATT has been signed and there are still 18 million unemployed people in Europe. The NAFTA has been signed and Mexico has been bled dry.</p>
<p class="contents">Scientifically, free trade is like the independence of central banks. There is no conclusive scientific evidence as to whether it is good or bad. We are not in a domain of science but in a domain of belief. It is basically as if in Seattle on 30 November the Church of Globology was going to meet.</p>
<p class="contents">That means that the method is important. It is important that the Council monitors the mandate of the Commission, so that Blair House may not happen again, and that both the States and public opinion monitor it. This is because in France the sickle has revolted against MacDonalds and the Millennium has come out of hiding.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the content, there will clearly be a lot of questions. The question of services, audiovisual, social and environmental questions, developing countries and, of course the agricultural question, with the risk that Europe will behave like Bambi and Walt Disney. Europe will no doubt obtain labellings and traceability, it will be able to play with blue boxes and green boxes, but it will give in on the important points, that is, the internal support for the farmers and the Community preference. Mr Lamy, you have not even mentioned the term “Community preference”, hence our reservations regarding this round.</p>
<p class="contents">To participate in these cycles, you have to be some sort of a cyclist. The only problem is that it is the people who do the pedalling and the very poorest who most suffer from the punctures. But it is true that we still have the strength to bear the evils of others! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would like to emphasise four particular points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the only way that the European Union can maintain a fighting stance in these negotiations is to lay the truth about the state of its agriculture on the table. The reality of this is one of multifunctional agriculture, which combines its economic function with preserving the environment and the countryside and which guarantees that the whole of our territory remains populated. This reality has a name: it is called the European agricultural model. Bearing this in mind, the European Union will not be able to accept any measure that might put it in jeopardy.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the European Union can only consent to enter into negotiations on the issue of agriculture if it is made clear that free trade is inseparable from fair trade. And for this reason, the WTO cannot confine itself to commercial matters, but must also address fundamental issues such as the quality and safety of food, animal welfare, the protection of the environment, and respect for consumers and their views.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the European Union must put on the table the precautionary principle, which means being able to take exceptional steps to protect our consumers. There should be no more trade reprisals merely because we have sought to protect our consumers, as we did in the case of the battle over hormones. </p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we must be aware that although European agriculture as a whole comprises many specific elements, it is also deeply heterogeneous. That is to say, the European agricultural model is a plural model. To this extent, special measures should be advocated for those areas whose survival is at greatest risk, particularly those with small farms, and the poorer regions.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We now have to benefit from this coherence in the face of our competitors, our partners in the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, we should make it clear that anything that can be done to inform, sensitise and mobilise public opinion, will strengthen the determination of our negotiators in the eyes of the Cairns Group, the United States and developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We can already see that the pressure of our civil society can have contagious effects in our competitors’ camp. The proof can be found in what is currently happening in the United States, for example, with regard to GMOs.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore necessary, as an extension of this matter, and with the aim of creating a favourable balance of power within the WTO, to debate, to communicate throughout Europe regarding the direction to be given to globalisation and the liberalisation of trade.</p>
<p class="contents">For us Europeans, the aim of this globalisation should consist of reconciling economic competitiveness with a global development which is more balanced, more durable and better distributed especially between North and South.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to agriculture, we should establish a system for trade in agricultural products which is fair, based on the market certainly, but also on more general considerations such as public health, the environment, employment and balance between territories. It is in light of these objectives that there is good reason to carry out, without delay, an intermediary appraisal of the application of the Marrakech Agreements. Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, these aims should naturally form the basis of the principle of the global application of the agreement, which should take precedence in the negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Why not commit yourselves to humanist values and dare to say that we must recognise the fundamental social standards defined by the ILO? Why not require quality standards on a global level, and therefore demand the same rights and the same responsibilities of all economies and businesses? Why not argue for diversity on an international level and demand, for everyone, a cultural exception and an agricultural exception?</p>

These concerns are shared and (…) by our group. We are not in favour of increasing the competences of an organisation lacking democratic structures, as is the case with the WTO. Nor are we in favour of interaction (…). What we want instead, is the World Trade Organisation to be officially reformed so that it complies with the Convention on Human Rights and with the conventions of the ILO.</p>
<p class="contents">We particularly want economic and commercial measures for the development of poor and marginalised countries. In any case, I want to say that the Millennium Round negotiations must not harm the basic elements of the European Agricultural Model. Neither must they harm the reforms which in addition to Agenda 2000, are necessary for protecting the development within each State of the number one objective which is local, family-based farming in the face of the interests of big industrial companies which have huge powers of distribution.</p>

It is therefore all the more depressing for me that, so far, no comprehensive evaluation of the consequences of the Uruguay Round has been made.</p>
<p class="contents">During our discussion on food safety yesterday, I wondered how we are really doing on the safety issue, as few of today’s consequences have stemmed from the deregulation which has already begun. The fact that the mandate for negotiation has barely been discussed in national parliaments I find all the more unacceptable. I think that it is shameful that we must accept that many developing countries who are contractually bound within the framework of this discussion to take part and above all who are directly concerned, for financial reasons cannot sit down at the negotiating table at all. It is also shameful that so little of the proceedings will be open to the public.</p>
<p class="contents">If there is one thing then that I would call for, in the short time I have left, I would wish that this Parliament, across all Parties, guarantees this openness to the public, and that there is transparency and intensive discussion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Why? Because when I hear the Council, Commission and Members of Parliament talk in this way it really does put me in mind of courting hedgehogs: afraid of needling each other and knowing that when it comes down to it we appear to agree on all the important issues, that is to say the social issues that Mr Hansenne talked about before and which I shall enumerate again: sustainable development, culture, the precautionary principle in food safety, agricultural affairs, development-related matters and animal welfare.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, that would only require a day’s work, which is why I believe it is appropriate to call upon you to consider this one point: all these courting hedgehogs will soon be gathering in Seattle; how does the European Commission intend to keep them communicating? I think there are two things which will achieve this. Firstly we need to see to it that Parliament sends a strong delegation which will ensure that national interests do not play a part. Secondly, Mr President, I hope that Mr Lamy will see to it that everyone continues to be aware that if the WTO is of importance to us, if it is of importance to Europe then it is also of importance to our other trading partners. What is more, they must remain aware of the fact that the WTO can only serve an important purpose if every Member State ensures, and also continues to understand, that the interests of one State alone cannot be allowed to prevail, rather the interests of Europe as a whole must always be served by these negotiations too.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, we must resist the pressure for a narrow round of debate, wherever that comes from. We need a broad round, we need comprehensive negotiations to get a package that has something in it for everybody.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, throughout these talks we will be very much in the public eye. The days of negotiations on technical matters behind closed doors are gone forever. People are watching, NGOs are watching, businesses are watching environmental concerns, health, animal welfare. So I am very pleased that the European Commission is tomorrow having a consultation with NGOs in Brussels. That is very good news.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, many have spoken about the need for a balanced approach. We must have a balanced package. It is not just about trade, it is about international and social justice, it is about environmental concerns. But neither can we, as some in this House would wish, forget job creation and wealth. That matters to the public too. It is going to be hard to get that balanced package, but the public expect it of us and that is what democratic, responsible government is about. We have to do it.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am pleased to hear the Commission and the Council mention the needs of the developing world. It is very important that we give them more than warm words as we enter the new millennium. Let us hope that in the next century we shall see something other than stories of Africa going backwards in terms of economic development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can do this because we have based our position on those adopted at the time from the agenda of the agriculture agreement of the Uruguay Round and at Agenda 2000 in Berlin, as well as on maintaining the multifunctional nature of agriculture </p>
<p class="contents">To these basic principles, I think that we should add the strategic value of agriculture in some regions of the European Union with strong exports, which furthermore were given particular recognition in the Amsterdam Treaty, such as the so-called outlying regions. These should be given special consideration in the Millennium Round negotiations so that the decisions taken in Seattle safeguard their agricultural interests and guarantee their cultural, economic and environmental survival, particularly after the Cologne Summit.

They say that we should extend our policies of liberalisation to an ever-greater number of sectors and countries, including agriculture and services essential to development and essential to improving the quality of life of our citizens, such as education and health.</p>
<p class="contents">The President of the Commission made his intention clear when, in his speech during the investiture process, he said that it was necessary to continue restructuring the single market and to promote liberalisation. He specifically emphasised the continuation of the process of liberalising the goods and services sectors. This means that we are no longer only in the process of liberalising the exchange of goods, as happened with GATT. The multinationals now want to go much further. They want to take over public sectors which are essential to our citizens’ lives and which have until now been the responsibility of the State.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a very dangerous road to go down, as the consequences of applying the WTO rules have shown, causing as they did, an increase in social inequality, unemployment, and world poverty. It is vital that the forthcoming negotiations do not go any further down this road, but take the road of solidarity and cooperation instead.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The situation in the agricultural and food-processing sectors has become more serious over the last few years, although we were theoretically covered by the Uruguay Round and the Marrakech Agreements, which were supposed to guarantee and organise access to the market, support for exports and internal support.</p>
<p class="contents">So you will appreciate, Commissioner, our concern at the apparent absence of shared views within the Union before the beginning of the negotiation, while the United States seems very determined to oppose the European system of subsidies, while skilfully absolving themselves from flexibility payments. In fact negotiations cannot get under way seriously until we persuade our partners and competitors to recognise the European Agricultural Model. It is this model which, based on the Community preference, guarantees product quality, food safety and the survival and development of our agricultural and food-processing sectors. </p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we have been happy to note your answers to the committee as well as your words at the beginning of this sitting. But we would like to know whether you can tell us how the Americans have reacted to the European position in favour of extending the peace clause beyond 2003. Could you also tell us whether the United States are demanding compensation or the disappearance of the green and blue boxes which amused Mr Martinez so much but which are absolutely essential for our farmers? Finally could you tell us whether you consider that the conclusions of the Berlin Council on the reform of the CAP are an inviolable basic element in your eyes or whether they are under threat in the new negotiations? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What do we need to do in terms of form? We must change the process for the settlement of disputes within the World Trade Organisation. We must make it more transparent, clearer and more accessible to the public. This is one of the most important conditions necessary for ensuring that areas such as the protection of the environment and of the consumer are given their rightful place, and are not ridden roughshod over in some panel. </p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the areas that are included, Mr Lamy, the most important of all is the precautionary principle. I have already said this on many occasions. We must take the precautionary principle from the trade agreement on plant health and apply it to the Agreement. So what then do we really need? We need policies on the environment and health to be important and proper components of the Agreement. The achievements of the World Trade Organisation’s committee on trade and the environment are not enough. It has not so far fulfilled its duties and must be penalised. It must be given a clear timetable so that it can give support to the various projects. </p>
<p class="contents">What are the most important areas that we really have to deal with? We must do what the Commission itself asks. We must make the whole World Trade Organisation more open, more democratic and more transparent and we must ensure that the whole contract underlying it can be subjected, as you yourself say, to a study on its environmental acceptability. We must examine production methods that are not tied to products and we must have an overview of the situation. I am convinced that this Parliament will not ratify another agreement in which the precautionary principle, consumer protection and health policies do not play an important part.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These fears must be taken into account and must appear in the agenda of the Millennium Round negotiations. However, neither on the creation of the WTO nor at the Singapore Conference were we able to persuade our partners to discuss them. We must draw lessons from this failure and, with determination, present a credible and coherent position. Above all determination: there will be no balanced negotiations if we are not able to debate these issues, and our citizens will not understand if we dare to start these negotiations by immediately giving up this essential issue.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to succeed, we should take a credible stance. In 1994, in Marrakech, and in Singapore, in 1996, we were unable to convince many developing countries of the validity of our concerns because we presented them in the form of a social clause. We failed because we presented ourselves with a negative and punitive image.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then things have changed. Last year, the Member States of the ILO – and amongst them our own countries – adopted a declaration on the principles and fundamental rights relating to work. We all undertook to respect the principles which create a genuine social dynamic in each country. We promised to support the efforts of developing countries to fulfil their commitments. We do not wish to sanction but rather to assist. Not to assist for the sake of assisting, but to assist so that the commitments may be met. To this end we must ensure that there is suitable and effective cooperation between the ILO and the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">We must finally give substance to the agreement reached in Singapore on the cooperation between the secretariats of the two organisations, in order to guarantee the positive implementation of the declaration. We must also adopt a coherent position. If we are willing to help our partners to build with us genuine world-wide social foundations, we must tell them what efforts we are willing make to this end. A more attractive incentive system involving preferences and a programme of specific and generous cooperation may contribute to this. A clear and strong sign in this direction on the part of the Commission and our governments must be prepared and announced in Seattle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will mean difficult and complex talks, during which we must always keep at the forefront of our minds the strategic interest that is fundamental for the European Community. We are the largest exporter in the world and so we are involved more than any other area on the planet with the push towards the abolition of barriers which hinder development of international trade. </p>
<p class="contents">Developing international trade means making a substantial contribution to European economic growth, which the countries of the Community really need. I think that this is an irrefutable situation which Mr Pasqua’s anti-American arguments, which are at least 30 years old, cannot bring into question. Naturally, we have to defend the values and principles which are fundamental for the countries of the Community, but we have to do it in a shrewd and flexible way. We must also keep in mind that first of all, we need to develop that strategic interest that is fundamental to the liberalisation of international trade which I spoke of a short while ago. I therefore think that this is neither the place nor the time to be erecting barriers. I think that Parliament’s involvement in the course of the talks and its cooperation with Commissioner Lamy will bring about results that are appropriate for this objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But I would like to see balance in world-wide trade. The tried and tested European Model must be maintained, with, for example, our high environmental standards and consumer protection, including our socio-economic measures. Against this background several maritime aspects must be considered in the WTO negotiations, even if the fishing industry does not have as much weight as agriculture. I shall now mention three of these aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, Europe has been allocated fish imports. Each measure that weakens our European fish-processing industry means large-scale job losses, mostly in regions which already lack infrastructure. The valuable assistance that the Commission and the European Parliament have so far guaranteed, through various market and regulatory instruments, should not be sacrificed at the altar of absolute liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, international fisheries agreements benefit the exploitation of waters outside Europe and give support both to European fishermen and to the development of third countries. I do not call this protectionism. But without public support, these agreements would not be feasible. What we must do here is to look beyond the confines of absolute liberalisation, in order to guarantee the many jobs which are dependent on a balanced and regulated world market.</p>
<p class="contents">In the future, the principle of partnership must be strengthened on a global scale. But this does not mean that free trade must be proclaimed to be the golden calf. It must be brought into line with other important aims such as environmental protection and sustainability in the fishing industry. The WTO negotiations must also deal particularly with ensuring that the products we want to market world-wide will still be available when we finally get around to discussing them.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Participation in prosperity, a healthy environment and healthy working conditions are by far the best investments for a good future. Following the 1994 Uruguay Round, we expected to see greater prosperity through higher growth for the ACP countries. Growth was to a large extent achieved, but according to studies by the OECD and the UNCTAD, standards of living at the lowest levels have not changed at all. In fact, what has happened is quite the opposite! It cannot make sense to have a policy of increasing our prosperity while making poor people poorer. This is why we should not miss the last chance to demand that the seven most important core employment standards, which were ratified in the IAO agreement, be made checkable social clauses. This does not imply a new form of protectionism, but is to do with standards of fundamental rights with which employees suffering discrimination can protect themselves. This is a human rights issue and we must strive for this minimum standard. Once we have these things, we can offer the ACP countries positive incentives to do the same. There is a whole raft of ideas on this in the Commission’s report. If we do not succeed in having the social components included, the last great step in achieving liberalisation will not work. I expect greater commitment on the part of the Council on this matter.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With European integration, the EU has grown into a major global influence on the economy, for which only a broad-based round of negotiations will make it possible to ensure steady economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Of all the important issues on the agenda for the talks, the liberalisation of trade in services is the most challenging. The European Union is the world’s largest player in the field of trade in services. Services account for the largest share of GNP in the European Union, and, what is more, that share is growing all the time; and that is good. One of the greatest barriers to free trade in services is the lack of any global set of norms relating to tendering for contracts in the public sector. International companies must have converging opportunities to make tenders for contracts, and the public sector must be opened up to international competition. Furthermore, the rules of global commerce must be defined to safeguard the rights of the market operators. Similarly, we must substantially develop a scheme to gauge the international comparability of rules of copyright.</p>
<p class="contents">The main aim of the talks is to ensure the quality of services on offer. If the European markets are opened up, any external agent offering services must meet the same high standards that exist in Europe. Any monitoring mechanisms used to check levels of quality must be clear as to their principles and as open as possible with regard to the communication of information. It is especially important that the fast growing services of the information society become subject to an agreement. The advantage of the development of the modern trade in services in Europe is that it maximises the benefits of increased commercial exploitation of information technology. Electronic shopping must clearly be made easier, and regulation and taxation in this area must be kept to a minimum. At the talks we must be able to ensure that electronic shopping remains free and dynamic, and guarantee the possibilities for developments in electronic shopping in Europe in the next Millennium also.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would appear that this long and detailed document is currently under discussion in the Council and between the Council and the Commission. It is the real mandate for negotiations which the Council is preparing to give to the Commission. We would like the European Parliament to be genuinely involved in the preparation of the negotiation mandate and, to this end, this text should be made available to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to mention one of the most important points in future negotiations: the question of services. Not all services can be put on the same level. For us, for example, human health is not a piece of merchandise. Certain services should continue to stand out amongst public services and general interest services. I am also thinking of education. Elsewhere in the world, others have made a different choice and have reached a situation where you are asked for your bank card on entering a hospital before they will treat you. This is one choice, but it is not ours and we do not want a situation where tomorrow, in Europe, the inclusion of services in the scope of the WTO leads to the rules of competition and market openness being applied to sectors such as health and education. This would mean the dismantling of our social model. This would mean changing from a market economy to a market society. The best guarantee for our public services is to place them clearly, and from the outset, outside the scope of the negotiations, as has happened in the case of the cultural exception.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish – and this is not unrelated – with the question of investment. May I remind you, the European Parliament has rejected the MAI, and we should not let the very thing that we turned away from our door yesterday, when it came from the OECD, today get in through our window coming from the WTO.</p>

This is so that the liberalisation of trade will be accompanied by renewed stability in the money market, by wide-ranging policies on human resources, by social protection networks and by widespread compliance with the fundamental regulations on work. Only in this way will it be possible to remove the mutual accusations of social dumping and protectionism. </p>
<p class="contents">With the solemn declaration of June 1998, the 178 Member States of the ILO undertook to promote the four fundamental rights of work: the right of association, respect for the minimum working age, the prohibition of forced labour and the suppression of discrimination. Out of this came an indirect definition of fair competition so that social development will not be compulsorily suppressed for competitive purposes. More recently, the express hope came out of the G8 meetings in Washington and Cologne that the ILO’s solemn declaration will be implemented. </p>
<p class="contents">Support policies must therefore always prevail over sanctions. In this regard, Europe can constitute a reliable point of reference, and this is also thanks to its model of the social market economy. The Commission, backed by Parliament, must therefore commit resources to assisting developing countries and transitional economies, construct modern social protection systems and efficient job markets. This is the ideal, political message which the united Europe will be able to take to Seattle, confirming the traditional function of dialogue and integration between developed economies and developing economies or those undergoing changes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In these deliberations we need to be absolutely clear that developing countries are not asking for an ambitious programme in this round. They are asking for compliance with the commitments which were made under the Uruguay Round. They have not, for instance, seen the benefits for their textile and clothing industries, neither have they seen benefits from the liberalisation of trade in farm products. What they want to see first are the good effects that could come from the Uruguay Round.</p>
<p class="contents">Developing countries are preparing for Seattle, and preparing to be very busy. They are saying that market access alone is not going to be a panacea enabling them to achieve competitiveness and integration into the global economy. We need to acknowledge that all these fine objectives will demand that we support the supply side in developing countries, because they simply will not have the capacity to deal with these fine objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also necessary to see the elimination of agricultural export subsidies and a new WTO clause to cover the need for food security in developing countries. Also, a social clause – which many people have mentioned – should be jointly managed by the ILO to ensure that some of the susceptibilities we all know about are dealt with.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Commissioner, when you deal with WTO rules in your deliberations, I would ask you also to remember that we have enormous duties and responsibilities under the Lomé Convention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Trade in recent decades has decreased by an average of 6% per year, service exports stand at 9% and foreign direct investments are at about 12%. This shows very clearly what our priorities must be. Our number one aim, which is full employment in Europe, requires an improvement in our competitiveness and is being decisively formed by these developments.</p>
<p class="contents">My priorities for the WTO negotiations are firstly, electronic commerce, the area with the greatest potential growth rate, and in which Europe is actually very competitive. In this area, we want to see electronic transactions and supplies made officially exempt from duty in the long term. We want to avoid ways of looking at the situation that differentiate between traditional and new services as the way in which a transfer of goods or services is effected does not change the nature of providing a service. We also want improved access to markets in non-EU countries for goods and services, and in the telecommunications services which give the necessary support to electronic commerce. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, telecommunications. Well-developed networks and fairer competition have a generally positive effect on a country’s economic performance and employment situation. The forging of international alliances opens up new markets, and as a consequence brings about a covert and strengthened sense of competition which is to the consumer’s advantage. But there is also a need for transparency in this area. Liberalisation is a prime example of a job creator. Through liberalisation, hundreds of thousands of new and supplementary jobs have been created.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point is TRIPs. The effective implementation of this agreement should safeguard the equality of status between material and intellectual property.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are no longer in a position to leave the concerns of citizens and various organisations off the Seattle agenda, which means that the European Parliament and the Socialist Group also have an important role to play here. This role must be focused on making a positive contribution during the negotiations. A contribution that has due respect both for trade interests and the interests of citizens. We must succeed in having the best of both worlds, even when it comes to the sensitive area of consumer and environmental protection. The political question is always about the division of responsibilities between the WTO, the European Union, national governments and the consumer. There are various answers to this question. In the United States, more responsibility rests with the consumer. Here in Europe, the government tends to bear the responsibility and we rely on legislation. Many conflicts over environmental and consumer protection could be avoided by the effective application of the precautionary principle. According to the Rio Declaration of 1992, it must be scientifically proven that a new product will have no damaging effects.

This means that it is particularly important that the European Union clearly states its opposition to any attempt to promote a new or even an old kind of protectionism. It must contribute towards developing a type of administrative interdependence for interdependent national economies, and it must also contribute to a global concept of economic management.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important thing we need to do is to establish international rules for competition. These rules for competition are all the more important because it is actually not very useful for the development of the European economy to have rules for competition here which do not apply throughout the world. I am thinking here of huge mergers, amalgamations, price cartels and cartels within a particular field. It is not acceptable that the 100 biggest companies in the world share things out between themselves, and all we can do about it is react but not actually play a role in it. That is why we need a catalogue of minimum standards for international rules for competition which must be laid down in national rules for competition. What we need above all are independent competition authorities in all the countries that are members of the WTO to implement these minimum standards for competition regulations. </p>

This is a subject Mrs Roth-Behrendt has already spoken of: the procedure for conflict resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">When the Uruguay Round ended in Marrakech, the World Trade Organisation brought in a compulsory system of settlement of disputes, but the procedure they used was one inherited from the old General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. This was a procedure led by groups of experts and informal bodies. The result of this is that now, the European Community is handing over to an international organisation its obligation to find a solution to its international disputes with no guarantee that it will be treated with sufficient impartiality. </p>
<p class="contents">For example, the first dispute about bananas was resolved by a panel, that is a group of experts, presided over by a former American senator, when the plaintiff was the United States of America. And secondly, closer to home, the Commission needs to set its own affairs in order because now, the Commission services responsible for putting its claims to the dispute settlement body of the World Trade Organisation are completely toothless. </p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore expect from the Commission and from the Member States that in the new draft of the World Trade Organisation text, an independent and impartial system for settling disputes will be established, which will not push us into the path of an oncoming bus as has happened in the past. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is particularly important, in considering these areas, that we look at the problems that challenge us in these sectors: for instance, the growth rate, presently 13% in the EU, which probes the capacity and the reach of negotiated rules; as well as their complexity. To take, for instance, the convergence of the telecommunication industries, audio and computer technology, which I feel pose fundamental questions regarding the way in which we produce and consume these industries. But much of this will depend on the detail as concluded in the negotiations themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to use the opportunity of the Commissioner’s presence here today to propose – in the light of the exemptions we already have in the European Union for the audiovisual industries, which give us room for manoeuvre, which give us also the ability to evolve with the industry and to make a gesture in the direction of an even playing field vis-à-vis the US – that, in constructing the infrastructure for the negotiations, we should be flexible enough to accommodate our needs here in Europe. At the same time, I also recognise that we need a negotiating arena that is both robust and realistic. So I would advocate that, in terms of our position here in Europe, we need to ensure that our industries move forward in a way auspicious to achieving the potential that they undoubtedly possess. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank Parliament’s large groups for the positive attitude they have of both Council and Commission policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, Commissioner Lamy asked the essential question in his excellent speech: is the liberalisation of world trade of any benefit to us? In the opinion of the Council, it most definitely is. It offers us economies of scale, which means obviously cheaper products for consumers. In addition, it offers the opportunity for economic transparency, and it can be clearly shown that in open economies, democracy and human rights fare better. It also furnishes trade with clearer rules and transparency to prevent bureaucracy, malpractice and bribery. We could say on the whole that we are not at the moment working for prosperity, democracy, human rights or integrity.</p>
<p class="contents">Here in Parliament, there is also cause to remind everyone that the basic idea behind the Union was to create a common market. We have a single market, whose objective is peace and the creation of prosperity. For that reason, it is quite natural that the Union should want a more open market for the world economy also. Central to the round of talks will obviously be the question of democracy, human rights and the environment. It is important that we try to find positive incentives for less developed countries to develop their own systems. I have to say that the Union’s own generalised Preference system is an excellent tool. But these incentives can be created outside the information system, for example, for the World Bank system and elsewhere, where they can function effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">When transparency and democracy is spoken of in the WTO, I would like to remind you that decisions are taken unanimously in the WTO. Consequently, it is certain and clear that democracy is also established there. I would also like to stress that cultural diversity will be a very important issue for Europe in the talks. In questions of agriculture, the fundamental principle will obviously be the Agenda 2000 solution that we achieved, and that solution has to be defended. We have been asked here to predict its outcome, but it would be quite wrong to assess the outcome in any way at this stage, or at least to say anything about Agenda 2000 that might be off the track. But it is important for us to remember that a broad-based round is also, for this reason, of benefit to the Union. I would also like to remind everyone that the Union enjoys important benefits in the area of agricultural exports. I believe that if we develop our own production, the agricultural produce of the EU Member States will become competitive, not necessarily with regard to just price: we also have to bear in mind quality, and especially the fact that we are taking responsibility in our own area for food safety, whose importance to consumers will essentially increase in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The role of Parliament has also been discussed here. The Council also wishes in future to have an exchange of opinion with Parliament – here in the part-session, and, likewise, on the Committee. We will try our best to take account of the opinions that have been expressed in Parliament while formulating our own positions. As for the documents discussed in the 133 Committee in the Council, we will furnish Parliament with all the information it requires as well as the documents insofar as the Union’s own acts allow. I wish to refer to the fact that during the previous parliamentary term a written question was presented on these procedures and a written reply was issued on the subject also.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the number of Members of Parliament to be present at the talks in Seattle, it has to be said that what is most important is that we have a body of people that can work in close cooperation with one another and between whose Members information can freely circulate. My experiences of other rounds and the number of MEPs present were positive, so this could serve as a basis for estimates of the number of Members required.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lamy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>I do not intend to touch on all the subjects which we have debated, but I would simply like to thank the speakers – or at least most of them – for their support and to reply to some specific points or some of the questions posed by the speakers.</p>
<p class="contents">First question: can we, or should we analyse the impact of something like a round on the economy or the environment? I believe that in the case of the economy, it is not necessary, even if it is not an exact science, because the majority of economists consider, for reasons which have just been indicated, that the liberalisation of trade is the right direction to take.</p>
<p class="contents">It is less obvious in the case of the environment, so much so that the Commission has taken the initiative to carry out a study of the environmental impact of the round which we are about to launch. One could therefore ask why we have not done the same in relation to the Uruguay Round. We did not do it because at the time we had not thought about it, we did not have the means and to do it now on the basis of the Uruguay Round does not make any logical sense. On the other hand, we have begun to do so for the next round. It is not an easy task and furthermore I think that the Union is a pioneer in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clearly possible to improve the mechanism for the settlement of disputes! Let us remember however, between ourselves, that, on the whole, the results of the application of the mechanisms put in place after Marrakech are absolutely correct from the Union’s point of view, with regard to the relationship between the number of cases we brought against other parties and the number of cases brought against us, between the cases won and the cases lost. If we look at the statistics and try to consider the exchanges in question, the results are satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that I have not mentioned the term “Community preference”. I am not superstitious and, from the moment that it appeared in the treaties and I was made responsible for developing it, I have not felt the need to repeat it constantly.</p>
<p class="contents">To my knowledge, the United States have not yet given their opinion on the problem of the peace clause which takes us to 2003; we will clearly have to address the question of knowing what we will do after that.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the interpretation of the European Council of Berlin, which has, on this point, expressed its agreement on what has been called Agenda 2000, I have said, and I repeat, that it seems to me to be a good basis for discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the possibility of developing countries gaining access to the techniques of commercial liberalisation, to the WTO and its panels etc, it is true, as has been said, that this poses a problem, that this objective is not yet within the range of many of them and that the use of these complex mechanisms is reserved for those who have the means, hence our proposal of technical assistance (which is furthermore mentioned in the Commission’s document), so that these countries may themselves possess and use the necessary legal technology.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the problems of health and education, we do not think, we do not foresee and we do not wish to call into question the public policy objectives in these areas within the proposals on the liberalisation of services in the next round.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to the representation of the European Parliament, I have already said, and I repeat, that the Commission is absolutely clear on this issue. We believe that to have the Members of the European Parliament, who are so well informed, by our side, in a negotiation of this type, is a trump card for us and hence for the Union. I have not therefore changed my opinion on this. We are aware that generally we work under your supervision and, sometimes, with your support.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of the number, I consider this to be a matter which is in your hands and I would not presume to interfere. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
