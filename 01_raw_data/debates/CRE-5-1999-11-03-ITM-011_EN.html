<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sterckx (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the UN Climate Convention in Kyoto, the European Union accepted a target to reduce CO2 emissions by 8% by the year 2012, relative to emission levels in 1990. If we now know that cars are accountable for 12% of these CO2 emissions, if we know that people who buy cars are completely unaware of the fact that the car is a polluting tool and to what extent it does pollute, although, for example, they do know what the maximum permitted level of alcohol in the blood is or I know that if I buy a car which uses three litres per 100 km then this is quite an economical car, then it is a matter of urgency to make the consumer aware of car pollution. Only then can we ensure that the European Union will yield results when reducing CO2 emissions. We have to impress on people that, at the moment, we emit an average of 186 grammes of CO2 per kilometre by car and this must be cut down to 120 grammes per kilometre. So one way or another, we have to drum these grammes per kilometre into people.</p>
<p class="contents">How will we do this? The directive proposes we provide information in four different ways. Firstly, it is suggested to introduce labels for new cars which specify information such as fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. Secondly, we can compile a guide containing this information on all new models, which also includes a top ten of the most economical and environmentally-friendly cars. A third suggestion is to display posters in showrooms with a list of data for all models on display and lastly, the fuel consumption and CO2 emission data should be included in advertisements for new cars.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Commission’s proposal, the European Parliament submitted a number of amendments during the first reading. We have noted that the Council has incorporated a large number of these in its common position. Parliament had requested not to mention fuel costs. The Council went along with this. Parliament had also requested to make a fuel consumption guide available on the Internet and at European level. Again, the Council agreed. Mentioning CO2 emissions explicitly, as was suggested by Parliament, has also been complied with. </p>
<p class="contents">There are two other points which the Council seems to have accepted to some extent, and one is that there should also be a “top ten” per category of cars. Although the Commission has stated that this is a complex issue, the Council still requests that the Committee concerned with the revision of this directive should look into this and get on with this categorisation exercise. </p>
<p class="contents">A second point relating to the revision is that Parliament had requested that the directive should also apply to second-hand cars, managers’ cars and cars registered for the day. Upon revision, it is possible to include second-hand cars, according to the Council. Again, Parliament’s request has been met to some extent. </p>
<p class="contents">Since the Council’s stance is so close to that of Parliament, I would recommend swift action, not tabling any amendments and approving the common position now so that, by the end of next year, the directive can enter into effect. I think this is rather more important than trying to achieve perfection in every last detail which would not make any significant difference. The Committee on the Environment has supported this proposal unanimously. This does not mean that we think this regulation is now perfect. </p>
<p class="contents">A number of observations made by Parliament are important, however. From the very outset, it was clear, for example, that complete harmonisation was impossible. As such, the Member States can elaborate on the provisions set out here. We would ask the Committee to ensure that the internal market is not disrupted. That on the basis of best practices in one or more of the Member States, the provisions in this directive are applied in a manner which is as uniform as possible and that red-tape is avoided for manufacturers or sales outlets. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to put forward another three points. Parliament had also requested if it could be borne in mind that air-conditioning or other additional equipment can increase pollution levels, that the legal responsibility of manufacturers and dealers should be delineated more accurately and that, as such, managers’ cars and cars registered for the day should be included. </p>
<p class="contents">The directive is a mere starting point. We now have to gather experience. We need to find out whether the environment is really an argument for the consumer when they are buying a car, i.e. whether they decide in favour of an environmentally-friendly rather than a less environmentally-friendly car. When the directive is evaluated, we will need to decide whether adjustments need to be made. The intention should at any rate be to reduce CO2 emissions as efficiently as possible and to act swiftly. This is why I would like to ask Parliament to adopt this directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When I bought my first car my primary consideration was to be noticed in it by the opposite sex. Now other considerations such as safety and economy are more pertinent.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome this legislation because it is important that the information outlined is made available to those purchasers for whom environmental and economy considerations are paramount.</p>
<p class="contents">People in the United Kingdom are particularly interested in fuel economy because of the punitive fuel tax levels set by our Labour Government, which particularly pose problems for people living in rural areas like my own where public transport is often non-existent.</p>
<p class="contents">My first reaction when I saw this directive was surprise. Not only have we had such a scheme of publicising fuel economy data for some time in Britain, but most people assume that the existing scheme is the result of a European directive already. In fact only Sweden and the United Kingdom have such a scheme. It is good to see Europe following Britain’s lead. The key to the success of the United Kingdom’s scheme is simplicity. I hope that the directive, as outlined in the common position, does not confuse consumers by going further than our scheme.</p>
<p class="contents">My first concern is that there is flexibility for Member States to extend the information available. Whilst I realise that there are subsidiarity implications for this flexibility it is also true that by having different information and different formats in different Member States this could distort the single market and confuse consumers who wish to buy in different states.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the directive proposes to compile a top ten list of vehicles according to class. How does one define these classes? If it is based on the footprint of the car then we could see small saloons, four-wheel drive vehicles and two-seater sports cars listed together, clearly a nonsense. It is also possible that a manufacturer could move a model up to a class containing larger vehicles simply by adding 15 cm of plastic to the front. Top ten rankings may also differ in neighbouring countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In welcoming this scheme, I hope that when it is reviewed in 2003, if any of the problems I have mentioned have arisen, these can be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I congratulate Mr Sterckx on the way he presented this to the committee and for his cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The directive does not entirely match Parliament’s expectations in all areas. Nevertheless, I can go along with the rapporteur, and would like to thank him for his work. We want to see this directive implemented as soon as possible. That is why we do not want a narrow-minded debate here today. For example, we could talk about whether we need realistic values, as everyone knows that air-conditioning or independent vehicle heating has a huge impact on a car’s CO2 emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">Another obvious question is why, when someone from Denmark buys a car in Germany, or someone from France buys one in Italy, they do not get the same information about its design. But we can put that to one side for now. We want to have the directive as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to say something about the centrepiece of the strategy – the voluntary agreements between the Commission and the car industry. If we really end up with 140 g in 2008 as intended, that would be excellent. However, and Parliament has already expressed its opinion on this at various critical junctures, there are certain risks. Parliament, and in particular of course the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, which was responsible for this, was not exactly pleased that it was not involved in the work on the negotiations and the agreement between the European Union and Japanese and Korean manufacturers.<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>I think, Commissioner, that once again you clearly need to find a <span class="italic">modus vivendi</span> to make sure that the legislature – Parliament – is in future properly involved in the voluntary commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive before us allows consumers to buy a car not only according to its horsepower, but also its CO2 emissions, by referring to a “top ten” list.</p>
<p class="contents">While in Bonn people are trying to shirk their responsibility and avoid reducing CO2 emissions, we here are doing things properly, establishing law and giving consumers the option of cutting CO2 emissions themselves!</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I would like briefly to refer to the factor which gives rise to this directive: the energy efficiency of cars. This doubled, effectively, between 1973 and 1986. Consumption decreased, during this period, from 17.8 to 8.7 litres per 100 kilometres. During this same period, the stricter provision of equipment contributed to a 4% saving and the use of a lighter chassis led to the remaining 96%. Nevertheless, since 1986, fuel efficiency has increased by a mere 10%.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, this is due to the fact that technological development systems used in the car industry impede global improvements in the product as a result of the high level of specialisation of companies’ R and D laboratories. These laboratories – which are often physically a long way from each other and lack a coordination and communication strategy between them – invest a lot in improving very specific features of cars, and very little in improving the car as a system for moving from one place to another.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end – and since directives such as the one which we are discussing today have been very well received – I believe that the European Parliament must promote and support initiatives which are aimed at an integrated product policy in which the R and D in design, in this case of cars, receives all the attention it deserves. I believe that unless we deal with production in an integrated way, that is, from the moment that the car’s raw materials are selected, through its manufacture, the production process, the use and finally the recycling and final disposal of the car when the buyer is no longer using it, we will never really manage to introduce measures which are genuinely significant in the field of reducing green-house gases.</p>

Therefore, I believe that this list we are talking about of the ten most efficient cars could also be, if we carry on like this, the list of the least inefficient, and in no sense will it be the list of the best. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Consumer information and awareness-raising are the third pillar of our strategy, alongside the environmental<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>agreement with car manufacturers and tax measures. I believe that the common position submitted to us by the Council fully addresses this third requirement. It is well balanced and takes account of the main requests made by the European Parliament at first reading – let me say that again, the main points. Because we should be really grateful to the Council, and I am not just saying this to get a laugh, that so many of Parliament’s requests from first reading have been weeded out, given that they were adopted in a fit of over-zealousness and did not have my approval. Mr Lange, I hope you will not take offence if I say that this request regarding petrol and fuel consumption in independent vehicle heaters and air-conditioning units is one of these. If we start trying to limit that certain level of luxury, that element of quality that people have become accustomed to, we will just irritate consumers. We should not be deterred by this. That is why I am happy that this directive is now somewhat clearer and that requests like this have been taken out.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we should limit our legislative texts to essential and comprehensible points, and that also applies to this directive.<span class="bold"> </span>This is all the more relevant given that in future we will increasingly have to deal with complex and technical subjects. In Strasbourg we have plans for a similar directive on just such technical processes. </p>
<p class="contents">The directive we are discussing is certainly an important part of our strategy for combating CO2 emissions. However, I think that a certain scepticism about its effectiveness is not out of place. I have my doubts about whether publishing consumption and exhaust gas figures will really influence consumers in their purchasing decisions. Consumption figures are important anyway at a time of rising petrol prices. In order words, customers will inform themselves out of pure self-interest.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that mentioning CO2 emissions has more to do with awareness-raising. For me, that is also one of the key points of this directive: raising consumers’ awareness of the problem, so that they worry a little more about reducing CO2 emissions when it comes to their favourite toy, their car, and so that this becomes part of their way of thinking. Because if we are really to achieve Kyoto’s ambitious targets, then we all need to get involved, not just governments!</p>
<p class="contents">So what am I driving at here? As the legislature of the European Union, we will in future continue to have no option but to set clear limit values and time limits for achieving significant reductions in emissions. Some Member States have limited ambitions in this respect. I believe, Commissioner, that we still have some persuading to do together.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur for taking on this report. I am very grateful to him for that and he has our support. I do not think there are any more problems!</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They need to know what the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions are. Great! Tables, advertising brochures, guidelines, tips, that is all marvellous and Parliament adopted 29 amendments, of which 14 have been included in the common position. I would like to take the liberty of praising the Austrian Presidency a little, because I think they were the ones who made this happen. I also totally agree with the rapporteur when he says we should not waffle on! We should accept the wonderful job done by the Council and make sure that it comes into force as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">As someone has already said, there are few of us left, it is late, and we are tired, but perhaps we should nevertheless look at the facts of the case, which are that CO2 emissions from private cars are constantly rising, and will continue to do so. So we should not act as if we have saved the planet here today! We certainly have not. We missed the boat long ago – or rather we missed a lot of cars. We will not save the world with this directive. It is necessary, it is important, and I am delighted that we have it, and perhaps we will all have a bit less of a guilty conscience the next time we get into our cars, but we should not imagine that we can really save the world with such minimal measures, even if there are a great many of them. We need action of a quite different kind for that. I wonder if we will ever adopt a directive along those lines!</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Goodwill has gone out now. Otherwise, I should have wanted to say that the goal must be for environmentally friendly cars also to be able to impress the opposite sex. We hope that, one day, this will be the case and that there will be good grounds for maintaining that the car concerned is environmentally friendly. </p>
<p class="contents">We support the rapporteur’s recommendation to accept the present common position without further changes. It can also be seen from the recommendation for second reading and from Mr Sterckx’s intervention that the common position takes account of many of the European Parliament’s points of view. </p>
<p class="contents">We consider that consumers should be informed systematically and without unnecessary delays about the fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions of new private cars. In this way, consumers can be helped to make the right decisions. True, this is not going to change the world but it can be a small move in a larger strategy. Just as Mrs Flemming said, there is certainly a need for further measures in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We followed the discussions in committee very carefully. Even though there were some proposals as to how one might be able to improve the common position, rapid implementation was considered to be the most important thing. We are well aware of the fact that, in its current version, the directive is only the first step on the way towards a situation in which the consumer is better informed. Here are two examples by way of illustration. Firstly, we intend as soon as possible to develop the directive further by applying Article No 9 in connection with the inspection process and Article No 10 in connection with establishing the relevant committee. The Commission’s officials are at present working on the implementation of these articles. In the course of the work, we shall in, all probability, be returning to some of the Committee’s remarks.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission also has plans to create an Internet page with information about the fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions of private cars for sale within the European Union. This demonstrates that we want the consumer to have this information as soon as possible. </p>
<p class="contents">I want to say to Mr Lange – and this is in fact not the first time we have discussed this – that I take this question extremely seriously. We must look again at the issue of how the European Parliament is to be involved and also kept informed about the work on voluntary agreements. I also want to remind you that the European Parliament, the Council and the Association of European Car Manufacturers all maintained that it was a matter of urgency to reach agreements with car manufacturers which are not members of European associations. But, as I say, I take the European Parliament’s points of view seriously. I also want to say that I have no plans to introduce proposals for further environmental agreements as long as the issue of the European Parliament’s involvement has not been solved. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I just want to say that the Commission is pleased that the common position received such a warm welcome from the rapporteur and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection. We hope that, at the plenary part-session, the rapporteur’s recommendations will be complied with. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
