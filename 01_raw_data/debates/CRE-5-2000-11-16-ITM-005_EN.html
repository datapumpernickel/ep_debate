The EPP Group did not itself ask but was asked to postpone this. I personally said that I could agree to that. But there are many other views in our group. I could agree to postponement under one condition, namely if Mrs Theorin used the time up to November II to improve her report, for as it stands our group cannot endorse it.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to make one thing quite clear, and it is a point of principle. If we do not manage to complete the voting by Thursday lunchtime, then the normal procedure is for us to continue voting on Thursday evening.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not in order for us to postpone the vote because some colleagues cannot be here in the evening. So, to put it in a nutshell: on behalf of my group I would agree to postpone it to November II, if Mrs Theorin states that she will continue to work on her report and to improve it.</p>

I understand that it is not easy, but changes to the agenda are something we need to be notified of. As a rule I am always here on Thursdays. This afternoon, however, I have to give a talk. So I will not be here for the votes this afternoon because I was not warned in time. I am one of those Members who attends sittings quite faithfully. I too would move that the vote be postponed to the November II part-session. First, however, there is just one point I would like to add.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning we witnessed a moment of particularly extreme parliamentary idiocy. I do not know how much roll-call votes cost, but no doubt it comes to hundreds of thousands of French francs, or Belgian francs, out of our budget. Just to please some people, under ludicrous conditions, we have wasted time and money. Mr President, I feel you should refer the matter to the Conference of Presidents, so that excessive numbers of requests for split votes or roll-call votes can be identified and perhaps roll-call votes can even be restricted. All this is out of order and Parliament made itself look ridiculous this morning.</p>

They then see to it that we have to hold roll-call votes, which in fact are no longer really roll-call votes. This is a deliberate attempt by a very few people to raise their profile at the expense of others. So, first of all, we need a sensible system for roll-call votes.</p>

My question is: have there meanwhile been objections to Parliament's decision to scrap Friday? Have there been any legal objections? What will things look like next year? In future we might even end up in the same situation as now, where we keep having to postpone reports to the Brussels part-session instead of dealing with them here in Strasbourg.

Apart from the negativity which they demonstrated during the first stage, when the European Parliament called attention to the risks in Great Britain, action during the second stage, when the crisis was at its height in Great Britain, was basically limited to that country, and there was no immediate programme of strict controls or attempt to restructure animal feedingstuffs at pan-European level.

<p class="contents">At present, responsibility is shared between the Community, which has already laid down some partial rules (the ban on feeding meat-and-bone meal to ruminants, rules on the heat/pressure method for producing meal, the compulsory removal of specific ‘at risk material’) and the States, which want to retain their right to enact measures appropriate to their own situation, together with their right to protect themselves and to react rapidly for public health reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">The confusion that already exists in this context is exacerbated by a twofold difficulty. First, there is the difficulty of further standardisation with a view to introducing tighter controls, because some countries, such as Germany, do not want to pass on the extra costs to their farmers given that they are hardly affected by this disease. Secondly, and, conversely, there is the difficulty of applying different national rules, for now that border controls have more or less disappeared and labelling does not mention the country of origin, there is a significant risk of eating pork from pigs fed on meat-and-bone meal, even in a country where this is banned.</p>
<p class="contents">We have now reached the pinnacle of confusion, as became abundantly clear from yesterday’s statements by the French minister, Mr Patriat, and the European Commissioner, Mr Byrne, who both seem to be completely at a loss.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation shows how irresponsibly the unification of the internal market has been pursued in recent years. The first step we need to take is to start again from scratch, to review the labelling rules, to restore certain national controls, to create others and always to set out carefully, and in a clear and practicable manner, minimum European rules, while giving each State the essential right either to go further or to take safeguard measures.</p>
<p class="contents">If we do not begin by clarifying responsibilities, rationalising and recognising the overriding right of nations, Europe will merely continue, as today, to play its sad part in watering down these responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the substance of the matter, my group recommended extremely stringent measures to fight this epidemic. But we must not stop there. It is all very well to put out fires, but it would be even better to prevent them breaking out. That is why we want to learn four major lessons which should be borne in mind for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The first lesson is that we must reject production methods that go against nature, that are doomed to lead sooner or later to tragedies of this sort. Perhaps quality farming is a little more expensive, but the apparent savings gained by farming geared to productivity in fact end up as terrible costs for society as a whole. In that respect, we are appalled to see that the Commission is doing all it can to re-authorise GMOs, at a time when we still have no real idea of their effects and they are liable, 10 or 20 years’ hence, to cause new tragedies along the lines of mad cow disease.</p>
<p class="contents">Lesson number two: quality farming, which ensures a certain independence in regard to food, cannot survive in Europe in the context of a global free market. Yet at this very moment, after Seattle, we feel that Commissioner Lamy is just itching to start up a new round of international trade negotiations, to include agriculture, with the intention of once again bringing about a fresh alignment with the world market. That is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Lesson number three: the Member States must keep a closer eye on the Commission during international negotiations to prevent any further false moves – or should I have said betrayals? – such as the Blair House and Marrakech agreements, which, by cutting down on our vegetable protein products for the benefit of the Americans, drove us to respond by developing the meat-and-bone meal production that lies at the root of our current problems. We believe that, instead of giving the Commission even greater powers in international negotiations, as is currently proposed, the future treaty of Nice should subject the Commission to closer scrutiny by the national governments and parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">Lesson number four: we must radically review the policy of totally abolishing internal border controls, since it encourages trafficking of all kinds and makes health and safety controls more difficult. Similarly, we should temper the dogma of free movement at all costs, which led the Commission to threaten those States that wanted to introduce an embargo on British beef in 1996 and to drag France before the Court of Justice in 1999 for having refused to lift that embargo. Despite all that is happening today, the Commission has the audacity to uphold its complaint, thereby showing the extent to which it regards the free movement of products as the ultimate dogma. If the Member States want to put an end to these aberrations, they will have to take the treaty of Nice as an opportunity to clearly re-establish a national right of protection for reasons of public health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are in a crisis situation, but we are not facing just a beef crisis. In fact, we are up against a real public health problem and an economic crisis. It concerns all the stages from ‘farm to table’.</p>
<p class="contents">The consumers have lost confidence, and to contain the situation it was essential for us to reiterate our call for the rapid introduction of compulsory tests to identify BSE for all bovine animals. This measure had to go hand in hand with an immediate ban on the use of meat-and-bone meal for all species, throughout the Community. That is certainly a practical way of applying the precautionary principle. We have been waiting for far too long.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union as a whole must be involved, for it is unacceptable to have one country taking draconian measures and putting its economy at risk while others carry on business as usual. Moreover, we are still, unfortunately, seeing many cases of fraud and the only way to put a stop to that is to ban meat-and-bone meal throughout the Community. These are the kind of measures that will reassure the citizens and that will send the farmers the message of solidarity we want to convey to them.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament must exert pressure on the Commission, which was overly cautious in the proposals it made during the debate. We are astounded that the Commission does not seem to realise the scale of the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this unprecedented crisis emphasises the limitations of the common agricultural policy, which we have seen for many years now. Today we must help farmers not to increase their production, but to improve it. There too, we have been waiting for far too long.</p>
<p class="contents">Some people are concerned about the emergence of genetically modified products to replace meat-and-bone meal. A radical change of course in the CAP, which has now become vital, towards growing vegetable crops on fields hitherto left fallow could prevent people from resorting to massive imports of GMOs from the United States.</p>

This affair has been characterised throughout by a lack of transparency and an extremely serious covering up of information at the highest level in some Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">What is at risk here is food safety, from the ‘mad cow’ issue, from dioxins and even from GMOs. All of this makes it clear that when the quest for maximum profit is the sole consideration, human and animal health are threatened. The lack of consumer confidence is spreading and the agricultural markets are battening down the hatches.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless there is a change in the common agricultural policy, the food safety problem will only get worse. The CAP has always promoted intensive production, the gradual ‘stepping up’ of production and land concentration, which has basically served the interests of the agro-food industry and the big transnational food companies.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic problem will not be solved simply by having a European food authority and belated one-off legislative measures, however positive they may be, such as the ban on meat meal in all animal feedingstuffs. It is crucial that we go further and promote a change in the common agricultural policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore necessary to establish as soon as possible the procedures to prevent the use of anatomical parts liable to lead to the transmission of the virus.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's proposals contained in the White Paper on food safety and, in particular, the establishment of the authority which is to guarantee this safety, must be implemented as soon as possible – over a year has passed and the authority is not yet operative – in order to avoid the confusion of actions carried out by the governments on the subject causing damage such as that which we are witnessing now. The damage is extremely serious in that it affects two strictly related areas: human health, on the one hand, and, on the other, the health of the cattle species and, consequently, the economy of the zootechnical sector.</p>
<p class="contents">We should remember that Europe banned France from continuing to enforce the embargo on beef and veal from the United Kingdom and that the lack of measures has allowed the epidemic now to spread to France.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, nevertheless, necessary for the Commission to ban the use of meat-and-bone meal henceforth and to provide for – as far as is known – safer procedures to destroy the parts considered dangerous such as the brain and bone marrow. Until we are given more information by the scientific bodies, it would be appropriate to destroy the cattle carcasses as well to provide the highest possible guarantee of the protection of human health.</p>
<p class="contents">The cases of BSE which have arisen in France, in the same way as the dioxins in chickens issue in Belgium, are the latest in a long series of irresponsible incidents. For fear of spreading panic among the citizens or with a view to avoiding commercial disasters, certain governments did not provide the Commission with the necessary information quickly enough or did not immediately call a halt to consumption of the products in question or ban their export at the first signs of danger. These irresponsible attitudes must be strongly condemned and, to avoid these incidents reoccurring, appropriate regulations must be established for all the States of the Union. It is unthinkable that we should be trying to run a single market without common rules for such a major sector as that of public health.</p>
<p class="contents">In the face of these uncertainties, the citizens’ reaction is, rightly, one of fear and the refusal to consume those products which are suspected of being dangerous for health. This attitude is combined with lack of confidence in the European Union, which appears to the citizens not to be able to guarantee the safety of the foodstuffs on the market. To restore the confidence of the citizens as well as protect their health, it is vital that the Union speeds up its decision-making, defining common rules on the matter and placing the scientific and control bodies in operation as soon as possible to monitor food safety. The ban on the use of meat-and-bone meal for feedingstuffs is only the first step along this road. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The constraints some producers, especially in France, have imposed on themselves to guarantee the quality and traceability of their products may already have been compromised by the loss of consumer confidence, not only in the products but also in measures to guarantee their safety, since products labelled AOC, IGP, etc. are also affected.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot allow an entire industry to be destroyed. We must tighten up our health and safety controls, impose a procedure for systematic BSE testing, and ban the use of proteins derived from animals. That is where Europe can assume its legitimate role in full and where it must play its rightful part. Any efforts the Member States make will remain fruitless unless the same requirements are imposed on imported products from the European Union and from third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we have to ban the use of meat-and-bone meal in animal feed, given that we cannot guarantee the traceability of the inputs, but this raises a number of problems. Should we burn them or store them? Provided we set up specialised facilities to control the impact of this on the environment. Should we replace them? For the time being with oilseed imports, even though we cannot distinguish between imports that have or have not come from genetically modified varieties. It is crucial to resume the negotiations in the WTO so as to enable European farmers to increase their production of vegetable-based proteins. The farmers cannot tackle this crisis without help: we need to draw up a support plan for stock-farmers and introduce measures to restore consumer confidence. Moreover, the politicians must fulfil their responsibility for dealing with the human situations these difficulties have produced.</p>
<p class="contents">The time has come for a global debate. The discussion of the White Paper on food safety is an opportunity to do so. Let us grasp it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let me point to the key role the UEN Group, and also the very coherent draft resolution we tabled, played in ensuring that it took place. We finally agreed to co-sign the joint draft resolution and we are delighted it was adopted by a very large majority, despite its inadequacies and weaknesses. At the same time, we keenly regret that the amendments our group tabled were not adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider it crucial, however, for the Community budget to help implement the new safety measures imposed on stock-farmers, and especially on all those working in the beef sector who are hard hit by the loss of consumer confidence. It is equally crucial to demand the immediate resumption, in the framework of the WTO, of the talks on the provisions of the Marrakech agreement relating to oilseed, an agreement which goes very much against European producers, so as to prevent the ban on meat-and-bone meal from resulting in mass imports of oilseed that may contain genetically modified organisms.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, yesterday’s debate highlighted the differences of opinion on how to deal with the crisis: differences between Member States, differences of political approach, differences between the Community institutions. There are deep-seated differences on the question of meat-and-bone meal and also on the subject of tests.</p>
<p class="contents">So we are now facing an absolutely fundamental safety problem affecting the public health of our peoples and the very future of an entire industry that plays a decisive role in the social balance in some of our Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In the face of this crisis, we cannot therefore confine ourselves to half-measures or to compromise provisions, i.e. to options that are totally inappropriate when what we should be doing is applying the precautionary principle by taking the relevant measures to ensure the maximum safety of our peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate has shown that the Council Presidency and the Commission are very much at sea on this issue. It was rather pathetic to see the Council Presidency try to pass the buck by putting its salvation in the hands of the future European Food Safety ‘Authority’, as though the fact that it was European were in itself a guarantee of absolute trustworthiness.</p>
<p class="contents">The accusations flying around on all sides in yesterday’s debate – ‘The Council is to blame!’ ‘The Member States are to blame!’ ‘The Commission is to blame!’ – show the extent to which the Community machinery actually works rather like a system for the reciprocal denial of responsibility, at the expense of the sole purpose of the debate: the effective protection of the public health of our people.</p>
<p class="contents">For its part, the Commission had to note the wide divergence of views on the remedies needed to contain the crisis. It decided it was a good idea to pour derision on the protective measures adopted by some Member States, in particular with its reference to ‘magic’ in regard to the total ban on meat-and-bone meal. While denouncing the lax approach taken by some Member States, it certainly did not point out its own reluctance to drag France before the Court of Justice because it quite appropriately decided to maintain its embargo on British beef.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is clearly envisaging no more than half-way measures, which will take away from and not add to the countries with the most stringent safety, whereas, in line with the principle of subsidiarity, it should be giving Member States back the freedom of action they need to protect their people effectively, to ensure their safety, taking account of public opinion in their country, the political resolve there, the scale of the epidemic in their country and the place of the sectors involved in that country’s economy and their society.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of the inability of all the European institutions, the Council, the Commission and Parliament, to define an appropriate Community policy that responds to the safety needs of the Member States most directly concerned, problems will arise in deciding whether it is the constraints of the single market or the health and safety needs of our people that come first.</p>
<p class="contents">How, indeed, can we restore consumer confidence in France and prevent the collapse of the sectors linked to stock-farming if, on the one hand, we put a total ban on the use of meat-and-bone meal by French farmers while at the same time authorising imports of meat from Member States that continue to feed their animals with meat-and-bone meal and refuse to carry out tests?</p>
<p class="contents">We must strictly respect the wishes of those Member States that intend to put food safety and consumer health above all other concerns, their resolve to give priority to scientifically based decisions and to the precautionary principle in regard to any measures they take, while choosing the middle road between the positions of the various partners, and especially those who are most lax. Otherwise it would become quite clear that the conduct of Community bodies is not being guided by the principle of subsidiarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The main source of air pollution is the large manufacturing companies, as in the case of waste incineration, which is a result of the waste produced in other daily industrial activities and other common daily activities of the European citizens. I voted for this directive but I would like to stress that, in doing so, I am calling upon the European Union to commit itself and concern itself, rightly, with those who breathe the toxic air produced by these industrial activities. It must also – and even more so – concern itself with those who work in these sectors. I feel that it would be appropriate to reduce the working hours of the people who work in pollutant companies.

<p class="contents">The Commission proposal goes back to 1998, but, because of the many points of disagreement between Parliament and the Council, the Conciliation Committee had to be convened on 11 October. So today we are deciding on the text that has emerged from the conciliation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me remind you that the directive covers the incineration and co-incineration of waste. These two treatment methods must form part of a global strategy that covers the prevention, re-use and recycling of waste, a strategy that is coordinated at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">In the course of the debates that marked the two readings by the European Parliament, I expressed my doubts and fears about lumping hazardous and non-hazardous waste together in the same directive. These are very legitimate concerns and they have led Parliament to be very vigilant and to table amendments aimed at establishing very stringent controls over everything connected with the process of incineration and co-incineration. After extensive discussion with the Council, we achieved what we wanted on several points.</p>
<p class="contents">On co-incineration, for example, which is generally carried out in cement kilns, the limit values for emissions are specified in an annex. However, if more than 40% of the waste incinerated in plants of this kind consists of toxic waste or untreated, mixed municipal waste, the plant will have to comply with the more stringent standards of another annex on incineration.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission wanted to exclude vegetable agricultural waste and waste from the forestry and food industry. At second reading, Parliament added fibrous waste from the production of raw pulp and pulp-based paper where this waste is intended for co-incineration. It managed to get this point through during the conciliation procedure. Parliament also succeeded with another point: plants in which radioactive waste is incinerated must be expressly excluded from the scope of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament also succeeded in obtaining stricter rules on the operation of incineration plants, together with improved public access to information.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by emphasising once again that the widespread treatment of hazardous waste must not lead us to tolerate the production of such waste. Our priority is and must remain to prevent the production of waste, in accordance with the line adopted in the European Union’s strategy in this field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The 370 million citizens of the EU are demanding action on this subject and they are right to do so. Waste in Europe is being generated at a rate of over 1kg per person per day. Two billion tonnes of waste is being generated within the EU on an annual basis. This situation cannot continue for ever.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must be clear about one aspect to solving waste disposal problems. The future of waste disposal does not lie in local authorities up and down the length and breadth of the European Union searching for new landfill sites. There is serious growing concern about the actual environmental consequences of landfill sites in general. I share this concern. I believe that nothing less then a major shift from reliance on landfill sites to more integrated waste management plans will suffice.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has been to the forefront in devising new waste management strategies in recent years. I support the objective of the directive which we are discussing here today which is to reduce the adverse effects of incineration on the environment and on human health by considerably reducing the emission levels into the air of several major pollutants. This is also part of broader European Union environmental policies which are designed to reduce the use of pollutants across all economic sectors in Europe, in accordance with obligations laid down by the Kyoto Accord.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union fully supports the strict, ambitious but attainable recycling and recovery targets that have been laid down by the Irish Government. These targets which are to be achieved over the next 15 years include the following: a divergence of 50% of overall household waste from landfill sites; a minimum 65% reduction in bio-degradable waste which is presently consigned to landfill sites; the development of waste recovery facilities employing environmentally beneficial technologies capable of treating up to 300,000 tonnes of bio-degradable waste per annum.</p>
<p class="contents">All these measures reflect changing public opinions on the issue of waste management. The days of landfill sites are now coming to an end and must be replaced by more environmentally beneficial technologies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That means that a considerable proportion of the working class of one of the richest regions in the world is reduced to poverty.

<p class="contents">The report proposes a budget of EUR 100 million over five years to combat poverty. That comes to one and a half euros for every poor European. Even as a handout that would be derisory, quite apart from the fact that the issue of poverty does not call for charity.</p>
<p class="contents">We realise that no report and no vote, even by the European Parliament, can alter this situation. Yet the report could at least have put the blame at the door of those responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, though we did not vote against the report, we did not feel able to vote in favour of it either, because not only are its practical proposals inadequate but, alas, it conceals rather than combats the actual situation, namely the exploitation that is the real cause of poverty among the working classes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let me remind you that Lisbon defined a common strategy of social inclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome this initiative, which responds to the expectations of our fellow citizens, the citizens of Europe. Indeed, while we welcome the return to growth and the fall in unemployment, we must not close our eyes to the fact that inequalities are still with us, if not getting worse. Social exclusion is a very real phenomenon, as the Eurostat statistics show: some 18% of the population of the European Union lives on less than 60% of the average national income – this is the low-income threshold taken to measure relative poverty – which means that 65 million people live on low incomes.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though the unemployment rate has fallen, there are still 16 million unemployed in the European Union. Moreover, although unemployment is still the main factor behind poverty and exclusion, job insecurity and low pay are nonetheless obstacles to full integration into society.</p>
<p class="contents">Too many of our fellow-citizens are left by the wayside. We must therefore adopt proactive measures to provide social protection and access to public services in the field of health, education, housing and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">I unreservedly support the proposal to implement a second Luxembourg process to deal with social exclusion, containing guidelines and national action programmes. Indeed, we can see all the benefits of this method in the employment field.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon European Council set the European Union the objective of becoming a knowledge-based, competitive and inclusive society. That can be achieved only at the cost of considerable efforts to guarantee all men and women access to training in the new information and communication technologies and also to the new telecommunications networks. Universal service has a prime role to play in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">The next meeting point is Nice where, I hope, the Member States will send out a powerful message indicative of their political resolve to embark on a global strategy to strengthen the European social model by adopting the Social Agenda and the Charter of Fundamental Rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the establishment of such a programme of community action is both wise and can be very helpful. We do not want to build a two-tier Europe, a Europe of the haves and have-nots. We do not want to accentuate the gap between the rich and poor.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact of the matter is that long-term unemployment and youth unemployment are quite concentrated in particular areas within the European Union. They are concentrated in specific black spots within many rural and urban parts of the European Union. Devising initiatives to defeat the problems of social exclusion and to give hope and opportunities to the disadvantaged in our society must be a central core policy of all governments within the EU at this time.</p>
<p class="contents">The principles underpinning this programme are to create an open method of coordination between Member States to help eradicate poverty and social exclusion. This will be achieved by setting specific objectives to be integrated into national action plans and implementing policies to promote equal opportunities. I believe that the rapporteur is right when he calls for greater participation of public authorities, social partners and civil society in measures to defeat poverty and social exclusion at this time.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of the Amsterdam Treaty, all governments within the EU must send new action plans on employment to the European Commission for its evaluation and consideration. The European Commission must evaluate all these plans to see how successful the governments of the EU are in defeating social exclusion. We must learn from each other on this specific matter. Otherwise the gap between rich and poor will widen within the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I welcome the key provisions of the Social Policy Agenda Programme 2000-2005 as recently published by the European Commission. This will give an increased role to EU social partners in terms of the drafting of different EU directives and regulations. Employer relations will be improved. There will be continued national and European support for local job creation programmes. There will also be an improved coordination of policy programmes in the area of the information society, modern telecommunication services and Internet related activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Ireland has quite an advanced system of social and employment rights and many EU directives are being drafted, particularly on the Irish model in the field of social partnership and employee/employer relations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Simply mentioning these figures ought to drive us to act, which is what the Heads of State and Government did in Lisbon by entering poverty and exclusion on the European agenda for the first time. Since Europe cannot be economically strong without social justice, we can only welcome this progress.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I have no option but to vote in favour of this report by our colleague, which not only endorses the Commission’s proposal but also enhances its content. The report calls for qualitative and quantitative indicators of social exclusion to be established. It is fundamental within the 15 States of the European Union for us all to able to speak of the same thing on the basis of identical data. Moreover, the report calls on the Member States to be more proactive and set precise objectives when they draw up their national action plans.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the report goes back to the open method of coordination, calling for dialogue between the players involved (social partners, NGOs, local and regional authorities) and networking. In conclusion, our Committee on Social Affairs, is proposing a budget of EUR 100 million instead of the EUR 70 proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, this is a step forward that we must consolidate and encourage, since economic progress by itself can certainly not guarantee the citizens a better quality of life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The ongoing restructuring processes and mergers involve new redundancy plans. Although we are seeing strong economic growth and a fall in unemployment, in the modern world work offers no protection against exclusion. The ‘working poor’, most of them women, working part-time, for a pittance and in the most insecure jobs, join the trail of poverty so loftily ignored in the official speeches about economic recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">Quality jobs, health care, housing and education are indeed basic rights, which, if they were binding upon employers and states, would be able to offer protection against social exclusion. That is why we will vote in favour of the report on combating exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet the Members who will be endorsing this text today did not show the same surge of solidarity when they voted for a Charter without social rights which, in reducing measures to combat exclusion to the level of measures of assistance, constitutes a step backward in relation to much of the legislation now in force. A more effective way of combating exclusion would be, for example, to establish a European minimum guaranteed wage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In submitting its proposal for a programme to combat social exclusion, the Commission is complying with the Council’s call to present "by June 2000" an "initiative for cooperation in this field".</p>
<p class="contents">According to Eurostat figures, some 18% of the population of the EU live on less than 60% of the average national income (taking the low-income threshold as a measure of relative poverty).</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal establishing a programme of Community action to encourage cooperation between Member States to combat social exclusion (2001-2005) consists of promoting a better understanding of social exclusion, mainstreaming the promotion of inclusion and developing priority actions addressed to specific target groups. This strategy is to be implemented through three main strands. Strand 1: analysis of characteristics, causes, processes and trends in social exclusion; strand 2: policy cooperation and exchange of best practice; strand 3: dialogue involving the various stakeholders. The open method of coordination is emphasised which respects the principle of subsidiarity whilst actively involving all relevant actors.</p>

Cooperation between Member States is crucial for tackling these deep rooted problems that exist all across the EU, but particularly in my own constituency in the North-West of England. Moss Side and Salford are amongst the most deprived inner city areas in the whole of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We are sadly all too familiar with the spider's web of problems impoverished areas face – deprivation, social exclusion, unemployment, crime and drug abuse, but with the help of European schemes tackling social exclusion and European cash, local communities can begin to free themselves from this evil tangle.</p>
<p class="contents">The British Labour Government has been leading the fight against poverty and social exclusion. Three years ago, the Prime Minister set up the Social Exclusion Unit which coordinates government action to reduce social exclusion by producing joined up solutions to joined up problems. It works with other departments which have a close bearing on social exclusion. I fully endorse this innovative measure that has benefited many young people in particular, through strong action on truancy and school exclusion, sleeping rough, teenage pregnancy and providing support to 16-18 year olds not in education, employment or training.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a great example of the Labour Government delivering concrete benefits to ordinary people. With a new, radical approach, I strongly believe that we can, not only turn the corner, but reach the finishing line too and, one day, banish poverty and social exclusion from the North-West entirely. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, scientists and climatologists are increasingly less worried about hiding their fears in relation to the consequences of greenhouse gas emissions, and even the general public is starting to become aware of them.</p>
<p class="contents">These projections, which are dramatic in the very short term, should convince us of the need to adopt clear, proactive measures at European level targeted at checking this process of degradation in the quality of the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal and the Rothe report we voted for today follow that line in calling for the promotion of renewable energy sources, which are alternative sources that respect the environment in the production of electricity.</p>
<p class="contents">This follows up the statements by the Commission and the call from the European Parliament for major progress to be made towards implementing the target set out in the White Paper of doubling the share of renewable energy in energy consumption by the year 2020.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States must now pursue the same line and respect the environmental objectives they endorsed both at European level and at international level, but they must also ensure their independence as regards energy and security of supplies. At present, the Union is dependent on outside supplies for about 50% of its energy, and that figure may well rise to 70% by the year 2020 unless we develop renewable energy sources.</p>
<p class="contents">Today the European Union is leading the way in the construction of plants for the various types of energy production.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Union wants to remain competitive in this sector, it will have to contribute by using and developing the technologies concerned, which implies major public funding.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, and because the Rothe report is an excellent report, I voted for it in the hope that the Commission and the Council will follow us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Renewables are a very important part of an effective climate protection strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">In Finland peat is an important renewable energy source, and accounts for 6% of all fuel used. Unlike in Central Europe, there is a lot of peat in the Nordic countries such as Finland. Specialists worldwide have also said that peat is an important biomass fuel, whose annual growth clearly exceeds its consumption in Finland. The northernmost areas of Finland are in the tundra zone, where not enough wood grows to constitute a source of natural energy. Peat is an important fuel particularly in these regions, where it also has an important impact on employment. I am satisfied that the European Parliament recognises these facts and includes peat in its report on renewable energy sources.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States of the European Union, including Finland, are committed to achieving the Kyoto targets, conservation of natural resources and a reduction in emissions of harmful substances. The importance of nuclear energy is increasing constantly, for this very reason. Obviously we have to observe more progressive and effective safety and security rules when using nuclear energy and when storing nuclear waste.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, 15 November, the Finnish energy company, Teollisuuden Voima, requested the Finnish Council of State to give a decision, in principle, on the construction of a fifth nuclear reactor. I hope our government and parliament will take a positive view of this request. The responsible use of nuclear energy provides the opportunity for an energy source that is environmentally friendly and economical, and there is no reason to place restrictions on its use. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission realises that, even more so the rapporteur, by calling for greater priority than before to be attached to alternative energy sources and alternative energy production. I therefore thank Mrs Rothe for her good report.</p>
<p class="contents">The first lesson we must learn from past experience with conventional energy sources – for instance, their impact on the climate and on nature, the incalculable safety risks and the foreseeable shortage of resources – is that we must considerably strengthen our support for the development and use of new energy sources. In the long term, that means we must move away from the policy of subsidising conventional, fossil energy sources. A first step here is consistently to break down all obstacles to the use of renewables. Moreover, in future we must do more to make existing best practice more widely known to the public.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the aim of any energy and economic policy must be to reduce and optimise energy consumption, for only the careful treatment of resources of whatever kind can help minimise the external costs. In that regard, we call for more targeted research into the external costs of the production and use of renewable energy sources.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we can only restructure energy supplies if we take account of the special conditions pertaining to alternative energy suppliers. Decentralised electricity provision is not just a structural but also a social aspect. Thirdly, therefore, we must not liberalise the energy sector without defining minimum social standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Coal and oil supplies will eventually run out and are responsible for CO2 emission. Nuclear energy can cause disasters capable of rendering large parts of the earth uninhabitable, and produces a hazardous waste product. So we must go in search of energy that is already present in nature, but which has remained unused because no one has developed the technology to tap into it. It is not very ambitious of Parliament and the Commission to only want to double the use of this form of energy over the decade to come. There is still too little water, wind and solar power, which is what makes it comparatively expensive. Everyone wants a method of electricity production that is as environmentally-friendly as possible, but they also want it as cheaply as possible. This particularly applies to people who are not very well off and whose first concern, therefore, is that their household costs should remain as low as possible. If clean energy remains an expensive option then it will also remain an elite form of energy for some time to come. Environmentally-aware high-earners are free to make a voluntary contribution to cleaner forms of energy, within a liberalised market, whilst everyone else carries on in the same old way. Clean energy must be available to all and affordable to all. As far as the six points are concerned, such as the incineration of peat and organic waste, I support the veto requested by Greenpeace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is aimed at speeding up the neo-liberal reforms, against which the second were protesting. The unions and the social movements reject the dictatorship of the “chaebol”, the large, traditional industrial conglomerates, but that does not mean they want this to be replaced by the dictatorship of the IMF or the WTO. Nor, indeed, by a new – economic – colonisation of their country, at a time when everyone is wondering which western firms will be buying out the South Korean industries that are in trouble.</p>
<p class="contents">The alternative forum also encouraged interparliamentary contacts, punctuated by a meeting at the South Korean National Assembly on 18 October. What it found is beyond dispute: the elected assemblies have been kept out of the ASEM process, even though businessmen were systematically involved. It is urgently necessary to breathe new life into the interparliamentary dialogue (ASEP) between Europe in the west and Asia in the east.</p>
<p class="contents">The preparation of ASEM IV must be used as an opportunity to set out our requirements for democracy, on the one hand, by ensuring that the elected assembles and civil society are kept informed and able to intervene – which involves, in particular, the establishment of a social forum – and, on the other hand, by adhering fully to social, environmental and human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
