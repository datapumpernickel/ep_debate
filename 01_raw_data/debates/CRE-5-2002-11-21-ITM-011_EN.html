The success of the student demonstrations cannot conceal the fact that the human rights situation has not improved but has, in fact, deteriorated.</p>
<p class="contents">The stoning of women, public hanging, torture and other barbaric practices mean that Iran still does not fulfil the elementary demands of civilisation. It is therefore astonishing that the European Union has not tabled a resolution concerning the situation in Iran in the UN General Assembly Third Committee. Many Member States say that they have high expectations of the human rights dialogue but, in reality, instead have high expectations of their lucrative business interests.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must not let itself be taken for a ride. On the day before the European delegation of negotiators arrived in Teheran, five people were publicly hanged. The dialogue must not be a reason for failing to put the human rights situation in Iran on the agenda in international fora. That is why, in the spring, the European Union must submit a resolution to the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. Naturally, it is important not to isolate Iran. Contacts must be established, but good use must be made of these, and the reformers must be given as much support as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">A political dialogue clause in a future agreement is not enough. In my group’s judgment, no cooperation agreement can be concluded as long as there is still gross and systematic abuse of human rights. Aid to terrorist organisations is also an obstacle to such cooperation. The situation in the country is becoming more explosive by the day, and it is therefore also high time that there were genuine reforms in Iran. There can only be constructive dealings with Iran if the truth is allowed to prevail and if supreme authority lies with the people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all condemned the death sentences and stonings and the general way in which this inhumane Iranian regime treats its people. At that time we also expressed regret – at least my group did – that the Council had decided not to table a human rights motion on Iran at the next meeting of the UN Commission on Human Rights. Now, only a short time later, someone is sentenced to death when all he has done is to urge people to think things over, not to let their opinions be decided for them and not to blindly follow religious dogmatism.</p>
<p class="contents">In this situation the European Union is continuing to negotiate a cooperation agreement involving economic cooperation. One of the statements in the motion is inadequate in my view. It is obviously good if future cooperation agreements contain a human rights clause. But I think it would be better – and I am saying this on behalf of my group – if there were no cooperation agreements at all and if they were not even concluded while human rights are not respected. It is schizophrenic. We only have a limited number of options when it actually comes to bringing pressure to bear. We should not give up the possibility of exerting economic pressure on Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course it is positive that the students are going out onto the streets. Of course it is positive that President Khatami is saying that this verdict is unacceptable. Of course it is positive that the Speaker in the Iranian Parliament is taking the same line. But this has not come anywhere near to forcing a restructuring of Iranian society. It is no accident either, in my view, that the Iranian religious leaders and the Iranian Government intend to remove the legitimate opposition in Iran by trying to make them out to be terrorist organisations and having them all put on the corresponding list so that they will have eliminated this opposition once and for all. I think that we too have a great responsibility here. We need to take more notice of who is put on these lists and why. We should ask more questions; the European Union should not always stand to one side like a junior prison warder.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we are calling on the Commission to make it quite clear at the next negotiations that there will not be any cooperation with Iran, economic or otherwise, for as long as this inhumane system remains as contemptuous of human rights as it is at present. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I share the view expressed by the Speaker, the Speaker in the Iranian Parliament, Mehdi Karroubi, who called the death sentence a disgrace to the country's judicial system. However, I am not entirely convinced that it is as a matter of conviction that the country's religious leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, has ordered the judiciary to review the verdict. Khamenei's previous record suggests rather that he is playing for time. The student demonstrations should slowly die down, as should the interest shown in the case by the public both nationally and internationally.</p>
<p class="contents">It has, however, become clear in the demonstrations that the demonstrators are not only concerned about Dr Aghajari, but that they want more democracy altogether. In fact this verdict, like many others, is not motivated by religious concerns, but by political ones. We are familiar with this from European history, when the State and the church were not yet separate. The rulers of the time used Christianity, too, as a means of realising their own claims to power until it could no longer be recognised as such.</p>
<p class="contents">Iranian society is, however, one step ahead of the conservative judiciary and clerics. This is clear, amongst other things, from the most recent proposals for reform put forward by the Iranian Parliament, which seek to restrict the absolute power of the Council of Guardians. I call on the Council and the Commission to pursue the dialogue on human rights in all their contacts with Iran and to be clear that without the European Parliament there will be no agreement on cooperation and trade.</p>
<p class="contents">The opposition in the Iranian Parliament, both in Iran and abroad, is also very hopeful that economic interests will not be our only reason to hold contacts with this country. I think that we will also be able to make our views and basic position known when we welcome members of the Iranian Parliament on the occasion of their return visit to this House. For our part, it will always be clear that we are on the side of more democracy and not on the side of those who want to turn the clock back several hundred years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Iran is a complex society. There is evidence of some progress towards an Islamic society that is in tune with the modern world. President Khatami and his reformist allies are a symbol of that modernisation. However, President Khatami is being constantly frustrated by the more fundamentalist elements of Iranian society. That is why the EU is currently engaged in negotiating a trade and cooperation agreement with Iran. This is not currently in doubt, though it must be clear to the Iranian authorities that at the same time we will expect and require an agreement on human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The death sentence on Dr Hashem Aghajari for apostasy on the basis of some obscure theological dispute is incomprehensible to the West. We welcome President Khatami's intervention, the action of lecturers and students in protesting and Dr Aghajari's own appeal for calm. We welcome the threat of resignation by President Khatami, the cabinet and dozens of MPs, should the Council of Guardians veto legislation that is being proposed to limit its current absolute power.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we have to make it clear to the government of Iran that we will be watching the outcome of this and similar cases with close interest, in terms of our future relations with that country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, it is about a man who is threatened with death and whom we must rescue. Secondly, it is about a Dr Aghajari who, in the opinion of many prominent Muslims, is defending true Islam, this great world religion, from political abuse by the extremist forces that are in power in Iran. And thirdly it is about the fate of Iran itself, because in Iran we are now seeing a power struggle between reformers on the one hand, who want gradually to open up this regime, like President Khatami and the aforementioned Speaker of the Iranian Parliament, and darker characters on the other hand whom to compare with the Middle Ages – I should like to make this clear – is an insult to the Middle Ages. These are forces that are unfortunately adherents to a modern, totalitarian form of extremism and that are abusing the great world religion of Islam for their own suppressive and criminal ends.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, allow me to say a final word to Mr Markov. Mr Markov, I have expressed criticism of the weakness of the West and of the repression practised by a regime myself in the past, when the SED was still in power in East Berlin, and I have to say that you yourself would have described the words that you have just used as a throwback to the cold war. At that time I certainly thought that democrats should be uncompromising where totalitarian forces were concerned. That was true then, it is true today and it will also be true in the future!</p>

<p class="contents">Following his speech last June on religious reform, given in western Iran, the university professor, Hashem Aghajari, was arrested and, this month, was sentenced to 74 lashes, followed by eight years’ imprisonment and the death penalty. Professor Aghajari, who lost his right leg during the Iran–Iraq War, needs medical attention. He was expected to appeal to a higher court, but Professor Aghajari had the courage to defy the legal system by refusing to go to appeal. For several days, Teheran has been the scene of heated student protests and, I am glad to say, President Khatami has announced that he does not support the sentence, which was ordered to be reviewed on 17 November by Supreme Leader Khamenei.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past, we have called repeatedly on Iran to apply the death penalty only to people who have committed the most serious crimes, in observance of the commitments assumed in accordance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In its Conclusions on 21 October, the Council agreed to initiate a dialogue with Iran on human rights, thereby confirming its concern over this area, including violations of civil and political rights and, especially, freedom of expression. The Council also mentioned its traditional, resolute opposition to the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">On 18 and 19 November in Brussels, President Prodi and Commissioner Patten met Iran’s Foreign Minister, Mr Kharrazi, who undertook to participate in future dialogue between the European Union and Iran on human rights, and challenged, together with other leading Iranian figures, Professor Aghajari’s unjustified sentence.</p>
<p class="contents">The dialogue on human rights is, in effect, an appropriate forum for the consideration of individual cases. The Commission will monitor developments extremely closely and remain in contact with Parliament and the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add that the Commission feels that initiating the talks, which will also include a political dialogue, is in the interests of Iran and the European Union – see the Conclusions of 17 June 2002 – and, furthermore, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement will contain a clause on human rights. In addition, the negotiation process will allow us to exert pressure while, at the same time, supporting President Khatami and the reformists. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
