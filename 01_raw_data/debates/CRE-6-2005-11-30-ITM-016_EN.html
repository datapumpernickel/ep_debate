I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and the members of all the committees involved. They have also made a major contribution to the work of Parliament on this file.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal from the Commission aims to implement at EU level the WTO General Council Decision of 30 August 2003, allowing copies of patented medicines to be produced for export to countries in need. This decision represents a waiver from the normal rules of patent law, particularly those set out in the WTO TRIPs Agreement. It has to be seen within the wider context of existing national and international frameworks for patent protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The discussions in the WTO leading up to the decision of 30 August were long and complex. The decision itself represents a delicate balance between the need to ensure access now to medicines for countries with public health problems, and the need to encourage development in the future of new medicines, through investment in research and innovation protected under the patent system. We have sought to reflect that balance in the Commission’s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">As many of you will know, the decision itself is a temporary measure. It will remain in force until a permanent amendment is made to the TRIPs Agreement. The negotiations on such an amendment have not yet been successful, despite several deadlines having passed. The compulsory licensing issue thus remains on the agenda of the WTO. However, that is no reason for us to delay: bringing our regulation into force as early as possible will allow countries in need and EU producers of pharmaceuticals to use the mechanism we are putting in place. Indeed, all three institutions, Parliament, the Council and the Commission, have supported the principle of early agreement on the regulation, and intensive informal discussions have been taking place with that in mind. While these discussions have not always been easy, they took place in a spirit of good cooperation, and I must congratulate Mr Van Hecke again on the results which show how well the institutions can work together.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased that these discussions have resulted in a compromise package. I should say now that the Commission could support such a package of amendments if it is voted through in its entirety and without any additions or subtractions.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the Commission’s proposal aiming to do? It sets out a mechanism in line with the WTO decision so that companies in the EU can apply for a licence to manufacture, without the authorisation of the patent holder, pharmaceutical products for export to countries in need of medicines and facing public health concerns. We have tried to produce an instrument that will allow the compulsory licensing procedure of the WTO decision to fit within the context of Member States’ existing national patent law and the compulsory licensing procedures they already have under that law.</p>
<p class="contents">An instrument at EU level implementing the WTO decision has great symbolic value as an external demonstration of the EU’s commitment to the decision. At the same time, we have to respect the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, and so avoid regulating specific details which can better be dealt with under national law or by the competent authority which is processing the licensing application.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s work has resulted in some helpful clarification, particularly as regards an explanation of the involvement of non-governmental and international organisations. We have always envisaged such organisations as being potentially involved in any purchasing procedures, and able to make requests on behalf of an importing country with that country’s approval. Of course it is unlikely that such organisations will themselves be manufacturing pharmaceuticals, but if they were they could simply apply for a licence under the regulation like any other manufacturer.</p>
<p class="contents">Another useful clarification has been improvement of the text relating to the possibility of using the EU’s scientific opinion procedure, or equivalent national procedures, to certify the safety and efficacy of medicines for export. This is not something regulated in the WTO decision, indeed it lies outside that framework. But in order to assist importing countries we felt it was a necessary complement to the licensing mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to the overall scope of the regulation. The WTO decision provides for export of medicines to WTO members who are least-developed countries or who are developing countries with insufficient manufacturing capacity of their own. There is no specific restriction on the pharmaceutical products covered, although there is acknowledgement that they are required to address public health problems, since that is in the context of the decision. The Commission originally took the view that we should reflect faithfully the scope of the decision as regards the countries eligible to receive exported medicines. That position was based on our assessment of the WTO decision, which specifically covers WTO members as beneficiary countries. I am pleased to say that since then we have accepted humanitarian arguments that all least-developed countries and certain low-income developing countries should be eligible, regardless of whether they are currently WTO members. At the same time, to help ensure that the right medicines get to the right patients, non-WTO members are also expected to make similar commitments to those required from WTO members. This means they should notify what medicines are required and commit to preventing trade diversion if they are to receive products under the EU mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important issue is the question of remuneration for patent holders. I do not think there is any disagreement that patent holders should receive some remuneration for the licences granted without their authorisation. This is a normal principle of law. In the interests of a certain transparency for industry investing in the production of medicines, and as part of the overall compromise package, we could support the proposed formula for remuneration which still leaves some leeway for determination on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude at this point by reiterating that the Commission remains very much in favour of the early adoption of this regulation, while respecting the overall objective of introducing a workable, transparent system which companies are able to use for the export of medicines to countries in need. I would call on Parliament to support the compromise package which is on the table. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This Decision gives the WTO members, in application of paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration on TRIPs, the option of granting compulsory licences for the production and sale of patented pharmaceutical products to countries with an acute public health problem and insufficient, or no, production capacity. It is just about the only agreement that the WTO members managed to reach in Cancún. My report aims to ensure that this WTO Decision is applied, by means of a European regulation, in a uniform manner in all EU Member States. In our Committee on International Trade, there was a large majority in favour of making considerable adjustments to the Commission’s original proposal. This consensus gave us a particularly strong negotiating position during the informal trialogue that was started without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">Particularly the British Presidency, with the WTO ministerial conference on the horizon – which I think gives them an excuse for not being here this evening – insisted on an agreement at first reading. Nearly all the proposals by the Committee on International Trade were eventually accepted thanks to the excellent cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs of the other political parties who have upheld Parliament’s viewpoints with much expertise and force, for which I am very grateful to them.</p>
<p class="contents">The key improvement to the Commission proposal is without a doubt the extension of the scope to include non-WTO members. From now on, all developing countries will, if necessary, be able to make use of the system. Moreover, NGOs and international organisations, such as the UN, will be entitled to submit their own applications for the import of medicines. It is, after all, often those organisations that distribute medicines in developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, an accelerated and simplified procedure will be introduced to deal with demand for additional quantities, and I would thank Mr Arif who has played a key role in this. Additional applications will become possible if it transpires that the quantity of medicines initially allocated in the compulsory licence is insufficient to relieve the suffering.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important change is the scrapping of the requirement of prior negotiations with the patent holder in the case of a significant emergency situation arising or other situations of non-commercial or public use. As far as these prior negotiations are concerned, the Committee on International Trade has insisted on the period being specified more clearly as being a maximum of 30 days. This was eventually accepted by the Council, just as the concrete fleshing out of the notion of suitable remuneration that must be paid to the rightful claimants who will simply keep 4% of the total value of the product in question in the event of an emergency situation. In other cases, the economic value will be taken into consideration, but 4% will remain the benchmark.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise entails a number of changes over against the original Commission proposal, and these were incorporated into amendments tabled both by me and by the shadow rapporteurs of the other groups. I hope that they will be adopted and that the agreement reached with the Council and Commission can be ratified. We will at any rate be able to say in Hong Kong that Europe has translated this important WTO Decision into a uniform regulation for the whole of the Union. This can only benefit our credibility in respect of the many needy in the developing countries and in the regions hit by natural disasters. It is in that spirit that I would like to urge my fellow Members to approve the amendments and thus to ratify the agreement that has been reached. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that we are dealing with this question on the eve of World Aids Day should encourage us to send a loud and clear message to those countries so tragically affected. UN Aids again reminded us very recently of the sad reality that the world has never before had so many people who are carriers of HIV. The number of persons infected passed the 40 million mark this year and Sub-Saharan Africa is the most severely affected with two thirds of the world’s sufferers and three quarters of the world’s infected women.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been clear from the outset that Parliament has one priority, namely the rapid implementation of the regulation in question, so that countries in need can benefit from the flexibility offered by the WTO’s 30 August 2003 solution as soon as possible. This is a first step in the European Union’s compliance with the spirit of the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and public health.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank my colleague Mr Van Hecke warmly for the work he has done in consultation and collaboration with the counter rapporteurs. He appears before us today with a compromise that manages to take account of Members’ positions: it is a responsible stance. Several of our demands appear in the final text, in particular the widening of the scope to the least developed countries and certain developing countries that are not members of the WTO. In view of the vital role that NGOs and certain international organisations play in the supply of health services and treatments, I am glad that they will be allowed to deal with patent holders directly in order to buy and distribute generic medicines. I am also pleased to see that my proposal for a simplified procedure for additional quantities has been adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many positive points. I do have a number of regrets, however, especially regarding the appropriate remuneration to be paid to patent holders. I would have liked the rapporteur’s proposed 4% ceiling to be mandatory in all situations and not only in emergencies. We have nevertheless succeeded in getting the fact that the compulsory licence is issued for humanitarian and not for commercial reasons taken into account when that remuneration is calculated.</p>
<p class="contents">I also hope that this regulation will be evaluated quickly and its viability assessed. In view of the complexity of the mechanism it seeks to deploy, I shall remain vigilant to see that this solution is permanently included in the WTO intellectual property rules. Indeed, only such an evaluation will enable us to draw adequate conclusions for effectively revising and adapting our response to the public health problems encountered by the countries of the South.</p>
<p class="contents">Meeting the challenge of access to medicines requires a more global approach and the regulation we are discussing today is only one stage in that. Within the WTO, Europe must commit itself to ensuring that all the Doha Agreement’s public health advances are translated into reality. This means in particular ensuring that no bilateral or regional trade agreements include additional conditions on intellectual property that would undo the gains of the Doha Declaration.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, if application of that declaration leaves something to be desired in practice, the EU must also try to find new ways to give the developing countries easier access to medicines. Even now, we are faced with the need for second-line treatments, for which no generics are yet available and the price of which is prohibitive, requiring renewed action on our part.</p>
<p class="contents">The fight against Aids and, I must stress, many other diseases afflicting mainly the poorest populations is far from being won. The forthcoming WTO conference in Hong Kong gives us an ideal opportunity to bring the question of access to medicines back to the centre of the debate. Adopting this regulation today offers us a first definite solution for thousands of sick people who are waiting for treatment, but let us not forget, when tomorrow comes, to seek lasting solutions equal to the scale of the challenge that faces us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am today speaking on behalf of my colleague Mrs Weisgerber, who is unable to be here for personal reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">This House goes beyond the Commission proposal in demanding the extension of compulsory licensing not only to needy WTO members, but also to over 40 other states equally in need of help. While there is agreement across group boundaries that the group of eligible countries should be expanded as a political indication of willingness to help countries that are not members of the WTO, it is equally possible to find this objectionable.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though we have gone to a great deal of trouble to seek – and, it is to be hoped, to find – a fair balance between the claims of the poorer countries on this planet and the licence-holders’ justifiable interest in protecting their patents, there is still a great deal of uncertainty. Who, in the final analysis, is in a position to monitor the re-labelling or repackaging of medicines and to prevent their being reimported into the European Union – the Member States at national level, the Commission, the importing countries, the industry or the drugs business? Are we not, by doing this, giving people a licence to create considerable problems for us at a later date? With the situation that we can currently observe, with people making great profits from the illegal trade in medicines across every border and by every route – ranging from the Internet to across the traditional shop counter – I have to say that I have misgivings.</p>
<p class="contents">I will be taking the liberty of asking the Council and the Commission, at regular intervals, how the figures stand and how many compulsory licences have been applied for, and I look forward to receiving accurate data in response. I understand that the British Presidency of the Council wants to notch this up as a success for itself.</p>

<p class="contents">Developing medicines costs money. The average cost involved in bringing a medicine onto the market varies from around EUR 600 to EUR 900 million. Businesses are compensated for this via patent rights, and rightly so, but the effect is to make medicines expensive. The directive we are currently debating intends to ensure that people in the poorest countries can access the necessary medicines, namely that poor countries can, in special cases and under certain conditions, produce medicines at affordable prices, which is a good thing.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, however, prevent a situation in which it becomes unattractive for industries to develop medicines. That is why we must make every effort to ensure that the regulation cannot be abused, for example via re-imports to the EU. The regulation is aimed at promoting health and not trade. That is why we think that precise descriptions must be given of reasons underlying applications for the compulsory licence, of the patents in question, that the medicines in question should have a different appearance, colour and packaging, where possible, and that the level of production must be logged.</p>
<p class="contents">The TRIPs regulation on patents has been in place for some time. Whilst it has, to our knowledge, never been used, it is still important. It can help patent holders to find solutions for emergency situations in developing countries quickly and under excellent conditions. Needless to say, this regulation cannot totally eliminate all the problems surrounding medicines in developing countries. They also need a road network, refrigerated transport, sufficient medical staff, and suchlike. It does, however, represent a considerable addition to the aid in special emergency cases.</p>
<p class="contents">This compromise makes it possible to transpose into EU law the WTO Decision in respect of TRIPs. With the WTO Summit in Hong Kong on the horizon, this can send out a positive message, which will stand the EU in good stead, and so I should like to congratulate Mr Van Hecke on the result of negotiations with the Council and Commission. I am pleased that a compromise has been struck and I hope that Parliament will accept it tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The subject matter was difficult and complicated. It is to be noted that, in the codecision procedure followed in respect of this proposal for a regulation, there were intense negotiations which culminated, I am glad to say, in a compromise text which includes most of the essential key points.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the inclusion of the following points in the compromise text is of particular significance. Firstly, the necessity of vital technology transfer and technical assistance to countries deficient in national drug manufacturing capacity. Such assistance will help much-needed, long-term improvement of healthcare provision in underdeveloped countries. Secondly, the extension of eligibility to non-WTO members: such countries are just as much in need of assistance under the provisions of this regulation as WTO member countries. Public health concerns and disease prevention and treatment cannot be differentiated on the grounds of WTO membership. Thirdly, the extension of applicants to NGOs and international organisations such as the United Nations: it is well known that many NGOs and international organisations play a major role in providing vital healthcare services in developing countries. Their rapid involvement in fighting disease and poverty and eliminating human suffering, especially in disaster-stricken regions, is well established and in most instances it is more important and better coordinated than national government assistance efforts. It is therefore only logical that a request from an NGO acting with authorisation from an importing country should be eligible under these regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, although this regulation will no doubt help save millions of lives worldwide, I feel it has come a little too late. Let us recall that the TRIPs Agreement was adopted in 1994; the landmark Doha Declaration on TRIPs and public health was produced in 2001; the decision of the General Council of the WTO was taken in 2003 and this regulation will probably come into force in 2006. I wonder whether such a delay may have been responsible for much confusion, inaction and probably unnecessary human suffering in the developing world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Obviously, the right to life is more important than all other rights. This represents the first step towards defending the right to life. The Commission’s proposal is too weak and, in my opinion, Parliament has improved it, especially with regard to enabling NGOs to use the directive. Another improvement stems from our justified criticism of the need for remuneration and of how this is to be defined and from the fact that we also apply such considerations to countries that are not members of the WTO and whose citizens’ lives are worth just as much as those of citizens of WTO countries.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of adequate remuneration, the fact is that, if you do not have any money, you cannot provide adequate remuneration. There just will not be any. That must be made absolutely clear. I also hope that these measures will be implemented as quickly as possible, as I do not believe that this legislation is sufficient, and the only way for us to find out if it is in fact sufficient is for us to get it through quickly so that we can test it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My group does, nevertheless, have a problem with the regulation. While it is intended to incorporate and implement the 30 August resolution of the WTO General Council, it has, today, already become evident that the agreed system for the handling of patented medicines will not be workable in practice. This has been confirmed by respected international organisations with experience of diseases – ‘Médecins sans Frontières’ and ‘Act Up’ for example – and proven by practical experience in such countries as Canada. The compulsory licensing system is cumbersome – so much so as to make the provision of development aid and effective help in the fight against Aids epidemics impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if the 30 August resolution softens the impact of the TRIPS Agreement on the health field, we still do not see the fundamental human right to health as being given priority. It is for that reason that my group will find it difficult to vote in favour even of an improved development draft. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, six million people every year die of Aids, tuberculosis and malaria; they are from the poorest countries in the world, and they lack medicines that are both effective and affordable. It is for that reason that the WTO, as long ago as November 2001, decided that its member states could, in emergencies – and I emphasise, in emergencies – abrogate the international patent protection afforded to medicines. That is why, subject to certain conditions, domestic producers of medicines or other generic manufacturers can apply for a compulsory licence entitling them to manufacture cheaper copies of patented medicines.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the good news. The other side of the coin is that the pharmaceutical research industry invests masses of money in effective and innovative preparations. Research and development creates jobs, and the work to be done in it can and must be funded by patent protection. I therefore believe that the principle of patent protection for medicines must not be undermined. Research into medicines must continue to be worth the effort, since the development of new medicines is in the interests of all. Only under exceptional circumstances, then, does it really make sense to award compulsory licences.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also prevent their being misused, and so the patent holder should be accorded certain information rights, enabling him himself to monitor compliance with licence conditions and to draw attention to breaches of them.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to know what is to be supplied to which countries and in what quantities, and we really do have to prevent cheap copies from finding their way back into Europe by being reimported. This can be done by, for example, special labelling, packaging or different colours or designs.</p>
<p class="contents">Taken as a whole, I regard the proposal on which we are going to vote tomorrow as a reasonable one. Nobody here regards it as perfect, and so it is probably a good compromise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What is regrettable about this debate is that some Members – particularly in the lead committee – keep trying to point the finger of suspicion at the medical research industry, and hence also at those who deal with patents, with unwarranted insinuations that they are indifferent to people in poorer parts of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Patents do not stand in the way of humanitarian action – the contrary is the case, for without them, innovative companies are unable to take on high levels of financial risk and invest billions in research and development. It is only by means of such investments that medicines can be developed that can, for example, keep pace with the constant changes in certain pathogens. That benefits not only us in Europe, but also people in every country throughout the world. Were there no patents, medicines and vaccinations against many fatal diseases would never have been developed – medicines and vaccinations now within the reach of everyone, including of course people in the developing world. Compulsory licensing is no solution to the problem of how to combat diseases in developing countries. More effective control and better setting of priorities would make it possible for billions given for development and humanitarian purposes, but then misdirected, to be used to buy adequate supplies of medicines.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to take the Lisbon Strategy seriously, that is to say, if we want to move research and development forward, we need an effective protection for patents that cannot be weakened or set aside at will. TRIPS may well make compulsory licences possible, but they are not a necessity, for there are alternatives to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The regulation, in fact, allows for the granting of licences, which are compulsory for export purposes, and provides that the conditions under which they are issued are identical in all the Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider it an inviolable principle that distortion of competition for operators in the single market be avoided by applying uniform rules to prevent pharmaceutical products manufactured under compulsory licences and at low prices from being reimported into the EU. By acting thus, the EU is putting itself forward as one of the international players most committed to ensuring that citizens of the most disadvantaged countries have access to medicines at reduced prices.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I am a committed supporter of this proposal, I must, however, point out that the measures contained in the proposal in question reduce the protection afforded to intellectual property rights. It would therefore be reasonable to allow patent holders the opportunity to be involved in the procedure laid down for the granting of compulsory licences for the manufacture and sale of medicines intended for export to World Trade Organisation countries. This opportunity for involvement would be achieved through the right to submit comments to the competent national authority to ensure that the decision taken minimises any loss of intellectual property rights, by providing for both parties to have a say in the proceedings. In particular, in the case of marketing authorisations, this procedure would allow the holders to enter the EU market in circumstances under which they would not otherwise be allowed to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
