<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sanders-ten Holte (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the quality of education is high on the political agenda of every Member State, and that comes as no surprise. The third millennium offers unknown opportunities and prospects within a society which is becoming increasingly more aware, more global, more mobile and more knowledge-intensive, but at the same time where the concern about different speeds and opportunities for people is becoming increasingly apparent, because how does one ensure that everyone can function fully in this new dynamic society? Education must and can help here, and all these new developments offer education opportunities and challenges, because education will undergo a sea of change, and that is only the way children are taught, and how they are taught to learn. Consider, in addition, technology, information technology and the different cultures. That is why it is so important that the EU Member States join forces and want to work together on future-orientated education, each according to their own tradition but, let there be no mistake, with a common goal in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur, I am thus delighted with the results of the common position as it is now before us. Initially, I found the Commission proposal somewhat vague and very non-committal, given the huge importance of sound education, and the Council was suffering from stage fright: whatever you do, do not touch our autonomy in education. However, in the course of the discussions, they came to share Parliament’s opinion that the quality of education should be monitored seriously and in a structured manner by, among other things, setting up sound, efficient quality evaluation systems for primary education, secondary education and secondary vocational training.</p>
<p class="contents">The recommendations are now clear in the amendments tabled by the MEPs and myself as rapporteur. In these, we stipulate clearly that Member States must develop transparent quality evaluation with high-quality education as the key goal. This was not in the first Commission proposal, and neither was the promotion of social integration. Offering equal opportunities to boys and girls, that was also hard to sell. It was difficult to convince the Council to adopt this wording, but as rapporteur, I am delighted that both the Council and Commission are now in agreement with this.</p>
<p class="contents">Another aspect which was close to my heart is that parents, pupils and teachers too should be involved in the process. This, too, has now been included, and this is important for the support structure of evaluation processes and improvements in education. It is also important to encourage schools to cooperate at national and European level. However, I believe that schools should not be prevented from looking for sound cooperation partners in their immediate surroundings within the region, and, in my opinion, this idea could have been given more of an airing in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to underline the importance of collating information and developing indicators and references, and of entering these in a database which can be consulted interactively. That is the modern way of communicating. It brings me pleasure personally as rapporteur to see that the Member States have got down to work both independently and under the remit of the Commission and have set up a working committee of experts that has developed a limited number of indicators and benchmarks. Parliament will be monitoring the developments closely.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, the common position as it is now before us is the result of sound and constructive cooperation with the Commission and the Council in the spirit of codecision, but particularly thanks to the involvement of my fellow MEPs who have delivered their comments with great care, the recommendation has become a sound, well-balanced and stimulating one, which Member States can now start to use. I am interested to hear your reaction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On behalf of my committee, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would particularly like to stress the importance of improving the quality of teaching in schools and vocational training, and seeking to implement a system for exchanging good practice and methodological tools. These are ways of achieving social cohesion and reducing unemployment. High quality education systems must strive to achieve objectives, such as to get people into the labour market, to reduce the number of young people leaving school early, our ability to provide life-long learning and to give people access to the new technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">I must highlight two points in this quality evaluation as specified in the common position. First of all, this process makes a clear distinction between administrative evaluation and the innovative procedures that we would like to see and that we would like to implement and in which, as has been said, all stakeholders must take part.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point which I would like to highlight has perhaps not been fully taken on board, as we would have wished. What we do not want to do is to turn the quality evaluation process into a factor for establishing a hierarchy, classification or league table of schools. On the contrary, this form of evaluation should allow each establishment, however different in terms of its students or the methods or resources used, to meet all the risks of dropping out, to improve the intrinsic quality of education for everyone and to accept all pupils of all abilities by offering education which is tailored to the students’ requirements and by allowing everyone to discover their own personal development needs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Perry (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, this report is strongly supported by the PPE-DE Group. Indeed, we have supported it throughout the entire procedure. We regretted that initially there was some slight resistance from the Council but we are very pleased that, as a result of strong intervention by the Commissioner and the negotiating skills of the rapporteur, a compromise was reached last autumn that we can certainly support. We congratulate the Commissioner and the rapporteur on their work to achieve that. We certainly all agree here in this Chamber that education is of vital importance and that an educated workforce is the cornerstone of Europe's future prosperity. Therefore, any attempts to improve standards in our schools must be welcomed with open arms.</p>
<p class="contents">We also all agree that education is rightly a matter for the individual Member States and the regions. But there is room for the Commission to coordinate and improve evaluation systems as provided for in the Treaty and I was glad to see that the Commission was careful to emphasise that this is to be based on voluntary cooperation between the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly, at the moment it is difficult to get past each country's various examination systems and teaching philosophies to reach any objective comparison of the teaching standards of the countries. As a former lecturer myself, I would have welcomed a clear idea of how British teaching and educational standards compared to those of other European countries. It is important in this global age to have as broad an input as possible for the evaluation system. European comparisons will show up, one hopes, strengths but also weaknesses that are currently hidden by evaluation systems limited to a single educational system. One of the main aims of education is to provide for the world of work as well as providing a cultural base for Europe's young people. This report seeks a balance between the need for adequate preparation in both those fields.</p>
<p class="contents">The possibility of comparing education systems across borders will, I hope, lead to improvements across European teaching establishments as schools learn from others outside their immediate view. The point made by Mrs Sanders-ten Holte about social exclusion is particularly valid. I would like to see whether there are differences in the pattern of the school day, whether this varies in different parts of Europe, and whether this offers ways of improving education. Then there is the use of compulsory sports activities: does this help in the educational system of different countries? Do different countries have different patterns? We would all be interested to know how the educational systems achieve competence in two modern languages in addition to the mother tongue. I suspect my own country will not do so well there but perhaps we would do better on the use of information technology.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would just like to say that the rapporteur's amendments calling for greater self-evaluation and participation of stakeholders inserts a valuable cog in the evaluation machine. The opinion of those within the educational system is often lost within the large civil service machines and bureaucracies which run schools. We must find ways which give power back to the schools and to the parents and to the students because that is where responsibility should lie. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The conclusions of the Lisbon Summit emphasised the importance of education both in improving competitiveness and preventing exclusion. It is only natural that the quality of school education should receive attention also at Union level, although the organisation of education itself is the responsibility of the Member States. We need Europe-wide cooperation and encouragement in all areas of education.</p>
<p class="contents">Systematic quality evaluation in education is still in its infancy in many EU countries. In Finland, for example, there were legal provisions introduced on it as part of national educational legislation just two years ago. A report on the subject prepared in Helsinki last week shows that evaluation is not yet adequately systematic in nature, although it has got off to a brisk start. The report points out, for example, that comprehensive and high school education has not paid adequate attention to cooperation between pupils, their parents and the organisers of education. The importance of including pupils and their home background in decision making is certainly worth bearing in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Education cannot just be looked at from the limited point of view of competitiveness. There must be room for different sorts of talent, but, at the same time, we have to ensure that the others remain included. Education has a major part to play in building an equal and integrated society. Well-organised education means that national resources are being put to the best possible use. In my opinion, schools must be developed in such a way that all children starting their compulsory education can achieve success. That is why the evaluation of quality cannot just focus on results, which give a narrow picture of the situation. Education is not just about information and skills gathering, but also personal development, in the shape, for example, of a healthy sense of self-worth.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a positive sign that a common position on the quality evaluation of school education is ready to be approved so quickly. Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, Commissioner Reding and the Council all deserve the credit for this. We are making good progress with this important issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This competence must be carried out as closely to the population as possible, and that means that there will probably never be a need for a general European education system. But it is exactly because education is so important in the passing on, not only of knowledge and in the acquisition of skills, but it is also in the passing on of cultural heritage and in the integration of the individual into the social fabric that sound education is vital. Accordingly, we pour huge amounts of money into education and yet, there is an increasing need for European quality monitoring. That is why we would like to lend our support in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Parents know that education requires a huge effort from children and students, but at the same time they expect to see results. In the old days, maybe attending a good school was sufficient, because it enjoyed our ideological trust. That criterion is no longer enough on its own, and has not been for a long time. Parents want quality education, and children who attend school want to actually learn what is important in life.</p>
<p class="contents">Each one of us can ask the question how important common quality monitoring is in our own environment. What it did lead to in Flanders is a high level of self-evaluation in the schools. They sensed of their own accords that they needed to make a stand in the world of education. It has also led to increasing levels of care and concern across the borders. In Flanders, quality monitoring used to be a bit of a taboo subject, for example, for it was feared that this would breed hostility in the different educational networks. We now see that the opposite is true. The desire for quality monitoring in education has opened up the door to this large European Community and to the job market of this European Community. Quality monitoring has thus increasingly become a common area of concern.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, I can show you the results of an enquiry which was held across the Flemish education system to check whether both primary and secondary education meet the common standards. It is quite striking how much media attention this enquiry received, precisely because they know that parents, students and the entire teaching environment scrutinise these results. After all, each school, each educational network, wants to come out of this enquiry smelling of roses, but at the same time, each parent wants their children to attend good schools.</p>
<p class="contents">It has come to my attention that the world of education has been complaining about a lack of resources. After all, not only do we want our children to do well at school, we also want their schools to be well equipped, the environments to be safe, in other words the infrastructure to be up to scratch. Unfortunately, a great deal of resources are still needed in many countries in order to achieve this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the report and consider European cooperation in quality evaluation in school education to be important in this age of information. The European education systems must become attuned to the information society. Rapid scientific and technological change, together with globalisation, demand superior educational standards. We need an education system that can easily adapt to rapid developments in modern society.</p>
<p class="contents">What constitutes a good school education these days? Is it about imparting knowledge and expertise? There is more to it than that. I believe it is the role of education in terms of the self-realisation of the individual and his or her participation in a democratic, socially just and tolerant society that is crucial to the definition of a high quality education. Young people must be given the opportunity to acquire academic and social competences at school. Everyone is entitled to a good school education, and that goes for foreign nationals and groups on the fringe of society too. They are particularly at risk of social marginalisation because they are not as well educated.</p>
<p class="contents">I call upon the Member States of the European Union to ensure that everyone receives the same standard of education. The social divide between the informed and the uninformed must be bridged. Quality evaluation in school education is to be welcomed for two reasons. Firstly, I regard the evaluation as a way of incentivising people to improve school education, and secondly, it raises awareness of the quality dimension in education systems. The Member States of the European Union must work together in the field of quality evaluation in school education, because this is of crucial importance to labour market policy and the free movement of workers within the EU. In addition, organisations and associations working in the field of quality evaluation in school education should cooperate at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">We need European networks so as to be able to offer mutual support and to get the external evaluation process off the ground. After all, schools, associations, and organisations can learn from one another by exchanging information and experiences and so find exemplary solutions to providing a good education. I am committed to the idea of providing a good education, as a way of preventing unemployment and social exclusion. A high-quality education is an investment in the future, for the sake of social progress, a peaceful world and tolerance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berthu (UEN).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, today we are discussing a draft recommendation to the Member States on quality evaluation in education which may bring some worthwhile innovations to the working methods of the European Union and a project which has already made good progress at grass roots level. As far back as 1998, at a conference in Prague attended by 26 European countries, the national Ministers for Education agreed to implement a system of common indicators for their methods and results. First of all, they had to establish a common language and then compare results in order to share experiences, whilst leaving each Member State with full responsibility for its own education system.</p>
<p class="contents">We will find this an interesting initiative as much from the point of view of its motives as the method used. As regards motives, on the one hand, education is obviously a key factor in the age of the information and knowledge society, for both human development and economic competitiveness. We should, therefore, ensure that we get the most from the inevitably limited resources available to us. So we can only be surprised at the size of the gaps between the Member States of the European Union which are emerging, in particular, from the first set of statistics published by Eurostat last July.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, while the average level of public spending per pupil in secondary education in Europe is 100, Germany spends 84.9 and France 131.6. The difference is thus quite considerable. Moreover, it does not always work the same way and depends on the circumstances. That is why it is in all our interests to share our experiences.</p>
<p class="contents">The advantages of doing this seem particularly obvious in the case of France, which has a very inflexible education system that would benefit from being more responsive to the needs of the ‘education consumer’. However, it is difficult to carry out any reform precisely because of this inflexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the methodological issues, on the other hand, the new cooperation in evaluation of education systems could, in fact, lead the way to a new, wholly beneficial, method. It involves implementation of an open method of coordination, which has already been touched upon at the Lisbon European Council and which, if it were developed, could introduce a divide between working methods in Europe. It would not be a question of setting targets with a view to obligatory harmonisation. In any case, Articles 149 and 150 of the Treaty establishing the European Community do not give the Community competence in this area. It is simply a matter of together finding out the best practices, without, <span class="italic">a priori</span>,<span class="italic"> </span>setting targets in precise detail beforehand and of allowing each country to draw their own conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">This new method of coordination will create a networked Europe, which organises interaction between the various seats of power, i.e. the national Ministries of Education, rather than a centralised Europe. This networked coordination is more decentralised and flexible and more liberal than the standard harmonisation directive. In addition, it can easily extend beyond the Union’s borders to bring together 26 or more Member States, rather than 15. Mr President, we believe, for all these reasons, that this new and different method of cooperation seems to have great promise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are no two ways about it, education, i.e. training and further education, must take centre stage in all policy areas. Education is not an end in itself but is the key to our being able to hold our own in the modern age, not just in economic terms but also at a personal level. The transition to the knowledge-based society, the globalisation of the economy, social, democratic and environmental change, together with far-reaching changes in the world of work, due not least to the new technologies: these are the big challenges we face in the third millennium, and they also require renewed efforts in the educational field.</p>
<p class="contents">So again, I welcome the fact that this report has come before the House, because its aim is both to improve school education and the quality evaluation thereof.</p>
<p class="contents">Quality comparisons – be they internal or external – generate competition, and if the quality of education in European schools is enhanced as a result, and the three-fold challenge posed by the information society, globalisation and rapid scientific and technological change is taken into account, then this report will have achieved its goal of giving renewed impetus to efforts in the field of education, and a major step forward will have been taken at European level. So let us help to ensure that the report on implementation, which the Commission is to put before Parliament in three years’ time, proves successful.</p>
<p class="contents">Permit me though, on a final note, to say something that is fundamental to the future of education, since I have just come from an educational symposium, the Federal Conference of the Austrian People’s Party. There is more to education than equipping people for employment. Its goal must be the all-round development of young people as individuals. This entails imparting fundamental knowledge, skills and competences, communicating values, and educating people in music, creative subjects, health and sport.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, a sound knowledge base, which imparts important material and leaves out what is unimportant, still forms the basis for education in the twenty-first century. So it falls short of the mark to say that knowledge and information ought only to be obtained from the Internet. Those who do not have basic knowledge do not know where to acquire knowledge either. The cultural techniques of reading, calculating and writing form part of this knowledge base. The new technologies offer new opportunities to acquire knowledge and employ our cultural techniques. Only those who have a knowledge base know how to handle knowledge properly, and how to distinguish and differentiate, in an age that has seen an explosion in knowledge. That is why I feel this report makes a significant contribution to placing the acquisition of knowledge at the heart of our policy areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Quality, as we have been hearing, can be a problematic concept in education, especially when one looks at any form of assessment. There are certain areas, such as literacy and numeracy, where we can now gain some idea of what has been achieved. There are many international studies which have thrown up difficulties, however, when it comes to making straight comparisons, because of differences in curriculum, approach and the underlying assumptions about what constitutes a good education.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential not to confuse education with training. The primary purpose of education is not to prepare people for the job market but to prepare them for a life which is fulfilling in every way. In an increasingly flexible or precarious working environment people will be thrown back on their inner resources at many times in their lives and social cohesion is partly dependent on such personal resilience. We only have to look at what happens to those who are thrown out of work or who are excluded from the job market.</p>
<p class="contents">So when we are assessing the quality of education, we want to see if we can develop people who have self-esteem and confidence, who can communicate effectively, who can look behind the information for the hidden message, who can question, who can work as part of a team and independently, and who are creative, resourceful and have an appreciation of the wider world and their responsibility to it.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that when we are looking at the quality of education we need to see if it is delivering real equality of opportunity for all of those within the system or whether it is doing, as society does, so much to exclude people on grounds of a poor background or their colour or whatever.</p>
<p class="contents">So in our comparisons and benchmarking we have to look beyond narrow league table approaches. After all, every football team in a league depends upon the level of investment and the selection of the very best. It does not necessarily improve the performance of all.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad to see that we are recognising the importance of involving pupils themselves in the development and assessment of our educational system. We cannot expect to develop fully rounded and responsible individuals if they are not encouraged to be constructive and articulate about this major component of their lives. After all, education properly done is a collaborative adventure and we know we have a lot to learn from each other. That is why I welcome this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Their purpose is always to check if the person being evaluated has met the predefined targets of the person conducting the evaluation, who sets both the evaluation criteria and the consequences of their being met or not.</p>
<p class="contents">Collaboration on the part of the Member States in evaluating school education is becoming an important tool for intervening in the Member States' education systems, the aim being to promote an education model which is a far cry from a universal, quantitatively and qualitatively broad general education. A model which is even a far cry from the principle of ensuring that everyone is given the same start in life. A model which costs little but which serves the needs of big business for a cheap and, more importantly, docile labour force, a labour force which is wholly adapted to its requirements. This policy results in cutbacks in general education for the benefit of training which produces disposable labour; it even results in general education being replaced by an endless process of life-long learning. It also results in the weaker – and generally poor – students being shifted out of mainstream education into second-class training, as is the case in Greece, where the number of sixth form students has fallen by 35% in a few years following the so-called education reform. Evaluation also aspires to becoming a lever which can be used to force schools to operate in a competitive environment in which the best schools attract the best pupils, the best teachers and the most funding – in other words to operate on market criteria. This will result in falling standards in the majority of schools, especially in working-class districts and the countryside. In addition, the system of self-evaluation shifts the government's responsibility for the quality of education on to teachers, pupils and parents.</p>
<p class="contents">If we were truly interested in the quality of education, we would not be concentrating on evaluation mechanisms but on improving the standard of education for everyone. The debate on how to carry out evaluation is futile and misleading. What does make sense is to debate the essence of the problem. What type of person do schools mould and for what sort of society? If we were to evaluate today's schools on the basis of this criterion, we would surely conclude that they have a long way to go to meet the needs of the workers and for social progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I particularly welcome the emphasis on social inclusion. Education is an important, indeed crucial, part of society. Our education has an impact on all our lives and our communities as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent reports, as those of us from the UK are aware, have tended to criticise the teaching of children at a very young age as this could prove damaging. It would therefore be good to compare and contrast with other European models, within limits of course, as my colleague Mrs Lambert has already stressed.</p>
<p class="contents">Spain, for example, attaches great importance to social inclusion and developing personalities, working in teams; integrating. These are placed higher on the agenda than academia and at an early age. I also fully agree with better integration between parents, pupils and teachers and the many community players who rightly want to play a role in education and its development and achieve, as a result, the idea of the school as the community.</p>
<p class="contents">It will also provide an excellent opportunity to encourage schools in the different regions to share in good practices. Partnerships between different countries are so important, as indeed are partnerships not only between countries but between rural and urban links. This is part of a very important twinning concept and philosophy that is well established in Europe and is proving such a success throughout all our communities. Networking is so important. I stress that the sharing of good practices and the sharing of information between the different schools in Europe should not develop into a competitive practice. We should at all costs discourage any attempt to create European league table of schools similar to that in the UK that has proved so detrimental.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the report, it is a positive paper and one that we can build on to create better educational networks within the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To everyone here at the European Parliament and the Commission, I hope that we continue to work on the same good terms as we have done in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s business is to examine the draft recommendation on quality evaluation of school education. This draft has already made good progress and had the full backing of the European Parliament. I would like to thank Parliament for its enormous support which was testimony to its political will to forge ahead, something that was, at times, difficult. Parliament made many positive suggestions which, over the years, have been put into practice in the field. I would particularly like to give sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, for the excellent work that she has carried out in extremely short time frames and I would also like to extend my thanks to everyone in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport.</p>
<p class="contents">You have before you a draft recommendation which, as some of you have mentioned, relates to a key issue at the heart of our political priorities, to wit, can we guarantee improvements in the quality of school education and, if so, how do we go about it so that the European Union can give this a bit of a nudge in the right direction, without interfering in European systems which are, and remain, the responsibility of the national Ministers for Education?</p>
<p class="contents">You are aware that we have already made considerable progress towards this goal, since the launch of the major pilot project to evaluate the quality of school education took place at the beginning of the 1997 academic year. Over 100 secondary schools in 18 countries took part in this project. The draft recommendation is, to a great extent, based on the conclusions which we collectively drew from this research.</p>
<p class="contents">The recommendation relates to two crucial points. First of all, that of evaluation as an instrument to improve quality – the aim of which is not to establish who is top and who is bottom of the class, but rather simply to act as an incentive so that everyone ends up at the top of the class. Secondly, the role of European cooperation in this area. This is, moreover, something we know how to do very well, and we have demonstrated as much.</p>
<p class="contents">In this sense, the proposal encourages self-evaluation, external evaluation and urges all stakeholders to play a part in every aspect of the evaluation process so that, in the end, schools are inspired to learn from each other and can identify good practices and the most efficient tools for evaluation.</p>
<p class="contents">In this process, the Commission shall not prescribe any rules and is fulfilling its role as a catalyst. It is encouraging European cooperation between schools and enabling them to establish a Europe-wide network. It is trying to set up a database of tools and instruments to be used by schools in self-evaluation and which will then by available to all stakeholders involved.</p>
<p class="contents">That is precisely what the Lisbon European Council asked us to do. If we wish to place European society at the forefront of the world stage as an example of the knowledge society, then clearly, the extremely high quality of teaching in schools in every Member State, area and village should be the <span class="italic">raison d’être</span> for social equality amongst citizens. Mr Karas said that, in today’s schools, we are creating the society and the success of tomorrow’s society and I agree with this wholeheartedly. From this perspective, it is our responsibility to provide every available tool and to ensure that schools learn from each other, that the system improves everywhere and that no one is left by the wayside.</p>
<p class="contents">That is actually the goal of a knowledge society. We cannot afford ourselves the luxury of 20%, at the very least, of pupils being left by the wayside because they have not received the education they need to be able to do well in society. I agree with those of you who, on this point, said that you need to prepare for life in society before preparing for life on the employment market. Moreover, that is a considerable loss for a society that needs all its human resources in order to progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, together with the Ministers for Education, we are making these proposals on quality analysis to enable us to give this opportunity to all young people, because if they receive a high quality education then it is likely that they will be able to do well in society and be able to find a job.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I would once again like to thank Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, the rapporteur, as well as the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport and all the Members who have assisted us in this work.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to inform you that, following the Education Council’s move to make evaluation and quality a priority issue, action 6 of the Socrates programme has put out to tender within this very specific area. This will result in comparative studies being made and relevant institutions being networked.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to inform you that, at the beginning of April, the Swedish Presidency will be holding a conference at Karstadt and that the upcoming Belgian Presidency has already planned to work on this issue during its presidency. You will, therefore, have concluded, ladies and gentlemen, that this is not the last time that we shall be discussing this issue and that I shall be coming here on a regular basis to speak to you in detail about new and, hopefully, all positive, developments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
