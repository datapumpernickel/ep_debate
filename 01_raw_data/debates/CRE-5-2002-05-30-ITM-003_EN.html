<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bradbourn (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, could I begin by saying that the difficulties which face us in the consideration of this report represent some of the most important challenges to the completion of the internal market. Ever since the publication of the TENs progress report at the Cardiff Council meeting of 1998, there has been concern that some Member States have not succeeded in bringing forward projects which are appropriate for the type of funding contained. Therefore, as rapporteur, I have endeavoured to undertake a balanced approach to the revision of the TENs guidelines across the transport modes which facilitate our collective goal of a common market.</p>
<p class="contents">So that we can develop a network which best fits the needs of business and the consumer, I feel it is necessary to offer a breadth of choice that will encourage competition, both within a particular sector and across all modes. I am particularly happy to see the increased importance given to regional airports in this report, which will not only provide valuable flexibility in the air travel market, but also significantly reduce congestion around our principal capital airports, along with the concomitant problems which that causes to the economy and the environment. Similarly, I am also pleased to see, in areas where such action is appropriate, there is a greater emphasis on short sea, intra-European and inland waterway shipping.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is necessary that in our efforts to promote a variety of transport modes, we do not lose sight of the different economic and social needs of Member States. A one-size-fits-all approach will not work. Different countries have different conditions to deal with demographically, geographically and economically and I must confess to being opposed to some parts of the report as passed in committee, which seem to favour unduly certain modes at the expense of others. If a particular form of transport proves to be the most effective option for their particular requirements, European citizens should not be deprived of their natural choice by actions which have little relevance to their specific circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, in my own constituency of the West Midlands in the United Kingdom, which forms the core of my country's logistics, distribution and haulage network, we are fortunate enough to have two TENs projects running through the region: the West Coast mainline railway and the M6 motorway which links together large parts of the British motorway system. It seems to me, by way of example, to be ridiculous to have the direct competition of these two transport modes compromised when this offers genuine choice to the consumer. The concept of genuine multi-modality proposed by the Commission should be encouraged, to include such projects as road and rail links to airports, but in a form which does not distort the market. Also, I have concerns that rail transport alone will not be financially or economically feasible in some areas of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, I fear that too prescriptive legislation will needlessly discriminate against some Member States. I feel that the plenary amendments which I have submitted amount to a restoration of fair competition and flexibility which will allow Member States to use the available funding for the most appropriate form of transport to meet their particular circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that EU funding should be restricted to a series of technologically and economically feasible projects from across all modes of transport, which will represent a truly level playing field. Sadly, one of the characteristics which does seem to be common in these projects is the tendency for them to drag on without recourse to reassessment if Member States do not provide the wherewithal to implement them. The regional policy transport and tourism committee has already accepted an amendment to limit the period for any project to no more than 15 years and I would commend this to the House. I cannot emphasise enough that in order to secure the long-term viability of the transeuropean networks, it is imperative that we first ensure the sound management and financial probity of suitable projects.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, I have not been able to support amendments tabled to add further projects to Annex 3 in the light of past experience which, in a sense, has resulted in an auction of promises. It is illogical to spread funding even more thinly when projects are already not keeping to the targets originally agreed. For this same reason, I am proud to say that I have been uncompromising in my position with regard to the financial scrutiny that I feel Parliament has a duty to perform. For example, with regard to the Galileo system, the definitive cost of which has only been approximated, I propose that a regular cost-benefit analysis be undertaken and that Parliament be informed of progress of the project on a regular basis.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I reiterate my belief that a balanced approach to transport across the EU is what is needed, not one aimed at current fashion. This is a very long-term, highly costly programme and Europe's peoples will not thank us if we go down the path of denying them the choice and freedom of transport that they rightly expect. I hope the House will feel able to support this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The ladies and gentlemen in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism are, alas, not as ecologically aware as their colleagues in the Environment Committee, but, after all, one has a bit less of a grasp of things one does not spend that much of one's time dealing with. We are, however, of one mind when it comes to being ready to promote the development of transport links with the countries bordering on the EU and between the EU's Member States, which I consider to be most important in terms of the enlargement of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet the Environment Committee has scored one major success in that the Transport Committee now accepts that the results of the strategic environmental impact assessments should be binding on the actual processes of implementation. Only on the connection between health issues and transport issues are they evidently unwilling to think more deeply. It is the case in all the Member States that transport accidents, above all road traffic accidents, are a major cause of death and serious injury. Air transport contributes significantly to air pollution. A considerable number of people in Europe are exposed to levels of traffic noise which are not only a serious nuisance and a cause of disturbed sleep, but also lead to communication problems and, in children, even to genuinely serious mental disturbance. We are keen to discuss all this in depth, but there was a lack of willingness to take the Environment Committee's opinion that seriously on these points.</p>
<p class="contents">Good things take time, though, and there will no doubt be another opportunity for the Environment Committee to have its say on transport issues. Certainly, nothing in human affairs can be seen only in black and white, and we all know that a very great part of our freedom and our prosperity is tied up with transport – be it by air, on the roads or on rail – but we should be responsible in all that we do.</p>

We agree with the gist of what he is saying, although my approach does differ from that of the rapporteur and that of the European Commission on a number of important points.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unfortunate that in the framework of the TENs, the Commission is opting for the same approach as the White Paper: lots of trains, not much water. The rigid management of European trains makes rail transport as a solution to the congestion in goods transport less likely than we would like to think and hope. Development of the waterways is cheap in terms of investment, and unsurpassed as a solution to the problem of congestion. I, along with a few other MEPs, wanted to make this point and add a few specific, cross-border water projects. The strategy of the two large parties in this Parliament does not allow for this. Although I have been unable to see the point of this strategy to date, I have reconciled myself to it. If the three institutions had all decided against adding any projects, this would have been a logical step.</p>
<p class="contents">It would have been much preferable not to review the annex in its entirety until 2004, by which time the acceding countries could have been taken into account to a greater extent. At the moment, only Parliament, which has nevertheless fought for the right of codecision on this score, will exercise restraint. This will result in a list that is a little one-sided from a geographical point of view. Fortunately, a few amendments, tabled together with the Liberals and the EDD, have been adopted by the groups. They call for alertness on all fronts concerning transport by water as a reasonably cheap solution to congestion.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I am of the opinion<span class="italic"> </span>that it would have been far better for the Gallileo project to be financed from research funds instead of infrastructural funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Savary (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, I should like, first of all, to thank our rapporteur, Mr Bradbourn, who has taken a great deal of trouble to come up with a report which now seems to me to be perfectly acceptable. Naturally we are pleased that the new guidelines being proposed to us for the TENs are moving towards and are in line with the policy of sustainable mobility which was proposed to us in the White Paper. I believe that this cohesion was absolutely necessary and I consider, personally, that the new objectives which have been proposed to us are probably sustainable objectives which will go beyond the other re-focussing phases of these projects.</p>
<p class="contents">We also warmly welcome the six new major specific projects, in particular Galileo. We in this Parliament approved this project with a large majority, and we have seen what an impact it has had. I also warmly welcome, on my own account, the links through the Pyrenees, because it cannot be repeated too often that the Pyrenees pose a problem which is just as acute as the one posed by the Alps. However, this report raises two series of problems. The first problem concerns the definition procedure of Annex III. How can we avoid Parliament becoming a sort of auction of a certain number of local and regional projects, without any budgetary responsibility, which would eventually lead to Parliament being discredited, because of course we all have our favourite projects in our own regions, and in our own towns and villages? Moreover, how can we ensure that these projects are not snatched away and removed from the free will of those who represent the people, in other words Parliament? I do not think that we have settled this question properly, and we shall have to think about it in terms of procedure. For our part, we have decided to support, on a provisional basis, the Annex III proposed by the Commission, but I wish to make it quite clear that I do not consider it to be satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem is that of funding. I believe, Commissioner, that it will be necessary to take a very strong initiative on the question of funding the TENs. In a way we are parading, at European level, a responsibility and an option without resources. When you look at the work that has been carried out, this is not satisfactory. I personally believe that, in addition to the proposals that you will be making to us on the system of charging for the use of the infrastructure, perhaps you could also include the idea of a large loan to finance the TENs and to accelerate their implementation. If you were to launch such an initiative, there are a number of us who would support it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore beyond me why the European Parliament should not be a party to deciding on this list of priority projects. Parliament demanded this at the time of the initial decision in 1996; it now has this opportunity and it is not seizing it. The Commission backed Parliament in 1996, and we are now about to turn down this opportunity, as is happening in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this is beyond me. This is also unacceptable, in my view. This is why my group, with the support of a number of members of other groups, has re-submitted the projects that were turned down in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism – both my projects and those of other fellow MEPs, who have had to withdraw their reports on account of some pressure or other. This is, in my opinion, not sensible and not acceptable. These are reports that originate from different countries, including Italy, France, Great Britain, the Netherlands and Belgium. It is therefore nothing to do with national thinking only. It is my belief that Parliament must take part in the discussions on this list.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to spotlight one project which is of extreme importance to me, as someone from Flanders and Antwerp: the Iron Rhine, the railway connection between the port of Antwerp and the Ruhr area, a railway line which already exists and which therefore does not need to be constructed, and which only needs modernising and re-commissioning. The rapporteur states in his report that connections between ports and their hinterland, between water and rail, are important. The Iron Rhine is one such case. In its White Paper, the Commission states that we should promote the railways, that we should start re-using abandoned infrastructure and using lines that are specifically intended for goods transport by rail, and that we should tackle the difficulties at border crossings, as these constitute the pressure points. The Iron Rhine project meets all these conditions, that are listed in the report and in the Commission’s White Paper. It is a project that is relatively cheap from a budgetary point of view, because the railway lines are already in place. It is a project that adds enormous value, because it can also provide some relief for the East-West line and can therefore combat congestion. I would therefore find it incomprehensible if the European Parliament were not to take part in this discussion and if it were not to table this, and other, projects. I am not saying that we should have the last word, but we have to engage in the discussion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we have had up to now, though, has been the absence of any planning and the realisation of outdated projects in national interests, backed up by cost and benefit analyses of dubious value. Even now, the Commission paper is not free of these things. The EU does not exist to provide things on national wishlists, but has a macro-economic responsibility, primarily to sustainable mobility and environmentally-friendly means of transport, above all railways, for the future belongs to them. It is imperative that planning should be compatible with EU policies on such things as protection of the environment. So I again urge that planning with regard to trans-European transport networks should at last leave the corridor approach behind, moving on instead to the regional approach, meaning that we plan with reference to a particular goal and in terms of what we want to achieve, and then check what is the best and most sustainable solution, one that will still work for the generations to come.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the river improvements in particular, the attempt to build gigantic tubs in Europe is something I find questionable, as rivers have another function in terms of people's living space, tourism, and the natural environment. I again underline the fact that ships need to be made more flexible, that is, smaller flat-bottomed vessels should be used more for short-term, flexible, and hence intermodal transport in preference to major improvements being made to rivers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore agree with the proposal from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy favouring railways and other less polluting methods of transport and which also proposes combined transport solutions more clearly than the proposal from the main rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the plans agreed at the Essen European Council, which were included in the White Paper, there is one, perhaps the most ambitious and most expensive, which is the plan for the interoperability of the Iberian high-speed rail network, which may take up half of the budget. Although we advocate promoting conventional networks, this project is on the table, and it is perhaps regrettable, Mr President, that in the route from Madrid to Valencia via Cuenca, it was not planned to pass through Teruel. I am well aware that projects are agreed upon and that it is very difficult to establish some stops, but the institutions in Aragon considered it to be viable according to a study by experts and it would favour a region that is in chronic decline and is suffering from chronic depopulation that has led to the residents forming a non-governmental organisation called 'Teruel exists'.</p>
<p class="contents">The report on transport policy by our colleague Juan de Dios Izquierdo, in 2001, pointed out that transport policy should contribute to the economic and social cohesion of the peripheral or sparsely populated regions. We therefore regret that this branch was not taken into consideration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Six years ago, this Parliament called for participation in respect of the composition of the list of priority TENs projects. The fact that this was impossible at the time led to great indignation. There is now cause for surprise – surprise at the fact that it now appears that this Parliament no longer wants this participation, although this possibility is now formally in place.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to restore the necessary consistency, I, along with the Liberal group, have tabled a number of amendments in order to make use of this opportunity to participate. In this way, we can offer the Council a counterbalance when it fine-tunes Annex III, entirely in line with the set-up of six years ago. If we fail to reach agreement on this, it will be more sensible to take the time to reconsider the situation and to delay the discussion on the TENs projects until the wholesale review of the list in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important area of attention is the implementation of the Trans-European Networks, particularly with regard to the environmental pre-conditions within which this is supposed to take place. The approach which the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has maintained in this connection is the correct one. However, ambiguity has crept into the proposals with regard to the functioning of Directive 2001/42/EC. This directive allocates certain tasks relating to environmental impact reports to the Member States. In Amendment No 20, the Commission is being allocated the same tasks. This seems to be a waste of effort and resources to us. The good cause is not served by duplication. The distribution of tasks must be clear. This is why I have tabled four amendments in order to avoid these duplications. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We welcome the harmony this first revision establishes with the White Paper guidelines, in an attempt to achieve vital consistency with strategic objectives and intervention priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, as has been pointed out by, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, the rapporteur, we would stress the appropriateness of an intervention that targets bottlenecks, that gives priority to actions that can deliver intermodal transport and restore balance between the different modes of transport. Road transport must not be penalised as long as no credible alternatives exist, but transport by rail and water must certainly be given a boost and we endorse action to this end.</p>
<p class="contents">We are, of course, concerned that the list of projects does not enjoy adequate financial backing. When there is such a big discrepancy between the number of projects and funding, there is a risk that some projects will, in practice, be plundered to the benefit of others. This is why, along with our desire to see the north-south axis priority maintained, we would warn against repercussions such as the necessary intervention on the west-east axis north of the Alps on the Stuttgart-Vienna axis becoming an alternative to the Lyons-Trieste axis south of the Alps.</p>
<p class="contents">I would conclude with a more general observation: we all eagerly await the 2004 review. This is why some of us have chosen not to have the list of Annex III interventions brought before Parliament, despite the fact that we do not endorse a method that has excluded Parliament. Next time we should have a proper preparatory inquiry that enhances the role of Parliament, which cannot run the risk of being downgraded to suit market demands, and unilateral management by the Commission and the Council is no guarantee of quality when selecting interventions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are dealing today with a slight reworking of the TENs. The really major revision will be in 2004, when we will certainly put our heads together and draw up sensible amendments for them. Thanks are due to the rapporteur for the work he has done, but also for the unsparing conclusion he draws. What is crucial is that, of the fourteen Essen projects, three have been completed, which means that the Council had at that time bitten off more than it could chew. Not listening to Parliament, it was guided by obstinacy rather than wisdom. Nobody, not even Parliament, can lay down the law to a Member State when it comes to when and where this or that project is to be put into effect. But, when a Member State says that it wants to have a project certified as being of European Community interest, then that Member State must comply with European conditions. That is why the rapporteur's proposal – that, if a project is not completed within a specified time, it is taken off the priority list – is very good.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal by the Commission is realistic and sensible. It deals with environmentally friendly forms of transport, and, so, tomorrow, we should support it accordingly. I can tell the Council that they would be well advised not to conjure up any conflict between the institutions on this point. It would not be worth it, as we have already made a whole series of changes to the TENs. That means that we should work together well...</p>

<p class="contents">Out of the fourteen projects that were agreed as priorities at the Essen European Council in 1996, so far only three have been completed. Among the projects that I really wish to see is the Southern high-speed rail network between Madrid, Vitoria and Dax, which is still in the project design phase. Given the limitations of Community resources, I think that it is advisable to postpone incorporating any new priority projects until the first ones have been completed, and to wait until the guidelines are reviewed when enlargement to new Member States takes place. I also propose, as I state in my amendments, that the high-speed rail network can be achieved not only through building new lines but also by improving the condition of existing lines, in order to prevent further impacts on the countryside and the surrounding environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The trans-European networks, are, unfortunately, in many cases, still only works on paper, and not even beautiful ones – simply a load of coloured lines on the map of the EU, numbered in sequence, running across Europe in every direction. The problem is that the many coloured lines do not always represent a modern, fully operational transport infrastructure of trams, waterways, and air routes. The network resembles the parts of a rag rug. Looked at from that angle, it is good and necessary that the Commission wants to do some repairs and so attaches primary importance to the transport facilities having greater and better interoperability and intermodality and intends to see to it that the candidate countries are better interconnected, tied in and involved.</p>
<p class="contents">What is less edifying about this business is the way that Parliament has still not been satisfactorily involved in the decision-making structures, and it is utterly inappropriate that a number of Members, belonging to different groups, should push themselves forward in a sort of free-for-all motivated by the self-serving desire to gain standing in the eyes of the voters back home. Let us hope that the Commission's programme for a real revision of the TENs in 2004 is kept to, and let us see it as being of great importance that Parliament be involved, fully and in good time, when the time comes. What the Commission has submitted is a good intermediate step for the moment that is now upon us. We should indeed follow the rapporteur in the position he has taken and, apart from a few small corrections, support this intermediate step. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This explains some of the things that I am going to say later, but it should also show us that the limited resources that we have should be focused more clearly on political objectives so that they can be used as a platform to speed up national funding, whether public or private, and to speed up completion of the projects, which, I would like to remind you, are in the Community interest due to their association with the establishment of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">The priorities are: firstly, re-establishing a balance between modes of transport, and therefore promoting intermodal transport, which is one of its corollaries. Secondly, releasing bottlenecks, which would enable us, with a smaller investment, to have a greater impact on increasing capacity and improving the functioning of the whole system. Thirdly, taking into account the Commission’s priority, which is enlargement, which is going to be the most decisive priority and political factor in the years to come, not just now, as we prepare for enlargement, but when it actually takes place.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate Mr Bradbourn on his report, on its quality and on the rigorous work that he has done, which I hope will enable this review of guidelines to be quickly adopted. I stress that it is an interim review, as the major review, with the plans and maps, is to take place in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The need to push forward these trans-European networks is a concern shared by the Heads of State and Government, which was expressed at the Barcelona European Council only a few months ago, and it has been asked that this text be adopted both in Parliament and in the Council before December 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the report that you are examining supports the modification of Annex III. I wish to point out that practically all of the projects in Annex III were already among the trans-European networks in 1996, or had been requested by the European Parliament, and what is happening now is that they are being given priority. Annex III updates the list from 1994, the Essen projects, and I have particularly appreciated the rigour shown by the majority of the members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism when dealing with this part of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">More than half of the amendments suggested by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism are very good proposals which improve the Commission’s proposal and reinforce the priorities set out in the White Paper, whether aimed at promoting short-distance sea transport, inland waterway transport or integrating those systems with rail transport. The Commission can therefore accept them in principle, in part, or with changes to the way that they are worded.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, some amendments that present problems to the Commission, and it is these that I am mainly going to discuss. They are Amendments Nos 53 to 56 and 61 to 66 that seek to modify Annex III. Their adoption would in fact mean considering a very wide range of projects as a priority at Community level, projects that the Commission does not have sufficient information about in terms of their added value for Europe or of their possible interest for the Member States concerned, and it should be remembered that in such matters we always need the support of the Member States. The Commission cannot therefore accept these amendments, and I welcome the fact that the rapporteur and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism cannot accept them either.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to discuss the amendments regarding the strategic environmental assessment of the network. In 1996, when the Decision that we are seeking to modify today was adopted, this issue was discussed at length. Therefore, despite what Mrs Fleming said, the Commission cannot accept the part of Amendment No 20 or Amendments Nos 40, 41, 42 and 43, which give the Commission the responsibility of conducting strategic environmental assessments, when European legislation in the Directive adopted in 2001 establishes that the task is the responsibility of the Member States. The Commission cannot replace the Member States in fulfilling their obligations. That is a basic principle, so the Member States should not shirk their responsibilities and try to pass on any responsibilities to us that they may not fulfil.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community could, however, contribute by providing added value, for example through supporting the development of assessment methods. We are therefore prepared to partially accept Amendment No 20, but only the part that proposes continuing the development of those assessment methods.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also unable to support amendments that again call into question the objective of re-establishing a balance between new modes of transport and Community financial instruments. These are Amendments Nos 9, 31, 33, 35 to 39, 45, 52 and 57.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Galileo, we cannot keep doing cost-benefit analyses every year, and as you are aware, the studies that I am referring to have been conducted by various consultants. We cannot therefore accept Amendment No 10.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Commission could never agree to include reducing the demand for transport among the objectives of the trans-European network. I am very sorry, this is not my responsibility as Transport Commissioner, nor is it that of the trans-European networks, and besides, no European Council has ever said that what we want to do is to reduce demand for transport. This is not the idea, and it is something quite different to separate the increase in demand from economic growth. Achieving this would represent a major step forward, and we are working on it. Amendments Nos 12 and 34 go further in the definition of environmentally viable transport than that established at the Gothenburg European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Many amendments regarding the priorities for Community action in Article 5 present certain problems for the Commission, Amendments Nos 13, 49, 15, 21, 17, 27 and 18 are rejected by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to defining the network of navigable routes, I agree with Mrs Peijs on the importance of navigable routes, and we are conducting very important initiatives. One of the projects that we have included concerns improving the link between the Danube system and the Rhine-Rhône system. The trouble is that there is a small problem, because there are not, unfortunately, navigable rivers in all the countries of the European Union or in all the areas of the European Union. It would be much more viable if there were navigable rivers across the whole of the European Union. I know a country very well in which, unfortunately, we do not have those rivers, and we are very envious when we see them in other countries, not only because of how beautiful they are, but also because of the possibilities that they offer for transport. We do have other things, but we do not have such large rivers.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, what I want to say is that the Commission supports the idea of including 'River Information Systems', but we cannot commit ourselves to putting forward a plan to develop them, as unlike the railways, the river system does not have a Community interoperability regulation. However, I wish to say to Mrs Peijs that as a result of her suggestions I am going to discuss with the Commission services whether progress can be made on these issues, as it would be of interest to do so. In short, I cannot make a commitment. I want to see the cost-benefit analysis and the possibilities, and, if it is feasible, in time I will also make a proposal for interoperability in the river navigation systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither can we accept Amendments Nos 25 and 26 because we do not wish to alter the maps of proposed internal ports. Finally, I would like to say that I fully understand Amendments Nos 29, 30 and 46, which seek to withdraw from the list of priority projects in Annex III those which have still not been completed after fifteen years. I fully understand them, and they would make sense, but there is a problem, very often these projects, which are of trans-European interest, are put forward by the Commission, and the Member States accept them, but show very little interest.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not wish to give examples, but we can all think of them. If the possibility offered by these amendments existed, some Member States would use it when a project that is very important for the Union is of little national interest. It would be different if we were always talking about projects of national interest. Then it would make sense to have a period of 15 years or even 10 years, but these are projects of Community interest, and, I stress, often the countries concerned only have a very relative interest. We therefore have to reject these amendments and Amendments Nos 44 and 50, which prejudge the content of the next review of the guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 59 and 60, which eliminate or modify the maps of the trans-European network attached to the proposal for a decision, as those maps are used by both the Commission and the Member States. This is what was proposed by Mr Sterckx, among others, as I already mentioned. In the same way, Amendments Nos 47 and 58 cannot be accepted, as they interfere with the justification of the projects in Annex III or with the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to answer the question asked by Mr Savary regarding the funds being insufficient. I think that this will have to be discussed along with the new financial perspectives. Here we are focusing the funds more, but not increasing the funds allocated. By focusing the funds what we are doing is acknowledging that we are contributing more due to the strong Community interest of the projects. It is true that some countries may have more interest in a specific project. More in-depth consideration would in my opinion bring us to the conclusion that we need to allocate more to the trans-European networks, precisely in order to favour the creation of infrastructures that will benefit the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind Mr Watts, who I regret has just left the Chamber, that the fact that a project is in European interests is mainly to attract the attention of the countries where the project is being conducted, as the co-financing that we provide is only partial. It is a system for providing incentives for the countries where the project is being conducted. Ultimately, the specific project that is selected and subsidised is decided upon in the financing committee for the trans-European networks, in which all the countries are represented and in which there is no leaning towards financing a specific country but rather the process is conducted in a balanced manner, taking into account Community interests.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism as a whole, which has worked hard and effectively on this issue. The adoption of this text, I hope without any delays, will enable us to focus Community action on the essential matters set out in the White Paper, providing coherence for the whole transport policy. It will also enable us to prepare, under the best possible conditions, a second review of the guidelines, which I hope the Commission will put to Parliament in 2004. What we need to do is to continue with the effort of focusing on the main corridors, including the sea corridors, and to integrate the priority projects of the future new Member States of the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
