<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barrot,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission. </span><span class="italic"></span><span class="italic"> (FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during conciliation on the ‘Single European Sky’ package, Parliament stressed the need to balance the various parts of the package so as to tackle the institutional, economic and technical aspects while developing a genuine social side. The Commission agreed to provide a proposal for a Community air traffic controller licence quickly. You are debating that Community licence today.</p>
<p class="contents">This Commission proposal for a directive has three objectives. First, like Parliament, the Commission believes it is very important that the various elements of the ‘single sky’ package should be developed in a balanced manner. This proposal is a key part of the social pillar. That is why the social partners were closely involved in preparing the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The second objective, the reason why we proposed introducing a Community controller licence, has to do with safety. This common licence will make it possible to improve the safety of air traffic management by raising the standards of controller training. Moreover, the proposal also allows us to identify and, if appropriate, adopt the Eurocontrol safety regulatory requirements concerning the training of controllers in order to transpose them into Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">The third objective is that the ‘single sky’ legislation will establish cross-border functional airspace blocks in order to reduce the fragmentation of air space. The licence will make it easier to organise these services either side of the borders and will contribute to labour mobility in the field of air traffic control.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us turn now to the means used to meet these three objectives. To put an end to the present diversity of national rules, the proposal for a directive introduces high Community standards for the full range of skills that are essential for safety. This means in particular the conditions for entry to the profession, the structure of qualifications, the endorsements, the content of initial controller training and linguistic ability, both in English and in the mother tongue. This problem of language rules was certainly one of the most sensitive points during the talks in the Council. The Commission has based itself on already accepted international standards. The proposal’s added value is therefore not so much the drawing up of those standards as their introduction into a Community framework that will enable them to be applied in a truly harmonised manner. I am in particular expecting a lot from the certification of training providers, which offers a sound guarantee for the issue of a high level licence.</p>
<p class="contents">As I am sure you know, the Council’s work has made good progress and a general approach was adopted at the ‘Transport’ Council on 9 December last. That approach respects the logic of our proposal and I will say that it clarifies our proposal in a number of places or else strengthens it, especially where the practicalities of management are concerned, with a view to the better management of mutual recognition, for example, or to applying the directive to current licence holders. Incidentally, Mr Schmitt, I note that most of your amendments relate to the same subjects as those raised by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the adoption of this report is a step towards convergence between the positions of Parliament and the Council. I have the impression that the Council is ready to examine with you the reconciliations necessary in order to facilitate the early adoption of this text, and I confirm to you that the report is very much on the same wavelength concerning the most delicate point, namely the language rules. The proposals in Mr Schmitt’s report are a balanced reconciliation between legitimate safety concerns and the mobility and free movement of controllers. That is why, Mr President, the Commission is awaiting Parliament’s position on this matter with confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mr Schmitt again and to say how much this air traffic controller licence will enable us to move forwards into a single sky that is safer for all Europeans. That is why I am confident that Parliament will help us to take this constructive measure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For that reason we should try to complete work, as soon as possible, on a joint directive that can then enter into force.</p>
<p class="contents">It is still a characteristic of the European situation that European airspace belongs to those who are most overburdened on a global scale. On the one hand, the high level of traffic occurs, not in a flexible space, but rather in a fragmented European sky; the Member States’ air traffic control systems are still often not mutually compatible. Individual states often retain their own rules, regulations, procedures and performance standards. It was this, just over two years ago, that led the Commission and Parliament, under the slogan of the ‘Single European Sky’, to introduce four packages of measures aimed at doing away, once and for all, with this fragmentation in the sky above Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">At the time, my response to all this was rather cautious, for it was unfortunately impossible for the Council to fully implement all the things in this package of measures that Parliament had thought up and asked for. Right now, though, we can be confident that the Member States – at least where the issue of cross-border blocks of airspace is concerned – are evidently prepared to accommodate each other, so that it may well be possible to create a single airspace in Europe within the foreseeable future.</p>
<p class="contents">At that time, we also – as you said – put on the agenda more things that we wanted the four regulations to do, it having become apparent from discussions at the time that there were many incompatibilities in the field of air traffic control, whether the hardware, the technology, or even the actual services performed by air traffic controllers. That is all the more astonishing when one considers that many of the preconditions and standards have been made the subject of international rules by the ICAO or by Eurocontrol. Despite that, there exists in almost all the Member States a variety of regulations, with the consequence that individual air traffic controllers’ licences are not compatible. That is why I believe this harmonisation to be urgently necessary, and that there are three things it will enable us to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">Even greater safety is, in any case, worth working towards, and that we will achieve by standardising training and in-service training – with high standards, of course. As you yourself said, one fundamental issue in this is language skills, which are not, at present, guaranteed in every area. You also stressed a second point, that being the issue of who is to provide the training, of how people are to be tested and certified; in future, an independent body will be able to examine their performance in terms of how good the training is and how well it enables the air traffic controllers learning there to do their jobs later on.</p>
<p class="contents">A third point, and one that I regard as far from secondary, is that air traffic controllers are, to this day, as a rule barred from pursuing their occupation if they were trained in another Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">I regard all three of these points as important, and we should therefore implement them as soon as possible. If I am right in my judgment, this is not a matter of dispute. Such was, in any case, the impression I got from the competent specialist committee, which adopted my report by a large majority. It is also clear from conversations with Members that there is scarcely dissent, except – as always – on minor points with the Council, but I am confident that we will agree on a joint regulation as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank all the Members of the House who have contributed helpful proposals, suggestions, or criticisms to this or that aspect of this report, enabling us, overall, to come to a result with which we, together in this House, will be able to take a positive decision.</p>

<p class="contents">It is therefore hardly surprising that we can identify wholeheartedly with the work he has done as rapporteur for what we have before us today. We are grateful to him for his essential contribution to making what we hope is a further improved text out of one from the Commission that was already good. According to what we have heard, there are actually very good indications that the Council will go along with it, so that all three institutions will be in this together. In the committee, as has already been pointed out, we were largely unanimous in favouring a high level of awareness of responsibility and competence, and in stating more precisely what these general requirements would mean in a range of specific applications.</p>
<p class="contents">Reference has already been made to one important aspect of this topic, that being the issue of language skills, particularly where English is concerned. In the past, there have been all too many tragic instances of deficient communications being the actual cause of grave calamities.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the rapporteur and – indirectly – the Commission have already observed that the outcome in the committee was almost unanimous. This was not so much an expression of our not regarding this report as important as of our having indeed having come to what was largely a consensus – a consensus that we want to see emphasised by as solidly united a vote as possible in the plenary, which will enable us to take a substantial step closer to the single European sky about which we hear so much said. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The directive on the air traffic controllers’ licence is a significant step towards the realisation of our great goal of a single European sky. For a start, the creation of functional airspace blocks across borders is dependent on it. Secondly, there is now a presumption of harmonised licensing and training at a high level in this area, which also makes air traffic controllers more mobile, something that is urgently needed in view of the fact that Europe is short of some 1 500 of them. Thirdly, standardised rules and regulations at a high level help to improve safety to a marked degree.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say at this point how glad I am that the rapporteur has taken on board my idea of implementing harmonised training in crisis management techniques. This will make us better prepared for extreme and dangerous situations such as the hijacking of aircraft.</p>
<p class="contents">What we see as important as regards increased mobility is that we should be able to reduce excessively stringent requirements as regards local languages – and here I am not talking about English – to justifiable individual instances. This is the only way in which we will be able to prevent market foreclosure through the back door. We Social Democrats also take the trade unions’ concerns seriously, and that is why we want explicit mention in the directive of social dialogue. Particularly in view of the heated debate on the services directive, we also see it as important that the host country principle should apply to air traffic controllers; firstly, as a means of preventing social dumping, and secondly, in order to enable the controllers to work together as a team without that being undermined. Now more than ever, being an air traffic controller is an attractive career, and one that can take you all over Europe, and I hope that it will be one on which even more young people will decide than they have done in the past. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are a few more points, of great importance to me in this context, that I would like to mention. One is the issue of how we prevent social dumping; it has been apparent from the dialogue as a whole that we agree that this is something we cannot afford in an area in which the safety requirements are so stringent.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we all attach great importance to training and safety, and here there is a need for more training on how to deal with extraordinary situations, such as hijacks and the like, in a job where people can be under extreme pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point is that I too thought it important that the follow-up to this directive must cover, step by step, the staff right down the safety chain with any involvement in the decision-making process, for this is where there must be harmonisation across the board and where mobility must be ensured.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, I would like to say something else about languages, one of the most interesting and most vigorously debated issues, where the impression was sometimes created that what it was about was not so much the mastery of the host state’s language, but rather the establishment of obstacles by way of the back door. To that I would say that creating obstacles of this sort in this area would be to set up the wrong benchmark. We have to ensure excellence in the use of the English language, and that is what this directive ensures. I thank all Members of the House for their good cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On the whole, though, one has to be honest and say that harmonisation, Mr Schmitt’s chosen approach, is entirely in line with our thinking, for, at the end of the day, harmonisation can be an overall goal for the European Union, no matter in what area. If harmonisation proves successful in certain political fields, if we manage to bring about the same conditions, that cannot do other than improve social standards and safety in every instance, and consequently bring about fairer competition among ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">It is down this road that the rapporteur has gone, while of course incorporating certain other things, two of which I would like to highlight. The first – and as the previous speaker has already said – has to do with the flight controllers, where we said ‘no’ and contended that the law of the country in which the flight controllers perform their services must apply.</p>
<p class="contents">I have come to know Mrs Lichtenberger too well to be surprised by what she said to the effect that social dumping must not be allowed under any circumstances to gain a foothold in this area. There must be no place for social dumping anywhere! If we make that the principle for this directive, we also have a good chance of making general changes to the services directive, and of doing away with the country of origin principle, which really does lead to social dumping and the erosion of the law.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point that is of course of equal interest to me as rapporteur on the monitoring of road transport is Mr Schmitt’s proposal for a mandatory and standardised or harmonised list of penalties. I very much hope that we can get this past the Council, for that is precisely what we need on the roads.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not acceptable that different Member States should, to some degree, treat different offences as more or less significant. This is where I regard harmonisation within the European Union as urgently necessary, and so I hope you manage to get it accepted. I will get my turn a bit later with the second reading of my report, and that of course increases the likelihood that I will achieve it too with my report. Once again, then, many thanks to the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

English is already the language of air control. One of the entry requirements to train at Eurocontrol is a good knowledge of English, the international language of aviation. These proposals lessen the requirement to speak English across air traffic control. Amendment 17 says: ‘Member States <span class="italic">may </span>require level 5 of the ICAO proficiency test in English and/or the local language’. ‘Or’ means ‘or’ in any language. That threatens safety. The report contains phrases such as: ‘the right of Member States to develop national endorsements should only apply in exceptional cases’. That is not English, it is EU gobbledegook. World airlines fear the EU’s costly desire to switch air control from radar to Galileo, but the EU’s air control agenda is not really about airways, it is about EU control and control for the sake of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We cannot afford to be indifferent or to allow any slackness in procedures and measures in this field, given that any problem could pose a threat to human life and health. I therefore believe that this directive is necessary, and indeed essential.</p>
<p class="contents">If the sky above us is to be treated as a Single European Sky, then precise and clear legal regulations are needed. These regulations must also cover air traffic controller licences, because the work of air traffic controllers must meet the highest possible standards of responsibility and professionalism. As well as specialised training for work under normal conditions, which we all hope will always prevail, it is important that training be provided for any exceptional situations or crises that could arise. Air traffic controllers must therefore be people with a great deal of theoretical knowledge and extensive practical skills. They must be in excellent physical and mental health, which means that regular check-ups are necessary, and they must be people who can remain calm and in control even in exceptional situations, such as crashes and terrorist attacks, as mentioned by the previous speakers. With regard to knowledge of languages, air traffic controllers obviously need a very good knowledge of English, the common language, yet they should also be fluent in the local language, as this would be particularly important in a crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that these regulations should also provide for some kind of feedback, or systematic monitoring of the impact of the legislation, as well as for the adoption of any amendments that become necessary, particularly with regard to developments in electronic and digital technology.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to the rapporteur, Mr Schmitt, for the effort he has put into dealing with this issue. I say this<span class="bold"> </span>as someone who has helped train Polish civil pilots, as until recently this was my job at the Rzeszow University of Technology. I also believe it would be a good idea if EU legislation on such an important matter were to be adopted and respected outside the European Union. There are no artificial borders in the sky, and the laws of aeromechanics apply everywhere. The principles of aviation safety should therefore be enforced throughout the world, and the European Union may well be able to help ensure that this is the case. Many thanks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mindful that managing a complex air transport system and air traffic control system must be seen from a broader global perspective, which encompasses not only air traffic management systems (ATM) but also airlines and airports, we note that this directive will complete an important aspect of the single European sky, namely the harmonisation of rules relating to the issuing of training licences for air traffic controllers in the European area. This will in turn improve their mobility and facilitate the work of cross-border airspace control services.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to clarify the legal situation as regards licences issued by the Member States under national law prior to the new directive’s entry into force; the necessary legal certainty must be provided and the directive must not be applied retrospectively. Hence the importance of the adoption in committee of an amendment covering this aspect, which will hopefully be adopted in plenary with the adoption of this report.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also pleased about the reference made by the rapporteur, whom I take this opportunity to congratulate on his excellent report, to the fact that, following discussions with interest groups, he was able to conclude that both workers and the industry – the Commissioner referred to this – not only consent to the introduction of a harmonised Community air traffic controller licence, but even welcome it. This also confirms that neither the economic aspects, nor, more importantly, the social aspects of the European single sky, including vocational training, have been overlooked by the Commission or by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I now hope that, when it is put into practice by the Member States, this initiative fully achieves all the objectives for which it was created and that it constitutes a practical opportunity to enhance the effectiveness of ATM services and of air transport safety for the benefit of its users, which, ultimately, we all are. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At last we have a text of very great quality, and the work of amendment done in committee makes an important parliamentary contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a text that flows naturally from the work we did during the last parliamentary term, that is to say on the establishment of the single European sky, and this social dimension was absolutely essential because we are dealing with a public safety service that is first of all a manpower service. The quality of air traffic control and of air navigation depends on the men and their qualifications, and its quality is of course its high level of safety.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the text meets all these requirements. I do not know what the outcome of the vote will be tomorrow, but it seems to me that it represents rather the anti-Bolkestein approach. It is an exercise in Community regulation. It is an exercise in harmonised regulation. It is an exercise in mutual recognition, with extremely detailed work on certification, endorsements and mutual recognition. From that point of view, I am very pleased with it.</p>
<p class="contents">From this perspective, Amendment 20, which wants it made clear that air traffic controllers will be subject to the social jurisdiction of the country where they work, is quite crucial. It will be the explicit confirmation of what we all want, that is to say harmonisation, not social dumping.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we are again presenting Amendment 22 on the sectoral social dialogue. I know that some of our fellow Members say that goes without saying. However, we think it is even better to say it, especially since the Single Sky Committee has not agreed to include workers’ representatives, which is quite crucial for the quality of the service in this field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do in fact believe this report is a very encouraging report and, once again, I want to add my voice to the praise and thanks that have been addressed to the rapporteur of the Committee on Transport and Tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">I now have to speak on the amendments. I am not going to review them individually, Mr President. With your permission, I would prefer to take them in groups. Most of the amendments seek to clarify the text of the proposal for a directive and to highlight safety, because safety really is this text’s absolute priority, or to introduce continuation training in the realm of safety. Such is the case with Amendments 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13 and 15. The Commission is therefore able to accept all these amendments. The same goes for Amendment 16, which tightens the conditions for the introduction of national endorsements, and for Amendment 18, which seeks to simplify administrative burdens.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will be able to back your position on the language rules, which in a balanced way reconciles legitimate safety concerns and the rights of free movement of controllers; your Amendments 10 and 17 bring about genuine convergence between the positions of Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of other amendments are acceptable in principle provided their wording is amended slightly. The Commission fully supports the principle of Amendment 6 concerning monitoring by the social partners and involving and consulting them. I have already stressed this point in my first speech. So far as Amendment 14 is concerned, the Commission accepts the idea of greater training in safety, but believes it would be better to deal with this in Annex I, which specifies the content of training.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the amendment that introduces the reference to the law of the place of work in the case of mobility. I fully understand the logic behind Amendment 20. The legal basis for such a proposal is nevertheless safety, and that objective is pursued through the establishment of standards for the essential conditions in the matter. As Mr Savary has pointed out, there is already Community law on this subject. The Worker Secondment Directive does in fact provide that the conditions of the place of work shall apply in the case of secondment. That is why, instead of an article that is alien to the purpose of the text, the Commission would be willing to accept a recital making explicit reference to relevant Community law, as you have asked for.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have just said, to confirm the importance of involving the social partners in implementing and monitoring this directive, especially in support of Amendment 6, I propose that such a reference to the social law applicable be included in a recital. In other words, this text, which is essentially about safety, is located in the context of a Community social law that can well be referred to in the recitals.</p>
<p class="contents">That leaves us with three amendments that the Commission is not able to support, for formal reasons in particular. Firstly, the Commission believes it is unnecessary to retain the requirement for accounts complying with international standards, as Amendment 19 asks for. The providers of continuation training, that is the suppliers of air traffic control services, are already covered by other Community regulations, and such a requirement seems to us to be excessive for small training providers. The Commission is therefore able to agree to a complete deletion of the paragraph concerned, your concern for sound management already being covered by other sources of Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendment 21 on the structure of penalties, the Commission prefers to keep the standard formula as it also appears in the general approach adopted by the Council. There is also Amendment 4, which touches on a very important aspect of the introduction of a licence: what should be done with holders of national licences? In our view, the solution is not to defer the introduction of the new harmonised standards or to have two parallel standards of competence existing side by side. Quite honestly, that would not be good for safety. That is why the Commission is unable to back this proposed amendment. Having said that, it is open to any solution that is conducive to the rapid introduction of the standards of competence, while of course respecting the obligations of legal certainty for current licence holders.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 22 was tabled just before the plenary session. As I mentioned earlier, the Commission supports the consultation and involvement of the social partners; they are essential. To be more precise, however, it does not believe it is essential for such an obligation to appear in this text.</p>
<p class="contents">There we are, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is in broad agreement with your work. The Commission is genuinely able to give its full support to Mr Schmitt’s report and I would like to add that the Commission’s and Parliament’s positions are really very close. The constructive nature of Mr Schmitt’s report really must be emphasised and, as I believe Mr Rack said just now, while the initial proposal was a good one, the text is even better. Yes, it is true, the text is even better, proving once again the importance of Parliament’s work as co-legislator.</p>
<p class="contents">If you validate this approach in tomorrow’s vote, I therefore believe we will have made progress towards achieving the objectives we have all set ourselves: that is, seeking even greater safety in the field of air traffic control. That is what Europe’s citizens are expecting of us, and it is all the more necessary if we want air traffic to develop in the direction of a very high service quality, with, in particular, a level of safety that should make the European sky probably the safest sky in the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
