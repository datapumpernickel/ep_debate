We know, for example, that nowadays a four-stroke lawn mower emits exactly as much in an hour as a car in European category 4 travelling at 150 kilometres per hour. Or we know that, on some days in June this year, 40% of carbon monoxide emissions originated from these mobile machines, 40% of the ozone precursors. That is why we have to do something about this.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed directive is all right in so far as it goes, but we made a number of critical observations in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. One point was that we wanted to move the timetable forward a bit, in much the same way as legislation in the United States takes place. We wanted to see if the 'averaging and banking' model was perhaps after all unjustifiable in European terms, being something of a bureaucratic monster that would be hard to keep a check on in Europe and which, to that extent, would tell us little about whether we could achieve the reductions we were aiming for. We tackled this issue very ambitiously in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. As the decision was made in July – in other words, quite some time ago – we were able to negotiate with the Council about this legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I can now present a compromise package which the Council is prepared to accept by a large majority, if not unanimously. It is my opinion that we should in this case go down this route and complete the legislation in its entirety in one reading. On the one hand, that would help take the burden off the bureaucratic processes here in the European Parliament and in the Council, and on the other would also, of course, help the environment if the legislation could enter into force more quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">What is this compromise about? Firstly, we want to move the date of entry into force forward for certain categories. It is about midway between what was decided by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and what was proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we want to dispense with the 'averaging and banking' system because of the bureaucratic difficulties involved in it. In order, however, that environmental legislation should not produce distortions in competition which are not justified in terms of environmental policy, we want to make exceptions possible for small manufacturers producing 25 000 units per annum, and we also want certain products, the SH2 and SH3 machines, to be subject to transitional rules for a period of five years, for example certain chain saws used high up in trees or certain two-stroke motors that drive drills. That is contained in Amendment No 30, so that these machines can be granted extra time – something which, incidentally, corresponds to what industry too has suggested. I cannot therefore go down the road of excluding certain machines from the directive altogether, but I will say: let us give these machines more time if this is justified on technical grounds.</p>
<p class="contents">I would again remind you how, when we were very ambitious in legislating for cars in categories 3 and 4, we ended up in the Conciliation Committee reaching a reasonable compromise which, of course, met with little approval from the industry at first but which in the final analysis is now appreciated by everybody, because it improves air quality in Europe. I think that the compromise package that I am able to present to you today points in the same direction, the only difference being that it is on the table already and not only after a conciliation procedure. In this respect, what lies before us on the table today is not a ‘chain saw massacre’, which one newspaper called it but, rather, a durable compromise to improve air quality in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Goodwill (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, a rhetorical question often rhetorically asked is: which came first, the chicken or the egg? In the case of new clean air technology, it is usually the case that government must first lay the legislative egg from which is hatched the technology to give us cleaner cars or lorries.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of this report, however, the situation is reversed, because in the main the technology is available to clean up the small engines which, as Mr Lange says, can produce more pollution in one hour than a car travelling 150 km. In many cases cost is the only reason for which we do not have cleaner engines already. In fact, Honda can produce overhead valve four-stroke engines that easily meet these requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are some important exceptions to this general rule. I am pleased that Mr Lange has withdrawn his suggestion that the small-producer exemption should be set at 10 000 units per year – which would not have covered any European manufacturers – and supported the Commission's position of 25 000, which covers 7 manufacturers.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we have some particular problems with this piece of legislation, and in particular with chainsaws and the like. These are machines which have to be light because they are carried by people; they cannot be hot, to avoid burning the user; and they have to be multi-positional – in other words they have to work when upside down. For those particular uses, two-stroke technology is the only viable option. We remember seeing those Trabants and Wartburgs coming across East Berlin; these types of two-stroke engines are dirtier but, in the case of chainsaws, there is no alternative.</p>
<p class="contents">The solution put forward by the Commission is to use a system of averaging and banking, whereby dirty engines can be set off against clean engines and clean technology can be saved up for the next year and used to produce some dirty engines the following year. I do not like this system. In many ways it is dishonest, because people will be buying engines which they think meet the regulations, when in fact they are dirtier. Only the big manufacturers who produce a wide range of engines can benefit from this. This system should not be supported.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we need protection for these particular applications and that is why I have tabled my amendment – No 29 – giving a detailed list of exemptions: strimmers, chainsaws, brush cutters, machines for drilling holes in the ice and so on. I am very disappointed that Mr Lange has not seen fit to support that amendment, because without the protection of this detailed list of exceptions, Mr Lange's amendment – No 30 – does not go far enough, relying only on some technical committee, some Commission assessment of the alternatives. Mr Lange should think very carefully about my amendment, and then we would have a deal that both sides of this House could accept. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Davies (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, this legislation has often been referred to as the lawnmowers directive. The fact that MEPs are spending their time discussing lawnmowers will no doubt confirm the impression which too many of our constituents have about the value of our work. If so, they should think again. The blue smoke from generators, lawnmowers, pumps and so on tells its own story. The cumulative effect contributes significantly to air pollution. So, in contrast to the last debate where I argued strongly that we should emphasise the principle of subsidiarity, this is a matter which is clearly trans-boundary and for both environmental and single market reasons should be dealt with by this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">On the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy we all get used to industry representatives coming up to us and saying ‘don't do that, the time-scale is too short, the technology is not available’. So it has been a pleasure while this directive was passing through Parliament to be lobbied by one company – Honda, to which Mr Goodwill referred – which believes that the standards being proposed by the Commission do not go far enough. I realise it has its own reasons for this position. It has made the investment. It can meet the standards and it wants a competitive advantage over those who have not done the same. But is that not what we want overall? Is it not a good thing for manufacturers to be competing on the basis of setting the highest possible environmental standards?</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry the committee has not accepted some of the amendments I tabled at an earlier stage. I am sorry also that too many companies in my own country have failed to look to the future and want to continue producing dirty, polluting equipment instead of investing in the future and setting the highest standards so that they can compete properly across the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Here in Europe we should be aiming to set these higher standards subject to the available technology. I agree with what Mr Goodwill said about chainsaws and the difficulty of reaching those standards insofar as that piece of equipment is concerned. But I also want to resist, as Mr Lange said, the Commission's proposals for averaging and banking. So far as I am concerned it allows manufacturers to continue to produce engines which do not meet the highest air quality standards and perhaps to even put new ones on the market. After all, we are not saying that the changes have to be made now. A transition period is built into the proposal to give time for re-equipment. Amendment No 18 suggests that some financial support and incentives might be given to manufacturers.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to hearing the sound of my neighbour mowing her grass – and indeed my grass too, I hope – knowing that the air will be free from pollution and that the birds will not cough and splutter in the trees around my home. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now I note that the committee believes itself to be tackling pollution from leisure machinery which, it claims, accounts for a considerable proportion of the output of ozone precursors, especially on Saturday afternoons in the summer months.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the committee understand that a whole range of professional equipment is involved here? We have heard about chainsaws, but there are many other examples. Chainsaws are vital for managing woodlands. Manufacturers say that if this amendment goes through, they will no longer be able to manufacture these goods. The net effect of this, according to the practitioners, would be an adverse effect on the environment, and so I urge the House to reject the amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">However, knowing how enthusiastically this House embraces all or any legislation, no matter how insane or restrictive, perhaps I will not be sorry if the amendment is actually accepted because, given the amount of damage it will do, it will at least show Parliament and the European Union to be the mad legislative machine that it really is. Ordinary people have suspected this for many years. Perhaps in this case you will prove it to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Lange and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for an exhaustive and comprehensive report. I also want to express my gratitude for the amendments tabled. We have a basis for achieving a rapid and effective agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Emissions of pollutants from normal motor vehicles have, of course, been subject to regulations within the European Union for more than three decades. As a result, emission levels are now less than 10 per cent of those that existed before we introduced these limits. Consequently, the relative importance of other emissions has increased and, at the same time, we can see, as we also can from the Commission’s Auto-Oil programme, that the problems of air quality in the Community require further measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal we are discussing today concerns emissions from engines used in lawn mowers, power saws, leaf collection machines, pumps, generators and similar equipment. Approximately 25 million machines of this type are manufactured in the world each year and, even if the statistics are rather unreliable, it seems as if such machines account for approximately 10-15 per cent of total emissions of hydrocarbon within the Community. We have already heard this expressed in another way: that one hour’s use of a power saw releases as much hydrocarbon as does driving a modern private car more than 2 000 kilometres. These emissions contribute to ozone formation, which is one of the air pollution problems we have still not solved. Obviously, we must do something about the emissions from machines of this type.</p>
<p class="contents">Products of the type affected by the proposal are sold to the very largest part of the world market, and more than 90 per cent of them are manufactured by large companies active in this market. It has been important to the Commission to bring about a harmonisation of the legislation so as to make it easier to introduce the legislation quickly, provided of course that this can be done in a way that is in keeping with a high level of ambition in environmental terms. The only existing legislation in this area is that in the United States. We consider that this legislation effectively satisfies the environmental requirements, and it has also been a big influence on the way in which our proposal is designed.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I must alert you to the fact that there exist not only these big companies in the world market, but also companies which are not active in that market. Even if these companies account for only a small part of total production, the products are often used in small specialised areas. Many of the companies are small and therefore have limited resources for developing the technology needed to comply with the emission limits. We have therefore proposed certain special rules exempting these products and companies, and these are the same types of exemption found in the American legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the Commission’s proposal is an excellent example of a win-win situation since we are meeting the needs of industry at the same time as having brought about environmental benefits which would not have been possible if industry had needed to divide its resources to take account of different forms of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is able to accept those amendments which enable the Member States to mark products which meet the stage II requirements and to use economic instruments of control to stimulate production and sales of such products even before the limit values become compulsory. The Commission is also able in principle to accept an earlier time for introducing stage II but is opposed to introducing stage I any earlier because it would put unreasonable pressure on small manufacturers who do not sell their products on the world market. The Commission is also opposed to changing the definition of small manufacturers.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the so-called averaging and banking system, we are broadly sympathetic to the questions that have been raised concerning how this is to be used in practice. However, we think that it is an important feature of the attempts to harmonise this area and that, if it were abolished, European legislation would differ from American legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason for introducing such a system is that, where certain products are concerned, it is difficult to comply with the stage II values and that the particular products concerned vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. In this context, it is important, if the necessary environmental impact is to be achieved, not to exempt products which in reality could meet the requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Through averaging and banking, we have therefore introduced a flexible system which places the administrative burden on those manufacturers who wish to use it and which has a sound impact upon the environment. If, on the other hand, use is made of the facility to exempt certain products, there is a risk of drastically reducing the impact upon the environment because these exemptions are not offset, as is the case with the averaging and banking system<span class="italic">.</span> We must also be clear that the exempted products we are talking about are equipped exclusively with two-stroke engines, which are the most polluting. The Commission therefore wishes to emphasise the importance of retaining this instrument as a part of the legislation and opposes the amendments in question. At the same time, I wish to emphasise that what is essential is not the averaging and banking system as such but bringing about the flexibility, harmonisation and environmental benefits provided by the system.</p>
<p class="contents">Exemptions of certain types of equipment should therefore be accepted only after a careful analysis of the consequences, environmental and otherwise. For that reason, the Commission is opposed to introducing exemptions right now but is able to accept that this will become a possibility through making use of a committee procedure in the future. We also oppose amendments that exclude the use of two-stroke engines for generators and snow-blowers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is prepared to look into the need for further legislation in this area, especially when it comes to particle emissions from two-stroke engines, and wishes to coordinate it with corresponding demands concerning particle emissions from motorcycles and mopeds.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is able to accept, or in principle to accept, Amendments 1, 10, 11, 13, 14, 18 and 28 inclusive, together with Amendment 30. The Commission is not able to accept Amendments 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 12, 15 and 17, but is open to studying solutions that can bring about flexibility, harmonisation and environmental benefits. The Commission is not able to accept Amendments 4, 5, 9, 16 and 29. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
