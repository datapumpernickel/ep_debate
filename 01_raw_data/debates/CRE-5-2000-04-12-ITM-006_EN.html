<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lagendijk (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, in the time allocated to me, I would mainly like to focus on the Funding Conference of the Stability Pact which has just been held, because it is more beneficial, in my view, to focus attention on this than on the text of my report which, of course, was written for the Conference. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a general comment regarding the Conference. It is safe to say that it was a huge success, not only in financial terms but also due to the fact that the emphasis was most definitely on projects which link up the different regions. In fact, this was one of the central themes of the report and the main thrust of the Stability Pact. Indeed, regional development is one of the Stability Pact’s key points. It was good to see all-round commitment most definitely present at all the desks at the Conference. It was also a success – and I do not simply say this to flatter the Commissioner – because it was clear that the European Union or the European Commission took the lead at long last. In my opinion, it had been taking a back seat for a little too long. This concludes my general comments on the Funding Conference. </p>
<p class="contents">Further to this Conference, I would like to single out five key points from my report. First of all, the funding. Everyone was waiting with bated breath for the moment when the Commissioner would produce the amount. He finally came up with EUR 530 million. That was very smart creative accounting, I must say, because, of that EUR 530 million, 50% was old, pre-2000 money from the Obnova and Phare programmes and 30% was taken from the same programmes for the year 2000. In the final analysis, therefore, there was little new money in it. This is not a reproach to the Commission but an observation, and one which will, of course, create even more bad feeling, bearing in mind that another EUR 5.5 billion is still to be found. This is an amount which was quoted by the European Investment Bank at one time, which was later taken over by Commission President Prodi and in respect of which it is still completely unclear, to me in any case, how this is to be raised in the coming year. I would, therefore, like to ask the Commissioner how the first year, the year 2001, is likely to take shape? How are the preparations for the Stability Pact budget coming along? What is his reaction to the ever increasing protests, both in terms of loudness and number, coming, for example, from the Council or the Member States, to the effect that those 5.5 billion intended for the western Balkans, by way of pre-accession aid for Bulgaria and Romania, have been pitched far too high and that, in terms of absorption capacity, for example, a much lower amount would be far more realistic? I am in favour of retaining the figure of 5.5 billion for the time being. I am only very curious as to how the Commission hopes to raise all this money. </p>
<p class="contents">A request had also been made to spread the projects and planning for this Conference over all the desks: democracy, reconstruction and safety, in the knowledge that, at the end of the day, a bridge is more expensive than a training centre or mine-clearance programme. Unfortunately, I have to note that, looking at all the figures after the Conference, the emphasis has been shifted quite considerably towards reconstruction. Of 4.2 billion, 80% has been set aside for reconstruction, 17% for democracy and only 3% for safety. I would call on the Commission, and Europe has more or less pledged to use the same scale, to take the 3 to 4% really seriously and expand it. I would just remind you of a tragic report in the paper this morning about three children who stepped onto a mine near Sarajevo yesterday and were killed. A mine-clearance programme is part of safety, is of key importance and should not be overlooked. </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I would like to comment on the appeal in the report, backed by the General Affairs Council, to lift trade restrictions for the countries asymmetrically and, if necessary, unilaterally, the underlying idea being that, in time, trade will be just as important as subsidies. What is the progress here? What does the Commission intend to do to lift these unilateral trade restrictions in the short term? </p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the NGOs. Regrettably, very little attention has been paid to the role of NGOs, especially the local NGOs, both in terms of preparation and implementation. This is all the more unfortunate if one considers the level of knowledge regarding the Stability Pact in the region. I am convinced that it is vital to introduce local NGOs in order to improve the quality of the programmes but also to raise the awareness of the Stability Pact, and the exact plans, in that region. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the distribution of tasks. Who will ensure that all these tasks are carried out promptly and efficiently? I would like to give the Commissioner a word of advice. Last week, he was accused of wanting to saw the legs from under Commission President Prodi’s chair. If you are having a go at chair legs, could you take those of Mr Solana’s chair? In my view, he has been given a leading role in the Balkans for no good reason. It would seem far more logical to give this leading role to the European Commission, notably Commissioner Patten, to implement this Stability Pact promptly and efficiently.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Seixas da Costa,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>.<span class="italic"> – (PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Lagendijk, on his excellent and important report. The debate caused by this could not have come at a better time. As you know, the Special European Council held in Lisbon reiterated the strategic priority for the European Union of ensuring peace and stability in South-Eastern Europe and, as such, this is an issue which is on the EU’s immediate agenda and permanently on our political agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is by far the body which has contributed the most aid to this region. Between 1991 and 1999, the total aid from the EU to South-Eastern Europe, including that from the EU as a whole and the Member States individually, was in excess of EUR 19.3 billion. The EU is furthermore the main trading partner of all the countries in this region. It has allowed valuable trade concessions and, as you know, several thousand soldiers, police officers and civilian workers from the EU are active in the region, particularly in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">We read with great interest the rapporteur’s conclusions on the stabilisation and association process for South-Eastern Europe. The assessment of the solidity and possible deficiencies of this process certainly provides points for discussion and I will try to comment on some of these. The Lisbon European Council confirmed that our overall objective remains the greatest possible integration of the countries in the region within Europe’s political and economic system. The Stabilisation and Association Agreements constitute a central point of this policy. As the rapporteur quite rightly notes, these new agreements will not enter into force immediately as we firstly have to prepare, negotiate and conclude each one. As a result, the rapporteur concludes that it will be necessary to create a type of medium-term stabilisation and regional development programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not necessarily convinced that this is the most appropriate way of tackling the problem. The general stabilisation process for the area cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be reduced to just agreements. Clearly these are, shall we say, the most visible and most well-known feature of this process, but other important instruments are required such as preferential trade agreements, direct aid from the European Union and political dialogue. Most of the countries already benefit from trade preferences and the Lisbon Special European Council confirmed that the Stabilisation and Association Agreements should be preceded by greater asymmetric trade liberalisation thereby specifically favouring these countries in their bilateral trade with EU countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea underlying the stabilisation and association process is sufficiently broad and flexible to ensure a constant project in this area. With regard to the agreements, the fact that it is taking some time to prepare these should not, in our opinion, jeopardise the whole stabilisation process. This has not been the EU’s experience in equivalent regional processes in the past. As with other comprehensive agreements, we therefore hope to be able to establish interim agreements covering the period between the signature and ratification of these agreements, bearing in mind that normally almost twenty months pass between these two events. It is also worthwhile to remember that we already have contractual relations in the form of trade and cooperation agreements with Albania and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The new agreements, which will be more comprehensive and also more demanding on our partners given that they include elements of political conditionality which obviously form part of the Union’s current approach in this area, will specifically replace the existing agreements in these two cases. They will concentrate much more on regional cooperation than the current agreements and will include provisions on cooperation in the area of justice and home affairs, an area which is of great importance to the Europe of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Negotiations have already begun with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. The Albanian Government recently indicated its reaction to the viability study on the opening of negotiations, which was prepared by the European Commission, and the Council will very shortly analyse this report. Following internal political changes, the European Commission is also to prepare a viability study for Croatia which the Council hopes to be able to analyse immediately before or after the summer.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind the request made by the local authorities, Bosnia-Herzegovina was sent a guide whose use will help towards preparing a viability study on negotiations for an agreement of the same type. This work is moving forward at a good pace given, of course, that in this specific case, we must be careful and not create excessive expectations, as the reality of the situation there does not allow us to be overly optimistic in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to refer briefly to the new regulation. As we agree with the European Parliament about the need to create a uniform legal basis for support to the region, the Council is waiting for a Commission proposal on a Council regulation which will replace the support granted to the region by the Phare and Obnova programmes. The recommendations to be made will form a valuable contribution to the debates which we will start within the Council on this issue. I note in particular that the report highlights that the reconstruction of the region must not be regarded as merely physical and economic but must also be aimed at the social infrastructure, civil society and the public institutions. These are the main objectives of our reconstruction strategy for the area which does not just involve a merely physical dimension but also an overall stabilisation dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur also refers briefly to the Stability Pact on which we have been cooperating with these five countries and with the countries involved in the enlargement process. The recent regional financing conference which was organised jointly by the European Commission and the World Bank, in close cooperation with the Special Coordinator for the Stability Pact, gave significant impetus to the Pact’s objective of reviving the reform processes and stimulating regional cooperation. It proved that the Stability Pact mechanism has already gained a certain maturity and can and must advance. We believe that reciprocal commitment is the key to the Pact’s success and I feel that this point was made very clear in the recent discussions at the Commission and World Bank conference. The commitment of the countries in the region to implement institutional policy reforms and to create an environment allowing economic progress is a fundamental element in this Pact. In return, the international community is supporting the reform commitments and the donors and financial institutions have promised or mobilised a total of EUR 2.4 billion. Of this amount, the European Union alone, that is, the Commission and Member States combined, have promised or mobilised EUR 1.08 billion. The international community has financed in particular a quick-start package of EUR 1.8 billion announced at the conference and has made available the necessary financing to accelerate the preparation and implementation of projects and initiatives in the short-term package.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the conference was only one initial step in a long process. The European Union is committed to acting as leader and guaranteeing the coherent management of this whole support process. It has also pledged to closely monitor and support the regional reform processes in a way which corresponds to the efforts made by each country so that these can be rewarded with advances in the development of new instruments. This will allow economic and social development and progress in line with European standards. With the exception of Belgrade, all the governments in the region have stated that they will start on the road to reform. I must clarify, however, that the Council considers that, without Serbia, our common efforts will be incomplete. A democratic and cooperative Serbia, at peace with its neighbours, will be welcomed within the European family. We must be aware that overall stability in this region can never be complete when one country in the region represents a factor of instability. This message about Serbia must be received by the respective civil society. Our support for Montenegro and for the stabilisation efforts being made in this country by the respective government must also be reconfirmed.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, we also note that the rapporteur intends that the mandate of the European Reconstruction Agency should not be limited to Kosovo. In the meeting of 20 March, the Council invited the Commission to work on a proposal and to present this to the Council with a view to including Montenegro in the Agency’s mandate. Discussions are also ongoing about the possible extension of the EIB’s activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Council has invited the Secretary-General and High Representative, under the authority of the Council presidency and in full cooperation with the Commission, to ensure the coherence of the policies for the Western Balkans. At the last General Affairs Council, an initial commentary was given on these ideas which specifically stem from the presentation given by Commissioner Patten and Mr Solana. We are sure that in future meetings of the General Affairs Council this issue will be followed with close attention and by effective steps towards its realisation.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pack (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, first of all I would like to offer my sincere thanks to Mr Lagendijk for his report. I can give it my full support, and I am delighted that a Christian Democrat can fully support a green report, because that would suggest we are going down the right track together and have shared the same experiences.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">This debate is taking place at an opportune moment today, as has already been mentioned. The donor conference had a positive outcome, at least on paper. Money is to be poured into projects that will at last be able to give the pact a face. It has been something of a mirage so far: the outcome was intangible. Work is now to begin at last, and the costly palaver is over. It is in fact a shame that the coordinator’s apprenticeship had to last so long.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Experts on the region have long been familiar with the projects to be undertaken there, which have now been defined by the European Union and the European Investment Bank. We could have, and in fact should have, made a start on them in the autumn. However, I would also like to take the decisions reached by the Council of Ministers to task at this point, and say that establishing a reconstruction agency in Thessaloniki and a coordinator in Brussels, and then not allowing the two to cooperate, shows what little inclination there is to promote efficiency. There can be no stability without reconstruction, and vice versa. </p>
<p class="contents">We must now swiftly regain lost ground. EUR 1.8 billion for the next twelve months can be used to set one or two things in train, so that the people in the region are at last able to see that we are serious when we make our grandiose statements about securing stability in the region. But this will not be possible without reconstruction and functioning institutions, and we need to work quickly to achieve both. Every euro that actually goes towards the projects and does not get caught up in the imbroglio of excessive activities and organisations, or even disappear on account of corruption, will be a euro well spent. We must be on our guard here. However, the wars in the region were more expensive in every respect than all the necessary measures will prove to be.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The idea of having a Stability Pact is a sound one because it is geared primarily towards cross-border measures, and thus to prevention of conflicts. Many local politicians and governments have grasped this and have already created a cross-border, regular working level. In implementing this instrument with rigour the European Union will be able to establish a successful and exemplary policy. However, all parties involved in the Stability Pact will need a great deal of stamina. It takes time and continuity to establish and consolidate stability. The recipient countries face the particular challenge of reforming their administration and their institutions, so as to create the right conditions for foreign investment and to enable them to become ever less dependent on external aid.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">However, stability in the region depends to a large extent in most spheres on the eradication of criminal power structures and the construction of structures befitting a state under the rule of law, as is the case in Bosnia for example. Elections are no panacea. One cannot vote democracy into being. Take last Sunday’s elections in the Republika Srpska in Bosnia. The parties of Karadzic and Kraijnik gained the most support. The return of the refugees is precisely what is needed to help restore normality and democracy, and that is why the refugee merry-go-round of Bosnia and Croatia, for example, must be set in motion without delay within the context of the Stability Pact. This will cost money. Mine clearance, job creation, schools and preventive health care must go hand in hand with repatriation. Unfortunately, the High Representatives in Bosnia have also wasted a great deal of time. They have tolerated, or even promoted, parallel structures for too long. We have not made nearly as much progress as we could have done when it comes to bridging the ethnic divide, which was created by the war, and, I am sorry to say, perpetuated by Dayton to some extent.</p>
<p class="contents">Efforts to initiate and undertake judicial reform, in Bosnia for example, are in a state of disarray. The court judgements are not even being implemented. Instead of maintaining a protectorate for decades, more commitment should be given to establishing the nation state of Bosnia Herzegovina.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning once again to the idea of a Stability Pact: as with European unification, the key is to motivate social groupings and their various interests, as well as States, to work towards a common goal. If we are to stabilise South-Eastern Europe, then the institutions concerned with the economy, culture, and educational policy that are either present or to be created in the respective States, must be encouraged to cooperate ever more closely with each other and with their European counterparts.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">We must now seize the opportunity and quickly create examples that will show the Serbs in Yugoslavia that it would be better if they were to rid themselves of the dictator Milosevic and then tread the path to Europe along with their neighbours. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now is not the time to pass judgement past events and situations. Today, let us take it that with this report we are taking a step towards the future and creating the platform for a first successful substantive European Union policy, in a way the first successful action of the CFSP.</p>
<p class="contents">Here, however, we must pay attention to certain issues. So what are these issues? It is an open secret that interests are being expressed in the Balkans by many sides and many people, who often do not have common strategic aims. In all circumstances this must be stopped by non-negotiable political answers given in every direction. So what are they?</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly: absolute compliance with the UN’s decisions on the area.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: the boundaries of the states in the area are non-negotiable, even if it proves necessary in critical cases to adopt flexible forms of administrative autonomy and greater decentralisation. I note that if there are some who think solutions will emerge either by creating new states or by redistribution between states, they are making a tragic mistake. That would lead to continued and lasting tension with no foreseeable end. A domino effect. Without exaggeration, at the beginning of the 21st century we would have a new thirty-year war, 10 years of which, in any case, we have unfortunately lived through.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly: our policy must concern the peoples, and only them. That is what is also in Europe’s interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly: the issue of economic and institutional reconstruction is an urgent priority. Positive results will emerge through development, democracy and prosperity. For the first time you are passing judgement on a complex problem at the very periphery of the European Union. The EU’s political credibility and competence must prove successful. It is a bet which must be won. I hope that the strong convergence of support for the Lagendijk report achieved in the Committee on Foreign Affairs will find the same response in Parliament, and thereby express the desire of us all for a positive and stable outcome.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to take up a subject mentioned neither in the Commission’s announcement nor in the report and so run the risk of its being said that I am operating at too low a level. The subject I want to bring up is that of women’s involvement in the reconstruction programme, and I wish to do so because women and children have always been the major victims when it comes to conflicts, civil wars and wars generally. Assaults upon women, rape, killing and torture are daily fare and have been so for many years recently in the countries of south-eastern Europe. I think it is absolutely crucial, if cultural understanding is to be promoted and a proper reconstruction programme prepared, that women should be involved – and involved very centrally – in the processes concerned. I am taking up this matter because not enough – although, fortunately, a little – has in actual fact been done in this area. It is in fact the case that a gender task force has been established under working party 1, but this has not happened because of any initiative from above but because of an initiative from below when a number of women have – if I may put it like this – approached the conference table and asked if it were not unreasonable for them, in one way or another, to have a central place in the whole of the reconstruction work. It is a number of quite concrete, down-to-earth things these women have proposed, such as developing a proper programme for women and involving women in the general development plans. The initiative is also, of course, about getting women to stand at elections at local, regional and national levels. If, however, the initiative is to succeed, these women also need to receive money for the projects concerned. Otherwise, these will not happen. Moreover, the amount of money involved is small in relation to the other money which, hopefully, will eventually be paid out in this area. I would therefore ask both the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council to take care to ensure that, where future work is concerned, women are involved in the reconstruction processes. I do not, in fact, believe that the project will succeed if that does not happen.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In other words, it essentially accepts that the wolf can guard the sheep. By its very nature, the Stability Pact in Eastern Europe is intrusive, on the pretext that human rights and democracy are being protected. I will not yet again refer to how the European Union is reacting to the flagrant violations of human rights in Turkey and elsewhere or the strident violations of those rights inside the European Union, i.e. the double standards policy. For the moment, I will just note that the Pact’s real aim is to ensure the political and economic dependence of the countries in the area, to plunder their wealth and to overexploit their workforce.</p>
<p class="contents">As is also stressed in the report, it is particularly worrying that in the area there will be a test of the European Union’s – I quote – ‘ability to develop an effective civil and military crisis management strategy aimed at conflict prevention’. In other words, new interventions are being prepared, even military ones, with the aim of converting the area into a protectorate. The tragic situation brought on by the criminal intervention of NATO and the European Union in Kosovo and particularly in Yugoslavia is indicative of what is likely to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides, respect for borders is not a matter of generalised declarations and wishes, as they occur in the report, but practical respect for the territorial sovereignty and integrity of these countries, in other words precisely the opposite of what the European Union and the USA are doing. It is clear that those who support this Stability Pact want to frustrate any resistance to their plans, especially when it involves conflict. They try, either by force or by economic blackmail, to terrorise peoples and subjugate them to the new order. And the question is this: what principle of international law are they basing their actions on? </p>
<p class="contents">Convinced, then, that the Stability Pact will bring new strife to peoples in the area and reinforce the dominance of the USA and the European Union, we will vote against the report and step up our fight against the Pact and on behalf of peace, friendship and solidarity between the peoples.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe focuses on regional cooperation in the Balkans. It is precisely this cooperation which the European Union wishes to promote in the best possible way. Well, this regional cooperation still leaves too much to be desired. The basic pursuit of common interests is being undermined by a longing for prestige and rivalry among the various nations. In this way, the swift implementation of the innovative Stability Pact is being hampered. What is needed here is a powerful response from the European Union. This should go hand in hand with a selfless and more balanced selection of regional aid projects. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I consider Paragraph 26 in the Lagendijk report to be a fine idea. Indeed, the Stability Pact applies just as much across the borders of the region. As such, the Republic Moldavia definitely deserves the opportunity of being directly involved in the Pact. After all, the alternative would be that Moldavia would be in danger of finding itself in a kind of political no man’s land. What is more: Moldavia is linked with neighbouring Romania both culturally and politically. If Romania falls under the scope of the Stability Pact, so does Moldavia, therefore. </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the success of this Stability Pact may well set a positive precedent for the East, with the Pact extended in the direction of the currently very unstable Caucasus. Am I right in thinking that Russia already subscribes to the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Swoboda (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to congratulate Mr Lagendijk on his excellent report. I think it is both pleasing and highly productive to have achieved a consensus spanning several groups on how the problems facing South-Eastern Europe should be tackled – one could revert to saying “the Balkans” again in the light of the fact that, interestingly, a representative of Croatia at the meeting under the chairmanship of Mrs Pack, said they would dare to go as far as to say again that Croatia is part of the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">We must take an overall view of the Balkans or South-Eastern Europe – whichever term we prefer – because there are pronounced similarities between the countries. However, that must not prevent us from responding differently to individual countries, all depending on how willing they are to take part in this overall process. We had a discussion on Macedonia recently – I had the opportunity to draft a report on this, and would again like to thank those of you who supported me – in fact we were debating a stabilisation and association agreement.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Croatia is currently the main object of our attention. Croatia has experienced a political watershed. I do not want to pass belated judgement on what has been, but only express my hopes for what is to come. That is why we must support Croatia every step of the way as it strikes out in this new direction, which does not involve excluding the opposition but endeavouring to enlist their support. But there is a new government and attitudes towards the refugee situation, economic development and, in particular, Europe, have changed. I would particularly like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council to work together with the other fourteen countries to ensure that the European Investment Bank is at last in a position to extend credits to Croatia. It is grotesque that Croatia, I am sorry to say, still does not have the option of receiving credits from the European Investment Bank.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Of course the other countries must also be given due regard and support. That much is clear. There can be no discussion whatsoever on that point, but for the moment I believe Croatia is to the fore. If we have a few cornerstones of regional development, such as Macedonia, Croatia, and hopefully also Albania soon, then it will be possible to create a network of stability in South-Eastern Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">There is a final point I would particularly like to address: the donor conference, which was highly successful – I am grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council, but I would particularly like to thank the Commissioner, both of whom helped to make the donor conference a success – concentrated above all on material infrastructure, and indeed that is what we need in South-Eastern Europe. However, we also need the appropriate mental infrastructure. We need a change of attitude on the part of the people in this region. That is why I am particularly keen to urge you, despite all the rumours we have heard, to see to it that due attention is given to furthering all matters to do with learning and education, and with the “Graz process”, i.e. to do with changing people’s attitudes and behaviour, solidarity and tolerance.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">It may cost relatively little, but it is still important to enable the people there to see that above and beyond the material aspects of their lives – bridges, roads, railways etc. – they also share a common future, reached through mutual understanding and support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is that Mr Lagendijk’s report has interesting ideas, positive proposals, but I very much fear that it is a naïve report which cannot be implemented in the Balkans by the European Union’s policy. When basic factors such as respect of the Balkan borders are missing, when we play games with Montenegro and Kosovo, when this is coupled with the antagonism being shown towards the Milosevic regime, I think we are already undermining every positive effort we should be making. The European Union must conclude that it should respect the frontiers in the Balkans, and that is something quite different from its attitude towards Milosevic.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I want to stress is that financing part of the reconstruction plans by reducing agricultural expenditure must finally stop. I think that the donor conference makes this possible, or seems to at least.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point I would like to make here is that there are parts of Greece, yes, unfortunately Greece, for example the Prefecture of Pieria, a tourist province in Central Macedonia, which has suffered enormous economic damage because tourists no longer come to that area. Such issues should be considered by the European Union as well.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, it was once said that the Balkans begin at the Rennweg in Vienna. But leaving that aside, the fact remains that this Stability Pact is of course adversely affected by the heterogeneity of its States. We have first and second wave candidate countries. We have countries such as Croatia and Macedonia that are about to overtake candidate countries. We have States such as Bosnia-Herzegovina and Albania in which the State is scarcely functioning, and then the two decisive challenges, namely Yugoslavia, or Serbia, where it is a question of doing everything we can to foster democratisation and develop a long-term strategy for the Europeanisation of Serbia.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Kosovo, where we will never achieve success unless elected political structures come into being there, along with a long-term vision of what is to happen to this region, which will never again be a Serbian province. We cannot afford to hang about over this issue any longer; otherwise all we will be doing is tinkering about at the edges, as it were. But that is not the only factor adversely affecting the Stability Pact, it is also suffering from a lack of credibility on the part of the international organisations and also the European Union, which owing to a confusion of competences, wastage, and mismanagement, are displaying traits that would be dismissed as being typical of the Balkans, were it not for the fact that this is happening in our own organisations. We are losing a great deal in the way of credit and respect in this region, and this respect and credibility are fundamentally even more important than the promises of funding that are made and then not kept. I truly believe we must put this situation in order in the European Union, primarily by strengthening the Commission’s role in the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I have a great deal of faith in your work, but I must say that we as a Parliament must also ensure that you are able to give this work more in-depth attention than you have been able to hitherto. What we need here is cooperation between our two institutions, so as to strengthen the EU and its credibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would, however, stress certain points. We know that the countries of the South-East are a priority, but we must be careful not to give ourselves more priorities than we can handle and not to establish conflicting priorities or we will lose credibility. I refer to the Mediterranean policy and the Middle East peace process, which are also priorities. We must be consistent, as I will remind the Council when we come to discuss the budgetary issues. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it should be borne in mind that the regional approach is appropriate and important, and that it is important for the European Union to play a guiding role throughout this matter. I therefore call upon the Commission and the Council to ensure, in the management of this extremely complex process, that the balance is maintained between the regional dimension of the Pact and the bilateral Association and Stabilisation Agreements, or we may end up sending contradictory signals to these countries. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to mention two other points: the former Yugoslavia and crime. With regard to the former Yugoslavia, I feel that we must follow the recommendations of the report and gradually reduce the embargo on the civil community until it has been lifted completely, because to continue to enforce it will only serve to postpone the fall of Milosevic. The sooner we do this, the better. Apart from anything else, the embargo is affecting other countries in the region, including several candidate countries. It is causing serious harm. And who can lift it if Europe does not? It appears that even the United States are expecting us to lift the embargo. We must find the courage to take this step. </p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, as other Members have reminded us, we must deal with society as well as infrastructures. It might be interesting to meet with the chairmen of the three Working Tables to discuss these projects; maybe the Committee on Foreign Affairs could see to this. Society is important, and that is why we must continue with information and culture projects. For example, my city, Rome, is organising the young artists’ biannual event in Sarajevo and funding the Sarajevo Concert Hall, precisely to give a sense of the reconstruction of a society within which there is dialogue, but which has dialogue with us as well. </p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the issue of crime. My country, Italy, has a very high organised crime rate. Puglia, for example, is a region which has to tackle crime organisations with a base in our country as well as elsewhere. I would include this among the priorities I mentioned before, because investments will also be affected if this level of organised crime is maintained. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Mr President, I arrived in the Chamber this afternoon with an extremely good speech, which I would like to thank my cabinet for most warmly; but perhaps I can deliver it on another occasion because I would actually like to respond informally to this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Members of the House will have noticed that the High Representative and I produced a report for the Lisbon Council, and I suspect that Mr Lagendijk might have noticed that it bore a striking similarity to his own report. I am not sure which was chicken and egg, but I feel that in complimenting Mr Lagendijk on the report he will not take it amiss and think that I am really congratulating Mr Solana and myself. Yet there was a great deal of similarity. It is fair to say that our work for the Lisbon Council was very much motivated by the strong feeling that unless we can make a success of our efforts in the Balkans, the whole credibility of our attempts to construct a common foreign and security policy will be shattered. It is enormously important that we rise to the challenge in the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">A point we made to the heads of government in Lisbon in our report – which was very much reflected in the week that I spent recently in the region – is that the stabilisation and association process has to be at the heart of our strategy. To put it in a rather more demotic way, in the phrase used by my honourable friend Ms Pack, what it means is designing, helping countries along the road to Europe. They want to be integrated with the Euro-Atlantic structures; they want that as an alternative to the traumatic disintegration of the last few years. We have to make that a real process for them.</p>
<p class="contents">There were a lot of references to the Stability Pact conference the other day, which as several people have said was a considerable success. The offers made by donors exceeded by a comfortable margin the expectations at the beginning of the conference.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a couple of points I want to make about it. One, in response to Mr Lagendijk, it is true that some of the money going into the quick-start projects supported by the European Union was money from the 1998 and 1999 budgets. There is a simple reason for that, which is that in some cases we had already carried out feasibility studies and made preparations for these quick-start projects. In my book, new money is money you have not spent already. Unfortunately, given the fact that our budget is based on commitments and payments, and not just payments unlike the budgets in almost all the Member States, that is a particularly important factor. Committing money does not always mean spending it, the next year or the year after or even in the next decade. It is important to be clear about that.</p>
<p class="contents">This follows up the point made by Mr Swoboda and it is a point with which I strongly agree. We are not just talking about infrastructure in terms of hardware, we must also talk about infrastructure in terms of software. That includes the rule of law, democratisation, the sort of civil society projects to which the honourable gentleman was referring; and it includes education – a point I will come back to in a moment.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to make one or two other points which arose at Lisbon and which we are following up. First of all, we were charged in the Commission at Lisbon to bring forward a package of proposals on asymmetric trade concessions for the region. It is worth remembering that the total exports from the Balkans to the European Union represent about 0.6% of our total imports. For agricultural products the figure is about 0.16%. So this is an area where we could afford to be a little generous.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also trying speed up our assistance and make it more effective. I announced yesterday agreement in the Commission on a rapid reaction facility. We will be coming forward to Parliament in the next few months with our new regulation for assistance to the West Balkans, which I hope will make it more rapid, more flexible and will, of course, have to include sufficient funding for projects supporting gender issues. I can think of no single model of successful economic or political development which does not include at its heart sensible programmes to ensure that women can develop their full potential and play a full role in their communities.</p>
<p class="contents">One point on education: last winter, despite all the cynicism, our energy for democracy programme in Serbia was extraordinarily successful. Alas, there are not many occasions when people cheer the European Union in the streets – all too few occasions in the country I know best. But that happened in some of those cities last winter. The Mayor of Nis has just written a letter saying that Energy for Democracy was a model of the sort of political support we should be providing in his country.</p>
<p class="contents">The winter is over, so there is not the same urgent necessity for oil at the moment. We are looking at ways to extend that sort of scheme. What we have been thinking of, among other ideas, is education for democracy: providing schools with equipment, school-books and other facilities, cash to carry out small improvements to classrooms and so on, and with sports equipment – all those sorts of things which can make for a better life for the kids in those towns while they have to wait with their families for the departure – sooner rather than later, I hope – of Mr Milosevic.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope we are at last going to see more progress on the cleaning up of the Danube, which is crucial for the region. We had useful meetings with the Danube Commission last week and I hope that the annual meeting of the Danube Commission this week will see us managing to set all that in motion, with the European Union meeting about 85% of the cost of the clean-up.</p>
<p class="contents">I have spoken before of my concerns about Montenegro. Following my visit there about a month ago, we have doubled our Obnova support for Montenegro from EUR 10 to 20m. We are also providing a good deal there in terms of food security and so on. I very much hope that the European Investment Bank will lend some money within reasonable limits to Montenegro before too long.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the honourable Member asked about the scale of our financial commitments to the Balkans. There will be other occasions when I can follow this up in greater detail. For me one of the real tests is whether all those yards of Council communiqués and all those promises about Marshall plans and so on for the Balkans actually amount to a row of beans! This year we will be spending about EUR 540m in the western Balkans. Because of the front-loading of our commitments in Kosovo, next year we will need to spend about EUR 800m in the Balkans. About EUR 350m of that will go to Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be said that it does not involve huge increases in expenditure elsewhere but we have to provide support in a country like Croatia where there is a good and decent government trying to do a difficult job in extremely problematic circumstances. We have to spend money with those stabilisation and association countries which are negotiating seriously with us on the road to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">For me, in public-spending terms, the crucial year is always year one – you are lucky if you get to year two or three. Year one is actually the big year of expenditure for us.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, at Istanbul, when we were asked how much we thought we could spend in the region, recognising that it was subject to the budgetary authority – I know all the theology of these matters now – we reckoned about EUR 5.5bn. People say that is a crazy figure. Well, I am keen that we should no longer be in the position we are in now where, despite the interinstitutional agreement, we are told by a lot of people that we have to find the extra money for Kosovo within the financial envelope agreed before Kosovo became a necessity.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing I have insisted on is a realistic figure in our budgeting for reconstruction in Serbia, because I do not want to find myself in two or three years time having to find additional costs for Serbia out of that same budget. We reckon that applying the same sort of figures applied in Kosovo, we would need about EUR 2.3bn for a serious reconstruction programme in Serbia. That could only start once Milosevic has gone. However, in my view it would be thoroughly irresponsible for us to suggest figures to this Parliament or Council which did not include an element of what we think would be realistic for Serbia. That is based on economists’ figures and our assessment that we need to meet the same sort of a proportion of expenditure on Serbia that we have met in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">The rest – EUR 3.2bn – over seven years does not strike me as being outlandishly generous. That is how we reached the figure of EUR 5.5bn and I have slightly resented the implication in some newspapers that this is a figure we have plucked out of the air and does not make any sense. I should be delighted to explain it not just in more detail to Parliament but I am looking forward in due course to explaining it in more detail to the General Affairs Council. Who knows, if I was lucky enough one day, I might even be able to explain it to finance ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">I respond to the honourable Member’s well-intentioned question in that way. This is not a figure plucked out of the air: it is an attempt to provide an honest assessment of what our rhetoric actually means. People cannot resent the fact that they do it: they asked us to do it in relation to the Middle East – to give some idea of what the cost of a peace settlement would be for the European Union’s programmes. So let us see the cost of it in the Balkans. If we are going to have an argument about the relationship between rhetoric and reality, let us start here.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point: we are clearly talking in the Balkans about building peace and security, not just in our backyard but in our front yard too. We are talking about building peace and security in an integral part of our European common home. I hope we can do so in practice with the rhetoric, with the promises, with the optimism that we show in all those rhetorical communiqués.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
