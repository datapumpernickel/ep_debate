That said, it might also help one to overcome stage fright. What is decisive though, is not the quantity but the quality of the people in the audience.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter, Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We are continuing the debate on the accession of Greece to the euro zone and, of course, we must have noticed that the tone of this debate has been influenced by the exchange rate weakness of the euro and enlargement, and we have kept in mind the fact that any decision we take now may set a precedent for future candidate countries. I feel we should take account of this throughout the debate.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">At the same time though, we must stick to the facts. The fact of the matter is that the European Commission and the ECB have presented us with reports. Both reports state – the one from the European Central Bank does so with a few more reservations perhaps – that Greece has fulfilled the criteria of the Treaty of Maastricht. If one looks a little more closely at the facts and figures, then it is possible to discern positive and negative aspects. On the plus side, one cannot help but notice that inflation – which was still running at 20.4% in 1990, when Greece started the consolidation process – fell to 2% in March of the year 2000. That is undoubtedly a most impressive achievement.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The second important criterion is the public deficit. It was still at 7.6% in 1996 and fell to 1.5% in 1999. That too is a most laudable achievement on the part of Greek economic policy. However, there are also concerns to be registered here. First, there is the fact that the criteria relating to the inflation rate were only fulfilled very late in the day, in the course of the last few months, and that the lowering of excise duty must have had something to do with this. Then there is the question of total debt, which is still in excess of 100%, and is only inching towards the prescribed 60%. We have some weighing up to do here.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I feel we should also take account of the fact that in the wake of the European Central Bank’s statement, the markets have, in principle, anticipated Greece’s accession to monetary union, and so if we were to reject this statement, it would not benefit the euro exchange rate in the least, but would, on the other hand, do considerable damage to the Greek economy. I believe we should bear this in mind when forming an objective assessment of the situation. Hence, we are in favour of Greece joining the euro zone, but with some reservations. The majority of my Group will vote in favour, however, as we have included several amendments in the Pomés Ruiz report that highlight our concerns.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it is made quite clear that the Maastricht criteria must be applied in full to all future candidate countries, and no more precedents are to be established in this respect. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there must be sustainability as far as the rate of inflation is concerned. I believe that if Greece were to step up its implementation of internal market directives, which actually enhance competition, then this would help to achieve this goal.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the proceeds from privatisation should be used to reduce debt. These are the conditions under which the majority of my Group will vote in favour of Greece joining the euro zone.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission has now concluded that Greece fulfils all the convergence criteria. I am convinced that Parliament will take the same view. It is quite an achievement to meet the convergence requirements and, at the same time, as Greece is doing now, to achieve increases in growth and employment. </p>
<p class="contents">Europe, especially the remaining convergence countries – Sweden and Greece – are now showing that it is fully possible to fulfil the stability requirements of the convergence process and still maintain a dynamic economy with growth and falling unemployment. Against that background, I have no reservations about recommending that Greece join the euro zone as from 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">Sweden, too, fulfils the basic economic requirements. The Swedish economy is now one of Europe’s strongest, with low inflation, high growth and a balance of payments surplus. However, Sweden still does not fulfil all of the more formal requirements. It has not joined the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) and Swedish legislation concerning the Bank of Sweden still does not completely fulfil the requirements of the Treaty. However, the Swedish Parliament has instituted a number of changes to the legislation concerning monetary policy in order to facilitate Sweden joining the euro. The remaining changes will be made when Sweden actually applies to join the euro, partly by applying to join the ERM. </p>
<p class="contents">I am very well aware of the implications of the Treaty. But in a Euro-sceptic country like Sweden, which still feels itself to be a new Member State, there is a democratic imperative for a change as major as that of joining the euro to be preceded by a careful democratic process. </p>
<p class="contents">At the Committee hearing, Commissioner Solbes declared that it is the individual country which applies to enter the ERM. Where Sweden’s entry is concerned, it is therefore my and, as I understand it, the Commission’s judgement that to want full status in EMU by entering the ERM is to adopt a political position. Commissioner Solbes said in the Committee that he respects the Swedish government’s desire to allow the people to decide the question in a referendum. We are therefore also grateful for the phrases in Mr Goebbels’ report in which he welcomes this democratic process. </p>
<p class="contents">I, who am working hard <span class="italic">in favour of</span> Swedish ‘euro membership’, am convinced that, in a few years’ time, we shall also make the same decision for Sweden as we are now making in the case of Greece, i.e. to welcome and approve Sweden as a fully-fledged member of the Economic and Monetary Union and of the single currency. I look forward to that day. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sweden joined the European Union without an opt-out, certainly not in respect of monetary union. Only on points such as legislation, which is in Sweden’s remit, does the country not meet the criteria. There is talk of a referendum coming up. I would like to know when exactly that will be as I am sure there is not a date for this yet. How long will it be before the Commission does its duty and reminds Sweden’s Social Democratic government of its signature under a very important contract? The Swedish government sets an extremely bad example for the candidate countries which are, at this moment, waiting to join.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would now like to move on to Greece. I have a problem with that country. The Greeks have produced a fantastic achievement. I only wonder how long the effects of that achievement will last. But I am acutely aware that by punishing Greece for achieving something positive, we will let the actual guilty party off the hook. Greece probably does not meet the criteria any more or less than other countries did. The euro zone should be able to carry a relatively small economy such as the Greek one quite easily. At the moment, however, this sends out the wrong psychological message to the markets and citizens who, to use an appropriate metaphor, look upon the euro descending Mount Olympus with sadness in their eyes. This is why Parliament, on behalf of the citizen, has to send out a signal to the Union’s large Member States. But the Central Bank, for example, is not concerned with the euro’s external value. The true culprits are the governments of Germany, France, Belgium and especially Italy. These countries, however, are making a mess of their own responsibilities vis-à-vis the currency and vis-à-vis the European citizen, let alone their own citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">They do not introduce the required structural reform within their own markets. Governments are far too accommodating when agreements are not met, under the motto: you meet the agreements today, I might meet them tomorrow. Why is Italy not called to task when it makes a shambles of its good intentions? The large Member States and Belgium are trifling with the interests of all European citizens. It is said time and again that the European citizens are not adversely affected as long as they stay in Europe. But surely, Mr President, we should not make that decision for them? In the Netherlands, many farmers are emigrating to North America. A weak euro lets them down badly. Businesses within the European Union have become 25% cheaper for the United States to buy. I think it is time for some changes. I will be abstaining from the votes today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is definitely deserving of recognition, but as the rapporteur, Mr Goebbels, said, Greece does not completely make the grade. The question of sustainability has reared its head again. Mrs Randzio-Plath has once again stressed the importance of sustainability in the context of compliance with the convergence criteria. When we look around in Europe, we see that wherever socialist governments are in office, or have just come to power, there are problems to do with sustainability. This affects the large countries such as Germany, France and Italy as well. As Guardian of the Treaties, the Commission cannot just ignore this, and behave as if everything was fine. The decision we have to make today is significant because there are other Member States waiting to join the euro zone, and so we must be sure to impose the criteria on Greece.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Greece joined the European Monetary System two years ago and revalued the Drachma early this year. It has largely fulfilled requirements in this respect. Secondly, it succeeded in getting the rate of inflation down to the required level not so long ago. Whether this lasts remains to be seen. I would have preferred it if Greece’s entry into the euro zone could have been deferred for a year, to 1 January 2002. As has already been pointed out, Greece does not, by any stretch of the imagination, fulfil the criteria laid down by the Treaty of Maastricht pertaining to the interest-rate margin. It could only reduce the public debt by a small amount: only by 6 percentage points over eight years, in contrast to Italy and Belgium, which were able to reduce their debts by a far higher amount. I really very much doubt whether we can talk in terms of sustainability in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Privatisation of state enterprise has made little headway. As before, no more than 49% of state assets can be sold, which means that it is nothing more than an exercise in private provision of capital. It certainly is not privatisation in the real sense. The decision as to whether Greece should be admitted to the euro zone ought not to be taken lightly. There is a significant minority in the European Parliament that would like to see Greece join, but believes that it is still too early, and the course of action we take now will play a part in determining whether the euro is stable or not, internally and externally, in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to say a final word about the comparisons that have been drawn with the Deutschmark in 1985. There is no comparison whatsoever.

As Mr Goebbels stated in his report, the European Parliament’s task is not to assess practical adherence to the Maastricht criteria, for that has already been done, item by item, by the Commission and the bodies whose task it is to monitor these indicators and keep us informed. The European Parliament must express a political opinion; it must speak from the heart and not on the basis of figures; it must listen to its soul instead of numbers. </p>
<p class="contents">What sort of European Union is it in which one of the 15 States, which wishes to accede to the most committed and most important level of European cohesion, is still left standing outside the door? When, as the report maintains, we consider that all the Maastricht criteria are fulfilled and that, in addition, this country is called Greece – an enchanting name in itself – we cannot fail to realise that this cannot continue and be moved to remedy the situation. And I refer, in particular, to the Greek pensioners. You may wonder why, as representative of the Italian Pensioners’ Party, I am interested in Greek pensioners. But Mr President, if we have to ask Greece to reduce its State deficit – and, unfortunately, we know that, nowadays, this is only achieved by reducing pensions – instead of avoiding wastage – which, as the previous speaker said, in socialist governments, especially, is due to poor budgetary allocations – we must not make the pensioners and elderly citizens of Greece pay the price for its accession to the European currency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It bears witness to this country’s desire to become a member of euroland, sparing no effort along the way. I am in favour of treating all countries equally when it comes to forming an assessment of the criteria. In other words, whilst I approve of Greece joining the euro zone overall, I have definite reservations when it comes to the results we are considering at present.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The inflation criterion and the debt situation certainly give cause for concern. Greece has only been able to achieve the reference value for the permissible inflation rate in the last few months. No stone was left unturned in order to attain this objective, which begs the question as to whether the currency stability that has now been achieved can be secured in the long term or, put another way: how do matters actually stand on the sustainability front? Another worrying aspect is the total debt situation, which, being in excess of 100% of GNP, as compared with the reference value of 60%, is far too high. We must also take into account the fact that the current free-fall of the euro is not exactly favouring a sustained reduction in Greece’s state debt, and the anticipated medium-term rise in the level of interest rates is unlikely to help matters either.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Let us be clear about one thing where this decision is concerned: the financial markets immediately draw their own conclusions about the forthcoming enlargement eastwards. Therefore, the standard we set for all the euro aspirants amongst the countries of Central and Eastern Europe must not be so much as a fraction higher than the standard we are currently setting for Greece. And so we should be careful not to be over-generous in our interpretation of these results. They constitute – and I would emphasise this again – a hard-won snapshot of the situation and qualify Greece for membership by right. In short, a ‘yes’ vote must be qualified with an equally clear ‘however’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For me, as a Europhile, it was a great day when monetary union was brought to a successful conclusion, exactly as planned and with as many as 11 Member States. For me, as a Swede, it was disappointing that Swedish Social Democracy had not been able to deliver a result then and there. Now, two years have gone by – without any response or progress on Sweden’s part. We are, unfortunately, the country without an EMU strategy. For my part, I can only congratulate Greece as the twelfth country to adopt the euro. </p>
<p class="contents">Now that our discussions are focusing upon Greece and we are carefully picking over the Greek economy, all EU countries ought to join Greece in also adopting the euro. Many people are to be heard explaining the fall in value of the euro with reference to the fact that the United States’s economy is stronger than Europe’s. That is indisputable. It is amazing, however, that more is not being done by Europe to reverse this trend. For me, the reason for this is clear. There is a lack of confidence in the European governments. It is time to implement the structural changes which are often talked about but which are still not being carried out. With lower taxes and a more flexible labour market, Europe can enter the new economy. There needs to be more rationalisation of the budget, more exposure to competition, more deregulation and a more rapid phasing-out of monopolies. If the governments of Europe give priority to this work, we shall immediately find confidence in the euro increasing. But many of the EU’s social democratic-led governments are visibly unable to take action. There is a lack of leadership. It is not the President of the ECB who can ‘talk up’ the euro. Instead, it is the Member States which can make the EU and the euro competitive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to begin by congratulating the Greek government on the outstanding results it has achieved in the course of the last year as regards public debt and inflation. But it is the current situation that we need to consider. It is certainly true that by the very nature of its national economy, Greece is not destined to be the driving force, the big market within the euro zone. </p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the question of inflation: Mr Goebbels, I hope – I do not know if I understood you correctly this morning – that the low inflation rate you referred to is here to stay. We will have a struggle on our hands. However, this is the first accession to the euro zone. Unlike the beginning, when Italy and Belgium also failed to make the reference values, we must now take care, in the light of enlargement eastwards, not to create new reference values, and allow this to become a never ending story. But that is precisely the problem it seems we are going to have to face. The important thing is to reach a decision today that will boost political confidence in the euro. In other words, we need to ensure that, in future, the markets believe that these are economic objectives and criteria and not political decisions.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The CSU (Christian Social Union) is proposing to vote against the motion today, which does not mean that it is saying ‘no’ to Greece and to the euro, rather it disagrees with the timing and hopes to be able to admit Greece next year. The ECB itself raised the issue of ‘sustainability’. It is precisely this view – i.e. deferral of the decision for a year, so as to allow the local economy to stabilise – that could send out a signal, both to the Member States of the euro zone and to the financial markets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today we are studying the report on convergence, which deals with the Swedish and Greek problems. With regard to Sweden, the situation has hardly changed since 1998. The economic situation is positive, but the legislative adaptation of its Central Bank is not being carried out and it is not a member of the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the EMS.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Greece, the situation is radically different. Greece did not fulfil the convergence criteria in 1998 but now it does. By that I mean that it fulfils them in the strictest sense, using exactly the same criteria as in 1998. Greece has clearly made a great effort and I therefore have nothing to add to the positive results highlighted by Mr Goebbels in his report.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to talk about some of the points which have been mentioned today, given the concern about the Greek model. I understand that concern because Greece offers a precedent not only for the new candidate countries but also for the current Member States who, in the future, may join the single currency. In this respect, it is quite clear that the way we deal with Greece will be crucial but I want to insist that Greece has been treated in the same way as all the other countries when their situation was considered back in 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">There have basically been two issues of concern: debt and inflation. Are they sustainable? Is this inflation situation sustainable, or durable, as you call it? In the case of Greece, debt stands at more than 100% of GDP, practically the same as in Belgium or Italy. I do not think it is reasonable to compare the current situation in Greece with that prevailing in Italy or Belgium. We must not forget that Belgium and Italy have benefited from the fall in debt resulting from the reduction in interest rates, which is due, in particular, to the approximation of the interest rates of their Central Banks with those of the European Central Bank. In comparative terms, the Greek situation is similar to the Italian or Belgian situation at the time of their accession to the single currency.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point of concern is inflation. I understand this concern on the basis of two arguments: firstly, it is true that the level of inflation necessary to comply with the criteria was achieved relatively recently; secondly, there will also be a reduction in the interest rates and this will have a positive effect on speeding up the reduction in deficit and debt, but which may generate tensions in the market.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the first point, concerning whether Greece has achieved this inflation rate in a manner which is unsustainable, I must make a few comments. Greece has been complying with the inflation criteria for some months and the situation is improving considerably. This morning I had the opportunity to discuss the Greek figures which were issued a few days ago by the Greek national statistical service. The Eurostat figures were also published this morning. At the moment, the harmonised CPI, in the case of Greece, stands at 2.1%, a drop of 0.7% on the March figure; this is a better situation, for example, than certain countries of the monetary union, such as Belgium, Spain, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg and Finland. In comparative terms, therefore, Greece’s current situation is quite sound.</p>
<p class="contents">If we abide by the strict criterion of the last 12 months, we will see that inflation currently stands at 2%. This is clearly better than the situation in Spain and Ireland, and practically the same as Italy, Luxembourg or the Netherlands. Therefore, in terms of figures, I believe that we should not worry about the Greek situation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission also shares the concern which certain MEPs have highlighted. We have therefore insisted on two points in discussing both the broad guidelines for economic policies and the convergence report. Greece has to do two things, and the Greek Government is prepared to do them and has committed itself to doing them: Firstly, it must continue with its liberalisation policies and structural reforms which will improve the inflation situation; secondly, Greece must continue with its policy of reducing the deficit, but in a context of combining policies, a ‘policy mix’, which will allow it, in the event that an increase in demand, resulting from a reduction in interest rates, may create tension in terms of inflation, to reconsider its tax policy so that it will not have negative effects on the process of integration into Monetary Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that all of that will happen, and the Greek Government has committed itself to ensuring that it does. I therefore believe that the entry of Greece into the euro will help rather than hinder it. The euro has shown that it is still an attractive currency which some countries want to join. I hope that the path being taken by Greece will be followed by other Member States in the next few years. This is the end of a process. We must wait for its culmination with the decisions in June, but I am convinced that, by welcoming Greece into the euro when the time is right, we will generate more confidence in the face of any other type of arguments against the future progress of the single currency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
