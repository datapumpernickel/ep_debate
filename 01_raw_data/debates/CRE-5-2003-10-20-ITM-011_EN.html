It is a follow-up decision to the decision of 19 December 2002 which, exceptionally, allowed Member States to sign this Convention in the interest of the Community. The current proposal concerns the second and final stage of this procedure, that is, the ratification procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The scope of the Convention, which was concluded in 1996 within the framework of the Hague Conference on private international law, is very similar to that of the Council regulation on parental responsibility, which was approved by the Council on 3 October and will apply between Member States as of 1 March 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">The new regulation creates a common judicial area in the field of divorce and parental responsibility. It contains specific provisions to facilitate cross-border visiting rights and to deter child abduction within the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">It is widely recognised that the Convention would make a valuable contribution to the protection of children in situations that transcend the boundaries of the Community, thus usefully complementing the regulation on parental responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The similarity between the two instruments will facilitate the parallel application of the two instruments that share the aim of offering increased protection to children who are resident within the Community or third states respectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would like to express its gratitude to Parliament in general, and to the rapporteur, Mrs Hermange, in particular, not only for their continued support of the Commission's work in the field of parental responsibility, but also for their enormous efforts in this particular case.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware that Parliament has done everything in its power to speed up the procedure, including changing the date for the plenary vote from December, as originally scheduled, to today. The work of the rapporteur and the responsible committee has thus taken place under considerable time pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission takes note favourably of the amendments proposed and is extremely grateful for these efforts which will enable the Council to adopt this proposal in early November, at the same time as the regulation on parental responsibility, thus ensuring parallelism between the two instruments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hermange (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Europe has a duty to continually step up its efforts to establish a harmonised judicial area, in particular for the benefit of the weakest members of society. It is against this background that today's debate on parental responsibility is taking place.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament was consulted on this proposal for a Council decision at very short notice – as you reminded us, Commissioner – but the importance of the debate and the issues involved meant that it was willing to comply. I believe that we cannot do other than welcome this proposal, because this debate on parental responsibility is the consequence, dare I say it, of the political determination of a number of Members of this Parliament – foremost among them my colleague Mrs Banotti – who have been campaigning since 1994 for Parliament to take into account the child's best interests and the rights of the child.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Hague Convention of 1996 is a traditional legal instrument within private international law, it has already been a significant source of inspiration for those drafting the new regulation on parental responsibility. We already know that on 3 October, the Ministers of Justice of our respective countries adopted this new regulation, which should make it possible to avoid those interminable legal battles that are so detrimental to children. This new text also extends the scope of Brussels II to all decisions relating to child custody, which should be welcomed given that in many countries, in particular France and Germany, divorces and separations between couples from two different countries are still giving rise to substantial conflict. It will also mean that one single text will determine the judge competent to rule on a divorce or on issues affecting children. It is therefore a step in the right direction. Nevertheless, we should not forget that the thorny issue of parental responsibility also arises outside the European Union with regard to third countries. That is also why, in the same spirit, I support the Commission's proposal to authorise the Member States to accede to the Hague Convention. I am convinced that this Convention can make a valuable contribution to strengthening Community legislation on child protection in cases that go beyond the borders of the European Community. I would draw your attention to the fact that the overlap between the scopes of the Convention and the new regulation will, I am sure, make it easier to apply these two instruments in parallel.</p>
<p class="contents">As you will have seen, given the rather procedural nature of the Commission's proposal, I have not tabled many amendments. I do not think that Parliament has had cause to object to the content of the proposal. It is an exceptional procedure, as I have underlined in my report, given that the Hague Convention stipulates that only sovereign states can be parties to it. This illustrates the importance of Parliament's role, because a parliamentary opinion is required for the Member States to accede to the Hague Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I have stressed the timetable. The Commission had proposed a very long deadline: 1 March 2005. That is why I have tabled an amendment proposing to bring this date forward by six months, to 30 June 2004. I do not think that you will have anything against this, particularly given that it is in the interests of the children. I have also tabled two further amendments, one of which refers to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the other to the work of the European Convention. You will be aware that in the first part of the draft constitution, Articles 3 and 4 provide that the Union shall combat exclusion and discrimination and provide social justice and protection, equality between women and men, solidarity between generations and protection of children's rights. It is in this spirit that I have proposed this amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we all know that enacting rules on the subject is not enough and we must not simply see this as an empty gesture, because we constantly need to follow up specific cases that are submitted to us. It is therefore essential to ensure that the rules are properly applied, but, given that it is up to the Member States, who remain sovereign in this field, to do this, the European Parliament will always have to ensure that, in accordance with the recent conclusions of the UN World Summit for Children, the child's best interests remain a prime concern, not only in all judicial decisions relating to children, but also in all of the decisions made by our Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She was right to emphasise in the context of her excellent report that at the heart of all of this must be the best interests of children.</p>
<p class="contents">As Parliament's mediator in these areas I receive many phone calls. I have spoken to some very distressed people representing parents whose children have been taken away. They tell me of a lack of access to these children and difficulties in getting the children back once they have been on access visits in another country.</p>
<p class="contents">The great value of this particular piece of legislation is that we hope that many countries that, due to their own judicial systems, were unwilling to sign the Hague Convention of 1980 on the transnational abduction of children, will see their way to signing this piece of legislation, thus ensuring the safe and quick return of children who have been abducted. The good news is that Morocco has recently become the first Islamic country to sign this particular piece of international legislation, for which I would like to congratulate that country. We hope this will set a precedent for many of the other Islamic countries who do not feel, due to the type of legislation they have – Sharia law – that they can sign the 1980 Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">The good news also is that very recently the Council passed the Brussels II Convention. Even though the rights of children are not enshrined in the Treaty yet – and we hope this will come eventually – we now have several pieces of excellent legislation that should ensure the safety and rights of these children to know both their parents in the event of a marital breakdown. The fact is that under the Brussels II Convention the decisions made in the court in the country where the child normally lives can be implemented in the country where the abducted child is being held.</p>
<p class="contents">The 1996 Hague Convention is an excellent piece of legislation. I can assure you, Mr President, Mrs Reding and Mrs Hermange, that they will be raising glasses of champagne to us tonight in The Hague. They have been most anxious to see this matter progress. The Secretary-General of the Hague Convention, Mr Duncan, will be absolutely delighted at the speed, efficiency and care with which Mrs Hermange has brought her report to us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Recognition, enforcement and cooperation in respect of parental responsibility and measures for the protection of children are of such great value that the Group of the Party of European Socialists will vote unreservedly in favour of all of the amendments and Mrs Hermange’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">We will do this because we know how important the protection of children is. As you know, I am a member of a Franco-German mediation group, and know what difficulties and sad cases we have to deal with in it. It is the children themselves who suffer. We will vote in favour, although as a Member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and as a rapporteur, or a designated rapporteur for this Committee – we could not draw up another report because there was not enough time to do so – I would like to make a few remarks.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, I would like to mention three questions, which I forwarded to the Commission through Mr Gargani, the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and also a question that Mrs Hermange asked, which referred to the importance of this agreement in connection with Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">We have Brussels II, we have drawn up legislation for the European Union, and our input into this legislation is, in my view, highly creditable. Yet, at the same time, the Commission allowed this agreement to be discussed and certain things to be deliberated on without informing Parliament or giving it the chance to be involved. That poses an important institutional question as to what the connection is between the agreement and the European legislative procedure, and what Parliament’s rights are on this matter. The upshot is that we agree with this exception, because we see this agreement as exceptionally important and we do not want children to be punished in any way just because it there a potential interinstitutional conflict. We will, however, raise this question again in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, since it cannot be acceptable for Parliament’s rights to be annulled due to parallel legislation at European and International level. That would not be in the least bit sensible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is extremely important that the Hague Convention on parental responsibility and the protection of children, which dates back to 1996, is ratified by the rest of the Member States as quickly as possible. The Hague Convention and, in particular, the Regulation on the recognition and enforcement of judgements in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility, which was adopted at the beginning of the month by the Member States of the European Union, will be a considerable help in settling disputes on custody within Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe we have actually acquired an instrument to help us to reach swift and effective decisions in disputes over custody and enable us to avoid long, expensive and difficult legal proceedings with regard to separations across borders, which are so painful for children. We can really ensure that children grow up in a calm environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad and a little surprised to see just how excellent a reception the Regulation has had throughout Europe. Both the press and children’s organisations have together commended us on what we have achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Divorce is always a traumatic experience for a child, as it is for adults too, and if it is followed by litigation that lasts for years it can become absolutely intolerable. With this Regulation the EU will have, for the first time, an instrument by means of which conflicts arising from different laws in different Member States can be avoided.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we cannot meddle with the content of the Hague Convention in this report by Mrs Hermange. For that reason, I wish to ask whether the Commission and the Council are aware that the biggest problems are in any case disputes over the custody and the abduction of children when one of the parents comes from outside the EU and a country that has not ratified the Hague Convention. We have all read sad stories in the tabloid press about children being abducted, a harrowing experience for parents and the playmates of the children involved. Could the European Union itself have a hand in promoting the ratification of the Hague Convention? Could the Commission and the Council try to negotiate more bilateral agreements so that the Hague Convention might be signed in still more countries? We would achieve even better results if we could involve countries outside the EU in this same arrangement that now allows us to deal with custody disputes within the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
