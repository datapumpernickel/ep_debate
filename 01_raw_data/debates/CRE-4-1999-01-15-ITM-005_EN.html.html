<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Novo </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (PT)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in addition to dealing with the specific proposals of the Commission"s action plan, I intended in this report to consider, and often to confirm, political issues involving the whole common fisheries policy. In fact, it is my understanding that controls cannot or must not be regarded as an isolated political priority. Rather, they must be looked at as one aspect of a set of broader policies that ensure the social and economic sustainability of the sector and of the fishing communities reliant on this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Monitoring is clearly decisive in ensuring the success of the fisheries policy in a situation of declining resources that is affecting a growing number of species. However, in order for controls to be accepted and effective, it is essential that they be applied correctly, universally, transparently and fairly. This requires, from the start, a simplification of rules and the broad and effective participation of all the social partners, at both state and Community level, in the process of defining these rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the need to adjust the fishing effort has to be based on multilateral and systematic scientific research, using adequate financial and human resources, which can identify the true state of the resources. They must also be able to assess independently and reliably the consequences of the various sources of pollution on the state of the oceans.</p>
<p class="contents">We must promote stability in the sector, particularly with regard to access to resources. The central issues must therefore be to guarantee the continuation of the exclusive national use of the territorial waters within the twelve‐mile limit, and even to consider whether it needs to be extended and to guarantee the continuation of the international fisheries agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">The social development of the sector also requires policies establishing general levels of social benefits and welfare entitlements that are identical for all Community fishermen and that guarantee them the foundations for a common legal statute in line with higher standards of living.</p>
<p class="contents">The widespread introduction of new technologies is certainly positive, not only in terms of improving the reliability and transparency of the controls, but also in terms of allowing an overall modernisation of infrastructures, thus improving health and safety conditions at work and guaranteeing a higher quality of fisheries products. However, the effects on increased productivity must be assessed. We must prevent over‐fishing as well as the creation of conditions leading to large monopoly enterprise groups that are totally alien to the economic realities of the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">For these policies to be implemented in a global and integrated manner and for the controls to therefore be successful, it is essential that, at both state and Community level, fisheries policy has adequate financial support, thereby putting an end to its position as the poor relation of the Community budget. In this context, the way in which the sector is dealt with in Agenda 2000 does not augur well and this situation must be radically altered.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the proposals of the action plan, in essence, responsibility for monitoring naturally lies and will continue to lie with the Member States. This does not mean that efforts may not be made towards real cooperation in terms of information, without breaking any confidentiality rules. We can also aim to achieve effective equivalence and reliability of the assessment procedures, which are increasingly computerised, and ensure an agreed definition of the basic rules and offences and of the equivalent sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">Inspection procedures must also be established by consensus, with a code of conduct being proposed. In addition, cooperation between administrations must be increased while equivalent vocational training must also be encouraged and the human resources allocated to the controls increased at all levels.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, it is vital to conclude the procedures allowing proper comparison of fleets and respective productivity by implementing the commitments made by some countries under the multiannual guidance programmes. At the same time, we must accept that the reduction in the fishing effort cannot be implemented on the sole basis of reducing the number of vessels, but must also involve the voluntary reduction of operation time. These measures should, in any case, be permanently accompanied by adequate and general compensation and by training programmes and aid for retraining.</p>
<p class="contents">The report argues in favour of tighter controls on third‐country vessels and on the so‐called flags of convenience, as regards both access to resources and landing. In this respect, it calls for compulsory satellite control of these vessels in Community waters and the correction of the imbalance between the controls carried out in Community waters and those carried out in international waters.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the recourse to greater certification of products landed and marketed in the EU is decisive. Tighter controls on their origin are necessary and we must take into account the social and environmental conditions of their production methods, the minimum size requirements for the species and the health and hygiene standards required in the EU. Tighter controls on transport from landing to the final point of sale are also required in order to make it possible to reliably ascertain the origin and legal situation of products on the market.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur and Parliament now hope that the Commission and the Council will take due note of all the policy guidelines approved today. If followed, these may contribute positively to improving the implementation of the common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I must thank all my colleagues for their contributions to the drafting of this report and I must particularly thank all the secretariat of the Committee on Fisheries for its diligence in preparing this report.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">McMahon </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Madam President, Mr Novo has produced a very interesting report. It is apposite in a week when we have been talking about control of the finances and the activities of the European Union, that here at the tail end of the session we should be discussing control of one of the most important policies and one of the few common policies we have, namely the common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has produced a five‐year plan for the common fisheries policy over the next five years. When my party formed the presidency of the Council last year under the chairmanship of Jack Cunningham and Elliot Morley control and supervision of control was made a high priority. It is very important because nothing brings the Union into greater disrepute – and we have seen that this week – than to have disputes and allegations of bribery and cheating. Fishing is an area where a great deal of this goes on. Indeed, in my constituency only last year a Spanish trawler was arrested and impounded in Greenock for illegal fishing off the coast of Ireland. No doubt Scottish and Irish vessels have been impounded elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">All fishermen, irrespective of nationality, are very adept at bending rules to their own advantage and blaming it on the foreigner, blaming it on the Irishman or the Dane or the Spaniard. This happens throughout the Union and it is important that the Commission and the Member States get together and establish some common rules and some common responsibilities. Member States must face up to their responsibilities and we in Parliament must play our part by ensuring that sufficient resources are voted into inspection and surveillance.</p>
<p class="contents">It is apposite too that Mr Novo is the rapporteur because Portugal has a second‐to‐none scheme of satellite surveillance which our Committee on Fisheries visited only last year. I was very impressed when I saw how they carry out surveillance by satellite and then send spotter planes out. They can take photographs of ships and if they are in the wrong area they can be taken to task and the fishermen can be fined in the courts. It is a very successful method.</p>
<p class="contents">My own government has introduced a designated port scheme which will stop the landing of illegal fish. This has been a serious problem in the United Kingdom. The Fish Merchants Association in Aberdeen has lobbied me about this. It is worried about the impact of illegal fish on price in the North of Scotland. These are some of the areas which are mentioned in the report. It is a very good report. The Commission has a produced a reasonable working document and hopefully together, Parliament's Committee on Fisheries, the Commission and the Council – who must face up to their responsibilities in this – will bring about proper control of the common fisheries policy.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Cushnahan </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – Madam President, the success of the common fisheries policy depends on effective monitoring and strict enforcement. This applies both to non‐EU vessels and to the fleets of Member States. Some fisheries resources have been badly depleted by over‐fishing which threatens the current livelihood of fishermen and of fishing communities, which are often in the poorest peripheral regions of the EU. Equally important, it threatens their long‐term future.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome this report. I believe the rapporteur is correct to criticise certain Member States for failing to supply adequate data. It is totally unacceptable that vessels in the Mediterranean are exempt from the obligation to keep logs and declarations of catch in contrast to the requirements placed on vessels in other EU waters. It is supposed to be a common fisheries policy, therefore common rules and obligations should apply to all equally.</p>
<p class="contents">We must improve the methods of monitoring and impose stronger penalties for breaches. Further cooperation between the Commission and the Member States is needed to achieve an effective implementation of the control of EU fisheries policy, even if the responsibility for the control is on Member States. This cooperation will not be complete if we exclude the main actors affected by the fisheries policy, namely fishermen, producers' organisations and vessel owners.</p>
<p class="contents">Since control measures might harm the industry, we also must support the rapporteur's plea for the issuing of new compensatory training and reconversion measures. It is also vitally important that Member States should allow access for Community inspectors to their waters, allowing for a complete and more effective cooperation between national and European authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, an effective control of the CFP would also be incomplete if no measures are taken in the marketing of sea products. Size control should also be a ‘must" when we consider the design of an effective control policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to make a point in relation to my own country. The Irish navy has the responsibility of policing some 20 % of EU coastal waters. Despite the meagre resources at its disposal it does an exceptionally excellent job. While the EU has been helpful in providing additional resources, more is always necessary. The reason I underline this point is that the role of the Irish navy is not an Irish one; it is undertaking a European task. The Commission should provide much more resources because the task that they are doing will certainly improve the lot of fishermen throughout the EU.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hudghton </span> <span class="bold">(ARE).</span> – Madam President, the Commission action plan on monitoring, if its aims come to fruition, is a positive move towards improving implementation of the common fisheries policy. I suspect, however, that the enforcement of the CFP, despite repeated efforts, remains ineffective. I am sure we could all quote examples of that. It is thus important to stress the need for monitoring to be effective throughout the Community and not just in certain Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Uniform application of monitoring methods and standards of implementation must persist throughout the European Community and the disparities that exist should be brought to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end I welcome the recent adoption of a regulation seeking to establish a control system applicable to the CFP emphasising the use of Community inspectors in addition to national inspectors. The use of new technologies in improving implementation is a step forward but clearly such methods should be financed properly and equally across Member States. It is little wonder, for instance, that Scottish fishermen get annoyed when they are prevented from accessing support available to fishermen of other Member States. In my view such inequalities undermine the objectives of the CFP.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree strongly with the report where it states that standard penalties for the same offences should be the norm throughout the Community. The fair and consistent application of controls is important but, again agreeing with the report, the system of controls must be an integral part of all the measures implementing the CFP. There must be a wider approach to fisheries which includes transparency, cooperation and harmonisation of data and administrative documents. A fundamental prerequisite for successful implementation is the greater involvement of the fishing industry in the entire process from decision‐making to implementation. This is something we must strive to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">The UK's designated port scheme may have been well‐intentioned but it has not been helpful to those ports which have not been designated but which do, in fact, have fish processing activity, which is important to these communities.</p>

<p class="contents">The deliberations by Mr Novo and the Committee on Fisheries on the need to improve the implementation of the common fisheries policy have highlighted four main proposals that we fully support.</p>
<p class="contents">The first proposal relates to the issue of controls. These must be fair and new technologies must therefore be used. However, this issue cannot be considered in isolation or without extensively involving the industry.</p>
<p class="contents">The second proposal involves the need for very vigorous international action so that the measures allowing responsible fishing are applied to both third country fishermen and to Community fishermen, so that our fishermen are not penalised.</p>
<p class="contents">The third proposal refers to the priority to be given to research, which will prevent dubious decisions being taken that are devoid of scientific basis, such as happened recently with the decisions on drift gillnets.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the fourth proposal requires a strong political will to ensure that the fisheries sector is no longer the poor relation of the Community budget and that it is finally recognised as a specific asset of the EU countries. In our opinion, these proposals are therefore excellent and we will vote in favour of this report.</p>

<p class="contents">Concentrating on the two specific issues in this report, the Commission agrees with Parliament"s idea of the need for overall consistency in the common fisheries policy. Efforts should be made to control all activities in the fisheries sector and this should be done fairly. The Commission also agrees with Parliament on the importance of transparency and cooperation, both among Member States and with the Commission. In addition, this is reflected both in the plan itself as well as in our proposal to amend the control regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Other elements in the report have already been covered in the amendments to the control regulation adopted by the Council in December. We were able to discuss this in relation to Mr Teverson"s report, which you have approved. It is a matter of strengthening post‐landing controls, strengthening cooperation between Member States and the Commission, tightening controls on third country vessels and even using new technology such as satellite controls. Lastly, there is also the matter of harmonising the concepts of infringements and penalties. This was also debated at that time but at the moment is rather far removed.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the issues addressed in the report are linked to decisions to be made in a different context, as they relate to monitoring fisheries. I am referring to matters such as European Social Fund allocations for training in the fisheries sector, or controls in international waters, which are, in principle, dealt with by the competent regional fisheries authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The same can be said of the Community financial contribution towards expenditure incurred by the Member States in implementing control systems, as governed by Decision 95/527. Your report also mentions controls to be carried out before fisheries controls relating to scientific research into the state of resources. We support this idea and agree with your opinion, although we will address this issue in a different manner.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the rest, ladies and gentlemen, we believe it is especially important that the fisheries sector participate in these initiatives in order to increase its level of cooperation and to promote better information. We have laid the foundations for adopting common parameters which will be useful for measuring the capacity and the size of the Community"s fleets. We were also involved in a debate with the Member States and made commitments on a number of questions that centred on a common definition of inspection. The Commission notes Parliament"s comments regarding the content of the list of pilot schemes, which it believes to be biased as it centres too much on certain areas. We will closely examine the possibility of improving the Mediterranean"s situation and we will keep an open mind.</p>
