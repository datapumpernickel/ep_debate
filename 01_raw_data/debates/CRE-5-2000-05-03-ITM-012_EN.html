Examined in human and economic terms, Moldova is faring very badly. The social situation is chaotic and democratic progress painfully slow. A civil war and the repercussions of the economic crisis in Russia have been paralysing the country for a long time now. Industry is still underdeveloped and unevenly distributed regionally. A modest export trade is based on the sale of agricultural produce to neighbouring regions. A look at the figures will show the level of desperation that exists. Since 1992, the Moldovan economy has shrunk by almost 70%. Life expectancy has fallen dramatically, and, according to a study undertaken last year by the UN, 50% of the people live below the absolute poverty line.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission deserves praise for having proposed a considerable increase in financial aid to Moldova at the suggestion of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Bilateral financial aid via the TACIS programme has been reasonably successful. A big step forward is particularly visible in the areas of local administrative training, the weeding out of corruption, and the promotion of exports and agriculture. This, however, is not enough. More financial aid must be made available if we are to solve the problem in macro-financial terms. This involves developing democracy and establishing a proper financial and economic policy. Positive action to develop Moldova must be supported with measures that boost the democratic system. The Commission must see to it that the additional funding is used properly, flexibly and in a way that strengthens the basic structures of society.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the biggest economic problem in Moldova is its dependence on Russia, the new EU aid action must aim at severing this dependence. For example, Moldova relies totally on Russian imports of energy, and is consequently tied by a leash to Russian energy companies. The circle can only be broken by establishing Moldova’s own energy sector and the diversification of its export trade. The other problem with regard to Russia is connected with the withdrawal of troops from Moldovan territory. The EU must do all it can to make it clear to the Duma that withdrawing Russian troops from Moldova would enhance the country’s stability. Furthermore, talks on dismantling Russian missiles stockpiled in Moldova must be pushed through immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">My report was unanimously adopted in committee. There were good and sensible additions made to it by the Committee on Budgets. I hope that this spirit of consensus will be present too in tomorrow’s sitting.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union is granting different forms of economic aid to different countries. Macro-financial aid is one of the most important, in addition to which equivalent forms of aid can be given in the form of European Investment Bank guarantees and Euratom loans. There is, however, a ceiling to this provision of loans, which has been determined in interinstitutional agreements. That is a maximum annual figure of EUR 200 million from the Guarantee Fund. This causes problems for possible new loans from the European Union, because this ceiling is inflexible. The present loan and guarantee decisions might lead to a situation where this ceiling is easily exceeded, if something unexpected happens. I would therefore think that, from the point of view of the Committee on Budgets, it is important that the Commission should make a multiannual assessment of likely future fund requirements, which would serve as a general guide. The aim should be that Parliament and the Council agree on priorities concerning the use of left-over margins, and that a procedure should be agreed in order to make any changes to these principles.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of macro-financial aid, the Commission appears to have considerable faith in the ability of the international institutions – the IMF and the World Bank – to evaluate the economic situation in whatever countries are concerned. The role of these institutions is perhaps too important, and the Commission often automatically accepts conditions imposed by others on these loans. For this reason, I think that Mrs Matikainen-Kallström’s remarks and amendments are very important, as they take account of the fact that such areas as employment and social security should also be examined when determining how the money from loans should be spent.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The people once again find themselves living in poverty. The average monthly per capita income in Moldova is only approximately EUR 30. Privatisation is making only slow headway and so far the country has not managed to entirely resolve the problem of integrating its Russian minority groups. It has still not achieved monetary or budgetary stability and Russian occupation troops are still stationed in part of the country, in Trans-Dnestr.</p>
<p class="contents">For days now, there has been a very real risk of all the lights going out in Moldova. The Russian energy company Gazprom suspended gas supplies because Moldova could not pay its bills in German Marks and US dollars. So we are quite literally witnessing this country’s almost desperate fight for economic survival and political existence.</p>
<p class="contents">Geographically, Moldova is a narrow strip of land between Ukraine and Romania. Many young Moldovans are looking towards the European Union. Some are studying at our universities and technical colleges thanks to funding from the European Union and its Member States. At home, most of them want Moldova to become more open to the European Union. How can we, the European Parliament, make it easier for Moldova to become more open? The macro-economic financial assistance, which the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats firmly support, is an important step towards building up the necessary confidence in the Moldovan administration system and thereby consolidating its budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the aid under the TACIS programmes must concentrate more on vocational training, education and improving the totally outmoded transport, communications and energy infrastructure. Small crafts and services businesses can only be started up if there are prospects of improving the framework conditions for competition and investment, which is only feasible in the long term with the help of the European Union. But Moldova must also know where it wants to go. Does it want to remain in a state of insecurity because it relies so heavily on cheap Russian raw materials, which it cannot even pay for yet, and also remain incapable of reform in many areas, which would mean tying its long-term future to the imponderables of Russian economic and social development? Or does it want to follow the example of Romania and resolutely tread the long and difficult road of economic reforms and closer cooperation with the European Union? In that case, it also deserves stronger support on our part. That support must be conditional on a radical modernisation of its economy and administration. We hope Moldova will opt for renewal and for Europe.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has guided this ‘child’ in difficult circumstances, for which I thank her. When we talk of transitional economies we might ask where these economies are really going. It seems that the direction is not always clear. Moldova imports all its raw materials from abroad and is very dependent on energy imports. One tenth of its GNP goes on a bill from just one Russian company, Gazprom, which – as the previous speaker said – is switching out the lights in the state of Moldova. There is therefore a stranglehold on energy that does not just affect Moldova but also its neighbour, Ukraine; and Belarus, too, for that matter. Consequently, this phenomenon has a broader political significance, which may create tension in this region, and which we will then have to attempt to relieve.</p>
<p class="contents">Moldova’s need for finance will be huge in the years to come. The Russian crisis on 17 August 1998 had an enormous effect on Moldova. It has become a ragamuffin state. The basic pension is just one fifth of the heating costs of one small flat. No nation can live and function like that. The balance of trade surplus is a massive 23 – 25%. As has been said, Russian troops are in the region of Trans-Dnestr, Lebed’s famous 14th army, not all of it, but nonetheless it has some influence.</p>
<p class="contents">We obviously support the loan decision and the line the report adopts, the macro-financial assistance, but this will not be enough. We are taking stability eastwards, so that we will not have to import instability from there. The next zone of enlargement, the following zone of candidate countries, will be the one we shall have to concentrate on. We have to create an area of special action, of which Moldova will be a part, and we have to help them. We therefore have to create an Eastern programme, to run alongside the current round of enlargement, which will help these countries – Moldova, Ukraine, Belarus and Russia – at a stage when we are receiving new members, so that no new curtain falls between these states.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has got to grips with the issue in a comprehensive way and raised some important issues connected with it. Our Group supports the rapporteur’s views. As has been said here several times, the situation in Moldova is extremely difficult. Although a little headway has been made in the areas of administrative development, social pluralism, and human rights, the economic and social situation is still extremely grave. The country’s economy has shrunk by around two thirds in the last ten years alone. Discrepancies in income have grown wildly and half the population lives below the poverty line.</p>
<p class="contents">Development in Moldova depends essentially on whether the country can achieve political, social and economic stability. It will be extremely hard for Moldova to overcome its huge problems without foreign assistance. The Union’s support for Moldova is thus in place. The EUR 15 million loan now to be made must be coordinated with assistance from the IMF and other international agencies with the aim of boosting Moldova’s social and economic stability. It is also important that the Commission guarantees the aid by attaching certain economic conditions to it, so that it is used properly in the right areas, for example, in improving administration, organising basic civil services and increasing economic efficiency. Later, we have to ensure that the conditions have been fulfilled properly and that the country is progressing along the path of democracy and that people’s living conditions are improving. The report’s proposal for the possibility of revising the financial perspective to increase the amount of funds in the guarantee reserve is also in order.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Moldova is still living proof of this. Ever since its conception in 1991, it has been faced with intransigent separatism from the Dnestr Republic. And we ought to remind ourselves of the Russian military presence in that republic, which is again completely at odds with repeated international withdrawal obligations on the part of Moscow. Faced with a double challenge in internal and external politics between being absorbed by Romania or by Russia, the political élite and the electorate of this small former Soviet Republic opted without hesitation in favour of its own independence in 1994. It did so precisely because of Moldova’s political unity. This commendable strategy of phasing out internal and external hotbeds has made room for, among other things, the autonomous statute of the minority population of the Gagauz and the border treaty with neighbouring Ukraine which is less than one year old. These achievements, however, cannot begin to conceal Moldova’s extremely difficult transformation process from ex-Soviet Republic to democratic constitutional state based on a social market economy. In terms of energy supply and a market for its goods, Moldova is extremely dependent on the Russian Federation. As such, Chisinau is looking to the West for financial support for modernisation. Hence the present, third request for macro-financial support from the European Union. </p>
<p class="contents">Given the level of exchange rate stability and internal currency stability achieved by Moldova, I can go along with this. However, I have two questions. What has been the effect of the European Union’s two previous capital injections into that country? Could the Commission be specific about this? Also, Amendment No 1 tabled by the competent Committee seems to clash with the objective of this specific long-term loan. Needless to say, I too much prefer giving the average Moldovan citizen financial support rather than lining the pockets of the Gazprom bigshots! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union is prepared to invest EUR 15 million, equivalent to SEK 120 million, in a long-term loan. The desire is for this to be given to Europe’s poorest country, which has a gross national product as low as that of the poorest countries in Africa. </p>
<p class="contents">Moldova is a country where the community, or society, has abdicated responsibility in a number of areas. The average wage among State employees is MDL 230, which is to say approximately SEK 150 or about EUR 19. The lowest pension is a mere quarter of this, or MDL 64. Because the State’s finances have been completely undermined, neither State employees nor pensioners receive their payments on time. Many have to wait for over a year for their money, and sometimes even longer. </p>
<p class="contents">Moldova is a deeply tragic example of the devastating consequences of Soviet Communism, an appalling ideology which has destroyed whole societies, countries and peoples spiritually, morally, socially and economically. What we see fully revealed here is the harvest of the dragon’s teeth sown by communism. </p>
<p class="contents">According to the Swedish professor, Per Ronnås, Moldova has seen a more devastating peacetime fall in its standard of living than any other country in modern times. At the same time, all the intelligence about people’s exposure to extensive torture by the police, involving electric shocks and suffocation with the aid of plastic bags placed over the head, is a very serious source of concern. </p>
<p class="contents">Moldova is today experiencing general migration. A quarter of the country’s four million people are estimated to have travelled abroad in search of work. Many poor and destitute girls have ended up in the hands of crime syndicates which degrade them and exploit them sexually. We can do nothing other than support this country, Europe’s very poorest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solbes Mira,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mrs Matikainen-Kallström for her report and all of you for the sensitivity you have shown with regard to such a serious problem as Moldova. I note that the sensitivity of the different political groups is in line with the sensitivity of the Commission when it made the proposal for supplementary macroeconomic assistance for Moldova and, in this respect, we are especially grateful for their support.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that today, we are talking about macro-financial assistance, therefore, with clearly defined objectives, which will undoubtedly improve the financial room for manoeuvre so that we can tackle the other difficulties such as those which you have raised during tonight’s debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the amendments presented in the report, the Commission has no difficulty in accepting Amendments Nos 1 to 4 referring to the final objective of the aid, the need for a coherent approach in our various instruments for Community assistance and the need for social balance in that assistance. Therefore, the Commission will support these amendments in the Council and I hope they can be taken forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I would suggest to the rapporteur and honourable Members that they reflect further on the remaining amendments. Amendments Nos 5, 6 and 8 advocate the establishment of a new committee to control this type of aid. In our opinion this initiative would be excessively bureaucratic and would not make sense. Macro-financial assistance is usually granted for periods of one year, it is not always renewed, it is granted in different areas, different countries, according to the circumstances and we believe, therefore, that the current system of concentrating its control in a particular body, the Economic and Financial Committee, makes sense since this is the group of people with the greatest experience and knowledge of the control and management of this type of aid. I would remind you that the Economic and Financial Committee is not a normal committee. It is a committee provided for in the Treaties which, in practice, consists of personal representatives of the Ministers for Economic and Financial Affairs. In our view these are the people who really have the ability to carry out this management. The creation of specific ad hoc committees would achieve less and would not be as effective as the current model.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to make another comment on Amendment No 9, which asks us – and I suspect that it also coincides with Mr Belder’s demand – whether we can provide information on the effectiveness of aid. We agree that the Commission should report on what we must do, but what causes us difficulty is the idea that this should be done before 15 September. By definition, macro-financial assistance includes a series of general economic indicators, which are not always available at that time. In some cases they will be available to us, in other cases they will not. We think it is much more reasonable that the Commission’s obligation should refer to the whole year and that we should be allowed greater room for manoeuvre between 15 September and 31 December to present these reports. We believe they will be of better quality if we have additional time available to us.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s concern, as I see it, that it should be provided with figures for the budgetary debate should not cause any difficulty, since every six months, a report is sent to the budgetary authority on the guarantees covered by the general budget along with an annual report on the management of the Guarantee Fund. By means of both reports, the Commission will have access to all the necessary budgetary information. Nevertheless, in order to assess the aid we should be allowed more time.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to make a comment on Mr Seppänen’s concerns regarding the budgetary availability of resources for this type of aid. In our view, there is no difficulty. We believe that this type of aid can be dealt with by means of the current budgetary resources. It is true that, in the future, we will possibly have to debate whether the current priorities and our financial room for manoeuvre are coherent or not, but we do not think that this is a debate which can be held in relation to a specific report; rather it will require a much more profound and more general debate, which we will be happy to take part in at this Parliament’s convenience. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
