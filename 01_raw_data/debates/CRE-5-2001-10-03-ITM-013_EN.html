<p class="contents">What is this report about? It is about the question of precontractual information on home loans. We are in the process of creating an EU internal market by 2005, and one of the objectives is that in future cross-border home loans should be offered and taken up by customers.</p>
<p class="contents">An agreement in the matter has been reached at European level between consumer associations and banking associations. We need that to be put into effect relatively quickly. It would be gratifying if that were to happen in less than twelve months. I would like at this point to expressly highlight the positive role played by the Commission, which managed to bring the two sides together repeatedly and in the end achieve a result in this difficult moderation process.</p>
<p class="contents">This may become the first positive example of self-regulation in the European Union. But there are still things that need to be done. First, we must look at the moderation process itself. It took about four years and according to some participants was not always very transparent. We call on the Commission to report to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs about the experience gained from this moderation process and the conclusions to be drawn for future self-regulation processes. As I have already said, it may be a positive example. But if it proves not to be a positive example of self-regulation, the Commission really will have to put forward its own proposal for a directive. A few points are still outstanding here.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, of course, we need a commitment not only from the banking associations, but we need a Europe-wide commitment from the banks themselves. The extent to which the banks will participate is an open question here.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the register that is published must of course also be posted on the Internet. We also need similar forms throughout Europe. It is already foreseeable that some Member States that were very keen on producing a standard form, especially at the outset, will want to go their own way and may take a different route in future. At all events, comparability must be preserved here, in the interests of the customer. We ought to try to extend this agreement to the candidate countries. We should also extend the mediation body you have just mentioned, Commissioner, to this field. We should not retain the internal mediation body proposed in the agreements, but follow the Commission’s initiative here.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need comparability of data. The effective annual interest rate in particular is highly important for the consumer. The figure at the end is not the only important thing, but the basis on which it is calculated, too. The effective annual interest rate is still calculated in different ways in Europe. We should work towards getting a uniform method of calculation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would very much welcome it if this did not have to come from the Commission, but if the banks themselves could manage to agree on a method within a very short space of time. We should then also apply all this to services offered over the Internet. We have, after all, just had the Huhne report, which also said we wanted to press forward with this. We should have this information there in future, too. And finally, as the Huhne report recommends, future legislation should be harmonised with the legal terms used in this code.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion I would like to stress that I very much welcome this voluntary code of conduct. It now requires critical appraisal and monitoring. We hope the Commission will before long present the Committee with a report on how successful the code has been and whether we can continue along that road or whether we must introduce legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is no doubt that work to reorganise and tidy up this rather confused sector has now begun. Unfortunately, some debatable if not downright censurable behaviour has been seen on the part of European lenders.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of the work that has been done lies essentially in the fact that for the first time a collection of indications and regulations is not the result of self-regulation, as has often happened in the past. I refer to the inter-bank agreements on conditions, in which the banks dictated the rules more so as not to have to face fierce competition within the sector rather than to set up transparent contractual schemes to supply to the end-customers, but by means of an agreement, even though a voluntary one, between banks and consumers’ associations.</p>
<p class="contents">Also important is the choice of transparency and publicity laid down in Articles 21, 22, 23 and 24 of the Code itself, and especially Article 25, which states that an offer made over the Internet should be made in accordance with the European scheme and in compliance with all the provisions and indications that are laid down.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to point out that this code will require further additions and corrections. The practical stage will be to give the necessary indications. I am just troubled by the fact that the committee did not accept an amendment I tabled to set a limit – the total amount – on the loan to be registered. My reason for this amendment was the fact that in some Member States the credit institutions triple the loan figure registered compared with the amount actually lent, which is doubly harmful to the consumer: first, there is a question of image, in that, to an inexperienced person the debt might appear to be three times as large as it really is; and secondly, a matter of costs, particularly notarial costs, which are calculated on the registered amount of the loan. I hope that in future this aspect can be reconsidered. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Completing the internal market for financial services and affording consumers a high level of protection is a Community priority. Signing a home loan agreement is often the most important and the biggest financial obligation a consumer takes on in his working life. We must therefore welcome the fact that a voluntary agreement has been reached at European level between banking and consumer associations on the duty to provide precontractual information. That the code of conduct and the register of home loan providers to be kept by the Commission will also be made available on the Internet is also a positive move.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, in order to improve the comparability of consumer information, a precise definition of a common effective annual interest rate for home loans should be included in the European Standardised Information Sheet; it should be calculated in the same way throughout the Community and be consistent with the consumer protection directive. The information sheet should be designed to include all the data needed to check how the loan is calculated. This means, in particular, the manner in which advance and deferred interest is calculated. That is one of the most important consumer policy concerns in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also desirable for Parliament to be included in talks about voluntary agreements in future so that absolute transparency can be guaranteed in drawing up the code of conduct. I hope that this example of a voluntary agreement between market participants and consumer associations will prove successful so that it can be extended to other areas of financial services.</p>
<p class="contents">This will be a major contribution to the swift creation of the internal market in financial services. But since the consumer side has relatively few resources available, concrete measures must be taken if the voluntary agreement is not kept. Otherwise, the instrument of the voluntary agreement – a very good instrument in itself – might prove to be inexpedient because in the end the agreement is only kept by those who cause no problems anyway. That alone would not be enough and would be of no benefit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The voluntary code of conduct which underpins the Commission's recommendation is the very first example of an agreement reached between banking and consumer associations on the standardisation of information which must be made available to consumers before a contract is concluded. Its existence proves, as has rightly been pointed out in the resolution, that market participants are best placed to negotiate proper solutions and to ensure an appropriate balance of interests between contractual parties. But however well placed they might be, market participants need a neutral and indefatigable broker to accompany, and sometimes remotivate them, during the long and difficult negotiations of this code. Tribute has been paid by the rapporteur to the Commission's role and the Commission is duly appreciative and grateful to the rapporteur for that acknowledgement.</p>
<p class="contents">As agreed between and called for by all parties, the broker, that is, the Commission, will now transform itself into a notary and, if need be, into a referee. As a notary, the Commission will, in line with the resolution, keep a register of home-loan lenders who adhere to the code. That register will be kept up-to-date and made available online. I say this in particular to Mr Radwan who wanted this code to be on the Internet and it will be. It will be made available online on the Commission's website and appropriate transparency will therefore be ensured. During the negotiation phase the lack of appropriate transparency was deplored in the report. It is a point well taken by the Commission, but at least when the register is on the net then that transparency will be restored. That is with the Commission as a notary.</p>
<p class="contents">As a referee the Commission will monitor compliance with its recommendation and assess its effectiveness. The Commission made it clear in its recommendation that it will consider presenting binding legislation should the terms of its recommendation not be fully complied with. Parliament will, as is rightly called for in the resolution, be closely informed – that also is a point that was raised tonight – about our monitoring and compliance-assessment work.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that the code and our related recommendation will play a very significant role in the completion of the internal market for financial services to which Parliament regularly reiterates its support. I am also hopeful, like the rapporteur, that this pioneer initiative, once again the first of its kind, will not be a one-off experience. Its success will, however, depend on the commitment of all parties – and I am pleased to inform this Parliament that the number of companies having notified their adherence to the code is now already significant, although not entirely satisfactory in some Member States. I can assure Parliament that the Commission will work hard in order to ensure adherence of the entire sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr Ettl has put forward certain wishes. The Commission takes note of those wishes but would like to point out that this affair is restricted to precontractual information and therefore information on interest rates and so on is beyond the scope of this instrument. So the Commission takes note of what Mr Ettl has just said but it does not see its way to complying with those wishes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
