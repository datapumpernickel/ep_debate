<p class="contents">In June 2010, the Council asked the Commission to develop a European strategy for the Atlantic region by June 2011. I took the initiative, together with a number of fellow Members, to put an oral question to the Commission about this strategy. This oral question was initially signed by over 50 MEPs from all the groups, and I would like to thank them for their support.</p>
<p class="contents">A motion for a resolution will also be tabled on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development. I would like to thank the coordinators of the various political groups for their cooperation, which has allowed us to obtain a broad-based consensus. I would also like to thank those Members who have enhanced this text by contributing amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Atlantic region has its own specific characteristics. In the first instance, it is, of course, a dynamic maritime area, in view of the maritime transport, fisheries and marine energy it is home to. It is also an area with a fragile environment that must be preserved – take the green algae problem for instance – and one that is affected by the consequences of climate change. In addition, it is an outlying area of the European Union that is characterised by access and connectivity problems and by a low number of major city centres.</p>
<p class="contents">These particular characteristics give rise to problems that go beyond national borders and for which political solutions must be sought at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament resolution therefore asks the Commission to propose that the strategy for the Atlantic region should take the form of an integrated strategy dealing with both maritime and land-based issues. The maritime aspect is vital, as the Atlantic regions share the common feature of being close to the sea. Links with the integrated maritime policy should therefore be encouraged.</p>
<p class="contents">The land-based aspect of these strategies is just as important. This concerns issues such as improving access and communications, developing urban and rural areas and strengthening land-sea links. This strategy for the Atlantic region could be incorporated into the ‘territorial cooperation’ cohesion policy objective and could be based on an integrated, cross-domain and territorial approach.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim should be to coordinate policy more effectively between the different governance levels, with particular focus on the most relevant issues. The strategy should encompass all the EU regions with an Atlantic coastline, including the adjacent sub-basins and the outermost regions in Macaronesia.</p>
<p class="contents">It will also be important to take the strategy’s external dimension into consideration, especially in the areas of maritime safety and surveillance and international trade relations. The strategy for the Atlantic region must facilitate stronger coordination of goals and resources by linking in with the EU 2020 strategy and with EU policy for 2014 and beyond.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not a case of spending more, but of spending more wisely, by fostering the Atlantic dimension of our existing policies. To do this, the strategy must tie in with regional policy and with the integrated maritime policy. It must also attempt to develop links with other policies such as trans-European transport networks, the common fisheries policy, tourism, environmental protection, energy policy and the research and development framework programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The strategy should be introduced in 2014 and coordinated with the next multiannual financial framework. The land-based aspect of the strategy will contribute towards the EU’s territorial cohesion objective, primarily through actions to promote better access and communications. These aspects will naturally need to be tied in with maritime policy in order to develop land-sea links in these regions. It is essential that we strengthen North-South connections along our Atlantic seaboard, in particular, by creating motorways of the sea running from Andalusia to Scotland. At the same time, West-East transport infrastructure will need to be developed, along the lines of the high-speed train line model.</p>
<p class="contents">I call upon the Commission to propose an action plan setting out its priorities through concrete actions as quickly as possible, with a view to implementing these actions in coordination with EU policies for 2013 and beyond. It will also be essential to get the many partners concerned on board, especially local and regional public bodies and civil society organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Cooperation within the framework of the strategy for the Atlantic region must be based, first and foremost, on the needs of the stakeholders concerned. A consensus must therefore be reached on the political priorities that are established within this framework. In this respect, the European Grouping for Territorial Cooperation could be a useful instrument for fostering cooperation between stakeholders in the Atlantic region.</p>
<p class="contents">This summarises the outcome of Parliament’s discussions on this strategy. We will be paying close attention to the Commission’s forthcoming proposals and will certainly make a clear, concrete contribution to them.</p>

I very much welcome his ideas. I would like also to thank the Members of the European Parliament who have subscribed to this oral question. We are now working on the preparation of a maritime strategy for the Atlantic. I would like to inform the House that I am determined to propose a well-targeted strategy in order to put maritime affairs at the top of the agenda in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I also recognise that this area brings a solid heritage of significant environmental importance and has many committed stakeholders. I have encouraged all those stakeholders, including the Atlantic, coastal and maritime regions and economic sectors, to give strong support to the strategy. They have already shown good support during its preparation phase. I will continue to encourage them to fully engage in its adoption procedure. This will be vital for the strategy’s success.</p>
<p class="contents">The public consultation has shown us that an Atlantic identity does exist. It has also shown that stakeholders welcome an approach that takes into account their geographical, demographic and economic specificities. They also support measures that bring coastal states together on matters such as marine knowledge, maritime surveillance, special planning and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The feedback we have received during the consultation will also allow us to identify priorities for EU actions in the field of regional development and research during the coming months. The Atlantic strategy will establish concrete policy objectives by providing for cross-fertilisation between all the maritime sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">A key priority will be to create jobs on the ground. This will require full commitment and active participation by Member States, the Conference of Peripheral Maritime Regions, Atlantic regions and the maritime industries. The assistance on these matters of members of the European Parliament, in their constituencies, is therefore of the utmost importance and value.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, to ensure maximum visibility, I am proposing that we plan for adoption after the discussion on the reform of the common fisheries policy. In this way, we will be sure that the initiative gets the appropriate exposure, and we can also include the regional dimension of the new, reformed, common fisheries policy. Parliament’s position also has to be taken fully into account.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the Atlantic strategy will help, firstly, to promote sustainable growth and jobs in the region through EU research programmes and regional development programmes, secondly, to achieve the objectives of the reformed common fisheries policy and, thirdly, to achieve progress in protecting the environment and, at the same time, to develop the maritime economy in a sustainable manner in this vital region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, thank you for your initiatives on developing a maritime strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">On close examination of this paper, it seems to me that our role is, above all, to address the things that we could together be doing better. I totally understand the point that we are not seeking to build new structures. In fact, coastal regions, and anyone who is involved with this issue in the individual Member States or is working on this issue with other Member States, should take up that policy and ensure that we do not end up with a new administrative level, somewhere between the European Commission, the European Union and Member States. It is important to make that preliminary remark.</p>
<p class="contents">However, let us look at the disparate things that maritime policy encompasses – here, I am thinking of transport, and of all the new methods that are relevant in that respect, the environment, the economy and, indeed, you have talked about sustainable development, the EU 2020 strategy, the energy challenge and, of course, the revision of our positions on fisheries. All those things together underline the necessity of supporting the opportunities and potential of the Atlantic coast. May I add another point to this? In this House, I help represent the Netherlands, one of our Member States. We have now addressed the Baltic, the Atlantic Arc, the Danube and the Mediterranean, and what remains to be covered? A coastline strip of Norway, the Netherlands, a chunk of Germany, Denmark, in short, the North Sea. Now, my question to the Commissioner is: if you want to work with macro-regions geographically, should the next step not be accepting and addressing this? One more sentence to conclude, please. At the end of this week, the CPMR [Conference of Peripheral Maritime Regions] Committee on the North Sea will be meeting. It will be putting forward that proposal in Middelburg. Could you just comment on that? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Likewise, all the regions included in the Atlantic Arc –and I would like to highlight the particularly active role being played by my home region, Cantabria, in Spain – have been working to promote cooperation in areas of common interest within the framework of the Conference of Peripheral Maritime Regions since 1989.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we believe the time has come to formulate an Atlantic strategy as soon as possible. This should be defined as part of the Europe 2020 strategy to protect the environment and biodiversity, fight climate change, promote sustainable urban and rural development, stimulate the responsible growth of the knowledge economy, tourism, marine research and innovation, renewable energies, sea transport and training, to improve access to our territories by developing new sea routes, improve infrastructure networks and develop information and communication technologies, and to encourage online working.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Conference of Peripheral Maritime Regions of Europe (CPRM) has rightly said – and I should like to thank this institution for all its good work – the current economic crisis, coupled with the need to take action against the challenge of climate change, opens the way to a new, genuinely sustainable development model in the European Union. This strategy is important for the regions included in the Atlantic Arc, but not just for them: it is important for the EU as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in Parliament supports this macro-regional approach and was actively involved in this resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are concerned with here are improvements to the protection of the seas and the environment, and naturally also maritime affairs and fisheries – but it goes beyond this into lots of other areas, and three pillars in particular. The first of these is cooperation between Member States, so that synergies can be better exploited. Secondly, the Atlantic links the EU Member States and regions bordering the Atlantic with transatlantic partners such as Canada and the US and with other neighbouring countries such as Norway and Iceland. Thirdly, it is also concerned with bringing about closer links between stakeholders in the regions.</p>
<p class="contents">We should emphasise the aspect of bringing together and networking towns and communities, regions, Member States and, above all, citizens, civil society and businesses, so that these actors can bring this framework – that is, the macro-regional strategy – to life. After all, the intention is not to create new institutions or new bodies; the idea is to have an effect using existing funding. The resources that exist are bound to contain unexploited synergies and opportunities that can be used as a basis for our activities.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely because of this that the ALDE Group considers this strategy to be urgently needed, because it affects international trade. Goods from all over the world come across the Atlantic into the European Union. Naturally, this trade must take place in an ecologically sustainable way. Moreover, there are likely to be large reserves of raw materials in the Atlantic that we may be able to utilise, provided there is sustainable protection for the environment. We call on the Commission to draw up and submit a strategy for this area as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sometimes it is fisheries, sometimes farming, sometimes maritime transport, energy or tourism that sets the agenda. Regional sea strategies such as the Atlantic or Baltic strategies should be a tool to coordinate and to help identify priority objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">We must remember that some policies such as fisheries and agriculture are mostly decided at EU level, but with environmental policies, it is Member States that are mostly responsible. I therefore believe that the EU integrated maritime policy has an important role to play. An efficient system of so-called marine spatial planning will be key to prioritising objectives and will guide managers, policy makers and stakeholders.</p>
<p class="contents">Cooperation with other States in the Atlantic region is also absolutely essential; in order, for instance, to decrease the amount of microscopic plastic debris, to fight illegal fishing or to ensure that fisheries and environmental regulations are effectively controlled and enforced.</p>
<p class="contents">We all depend on healthy seas and good environmental status. That will benefit all sectoral interests, not least fisheries and tourism.

Following on from the Danube region macro-strategy, we now have the strategy for the Atlantic Ocean on the table. However, in this instance, the situation is rather specific. The European Union has directed its attention towards the Atlantic Ocean for some time now, and this has been within the framework of developing cross-border and transnational cooperation. The Atlantic Ocean region was a supported territory under the INTERREG III B programme; it is also an integral part of the current territorial cooperation programme (Objective 3). Under these supportive programmes, the priority has been to expand regional development strategies at a transnational level, and then to provide support for transport systems and improved access to information society, environmental protection and natural resources, and economic integration, especially of peripheral regions.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be highly desirable to first evaluate the existing programmes and their benefits, and then to create a new strategy for this region taking these findings into account. Moreover, we should not forget to include trans-Atlantic relations in this strategy. Whether we like it or not, we are part of a Euro-Atlantic civilisation and we all share the same values. Just as they are doing on the other side of the ocean, here we are striving for a territory without barriers and with free movement of goods, people and services. Yet, despite the fact that the goals of the United States of America and the European Union are, in many ways, complementary, there is often minimal coordination. Therefore, it is desirable to provide requirements for trans-Atlantic cooperation in European programmes and policies. More ambitious cooperation and better coordination within the European strategy for the Atlantic region could, in this respect, try to cover a more ambitious agenda, since voluntary, practical cooperation on common issues could significantly help in strengthening trans-Atlantic relations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, there is the importance of ecologically sustainable fishing and, secondly, there is the question of how important it is for the EU not to extend the fisheries agreement with Morocco, which is illegal under international law.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards fishing, we currently have a situation where more than 70% of the marine fishing areas in the world are overfished. This is also the case in the EU. However, since the EU represents the rich part of the world, we import 60% of all the fish that is consumed in the Union. This means that people in poorer countries do not have access to the protein- and nutrient-rich food that fish represents.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue that I would like to highlight is, once again, how important it is for the EU not to renew the fisheries agreement with Morocco, which provides the EU with fish from the Atlantic off the coast of Western Sahara. Morocco has occupied Western Sahara since 1975 and 160 000 people currently live in refugee camps there. According to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Morocco’s occupation of Western Sahara lacks legal basis and therefore, Morocco has no right to the natural resources of Western Sahara.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, the question of ecologically sustainable fishing must be given high priority in the Commission’s strategy for the Atlantic region. Furthermore, the strategy must involve the EU, once and for all, showing respect for international law and not extending the fisheries agreement with Morocco. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fish stocks in the North Sea, part of the Atlantic, have been ruined by discards, which must be abolished. They should never have been contemplated in the first place.</p>
<p class="contents">UK fishermen have carefully looked after fish stocks in their own territorial waters while others have ruined theirs by overfishing. No wonder the CFP was welcomed by other Member States, whose fishermen could not wait to get into the North Sea. One needs more territorial exclusion, not less. In my own region – the East Midlands – the fishermen of Boston have fished the Wash for generations, looking after the fish stocks and making sure that their trawl nets do not disturb the sea bed, for they know that this is where the immature shellfish develop and that this is where the creatures form the bottom of the food chain.</p>
<p class="contents">This is their livelihood. Now they are forbidden to fish, on the pretext that their trawls damage the sea bottom. Meanwhile, a Dutch vessel is licensed to hoover up a million tonnes of gravel from the same sea bed, while E.ON is to dig a trench right through to the open sea to lay the line for a useless offshore wind farm. How much damage will all that do to the sea bed? How much longer will these fishermen be forced to stand by and watch their fishing grounds reduced to nothing while they are reduced to being benefit claimants? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If around 20% of all Chinese goods come by sea via the Panama Canal, this project will undoubtedly also have an effect on the Union’s strategy for Latin America.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not overlook the fact that the Atlantic also plays a major role when it comes to flows of refugees. Since the Spanish border fence was erected in 2005, for example, people smuggling networks from Africa have evaded it by transiting through the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. In this respect, the unrest in the Arab world will also have effects. In the coming months, the tens of thousands of refugees that have so far landed on the coasts of Europe could be just a drop in the ocean compared to what we face in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, it would be sensible for the European Union to become active on the Mediterranean coast of Africa, but also on the Atlantic coast. The principle of accommodating refugees as close as possible to their home country should apply. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a region that has two major, related characteristics: its oceanic-maritime nature and its peripheral character.</p>
<p class="contents">I will make four points. Firstly, I would stress the importance of its maritime aspect, because of which, the strategy must attach importance to the preservation of the marine environment, fishing, the environment, energies related to this marine environment, and tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, given the peripheral nature of the region, transport – so-called ‘connectivity’ – is very important, both between the areas that make up the Atlantic region and, above all, with the rest of the European Union. The trans-European transport networks, the highways of the sea and energy connections must be given priority. With regard to Galicia, my constituency, I also have in mind the high-speed connection with the north of Portugal and the Transcantábrico train.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Commissioner, I believe that the strategy must not focus solely on maritime issues. It must, as Mr Cadec has said, have a significant land-based dimension which includes the objectives of social, economic and territorial cohesion. As the resolution on which we will vote tomorrow indicates, the strategy for the Atlantic region must be closely connected with the Europe 2020 strategy, and with regional development policy and future economic prospects.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the various administrations and organisations that exist in the Atlantic region must be taken closely into account, including the regional government of Galicia and the Euroregion created with the neighbouring community of North Portugal, which were amongst the first in the European Union to create a European Grouping for Territorial Cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this means that there is a need for the Commission to maintain a permanent dialogue with these regions and entities, during both the development of the strategy and its subsequent implementation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need a common approach to the uses of our maritime spaces that takes the specific features of each basin into consideration and finds joint solutions to the problems that exist.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, as an elected representative of Normandy, I would like to draw your attention to the specific situation of the Channel, which must also be incorporated into the plans for an integrated strategy for the Atlantic region. The Channel is one of the European Union’s strategic maritime gateways and is an essential link between the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea. It contains 20% of the world’s fleet and more than 500 ships over 300 tonnes sail through it every day.</p>
<p class="contents">On top of this transport activity, there are also fisheries, leisure activities, aggregate extraction and soon – much to my satisfaction – energy production from offshore wind farms.</p>
<p class="contents">This concentration of activities calls for serious thought to be given to the issue of managing maritime safety at European level, which I feel must be discussed as part of the Atlantic strategy also. As you know, the bilateral bases on which funding for safety is based are currently under threat. I have already alerted you to this point Commissioner and I will be paying close attention to the proposals you will be making in June. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The following five EU Member States border the Atlantic: Britain, Ireland, France, Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">On top of that, economically and environmentally, it is vital that the coastal regions of Norway, Iceland and the Faroe Islands are included in any strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Atlantic strategy must focus on encouraging the economic development of the Atlantic islands and coastal regions. </p>
<p class="contents">The Atlantic region is one of the world’s richest and most underdeveloped areas in terms of wind and wave energy. It is estimated that by 2050, up to 50% of Europe’s electricity supply could be provided by renewable energy generated off the Atlantic coast.</p>
<p class="contents">Tourism and leisure facilities are also a major economic asset for the regions along the Atlantic Arc. There remains enormous potential for growth in this area, including the development of strategically located marinas along the coast in each country. The maritime transport and port sector and the seafood sector, including aquaculture, would also benefit from deeper cooperation between the Member States along the Atlantic. Of course, an Atlantic strategy must also be consistent with the common fisheries policy, and the European Atlantic Area contains the most productive and prolific fishing grounds in EU waters. It also contains the major spawning grounds for mackerel, blue whiting, horse mackerel and hake. Member States’ cooperation in terms of marine safety, security and surveillance has improved in recent years. Given the broad expanse of the Arc, an integrated strategy will ensure better and more effective operations organised between Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this will result in better emergency-at-sea responses, including search and rescue, that know no geographical or political boundaries, and in improved surveillance at sea to combat organised crime and drug trafficking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have talked here already about the strategy for the Baltic Sea, and about the Danube strategy, which is, by the way, currently being continued and developed by the Hungarian Presidency. Now the time has come for a strategy for the Atlantic region. This is a particularistic strategy, which concerns only five Member States of the European Union. Nevertheless, it is certainly an important one. However, one has to strongly emphasise that it must not become a pretext and an instrument to increase EU funding for these countries, but only to improve the use of such funding in the context of the development of the Atlantic region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like the economic and social dimension of regional policy, the effectiveness of this dimension is dependent on the drawing up of renewed strategies for the European regions. For it to be successful, the reality of the regions, their specific characteristics and their particular problems need to be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">The Atlantic region is one that presents a number of key characteristics which mean it requires an ambitious strategy to be prepared. To begin with, it is a remote area that includes regions with worrying problems of accessibility and connectivity. It has a fragile environment which is increasingly weakened by climate change. Its shipping activity is dynamic, as a result of the importance of maritime transport, but also as a result of activities relating to fishing and energy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind you that it is thanks to the Atlantic region, and specifically the outermost regions located there, that the European Union has the largest exclusive economic zone in the world. The creation of an integrated strategy for the Atlantic region should be supported, provided that it takes into account not just the important maritime dimension, but also the land-based dimension. Synergies must be created and fostered between the various sectoral policies, so seeking to achieve benefits for the region</p>
<p class="contents">The strategy must, obviously, cover all the regions of the Atlantic coast, including the outermost regions of Macaronesia: that is, Madeira, the Azores and the Canary Islands. It is necessary to improve the connectivity of these regions, whose specific geographic and structural characteristics require the optimisation of accessibility and mobility. This would not only contribute to making these regions more dynamic and to their growth, but also to the better achievement of internal market objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to stress quickly the need for multi-level governance within this strategy, in which it is desirable to call on the regional and local authorities to be involved, from the stage of analysing the regional situation to that of implementing specific measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Clearly, we will also need this Atlantic strategy in the future. As we have heard in previous speeches, it will establish a very important demarcated area for the European Union, one that will involve issues relating to fishing, transport and energy. I believe that macro­regions and macro-regional strategies will also allow us in the Union to fight for these issues and work together.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the 1990s, the European Union has supported this territorial cooperation both among the Member States and with third countries bordering on the Union, mainly as part of the Union’s cohesion and foreign policies. Of course, these macro-regional strategies began during the Swedish Presidency, and I hope that they will also bring added value in the future in the areas of international and interregional cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been said, these macro-regional strategies have much to offer, especially in the transport, business and energy sectors. As mentioned in this motion for a resolution, it is important that things go on as they did before with regard to this Atlantic strategy, which is to say that we make use of existing structures and financing. It is simply not necessary to start creating more structures with this macro-regional strategy either.</p>
<p class="contents">In this preparatory work, we will need to take account of all regions and actors for us to be able to create genuine synergy for this area of the Atlantic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have seen the Danube, the Baltic and the Mediterranean strategies. In those terms, the Atlantic strategy is in its infancy, but has vast potential, as speakers have pointed out, not just in its maritime aspects, but also in its territorial aspects, as my colleague, Mr Millán Mon, mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two points which I would like to concentrate on: one is tourism potential and the other is energy. 7% of Irish tourism is maritime-based. We should set a target of doubling that right along the Atlantic coast, in the five countries of the Atlantic Arc, by 2020.</p>
<p class="contents">Particularly amongst young people, there has been a growth in activities based on-shore and off-shore, such as walking, diving, fishing, whale-watching and surfing. These can all be developed through a unified approach with all the areas cooperating, particularly in marketing, and also in licensing, etc., thereby reducing red tape.</p>
<p class="contents">Where energy is concerned, by 2050, we will need far more renewable energy than we have now. We have seen the volatility of the price of oil in recent weeks. That is not going to change. The Atlantic Ocean has wonderful potential for wind, wave and tidal power. That may be cost-prohibitive at the moment, but in due course, with developing technologies, that will change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A strategy for the Atlantic region in which the Member States and their regions participate should also prioritise new areas of innovation in the economy and science, in particular, new products and services linked to the environment, to renewable and marine energy, to food-related marine biotechnology, to health and smart technology-intensive products and services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Territorial cohesion seeks harmonious development between territories, so that their citizens can benefit fully from their singularities.</p>
<p class="contents">However, to achieve this objective, it is also necessary to make progress in the field of cooperation between regions of the European Union that are facing the same challenges and the same problems. This is the objective of the European strategy for the Atlantic region: a common perspective for tackling the common challenges faced by the Member States of the region, including marine research, maritime monitoring and environmental and economic challenges. To achieve our objectives, it is necessary to adopt a focused and integrated strategy which is in line with the Europe 2020 strategy and with the policies of the European Union for the post-2013 period, in particular, with regional and maritime policy.</p>
<p class="contents">However, ladies and gentlemen, this strategy must be founded, above all, on reformed, multi-level governance based on closer participation by the public authorities, both regional and local, the Member States, the European Union, private sector stakeholders and civil society organisations, including inter-regional networks and organisations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Atlantic’s distinctive characteristics are the intercontinental dimension, the diversity of its oceanic basins and the fact that it is an ultra-deep ocean. These, along with the historic ties between the countries and regions divided by the Atlantic, are arguments justifying a different approach to it. Its geostrategic position on the border between Europe, Africa and the Americas creates challenges and opportunities for maritime activity on a number of levels, such as the protection and safeguarding of ecosystems, maritime security, the study of climate change, the security and supply of food and energy, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is at the level of the deep ocean that the Atlantic’s great wealth in natural, genetic and mineral resources will be located. In this context, I believe that technological research, development and innovation activity should be implemented that will ensure the exploitation and sustainable management of these resources, under the umbrella of the European Union Atlantic strategy. We need to create a European deep ocean observatory in an area suited to that purpose, such as the Azores. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think there is a wide agreement that we can achieve more together by creating a forum for encouraging cooperation amongst the regions and states and nations of the Atlantic Arc, but I would counsel gently against ‘priorityitis’, which is a disease that afflicts us in this Chamber particularly badly. If you try to achieve 300 million objectives, we might end up doing nothing very well, so I would pick out two particular priorities where I think the EU could add real, genuine, EU added value.</p>
<p class="contents">In paragraph 8, there is a focus on interconnectors for marine energy. We have a massive renewable energy potential in the Atlantic region. Coming from Scotland, we have a vast contribution to make towards our climate change and our regional development objectives. We could play a great role in that. In paragraphs 9 to 11, the importance of marine transport could also have hugely important economic, as well as environmental, output.</p>
<p class="contents">There is much in this to admire, but I would hope that the Commission will have a greater degree of focus than the many, all very worthy, objectives we have seen from this House this evening. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Atlantic Ocean, as a field for the dynamic development of maritime transport, fisheries, sources of ecological energy and scientific research, provides us with great opportunities for efficient management. One should use these wisely, keeping in mind the important role of the Union as a guardian of the natural environment, which undoubtedly includes the oceanic ecosystem. The channelling of the EU’s strength towards the Atlantic Ocean is a natural direction of economic expansion for us. The development of the maritime transport sector virtually forces us to work on an optimal strategy for the development of the Atlantic region, including its port facilities. Let us remember that they represent the maritime gateway to a united Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am delighted that today, thanks to my colleague, Alain Cadec, we are able to provide the impetus for an ambitious regional strategy for the Atlantic Arc. In addition to the many areas requiring coordination and joint work and the importance of an integrated approach that will allow us to address the region’s problems at the macro-regional level, I would like to emphasise two points in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">The territorial cooperation objective, Objective 3 of the cohesion policy, and, in particular, its transnational aspects, should be brought in to support these strategies by coordinating discussions and project development and coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States and regions should be encouraged to take part in jointly devised actions through their operational programmes. Unfortunately, without strong political will, these strategies will simply meet a dead end. Whilst Europe does not want to cover itself with macro-regions, it needs to take on board the territorial constraints that have not disappeared simply because our borders have been removed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have three points. The first concerns our maritime strategy. In maritime strategy, we can include many sectors, many actions and many perspectives. What will our focus be? Our focus will be on trying to create linkages between the different sectors. Let me explain myself.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a space, we have a sea space – Atlantic sea space. There we can have fisheries; we need environmental protection; we can have tourism; we can have transport; we can have aquaculture; we can have energy; and we can have research. So we need a way to create linkages between all these sectors and to overcome the possibility of there being conflicts of interest there. So, maritime special planning will be a very important instrument for us, and maritime surveillance and maritime knowledge will also be very important instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">This is our ambition. It is not about creating new structures – I can agree with that; we do not really need new structures. What we need are linkages between the different structures we already have. That is what this is all about – creating linkages between the existing structures in order to have better results. So this is my first point.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns your comments about having a territorial cohesion policy. I would like to remind you that to have this macro-region policy, we need to have a proposal. A proposal must be made by the Council to the Commission. What we have for the time being is a proposal about a maritime strategy. There was a decision last June about this and we have already been authorised to come forward with a maritime strategy. We are working on this and we hope that in this way, we are helping to put on the table the prospect of a macro-region approach.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point is the need for an international approach. Yes, I agree with all of you who said that we need good coordination with our neighbours on both sides of the Atlantic too. We have to be cautious. We need to have good discussions and to try to fix a level playing field for everybody, because this is the only way to be successful.</p>
<p class="contents">So I would like to thank Mr Cadec once again for his initiative and I would like to reassure you that all your suggestions will be taken on board. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
