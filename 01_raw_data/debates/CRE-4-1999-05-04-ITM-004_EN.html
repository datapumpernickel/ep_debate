<p class="contents">The list accordingly sets out the types of behaviour considered unacceptable: obstruction of fisheries inspectors; falsifying or destroying evidence; fishing without a licence or with a false licence; falsifying, deleting or concealing the name, registration or markings of a fishing vessel; using prohibited fishing gear or fishing methods; and fishing for prohibited species or in a closed zone. Other unacceptable behaviour includes the failure to comply with the rules on holding or preserving fishery products on board, the failure to comply with the rules and procedures on transhipment, falsifying catch data, tampering with the satellite‐tracking system and the deliberate failure to comply with the rules on remote transmission of the movements of fishing vessels. The list also refers to failure by the master of a fishing vessel of a third country or his representative to comply with the rules on the procedure for landing or transhipping catches, and finally, landing, putting on sale and transporting fishery products which do not meet the marketing standards in force and those relating to minimum sizes.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that control is one of the essential pillars in applying the common fisheries policy, we can only support the establishment of this list. However, in the opinion I drafted on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries on the amendments to Regulation No 2847/93 establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy, I had tabled amendments which were adopted by the European Parliament. These emphasised that, in order to be fair and to be perceived as such, similar penalties should be imposed throughout the Community for similar infringements of the common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore regret that the Commission has not availed itself of this opportunity and include these proposals by Parliament which, if adopted, could have been regarded by fishermen as progress towards equal treatment. While each Member State must remain responsible for its own control bodies, the Commission must be responsible for coordinating the application of the controls.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when the common fisheries policy is the subject of increasingly vocal criticism from fishermen, the fairness of the application of its rules should at least be beyond reproach. This is not currently the case. There is a widespread perception of grave injustice built into the system. This will undermine the willingness of fishermen to cooperate fully with conservation measures when they believe that others are indulging in illegal behaviour and escaping any punishment. Without the cooperation of fishermen, most conservation measures will remain ineffective.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, the Commission must put forward a proposal on comparable penalties for comparable offences. The urgency of the problem dictates that action should be taken very swiftly, specifically before the amendment of the common fisheries policy planned for 2002.</p>

Of particular significance is the call for a transition to a new political order in East Timor.</p>
<p class="contents">In any discussion of democracy and Indonesia, it is important to remember that Indonesia still occupies another country, namely Irian Jaya. This region was handed over to Indonesia in 1963, with the stipulation that a referendum on the country's future was to be held by 1969 at the latest. A kind of referendum was indeed held, but it could hardly be called democratic, since only the tribal chiefs were allowed to participate. Furthermore, it was reported to have been carried out using undemocratic methods.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, Irian Jaya has no cultural attachment to Indonesia. More than 100 000 people are estimated to have died in clashes between the indigenous population, mainly armed with bows and spears, and the Indonesian army with its modern equipment. There have been reports of political prisoners, bombed villages and the use of chemical weapons. Thousands of Irian Jayans have moved to nearby Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p class="contents">It is scandalous that the international community has not reacted more strongly against the continuing genocide in Irian Jaya. The manipulated referendum results should be declared invalid, and the people of Irian Jaya should decide on their future at the earliest opportunity.</p>

There must be a sensible balance between public health and the development of a competitive European industry. It will generally be necessary to reduce dependence on national reimbursement systems and make a sensible move towards greater individual responsibility, which may in turn lead to more private insurance and/or to greater individual responsibility and thus possibly to a greater volume of self‐medication. This in no way reduces the principle of solidarity; on the contrary, it preserves and ultimately strengthens it. In my view it is scarcely conceivable that, in the long term, doctors should be consulted and medication prescribed for all relatively minor illnesses.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is important to bear in mind the special role of pharmacists and doctors in the area of self‐medication. Both professions have commented on this field, and I welcome in particular the self‐medication brochure published by the European Medical Association, among others, which was also endorsed by the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The licensing system is of particular importance to a viable single market in pharmaceuticals. Many different efforts have been made in recent years to improve the licensing system, and today both the centralised and the non‐centralised licensing system make an important contribution to the single market in pharmaceuticals. In general, what I consider to be particularly important for the future is a balanced relationship between the role of national agencies – and therefore also of the non‐centralised procedure – and that of an appropriate centralised structure.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of support payments from the Community budget to the European Medicines Evaluation Agency last summer, special attention was given to the work of the EMEA on herbal medications. As can be seen from a new publication, in the last few months an ad hoc working party has done some outstanding work and clarified certain important points about this medication in the European Union.</p>

This simply weakened the report. These compromise amendments will not have the effect we are seeking, which is to limit the negative consequences on consumers and European honey producers of a directive which does not adequately protect the quality of good European honeys against imported honeys. Moreover, this situation is an open invitation to fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, it was no longer possible to amend these compromise amendments as I would have liked. Therefore, as I cannot resign myself to voting for texts which do not guarantee that the consumer will be able to easily distinguish between imported honey and quality honey produced in the Community, I abstained. The remainder of the report is not bad, although mixtures of honeys where part originates from outside the Community should also be marked ‘imported honey".</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I must state that in order to improve honey production and marketing, as referred to in my report on an ad hoc regulation and for which we have obtained EUR 15 million per year – although I had asked for EUR 65 million – stringent requirements are needed on the quality, control and labelling of honey. I regret that the Commission and the Council did not follow Parliament"s lead as it unanimously approved my two reports on European apiculture and the improvement of honey production and marketing. I am hopeful that during the next parliamentary term we will be heard, as my struggle on behalf of honey producers and their high‐quality products in Europe and the Community will continue inside or outside Parliament.</p>

In my opinion, the provisions adopted respond to a particular situation. They aim to solve the problem relating to the 1996 financial year, and it is never advisable to amend general texts to solve a particular problem. However, I also have two formal comments to make.</p>
<p class="contents">The first follows on from the comments made earlier by Mr Herman in relation to the fact that you decided that the amendments to Annex V to the Rules of Procedure would be adopted by an absolute majority. You were right in that respect since this is in accordance with the Treaty, which specifies that the Rules of Procedure shall be adopted by an absolute majority of the Members of Parliament. You – and by you I really mean the President"s office in general – should actually have applied the same conditions to the adoption of the amendment to the other annex in the last part‐session concerning the responsibilities of the parliamentary committees. There is no difference in the nature of these annexes. It is solely for the sake of convenience that these texts have been made into annexes to the Rules of Procedure because they would take up too much room in the main body of the Rules. However, in both cases the provisions are important and must be adopted under the same conditions as the main text itself.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment concerns the immediate entry into force of the Rules. We decided on this even though the committee"s amendments were not adopted. We therefore voted on the Elles report without knowing exactly what we were voting on. In future, if we want to apply something quickly, we should allow at least one day in order to obtain the final adopted text. We should not vote without knowing exactly what we are voting on. The Rules of Procedure allow quicker application than that normally anticipated, namely in the part‐session following their adoption, but immediate entry into force does not seem appropriate.</p>

<p class="contents">In this proposal, the Commission is seeking to add a new paragraph 6 to Article 28 of the directive. This paragraph provides for a procedure enabling the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, to authorise any Member State to apply a reduced rate for the period from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2002 to certain local labour‐intensive services that meet specific requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations has indicated on several occasions that it believes that there is a direct link between a lower VAT rate and higher employment. This proposal to amend the directive is therefore heading in the right direction by offering Member States a positive option, which they will certainly use in a fairly general manner.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the I‐EDN Group voted against Amendment No 4 by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, which was adopted by 423 votes to 61. This amendment specifies that the Council should act by qualified majority and not unanimously. Yet according to the Treaty, all tax provisions governed by Community law must be adopted by the Council acting unanimously. Once again the supporters of a federal Europe are trying to go one step further by removing one of the Council"s prerogatives to the benefit of the Commission. If qualified majority voting were adopted for taxation, as desired by the vast majority of Members, a whole chunk of national sovereignty would be swept away. This would seriously impinge on the right of each Member State to fix and collect tax.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that Parliament has frequently indicated its backing for the introduction of a European tax. In this case, with its shrewd support for a text allowing Member States to reduce VAT, it is trying to alter the legal basis of the Treaties by changing the procedure in the Council for adopting the Commission"s tax proposals.</p>

By contrast, the United States of America is growing twice as fast and its unemployment rate is half the European level. At the same time, and fairly logically, the euro has been falling against the dollar since it was launched at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation quite clearly contrasts with the promise accompanying monetary unification that a new era of growth and employment would begin in Europe. Of course, you could say that the euro has only really been in use for four months and that it is therefore too early to come to any definite conclusions about this. However, this statement is not actually true because the bilateral parities between the European currencies were fixed just over a year ago, on 1 May 1998, and the objective of rigidly pegging the currencies to each other has prevailed for several years. Neither the euro nor the European management in general can therefore be easily exonerated of all responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">We are particularly conscious that growth is weaker in the countries at the centre of the euro system which contribute to the Structural Funds and stronger in the more peripheral countries or those which benefit from European aid. In essence, the question is whether or not the decline in the centre of the Union is weighing on Europe as a whole and whether or not European growth, which has thus been weakened by the Brussels management, is wreaking revenge by weakening the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations wants the recovery of European growth to be assisted, firstly by reducing the compulsory levies for the Structural Funds, and secondly by relaxing the rigid management of the euro. We believe that a certain amount of currency flexibility must be restored and that the euro must be adapted to the specific situation in each country. This could be achieved by allowing the national currencies to remain, together with the euro, after 1 January 2002, with the euro then becoming a simple common currency.</p>

<p class="contents">1. The idea of a common economic policy is flawed in principle. The Member States' individual economic structures make it necessary to have a policy which takes account of national differences. Real convergence requires different policies. Formal convergence, on the other hand, results in conflicting policy outcomes.</p>
<p class="contents">2. A common economic policy, controlled by the Union, constitutes a serious breach of national independence and encroaches on the role of national parliaments, whose prerogative in terms of economic policy is an essential part of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">3. In the report and the accompanying statement, the policy which is advocated represents biased theoretical ideas and a particular brand of political theory. It runs counter to many of the approaches and observations endorsed by modern economic science.</p>

The forecasts for economic growth in the Union made last winter were revised downwards in the spring. But there is no reason to panic or to turn into eurosceptics. This is not a crisis or an economic recession but just a slow‐down in growth. As Wim Duisenberg said a few days ago, the current exchange rate between the euro and the dollar is due to a strong dollar and not a weak euro. This factor essentially explains the difference in economic growth between the euro zone and the United States of America. The latter is experiencing an exceptional period of nine consecutive years of economic expansion, sustained by the dynamics of consumption, private investment and the capital market. But the signs are there of a slow‐down in the second quarter because private consumption is too dependent on the stock market, the trade balance deficit is increasing rapidly and monetary policy is more restrictive, as demonstrated by the recent fall in long‐term interest rates.</p>
<p class="contents">Conversely, Europe"s economy is heading towards a recovery in the second half of 1999. The relative depreciation of the euro has increased external demand and the departure of Lafontaine has increased the confidence of the German business sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that the euro"s introduction is creating the basic conditions for the economy to grow. This is due to the disappearance of exchange rate risks for companies, the lowest interest rates this century, an increase in trade within the Community and greater coordination of economic and monetary policies between the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The main challenge now facing Europe is to develop a new policy mix which firmly links the creation of stable jobs with lasting and sustainable economic growth. This will require a European stability and growth pact to be established which fully involves the social partners and a strong political will on the part of the Member States to introduce the necessary structural reforms, to move towards a European information society and to remain determined in striving for greater tax harmonisation.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, we have a reservation about a point made in the explanatory statement of the Fourçans report which states that, ‘it must be said that the countries with the lowest unemployment are those which undertook these reforms many years ago". This is not true. Look at the case of Portugal which has one of the lowest levels of unemployment in Europe yet has not so far had the political courage to implement any structural reforms in health, education, social security or taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no innovation or risk capital market, as pointed out by the Commission"s recommendation.</p>
<p class="contents">The stability and growth pact put forward, as with that of other countries, is based on unrealistic and overly optimistic assumptions and will not enable progress to be made towards the aim of rectifying the budget deficits, which is vital to a healthy system of public finances.</p>

The great disaster, however, is that it now seems unlikely that the content of the Pact will really be any different under this new spirit of cooperation, since the employment guidelines are still those agreed in Luxembourg in all their ambiguity. The essential features of economic policy are this time extremely vague and unclear, with the result that for the time being we have no choice but to carry on as we are, which is extremely difficult in view of the number of problems we face. The market reforms that are to form the third component consist of a mixture – not yet clearly defined – of deregulation ideas and necessary framework definitions for fair competition in the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">So much as we welcome the fact that the European Union is preparing to create the conditions for a European ‘polder" model in economic and employment policy, we must nevertheless warn against it if the structure is not also linked to the content. The aim must be to change the direction of economic policy and move to a policy that actually gives priority to long‐term, sustainable employment, a policy that returns to the idea of the redistribution of labour, a policy that places the need to develop sustainability, meet the Rio commitments and achieve solidarity in dealing with and stabilising the European environment back at the forefront of European economic policy instead of regarding it as a type of aggregate micro‐policy imposed by the large companies. This is what has happened in the last twenty years, with the all‐too‐familiar negative results that the whole of Europe is suffering from today.</p>

We believe that the current high level of unemployment constitutes a threat to the European welfare model. The fact that, year after year, millions of people are out of work is detrimental to the credibility of both society and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Menrad report on the European Parliament's contribution to the European Employment Pact is an important contribution to the strengthening of employment in Europe. We therefore welcome the report, with certain reservations. The report recommends exploring the possibility of an agreement between the labour market partners on a basic wage. In our view, this is not the right way to combat such things as social dumping. We believe that the focus should be on other measures instead, for example minimum standards in the area covered by employment law.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also puts forward further demands, such as a relieving of the tax burden on companies' incomes and investments and a reduction in payroll taxes. In principle, we are opposed to such measures. We think it is extremely important to promote a climate in which companies can flourish, but that this is a national responsibility and one on which each Member State should adopt its own position.</p>

By promoting the adoption of a European Employment Pact, it is already being admitted that these measures have substantially failed.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course the European Union and Member States have not drawn any useful conclusions from the policy they are currently pursuing, both at a macro‐economic and a social level. An assessment of the socio‐economic situation confirms that not only has overall employment increased, and not only has unemployment not fallen, but the distribution of unemployment has officially become the main objective of the policies pursued. It is not by chance that the countries that are to be ‘congratulated" in this regard by the European Union are those countries which were the first to move towards general reforms in this direction in the labour market, increasing in particular part‐time and other forms of flexible employment.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, we have every reason to be especially concerned when we hear that new initiatives are being promoted, still within the framework of the same policy. The plans that have been published regarding the contents of the European Employment Pact leave us in no doubt that the same policy is being pursued, but with greater demands being made. The objective of full employment has been abandoned. Closer association between the procedure regarding general economic trends and that regarding guidelines on employment promotes the further subjection of wage and, more generally, social policy measures to the stifling restrictions of the convergence criteria and the stability pact. Legally enforcing and attempting to strengthen ‘multilateral surveillance" within social policy sets out to remove any possibility national governments have to take measures which are different from those imposed by Brussels. Briefly, we are actually overstepping the terms of these Treaties, whilst wage policy and social policy as a whole is subject to control and the threat of sanctions from Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">Our only option is to underscore our opposition to the plans that are being promoted. We refuse to regard as ‘social dialogue", in the substantive sense of the term, the attempt to subjugate the trade union movement by restricting its activity within predetermined budgetary and, more generally, macro‐economic choices which stem from the stability pact. Such a development would alter the nature of collective negotiations, ignore the role of the interrelation of forces in determining the contents of collective agreements and, finally, transform trade unions into mere enforcers of government decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to express our concern because, the more measures are taken to reduce the income and the rights of workers, the more pressures for further reforms increase. Workers have got to the point where they even have doubts about the hard core of labour law. They understand from experience that they have nothing to gain from such approaches. They see that the planned European Employment Pact, together with the central policy of the European Union, as sign‐posted by the Commission reports on so‐called ‘economic reform" and by the large amount of literature on the subject produced by government representatives, aim to further promote the flexibility of working time, the continuing process to dismantle the social security system, increased tax burdens on workers, together with reduced social security contributions to the benefit of employers. Workers know that an economic and monetary policy which aims to promote the affluence of the masses and to reduce public expenditure at all costs needs the backing of workers who are ‘employable, adaptable and flexible". They know that the process to dismantle their rights has no bounds. The only brake on this process may be their determined struggle for a different policy, underpinned by the objective of full and steady employment, which will increase rather than reduce their rights. Such a policy will have people and their needs at its core and will promote growth and investment in production, for the benefit of the world of work and production.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs adopts the guidelines to make the labour market more flexible and to promote the reforms that have been announced. It calls for the abolition of inflexible regulations within the labour market, the reduction of contributions and indirect labour costs, and supports flexible working times. For these reasons we will vote against it.</p>

And I will continue to fight against this and I undertake to do so everywhere, both inside and outside this House and before the Court of Justice. This is because I cannot accept being a member of a parliament which votes for what is wrong and which therefore, in terms of the law, is making, passing and using laws which are wrong. The text which we have approved is totally wrong. We had said that we would not grant discharge to the Commission but this was not true. However, I have made this my undertaking and it explains why I voted against the text. I will try in every possible way to ensure that the rule of law remains our standard, despite Mr Elles and despite others. I will try to ensure that these concepts promoted by a faded left are not imposed on others. In my opinion, the rule of law cannot be separated from democracy.</p>

Instead I am going to give the expected explanation of vote on the Elles report. We approved this report particularly because of its first paragraph – please stay Mr Dell"Alba, just for a few more moments – and although I agree that this paragraph is not entirely realistic, its political significance is very clear in our opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first time, a majority of the Members of this House said very clearly that discharge could not be granted to the Commission in respect of the 1996 financial year. For the first time, it was clear that we would refuse to grant discharge when, on 17 December, we rejected a motion in favour of granting discharge tabled by the Socialist Group which had been adopted <span class="italic">in extremis</span> by a very small majority in the Committee on Budgetary Control. We have also adopted and annexed to our report the reasons for the decision of 17 December 1998. These reasons involved a condemnation of the Commission and should have led at the time to a majority in Parliament censuring the Commission, as we ourselves proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we have witnessed not only some flights of fancy on the subject of paragraph 1 but also an extraordinary amendment by the Socialist Group attempting to delete this paragraph. I believe that this amendment tabled by the Socialist Group demonstrates the hypocrisy which some have been attempting to lead us towards since 17 December. The Socialist Group proposed that we should not say that we had refused discharge and it proposed that we should not annex to our report the comments of 17 December. If we had adopted the Socialist Group"s amendment, as 212 of our colleagues unfortunately did, there would have been no mention of the refusal of discharge and these comments which, I must repeat, condemned the Commission, would have had no legal value. This is why I welcome the adoption of the Elles report.</p>

<p class="contents">For the first time in its existence, the Commission has had to resign <span class="italic">en bloc</span> due to the overwhelming evidence of its mismanagement. Much more could still be said or repeated on this issue. But to a certain extent, the Council and Parliament must also accept some responsibility for this crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with the new challenges caused, in particular, by the collapse of the Berlin wall and the globalisation of the economy, neither the Council nor Parliament stopped to consider all the logical consequences, particularly in terms of hiring staff, before increasing the Commission"s workload.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Parliament and the new Commission will have to take over where we have left off in order to identify at a more leisurely pace, and hopefully in close cooperation, all the necessary conclusions and consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, I agree with the rapporteur that it is technically important for the time being to note the accounts of the EC budget for the 1996 financial year in order to proceed with work on the accounts of later years.</p>
<p class="contents">We must once again bring to the attention of the public that this simple noting of the accounts cannot in any way be regarded as calling into question Parliament"s refusal to grant discharge to the Commission for the 1996 accounts.</p>

It would be paradoxical for Parliament to approve this discharge before the end of its term when not all the information is available, when the second report by the Committee of Independent Experts is expected in the autumn and when the conditions for us to definitively approve this discharge are not therefore satisfied.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I must underline the extraordinary nature of the vote in this House. Three amendments – Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 7 – tabled not by us but by the Green Group were rejected by a very large majority, with roughly 400 against and 115 for. Amendment No 2 recalled that, under Article 276 of the Treaty, the Commission must submit any necessary information to the European Parliament at its request. This amendment was rejected as the House considered that this duty of information required the Commission to submit to Parliament in full all the documents it deemed necessary to exercise this responsibility. So this amendment was rejected. Amendment No 3 recalled what happened with the ECHO dossier. Amendment No 7 simply recalled what happened with regard to the external staff hired by different companies.</p>
<p class="contents">The 112 or 115 Members who voted in favour of these amendments are a credit to this House because they were expressing the belief that Parliament is entitled to scrutinise both the Commission and its implementation of the Community budget. They were also stating that the Commission must respect the Treaties by submitting the necessary information to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who voted against these amendments have not enhanced Parliament"s image. They have clearly shown the hypocrisy of our situation over the last six months. If there had not been five independent people, appointed by Parliament, to deliver their very clear judgment on the workings of the Commission, we would still have the same Commission which would not have resigned and would not have been censured.</p>

This is because the 1997 budget was implemented by the same Commission which fell due to its mismanagement of the 1996 budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I must agree with the rapporteur that discharge necessarily constitutes a political act expressing the confidence of the principal in its agent.</p>
<p class="contents">How could Parliament place its confidence again in a Commission which has resigned without contradicting itself? This is particularly true given that it is difficult not to examine the implementation of the general budget for the 1997 financial year from the direct perspective of the previous budget. The two are now inextricably linked by the same disgrace and it is by examining their failings in depth that the necessary reforms will be identified, particularly in terms of making the Commissioners individually responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that Parliament"s obstinacy in demanding that light be shed on the management of the EU"s budget has revealed the unacceptable problems within the institution which is supposed to be the guardian of the Treaties. However, I regret that collective responsibility was applied, with the justified resignation of some and the departure of others whose management cannot be reproached, as things stand.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I believe that the examination of the discharge for the 1997 financial year by a newly elected Parliament, in cooperation with a Commission free of the errors and faults of the past, will ensure a less stormy atmosphere in which to determine the real responsibilities of each of the outgoing Commissioners.</p>

<p class="contents">I intend to talk about the amendments which were not adopted, in particular Amendment No 3 and Amendment No 7.</p>
<p class="contents">In Amendment No 3 we asked the Secretary‐General to provide the Committee on Budgetary Control with a report on the reasons and circumstances which led to the decision to divide up the Directorate‐General for Personnel, the Budget and Finance, on the effects of this decision and on the efficiency of the budget management and staff policy. This amendment was tabled by the Green Group.</p>
<p class="contents">In Amendment No 7, the same group noted that Parliament had withdrawn a complaint on the financial claims and it wanted to know the consequences of this. Amendment No 9 recalled the conditions which should have led us to postpone the granting of discharge.</p>
<p class="contents">Around 100 Members voted for these amendments. Just as Parliament must monitor the correct implementation of the Community budget, it must also check that its own budget is correctly implemented by the Secretary‐General and all the officials whose honesty and qualities are not in question. It must therefore check that everything has been correctly implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly we have questions about the 1997 financial year. We should have postponed our decision and I regret that we did not. This is why we could not vote for the report by our colleague Mr Fabra Vallés.</p>

It would be even more damaging to the credibility of the European institutions if such a storm were to affect Parliament. This just shows the importance we must place on examining the accounts of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">In this period of deep doubt among the public, we must be even more careful not to allow room for the suspicions which are always so quick to appear and multiply.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors can and must help us in this task. It is, to a certain extent, the external guarantor of our institution"s credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why, like the rapporteur, I wish to stress that the Court of Auditors may at any time investigate the extent to which Parliament"s use of its appropriations from the budget conforms with the rules in force.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has also highlighted certain failures that must be corrected immediately, particularly in terms of staff management and the commitment of investment appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">On a more general note, I support the rapporteur in all his conclusions, including the need to postpone the decision to grant discharge to the Economic and Social Committee for the 1997 financial year. Given the seriousness of the conclusions of the Court of Auditors" annual report on the previous financial year, it is not acceptable that the Economic and Social Committee has considered it inappropriate to refer the matter to UCLAF, as demanded insistently by Parliament, in order to enable the extent of any administrative involvement or responsibility to be fully determined.</p>

<p class="contents">In this case, it seems that the combined attention of our rapporteur and the Court of Auditors is finding a real will within the Foundation to respond to the remarks made.
