<p>In line with the conclusions of the European Council of Helsinki in December, Turkey - like the Central and Eastern European countries associated with the European Union, the associated countries Cyprus and Malta, and the European Free Trade Associates (EFTA) countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, members of the European Economic Area - is invited to align itself with CFSP declarations made by the Presidency on behalf of the European Union.</p>
<p>One cannot expect countries - even candidates for EU accession - to associate themselves automatically with EU declarations on foreign policy issues on which they have not been consulted and in the drafting of which they have played no part. On the other hand, as part of the process by which they approach accession the EU welcomes it when they feel able to associate themselves with EU positions in CFSP and indeed encourages them to do so. But it must be for these countries to decide freely whether they wish to do so.</p>
<p>In 2000, the associates were invited to associate themselves with 131 CFSP declarations. In 95 cases, all countries concerned aligned themselves; in 36 cases, one or more countries wished not to do so, in 18 cases of which Turkey was one of them. In 2001, the Associated countries have been invited to align themselves with 16 declarations.

<p>The Council is not aware of the commercial modalities of the gas supply agreements between Georgia and Russia.</p>
<p>However, the Council is concerned about the interruption of gas supplies from Russia to Georgia and its effect on the economic, social and humanitarian situation in Georgia. Interruptions of this kind, however short, do not only affect the people directly involved but, of course, in a wider perspective, also have an effect on Russia’s reputation as a gas supplier.</p>
<p>The interest of the Council in increasing the security of energy supplies is demonstrated by several items on the agenda of a forthcoming Council meeting.</p>
<p>Firstly, the Council is currently undertaking an in-depth examination of the Commission's Green Paper: "Towards a European strategy for the security of supply", which underlines our growing dependence on external energy sources and notably on Russia for gas. Within the context of enlargement, this dependence will increase further due to the historic links between Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. One of the responses to dependence will be increased diversification of energy sources.</p>
<p>Moreover, on the occasion of the 6th EU-Russia summit since the entry into force (1.12.1997) of the EU-Russian Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA), held in Paris on 30 October 2000, it was agreed to institute an energy dialogue on a regular basis to enable progress to be made in the definition and arrangements for an EU-Russian Energy Partnership. Since then, exploratory contacts at high level have been taking place, taking into account the interest of the EU in safeguarding the continuation of reliable energy supplies from Russia. On the same occasion, Russia also confirmed its commitment to proceed to the ratification of the Energy Charter Treaty in the near future. The Community is currently participating in negotiations on a Transit Protocol to the Energy Charter Treaty, which should also contribute to increasing the security of supply, especially as regards the legal framework.</p>
<p>Finally, the Action Plan on the Northern Dimension, adopted at the European Council of Feira, 19­20 June 2000, comprises, within a series of priority actions, measures to ensure (legal) security of investment and of supply from i.a. Northwest Russia. Implementation of this Action Plan will be reviewed at the June European Council in Göteborg.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0164"></a>

<p>The Council remains concerned at the difficult situation of the civilian population in Chechnya. In all political dialogue meetings with Russia, as well as in the OSCE and Council of Europe, the EU expresses its serious concerns at reports on violations of human rights and humanitarian law, in particular forced disappearances, summary executions, torture and arbitrary detentions. The EU is keeping the pressure on the Russian authorities to bring human rights violations before the court. The Council regularly expresses its disappointment that only very few complaints received by Mr Kalamanov have been followed by criminal proceedings so far.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Council keeps stressing to Russia that the return of the OSCE Assistance Group to Chechnya is important and that it should be able to fulfil its full mandate. Foreign Minister Ivanov recently expressed Russia's agreement to the return of the Assistance Group. Only a few technical questions remain to be resolved. The Council will watch closely to see if Ivanov's statement is followed by concrete steps.</p>
<p>In view of the Commission for human rights in Geneva (19-27 March), the EU is to bring the human rights situation in Chechnya before the Commission, considering that the recommendations from last year's Commission have not been fully implemented and that the human rights situation remains unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>As long as the situation in Chechnya does not substantially improve, the Council will insist on discussing this point at all political dialogue meetings and it will explain that the lack of progress on Chechnya remains an obstacle to developing the full scope of the envisaged EU-Russia partnership. Upcoming opportunities to express the Council's concern are the Cooperation Council with Russia on 10 April and the EU-Russia Summit on 17 May.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0168"></a>

<p>The Council as a whole is deeply committed to the fight against poverty. We believe that we possess the knowledge and resources to make substantial progress towards the international development goal of halving the proportion of people living in extreme poverty by the year 2015. You will remember that this goal was confirmed by 149 Heads of State and Government at the UN Millennium Summit last autumn.</p>
<p>In its joint declaration with the Commission on 10 November 2000, the Council stressed that the main objective of Community development policy must be to reduce and, eventually, to eradicate poverty. Poverty is a multidimensional phenomenon. Experience shows that poverty is not just a matter of lack of material resources – it is also a lack of access to power. To be poor means not being able to make one's voice heard. It is to feel insecure. To be poor is to have very little chance of influencing one's own life. This implies that poverty includes much more than the conventional dimensions of income or consumption. Poverty also includes risk, vulnerability, voicelessness and powerlessness. The fight against poverty must take all these dimensions into consideration. The perception of the poor themselves must be the starting point.</p>
<p>Bringing the different dimensions into our understanding of poverty inevitably leads us to see its context specificity.</p>
<p>Accordingly, in their declaration, the Council and the Commission went on to discuss ways of combating poverty, highlighting the importance of measures to improve:</p>
<p>Access to adequate food supplies, health and education, natural resources and drinking water, land, employment and credit facilities, information and communication technologies, political involvement, services and infrastructure. The Council also emphasised the need for consolidating the democratic process, respect for human rights, peace and the prevention of conflict, the development of social policies and the integration of social and environmental concerns in macro-economic reform programmes.</p>
<p>Another important dimension of development is the gravity of the communicable diseases, especially HIV/AIDS. In view of the global dimension of the problem and its impact on poverty, targeting this problem must be considered an absolute necessity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the declaration stressed the integration of developing countries, in particular the least developed among them, into the world economy. In this respect, the Council recognised that economic growth was essential, although not sufficient in itself to ensure poverty reduction.</p>
<p>The Council also supported the Commission’s view that Community activities should be concentrated in a limited number of areas selected on the basis of their contribution towards reducing poverty and for which Community action provides added value. These are trade, regional integration and cooperation, support to macroeconomic framework, transport, food security and institutional capacity building.</p>
<p>As a follow-up to the new development policy, the Commission has, on several occasions, stated that it will, early 2001, deliver a communication on how to strengthen its capacity to address the objective of poverty reduction in the EC development cooperation. The Swedish Presidency is of firm belief that the Commission will live up to its commitment in this area. Poverty cannot be handled as a sector or separate part of development cooperation. To implement the development policy, the interdisciplinary and poverty focused approach to development partnerships must be strengthened.

<p>Sanctions against the Taliban - and not against Afghanistan - have been adopted by the UN Security Council following the Taliban's refusal to extradite Usama bin Laden, who is abusing his host country as a basis to launch acts of international terrorism and as a convenient cover to set up a network of training camps for radical terrorist groups. The relevant UNSC Resolution 1267 (1999) further accuses the Taliban of, inter alia, massive violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law. The sanctions adopted concern a flight ban for aircraft under Taliban control and a freezing of Taliban assets.</p>
<p>As a result of the Taliban's persistent refusal to comply with the pertinent UNSC Resolutions, the UNSC adopted, in December 2000, its Resolution 1333 (2000), which oblige all UN Member States to adopt a new set of sanctions against the Taliban regime. These sanctions demand in particular: the prohibition of direct or indirect supply, sale and transfer of arms and related military material; the prohibition of the direct or indirect supply, sale and transfer of technical advise, assistance or training related to military activities of Taliban forces; the withdrawal of military experts and advisors from the Taliban regime; the closure of Taliban and of Ariana airlines offices; the freezing of assets of Usama bin Laden an individuals or entities associated with him; the prohibition of the sale, supply or transfer of the chemical acetic anhydride (necessary for the production of Heroin).</p>
<p>The Council, while fully sharing the honourable MEP's preoccupations concerning the disastrous humanitarian situation in Afghanistan, does not believe that these sanctions have or will disrupt the distribution of relief supplies. On the contrary, these targeted sanctions are aimed against a regime which, due to its ruthless pursuit of the civil war and of its massive violations of human rights and the international humanitarian law, is primarily responsible for the disastrous situation in Afghanistan. The severe drought has contributed to a further deterioration of the humanitarian situation. The Council expects that the sanctions will contribute to reduce outside interference and to promote a negotiated settlement of the Afghan conflict. The Council further expects that they will lead to a reduction in the production of Afghan drugs, thus reducing the revenue necessary for the Taliban to pursue and to finance the war.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the EU will continue to provide humanitarian aid to internally displaced Afghans and to Afghan refugees in neighbouring countries, whenever the difficult conditions on the ground allow.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0172"></a>

<p>A programme of Community action on the prevention of drug dependence within the framework action in the field of public health (1996-2000)1 was recently extended until 31 December 2001. The objective of this programme is to help in combating drug dependence, in particular by encouraging cooperation between Member States, supporting their action and promoting coordination between their policies and programmes, while ensuring consistency and complementarity with other relevant community programmes. It also provides for cooperation with non-member countries and relevant international organisations. The actions of the programme centre on the collection of data, research and evaluation as well as on information, education and training.</p>
<p>The programme will be replaced by the programme of Community action in the field of public health, presently being examined by Council.</p>
<p>Finally as the honourable Member knows the European Union attaches great attention to the fight against drugs.

<p>The honourable Member will certainly remember that in his recent speech delivered to the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy of the European Parliament (23.1.2001), the President of the Council has indicated the high priority it attaches to initiatives contributing to a greater use of non-fossil energy sources. As the Council had already the opportunity to do in its answer given to the question raised by Mary Honeyball during Question Time last February, it recalls the ongoing work in the following areas:</p>
<p>Following last December's Council (Industry/Energy) agreement on a political orientation on the proposed Directive for the promotion of electricity from renewable energy sources in the internal market, the Council will, within the coming weeks, formally adopt its common position on this text, which should confirm the commitment of Member States to a indicative Community target of electricity from renewable energy sources of 22.1% by the year 2010. This Directive will represent a significant progress in favour of electricity from renewable energy sources, all the more needed given the difficulties faced by the Climate change negotiations.</p>
<p>The Council (Industry/Energy) has welcomed with much interest the presentation of the Commission's Green Paper: "Towards a European strategy for the security of energy supply" at its December meeting. This paper, launched to raise an overall debate, proposes a strategy for dealing with the increasing dependence of the Union with regard to energy supply over a 20-year period. Within this strategy, as proposed by the Commission the enhancement of diversification of energy supplies and sources is an important part, and includes the increased efforts in the research of (alternative) new and clean energy sources (ies).</p>
<p>A comprehensive European sustainable development strategy will be prepared with a view to its examination by the European Council (Göteborg) in June 2001. To that effect, the Council, on the basis of a report from the Commission, will be examining the ongoing work on the strengthening of the strategy for the integration of environmental aspects and sustainable development into the energy sector (policy), as adopted at the European Council in Helsinki (1999). This examination will also include consideration of the Commission's Action Plan to improve energy efficiency as well as the proposal for a 6th Community Action Plan on sustainable development. It is our intention to draw some conclusions at the May Energy/Industry Council, in order to bring this work forward. Moreover, we expect that a number of actions will be launched under the Action Plan on energy efficiency on the basis of the priorities identified by the Council at its meeting on 5 December last.</p>
<p>Furthermore the Council recalls that among existing instruments for the promotion of cleaner energy, (the ALTENER and CARNOT subprogrammes of the Energy), the framework programme on Energy, i.e. ALTENER, SAVE, ETAP and CARNOT, is of specific (are particularly) importance (t).</p>
<p>Last but not least, as regards the relation between clean energy and physical disruptions, the Council considers that the progress towards the achievement of a fully operational internal energy market, as stated in the Lisbon European Council conclusions, will contribute to diminishing the influence of external factors on security of supply.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0176"></a>

It regrets that these efforts in many cases have not yet been translated into law. As a matter of fact, in law, women are discriminated against in many different ways, mainly based on Islamic law: inheritance (only half of that of a man), right of divorce, legal testimony, freedom of movement (permission to leave the country), etc. In practice, women are also discriminated against on the labour market (lower wages).</p>
<p>At the same time, the EU recognises that the situation of women is in many respects better in Iran than in many of the neighbouring countries. Women enjoy full legal rights to participate in political life in Iran; there are several women in the Iranian Parliament and some in important positions in the Government, such as one Vice-President. Women practice almost all professions - lawyers, journalists, doctors, business people, teachers; 60 per cent of university students are women.</p>

The decision to commit forces would have to be made by sovereign national governments.</p>
<p>The European Union has undertaken to respect the principles of the UN Charter, together with the principles of the Final Act of the Helsinki Agreement and the objectives of the Paris Charter. The Union also acknowledges that the UN Security Council has primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security.</p>
<p>The types of operation to which the rapid reaction force, as it is called, can be committed are clearly defined in the Treaty itself (Article 17.2 of the Treaty on European Union) and include the following:</p>

<p>According to reports in the Polish press, the Swedish Government's Minister for Equal Opportunities, Mrs Margareta Winberg, has strongly criticised Poland on account of the fact that, in that country, abortion is banned by law. Mrs Winberg's criticisms were expressed directly to a Polish Government Under-Secretary of State, Mrs Irena Boruta, who had been invited to Norrköping in order to attend an informal meeting of EU Social Affairs Ministers, together with representatives of other applicant countries.</p>
<p>Mrs Winberg made her comments in her official capacity, against the background of the Swedish presidency and in the context of the informal meeting of EU Ministers which was held at the end of January. Her exact words were allegedly as follows: 'It is unacceptable that a country which is knocking on the European Union's door should behave in such a way'. Mrs Boruta is said to have replied (again according to press reports) that the ban imposed under Polish law had been established by democratic means.</p>
<p>Is the Council aware of the attitude adopted by Mrs Winberg towards Poland and can it confirm the facts as reported? If so, does Mrs Winberg's attitude reflect the Council's official view?

<p>The Polish law of 7 January 1993 protects the life of unborn children and/or foetuses. The number of abortions in that applicant country has declined sharply: from more than 100 000 per year until 1988 to a few hundred in recent years. Representatives of the Presidency and of the EP have criticised the Polish law prohibiting abortion. As penal law is not subject to the ‘acquis’, does such a law have any relevance in negotiations with applicant countries, and would it play a role in the accession process?</p>
<p>Is the Council planning to include the issue of abortion law in the EU information campaign being carried out in Poland to prepare that country for membership or in any activity with that in mind?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>The Council would like to inform the honourable Members that it is not in the habit of expressing its views on the content of statements made by national ministers.</p>
<p>The Council believes that Poland continues to fulfil the political Copenhagen accession criteria, with which the applicant countries must have complied and which relate, namely, to stable institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for, and the protection of, minorities.</p>
<p>With regard to the special issue of abortion, the Council would remind the honourable Members that national abortion legislation does not fall within the Community’s competence. The issue of conformity with the Community’s regulations does not therefore arise.</p>
<p>With regard to Ireland, the Council also wishes to remind the honourable Members of Protocol No 17, annexed to the Treaty of European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, and of the Declaration of 1 May 1992 of the High Contracting Parties to the Treaty on European Union, which constitutes a legal interpretation of that Protocol.</p>
<p>The Council would remind the honourable Member that, in the Nice conclusions on 7–11 December 2000, the European Council insisted upon the historic significance of the European Union’s enlargement process, together with the political priority to be given to making this process succeed. The Council has welcomed the fact that the accession negotiations with the applicant countries have been intensified. These have led to very important progress, especially in recent months. This is naturally inconsistent with any suspicion of prejudice against any of the applicant countries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>On 5-7 February 2000, extremely serious incidents occurred in El Ejido in Andalusia. Both large numbers of eye witnesses and the media stated that the riots were racist and xenophobic in nature, and the European Parliament adopted a resolution severely censuring what had taken place. What does the Council intend to do in view of the fact that there have been no prosecutions or sentences in connection with the events at El Ejido a year ago, although almost 700 complaints have been lodged?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>1. The honourable Members should note that extensive and intensive debates are currently being conducted within the Council’s different bodies on a number of issues affecting immigration policy within the framework of an overarching strategy.</p>
<p>2. It may be remembered that Article 63 of the Treaty establishing the European Community provides for the Council to decide upon measures relating to policy on both legal and illegal immigration.</p>
<p>The European Council in Tampere called for a common EU policy on immigration to be developed and emphasised the need for an overarching strategy on all problems and issues affecting immigration. The Tampere conclusions gave priority not only to the fight against illegal immigration but also to an integration policy granting third country citizens legal status with appropriate rights and guarantees. The need to enter into partnership with immigrants’ countries of origin was also emphasised.</p>
<p>3. So as to be able to implement the regulations in Article 63 of the Treaty, the Commission has, as a result of the Tampere conclusions, designed a ‘scoreboard’ for monitoring progress in creating an ‘area of freedom, security and justice’ in the European Union. The scoreboard provides a detailed framework and a timetable for measures which will deal with all the relevant problems outlined in the Tampere conclusions in terms of a coordinated strategy. The Commission is also considering developing a new immigration strategy and establishing a framework for the Community’s immigration policy. A communication was therefore submitted recently to the Council, with a long-term strategy for dealing with immigration that requires a large number of effective measures to be taken both by the Community and the Member States.</p>
<p>4. On the basis of the scoreboard, the Commission has already presented the Council with various proposals for legislative measures, and these are at present being discussed both at technical and political levels. The Commission will shortly be tabling further proposals which will be announced on the scoreboard.</p>
<p>5. With regard to partnership with immigrants’ countries of origin, the work done by the high-level group for asylum and immigration is of the greatest importance. The high-level group developed an integrated strategy, not confined to any one pillar, for tackling the basic reasons why people migrate or become refugees and drew up action plans for certain countries from which asylum seekers and/or illegal immigrants come, including Morocco. Within the framework for implementing this plan in the course of the year 2000, two measures are of special relevance to the situation of migrant workers in Spain. These measures, comprising the following, are described in a document that was presented to the European Council in Nice.</p>
<p>– Programmes to assist the integration of Moroccan immigrants in Spain, for which the Spanish authorities have earmarked a total of EUR 4 373 589.</p>
<p>– An agreement between ministers of health and social affairs from Spain and Morocco concerning Moroccan seasonal workers in Spain.</p>
<p>6. The Council also emphasises that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is applicable to the Community institutions and the Member States only when they apply Community law, which is not the case in the current situation. However, the Council has resources available to it, such as the programme for combating social exclusion, and, through these, it can intervene to improve situations.</p>
<p>7. Finally, the Council would ask the honourable Members to note that the events in El Ejido, the prosecution of those responsible for the criminal acts committed under these circumstances, and decisions concerning preventive measures are issues which fall within the competence of the Member State concerned.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Illegal immigration towards the European Union is one of the main issues the Council is dealing with, as shown by the conclusions of the European Councils in Tampere, Santa Maria da Feira and Nice. As the honourable Member will be aware, the European Council committed the European Union to intensified cooperation to combat trafficking in human beings, following the tragic events in Dover last year. However, regarding the first question, it is not for the Council to conduct such an inquiry. This matter falls within the exclusive competence of the authorities of each Member State. The Council is not authorised to take a position on a matter which does not fall within the scope of the powers conferred upon it by the Treaties.</p>
<p>The Council is concerned about the difficult situation for Kurds in many of their countries of origin. But there are many reasons why people, including Kurds, are fleeing to Europe from their countries of origin, including poverty, economic hardship or simply a natural desire for a better life, as well as political persecution. The EU is doing what it can to promote conditions which will reduce these pressures both politically and economically. The Accession Partnership with Turkey has a number of priorities and intermediate objectives with specific relevance for Turkish citizens of Kurdish origin. The EU strongly supports the Peace Process in the Middle East. It welcomes the fact that under UNSCRs a significant proportion of the oil-for-food programme is used in the Kurdish parts of Iraq. The Council also underlines the importance of the Action Plan for Iraq on asylum and migration adopted by the Tampere European Council. The Council is currently working on the implementation of the Action Plan, which includes, among other measures, a dialogue with Turkey on questions concerning migration.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0212"></a>

<p>The Council is fully aware of the environmental problems caused by the plans for expanding the port of Primorsk, by the construction of a pipeline to that port and by the fact that tankers will be navigating the Gulf of Finland. The matter was therefore discussed under "other business" by the Council at its meetings of 10 October 2000 and 8 March 2001 (Environment).</p>
<p>The Community has raised the matter on different occasions in the relevant bodies under the EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, including at the EU-Russia summit on 30 October 2000. Each time, the Community expressed its concern and suggested establishing, in the framework of the Espoo Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context, an international panel that would evaluate the trans-border impact of the extensions of the port. The Council was informed that the Russian authorities have undertaken an environmental impact assessment and will take measures to preserve the environment around Primorsk and to protect the approaches to that port against oil spills. In particular, they informed the Finnish authorities that they intend to protect the maritime approaches to Primorsk by a strict implementation of the Marpol convention, i.a. by imposing the anticipated use of double hull tankers, and that they would in addition consider carefully the plans for constructing the oil terminal and the pipeline to St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>All the statistics show that it is becoming increasingly difficult for refugees to enter the EU. The extension of transporters' responsibility introduced during the French Presidency is simply another expression of this tendency. Airlines, which already have to pay for a return ticket for refugees who do not have valid travel documents, are now to be subject to even higher fines. This means that it will become more difficult for refugees to enter the EU legally to seek asylum and plays into the hands of the people smugglers.</p>
<p>Is it reasonable to expect refugees fleeing from countries which are guilty of massive violations of human rights to have 'their papers in order'? Does the Council not see a risk that the extension of transporters' responsibility may be playing even more into the hands of people smugglers by making the conditions for entering the EU legally even stricter?

<p>The proposal to which the honourable Member refers is an initiative of the French Republic with a view to the adoption of a Council Directive on the harmonisation of financial penalties imposed on carriers transporting into the territory of the Member States third-country nationals lacking the documents necessary for admission. <a href="#defann_27_1" name="refann_27_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></p>
<p>This text, which was forwarded to the European Parliament for consultation on 6 September 2000, is at present being examined by the competent Council bodies.</p>
<p>The initiative draws on the will to cooperate in implementing a coherent policy for combating illegal immigration at European level. Such a policy cannot be restricted to taking measures that apply solely to illegal immigrants. Action must also and especially be directed effectively against the vectors and means that accompany, or even encourage, the phenomenon. Making carriers answerable is an essential part of this approach.</p>
<p>The implementation of this policy must, however, involve a shared attitude on the part of Member States, since it is essential that the European Union present a united front in its struggle against illegal immigration. A common approach is also required for the system to be effective. Divergent situations in the various Member States could lead to distortions of competition in particular in the field of air transport.</p>
<p>In that light, the essential aim of the initiative is to harmonise the penalties applicable to carriers as provided for in Article 26 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement.</p>
<p>I would draw the attention of the honourable Member to the fact that according to Article 26(2) of that Convention and recital No 3 of the French initiative, ‘the draft Directive is without prejudice to the obligations resulting from the Geneva Convention of 28 June 1951 on the status of refugees, as amended by the New York Protocol of 31 January 1967.’</p>
<p>As recognised by Heads of State and Governments at the Tampere European Council a future Community asylum and immigration policy must be based on the full and integral application of the Geneva Convention, on rules governing the orderly admission and integration of legally arriving third country nationals, on measures aimed at combating illegal immigration, as well as on partnership with countries of origin of asylum seekers and illegal migrants. The French initiative falls under the third of these four guiding principles.</p>
<p>Finally, I would point out that the competent administrations of the Member States regularly train employees of transport companies in the detection of false papers and that it must be remembered that any person who wishes to enter another State must first pass through the passport control organised by the border police of that State.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>An article in the newspaper ‘Neues Deutschland’, which has been reproduced in the Greek press, mentions the existence of a secret plan involving the annexation by Albania of certain regions of southern Serbia, Montenegro and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The article also refers to a 360-page report allegedly drawn up by a team of 30 experts at the request of the Secretary-General of NATO and the EU’s foreign policy services. Not only does the report fail to rule out the possibility of supporting the positions advocated by nationalist circles in Tirana who favour a Greater Albania, it even proposes solutions that would involve this approach, a policy which would enable NATO to remain in the region for decades to come and would better serve Western interests by providing them with military protection.</p>

This fresh attack which was provocatively called a 'routine' operation is one more crime against the Iraqi people who are still suffering the consequences of the Gulf War and the inhuman embargo imposed on the country. It is also a blatant violation of the rules of international law and is the first sign of a new escalation in moves to destabilise the sensitive Middle East region.</p>

<p>As is well known, American and British aircraft attacked military targets outside Baghdad on 16 February. The reason given for the attack was an increase in Iraqi anti-aircraft fire directed at the British and US warplanes patrolling the "no­fly" zones in northern and southern Iraq. The United States and United Kingdom have made statements stressing that the action was taken by way of self-defence, was of a routine nature and should not be regarded as an escalation or change of policy. Several countries have criticised the action taken. The Security Council held a brief discussion of the matter during informal consultations on 20 February.</p>
<p>As was also noted earlier by the Presidency during a debate at the European Parliament on 1 March of this year, there are differing opinions within the Union concerning the basis in international law for such military actions, including those in the no-fly zones. One Member State participated in the strikes. Other Member States have deplored what happened, but the Common Foreign and Security Policy depends on the existence of a common position and, as you all know, that is not the case here.</p>
<p>As for the sanctions, Security Council Resolution 1284 of December 1999 allows for the possibility of suspending them provided the Iraqi Government cooperates fully with the UN inspectors responsible for disarmament in Iraq. It is encouraging in this connection to note that a dialogue has been initiated in New York between the Secretary-General and the Iraqi Government. Naturally, we hope that these discussions can help break the deadlock and that Iraq will decide to cooperate with the UN and the UN’s weapons inspectors on the basis of the current Security Council Resolutions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0233"></a>

The candidate countries are participating in the accession process on an equal footing. They must share the values and objectives of the European Union as set out in the Treaties. Furthermore, compliance with the political criteria laid down at the Copenhagen European Council is a prerequisite for the opening of accession negotiations.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member will also know, the Helsinki European Council also established a tailor-made pre-accession strategy for Turkey. Work on this pre-accession strategy is now ongoing.

Turkey will respond to the Accession Partnership in its National Programme for the Adoption of the Acquis (NPAA).</p>

<p>The EU has on several occasions raised the recommendations contained in the report of the Electoral Observation Mission to Sri Lanka, both publicly and bilaterally with the Sri Lankan authorities.</p>
<p>On 18 December, the EU issued a declaration in the run up of the World Bank Development Forum on Sri Lanka, where good governance was one of the key issues. The declaration recalled that the observer mission was a demonstration of the EU's support for the democratic process in Sri Lanka, regretted and condemned the anomalies observed throughout the campaign and the violence during the voting, and reminded the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) of the need to implement the mission's recommendations in order to guarantee greater transparency in future elections.</p>
<p>More recently, the issue was discussed at the EC-Sri Lanka Joint Commission, which took place in Colombo on 27/28 February 2000, within the wider discussion on improving governance in Sri Lanka. The EU was anxious to engage GoSL in constructive talks on this issue, following up on the report's recommendations and with the aim of developing an agreed programme of action which would improve the quality of governance in the country.</p>
<p>The GoSL assured the EU that the principal recommendations of the report had been noted and that necessary measures were either under consideration, notably in the framework of the revision of the Sri Lankan constitution which the GoSL proposed before the elections, or were already being implemented.</p>
<p>At this stage, the Council is not yet in a position to confirm whether the High Representative Solana will be able to meet the Sri Lankan President during her forthcoming visit in Brussels. The Council is, however, confident that the President of the Commission will raise, once again, the crucial question of improving good governance in Sri Lanka in his talks with the President Kumaratunga.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0146"></a>

<p>In its declaration on the future of the Union annexed to the Treaty of Nice, the Intergovernmental Conference expressed its desire for a broad and in-depth debate on the future of the European Union. This debate, encouraged by the Swedish and Belgian Presidencies, in cooperation with the Commission and with the participation of the European Parliament, will involve all the interested parties: the representatives of the national parliaments and public opinion as a whole, including representatives of political, economic and academic fields, representatives of civil society and candidate countries, according to procedures to be defined.

The Commission believes that, at that conference, and also during the preparatory stages for it, the fundamental issues on the aims of the Union should be raised.</p>
<p>The questions we will be raising on the future of the Union will lead us to a consideration of the distribution of Community competences. It is within that framework that sport, amongst other issues, will no doubt be dealt with. However, it does not seem appropriate to approach this ‘constitutional’ debate by dealing with specific policies. We must first of all produce a coherent and sustainable plan for the enlarged Union. Once this coherent plan has been drawn up, we will be able more specifically to raise the question of the role of a particular policy and we will therefore have the opportunity to create a specific legal basis for sport.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0224"></a>

<p>The ‘Establishment of the National Land Registry’ project in Greece benefits from Community aid (ERDF) to the value of around EUR 105 million under the CCA II ‘Environment’ programme.</p>
<p>The objective set by the programme for this project is to create an operational land registry covering an area of around 28 200 km<span class="sup">2</span> by the end of 2001. Unfortunately, recent available information indicates that, while 83% of the budget has been employed, only 21% of the works have been carried out to date.</p>
<p>There have been delays and shortcomings in the implementation of this programme. Six years after the approval of the operational programme and despite the allocation of significant Community funds, not a single part of the project is operational. Therefore, on 19 January, the Commission sent a letter to the Greek authorities requesting clarifications and raising the possibility of applying Article 24 of Regulation (EEC) 4253 of 19 December 1988, which lays down that, in the event of proven irregularities, Community aid can be reduced or even cancelled.</p>
<p>The Commission will not take a decision until it has made an in-depth analysis of the Greek authorities’ response.</p>

<p>The Commission acknowledges that certain weaknesses have been identified in relation to the programming periods previous to 2000-2006 with regard to the implementation of the Community INTERREG initiative on the Franco-Spanish border. The difficulties arose essentially as a result of the absence of common programming and management methods for these Structural Fund actions.</p>
<p>For the 2000-2006 programming period, within its Guidelines on Interreg III, the Commission has laid down that the use of new methods for the development of cross-border cooperation is mandatory. Hence, item 7 of the said Guidelines lays down that the development of a common strategy is a necessary requirement for the acceptance of projects proposed for Community funding. All specific operations selected must be of a clearly cross-border nature. The only eligible operations are therefore those which are selected and implemented jointly. Furthermore, the implementation of the cooperation must make use of common management structures.</p>
<p>In relation to the existence of legal structures for cross-border cooperation, the Commission’s Guidelines for Interreg 2000-2006 allow Member States the opportunity of choosing the most suitable means for promoting that cooperation. In the specific case of the Franco-Spanish border, the two Member States and all the regions involved have proposed that the region of Aquitaine should take on the role of common management authority for the new programme. The role of payment authority will be taken by the Spanish Minister for Finance. A joint technical secretariat will operate from the region of Aquitaine. Three subcommittees for the selection of projects will also operate in a joint manner.</p>
<p>This programme was presented to the Commission on 22 November 2000. It has been deemed admissible and negotiations are commencing between the Commission and the competent regional and national authorities. The Commission expects it to be formally approved by the summer.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0135"></a>

<p>The European Employment Strategy (EES) which is the cornerstone for European Social Fund (ESF) activity deals with this issue. In guideline 7, the employment guidelines encourage Member States to “implement appropriate measures to meet the needs of the disabled, ethnic minorities and migrant workers as regards there integration in to the labour market and set national targets where appropriate for this purpose”. Recently agreed ESF programmes reflect these commitments.</p>
<p>In reforming ESF, there was a desire to move away from the target group approach to programme development to one based on defining clearer policy themes. This aimed to move to a position of management by objectives rather than management by inputs (e.g. numbers in a target group). Consequently, one of the 5 policy fields specifically promoted through ESF focuses on “promoting equal opportunities for all in accessing the labour market, with particular emphasis on those exposed to social exclusion”.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Commission considers equal opportunities not only with regard to women and men but in its broadest sense in the application of Structural Funds allocations. There are a number of references to the objective of including all groups of people and combating any discrimination or social exclusion.1</p>
<p>The aim of the Community Initiative EQUAL, funded by the European Social Fund, is to promote new means of combating all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market.</p>
<p>In this framework, ESF programmes have made a clear commitment to supporting the needs of people with disabilities and others at risk of social exclusion. Latest estimates suggest that the ESF will contribute in the region of 9 billion Euro towards the fight against social exclusion over the period 2000-2006.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0136"></a>

<p>The Commission is currently finalising its opinion on the Council’s common position on the Directive on the promotion of electricity from renewable energy sources. This opinion will also set out the Commission’s position on the provisions in the common position relating to the incineration of certain forms of waste including biodegradable urban and industrial waste.</p>
<p>With regard to waste management, the Community Support Framework for Italy’s Objective 1 regions stipulates that actions will focus on: the establishment of ‘ambiti territoriali ottimali’ and their management plans (a prerequisite for undertaking further actions); the promotion and staging of information campaigns for prevention and innovation; the development of a system for integrated waste management in line with Community priorities and the organisation of training actions and actions aimed at creating new businesses. </p>
<p>The definition of the management plans (drafted in accordance with Community Directives 91/156/EEC, 91/689/EEC and 94/62/EEC) and priorities for action must be consistent with the Community priorities in the field of waste management and must stipulate the prior analysis of the region’s needs and specific characteristics. </p>
<p>The Commission – in line with the Community Strategy for Waste Management as well as the Parliament Resolution and the Council Resolution on waste management in the Community – considers that ‘prevention of the generation of waste shall remain the first priority, where the generation can not be avoided, it should be reused or recovered for its material or its energy. Preference should be given, where environmentally sound, to the recovery of materials over energy recovery operations’. In other words, recycling shall take precedence over incineration. As stipulated in the above-mentioned directives, waste management plans must be reported to the Commission, which will establish whether they comply with the directives.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The European Commission grants authorisations for mergers involving European companies. Its main concern is clearly to ensure that the rules on competition are applied.</p>
<p>Major companies which decide to merge always use mergers to get rid of thousands of jobs and to close down industrial sites.</p>
<p>The adverse employment and social consequences of mergers usually come to the attention of public opinion when the merger is announced and therefore cannot escape the Commission’s notice when it gives its opinion.</p>
<p>The job losses are particularly shocking because they occur in companies whose success and good performance are plain for all to see. Despite this, the Commission does not seem to take any account of this aspect of mergers when it grants authorisations.</p>
<p>Since the European Union, in all of the texts it adopts on economic policy, is in the habit of adding one or two paragraphs saying that it wishes to preserve Europe’s social dimension, and in order to ensure that these declarations do not remain just meaningless words, we should like to know how many mergers the current Commission has authorised and how many jobs have been lost as a result?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The worldwide trend of increasing merger activities is clearly reflected in the growing number of cases notified to and decided by the Commission. In 2000 the Commission made 345 decisions, which means an increase of 28% compared to 1999. The respective figure for 1999 was 270, which represented an 18% increase over the previous year. In 2000, 321 cases were cleared in Phase I, of which 28 were cleared conditionally; in phase II three cases were cleared unconditionally, 12 with conditions attached, and two were prohibited (six cases were withdrawn during an in-depth investigation before a final decision was taken).</p>
<p>It is not possible to ascertain exactly how many jobs are lost due to mergers. The figures mentioned (if any) when mergers are announced very often do not adequately reflect the actual development afterwards. Figures provided may both under- and overestimate eventual job losses. In addition, it is not always clear, whether job losses can really be attributed to mergers as such, or whether they are not rather the result of exogenous changes in market conditions and induced structural changes, which are at the same time the driving forces behind these mergers. A balanced evaluation of the effect of mergers and other restructuring on jobs would also have to take account of possible job preservation effects.</p>
<p>However, there can be no doubt that mergers do very often involve substantial cuts in employment, and that this presents a very severe problem, especially for those workers who are directly affected. The basic objective of the Community’s competition policy is to ensure the maintenance of competitive markets. At the same time, competition policy has important implications for employment and social policy and it seems necessary to examine the links which exist between these policies.</p>
<p>Within the current context it appears for example important that the views and interests of workers and their representatives are adequately reflected and heard in the process leading to the establishment of a merger. This concerns first of all effective involvement of workers' representatives within the concerned companies, through adequate and timely procedures of information and consultation as provided for in existing Community and national legislation and practice, as well as in legislation under adoption (notably the Commission's proposal on information and consultation in the EC). It also concerns the possibility for them to present their views to competent public authorities, notably on the implications of planned mergers, as provided for, e.g., in the Merger Regulation.</p>
<p>As announced in the Commission’s Social Policy Agenda of June last year and endorsed by the Nice European Council the Commission will continue to examine the relationship between social policy and competition policy with a view to better articulate both policies, as well as to address the employment and social consequences of economic and market integration (mergers, acquisitions).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0140"></a>

<p>In December 1998, the European Parliament organised a public hearing to collect information on action undertaken by the Member States to improve the safety of existing lifts in line with Commission Recommendation 95/216/EC<a href="#defann_48_1" name="refann_48_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.

<p>The Commission believes it is important that the safety of lifts already in service continues to improve, which is the aim of Commission Recommendation 95/216/EC of 8 June 1995, concerning the improvement of safety for existing lifts. It recommends that Member States take all necessary action to improve the safety of existing lifts, based on the principles given in Annex I to the Recommendation.</p>
<p>The public hearing organised by Parliament in December 1998 certainly helped raise awareness on this issue within the Community.</p>
<p>A standard on the safety of existing lifts would be very useful. In fact the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) is currently drafting a standard on the “Rules for the improvement of safety of existing lifts”. This draft standard will soon be subject to public inquiry. It is likely to become an important tool for Member States in their efforts to take action according to the Commission Recommendation.</p>
<p>Parliament and Council Directive 95/16/EC of 29 June 1995, on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to lifts assures the circulation of “new” lifts in the European economic area (EEA). It would therefore not be possible to use it as a legal base for mandating a harmonised CEN standard on existing lifts.</p>
<p>The elaboration of standards is a responsibility of CEN and is based on priorities laid down by all involved parties, as national standardisation bodies, industries, etc. CEN being a private body, it has the possibility to elaborate all documents it deems necessary or useful to help industry and to ensure a high level of safety. In the case where there is no mandate from the Commission, such an elaborated standard can not give any presumption of conformity according to New Approach Directives but remains a very useful guidance tool for industry and user.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Community guidelines on State aid to maritime transport have been effective since 5th July 1997, the date of their publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities. It is expected that the guidelines will be revised in 2002.</p>
<p>With respect to the issue of tendering in relation to the ferry services off the west coast of Scotland which are currently operated by Caledonian MacBrayne, the state aid guidelines must be seen in the light of Council Regulation 3577/92 of 7 December 19922 on the freedom to provide services to maritime transport within Member States. Article 4 of this Regulation permits public service obligations for the provision of maritime transport services, within a Member State, on shipping companies participating in regular services to, from and between islands. Whenever a Member State imposes public service obligations, it shall define it precisely and entrust it on a non-discriminatory basis in respect of all Community shipowners; it shall also limit the financial support to the extra costs incurred by the operator in providing the service. A public tender is an effective way of meeting these requirements and ensuring the market price of the services concerned. It is for this reason that the state aid guidelines specify the expectation of a public tender as one of the criteria for permitting the reimbursement of operating losses incurred as a direct result of fulfilling certain public service obligations not to have to be formally notified as State aid under Article 88(3) of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>There are currently no plans to alter Article 4 of Council Regulation 3577/92. Whatever form the revision of the state aid guidelines may finally take, the principle of non-discrimination will remain and will need to be fulfilled by Member States wishing to establish public service obligations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0154"></a>

<p>The main principles of the protection of the health and safety of workers are laid down by the Framework Directive 89/391/EEC on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work. These principles are fully applicable to workers on board of all kind of vessels. Article 16 of this directive establishes that individual directives should be developed to cover activities of specific risk, in particular, in the field of fisheries and agriculture.</p>
<p>For this reason, in 1993, the Council adopted Directive 93/103/EC concerning the minimum safety and health requirements for work on board fishing vessels.</p>
<p>This directive sets down the minimum safety and health requirements for new fishing vessels (in Annex I), and for existing vessels (in Annex II) including, inter alia, the minimum requirements on seaworthiness and stability, as well as on the conditions of decks, bulkheads and deckheads in order to prevent falls. In particular, Article 7(1) foresees that Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that, without prejudice to the skipper's responsibility, owners shall keep on board the vessel an adequate quantity of suitable equipment and survival equipment in good working order and, without prejudice to the provisions established by the Council Directive 89/656/EEC on the minimum requirements for the use by workers of personal protective equipment at the workplace, shall take account of the personal protective equipment specifications given in Annex IV to Directive 93/103/EC.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Commission, being extremely sensitive to the protection of falls and drowning, adopted a Communication in 1989 for the implementation of the Council Directive 89/656/EEC concerning the assessment of the safety aspects of personal protective equipment with a view to the choice and use thereof. Paragraph 8 of the Annex of this Communication describes the non-exhaustive information for evaluating life jackets for professional use as personal protective equipment. This description includes the risk, the origin and type of risk and the safety and performance criteria for selection of equipment.</p>
<p>In this context, the Commission considers that the above mentioned directives cover in a reasonable way the prevention of the risk of drowning. However, it should be noted that it belongs to the national authorities of the Member States the control and enforcement of the national legislation transposing the Health and Safety Directives.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0155"></a>

<p>The honourable Member raises the important issue of how public health and new technologies interact as regards in particular the expanding use of telecommunication systems.</p>
<p>A European protection framework is already in place in form of the Council Recommendation of 1999 on the limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields. The Terrestrial Trunk Radio (TETRA) system, which the honourable Member mentions, was already known and taken into account during the preparation of the Recommendation, and the system is covered by the scope of the Recommendation. The exposure limits of the Recommendation are not based on the effects of any particular system, but on the guidelines regarding protection against health effects from exposure to electromagnetic fields developed by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection. These guidelines, which include specific exposure limits regarding the TETRA system, were endorsed by the Commission’s Scientific Steering Committee, which stated that these international guidelines provide the appropriate basis to develop exposure limits against public health risks.</p>
<p>In order to cover any new scientific findings and to ensure that the scientific basis, on which the Council Recommendation is based, is still valid, the Scientific Steering Committee has been asked to give an up-dated opinion in June 2001.</p>
<p>To ensure a uniform level of protection throughout the Community the Commission has mandated the standardisation bodies (CENELEC and ETSI) to work on establishing European standards, including harmonised methods of calculation and measurement. This will enable verification that the safe exposure limits set in the Recommendation are met. A first standard for mobile telephones is expected to be available in June 2001, and other standards will follow.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0157"></a>

<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of the importance of opening a Delegation in Riyadh.</p>
<p>In 1998, the Commission included Saudi Arabia in its list of priorities for the opening of new Delegations and Offices. But, the Commission does not at present have sufficient resources - financial and human - to enable it to open all the Offices it would like.</p>
<p>The overall structure of the External Service is currently under review, not least to take account of the new needs arising from the reform and deconcentration of external assistance. The emphasis must be on consolidating the existing network of delegations.</p>

<p>The Commission is aware that the situation for women in Iran leaves a lot to be desired.

(For instance, the proposal to raise the age of marriage for girls from 9 to 14 is only slowly making its way through the decision-making bodies.)</p>
<p>The lack of progress on reform and the backlash in the areas of freedom of the press and freedom of expression give rise to concern.</p>
<p>The Commission has tried to take both sides of this picture into account in its Communication to the Council on the relations with Iran.

<p>The Commission shares the honourable Member's interest to ensure that new information and communication technologies benefit both rural and urban areas within the Community. The Commission recognises that such technologies can present an important opportunity for the economic and social development of rural areas, by overcoming features such as distance and isolation, which have previously constrained their development. However, to realise this potential, it is also clear that rural areas and communities need the same level of access to these technologies, and under similar conditions, to users of these technologies in urban centres.</p>
<p>The new Structural Funds regulations for the period 2000-2006 provide the scope for financing actions in this field. Indeed, the information society has been identified in Commission Guidelines for the period 2000-2006 as one of the priorities to be implemented. That priority has been converted into practice as a feature of most Objective 1 and 2 programmes. The choice of measures within these programmes is then the responsibility of the Member States and regions.</p>
<p>Moreover, the second instalment of intervention under the heading of innovative actions in regional policy includes financing for programmes to promote the information society at the service of regional development. This applies to all regions, rural or urban, that are eligible in whole or in part for Objectives 1 and 2.</p>
<p>In recognition of their interest for rural areas, the Commission identified the use of new technologies to make the products and services of rural areas more competitive as one of the four priority themes for the Community Initiative for rural development for the period 2000-2006, LEADER+.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0171"></a>

<p>The Commission is, of course, very aware of the desperate humanitarian situation which exists today in many parts of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Winters are particularly harsh in Afghanistan, made worse this year by the continuation during the winter of the ongoing conflict and by the prolonged effects of the worst drought in the country for 30 years.</p>
<p>International donors have reacted to this crisis with increased shipments of food aid and medical supplies, as well as continuing with support for activities in the field by United Nations agencies, international aid agencies and NGOs.</p>
<p>Except for a brief period following the introduction of the latest UN sanctions the activities of these aid agencies and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have continued as previously.</p>
<p>The Commission’s own activities through the UN and others on behalf of vulnerable groups of internationally displaced persons (IDPs) and Afghan refugees are also continuing.</p>
<p>The Union’s position on the situation in Afghanistan is clear and is set out in the latest Common Position on Afghanistan dated 22 January 2001.</p>
<p>In this Common Position, which of course the Commission fully supports, the Union sets out its principle objectives as being the bringing about of a lasting peace, the ending of foreign intervention and the encouragement of an inter-Afghan dialogue through the UN.</p>
<p>The Union applies a set of sanctions, which were decided by the UN Security Council under Chapter VII of the UN Charter and are therefore mandatory for UN members. In addition, it continues to apply its own embargo on the export of arms, munitions and military equipment to those parts of Afghanistan that are not controlled by the Taliban and urges other countries to adopt a similar policy.</p>
<p>Some days ago, the restrictive measures against the Taliban set out in UNSCR 1333 of 19 December 2000 have been adopted by the Council following discussions between the Member States and the Commission. Any decision on the lifting of these sanctions will have to be compatible with the obligations of Member States under the UN Charter.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0173"></a>

<p>The European Anti-Poverty Network (EAPN) resolution that is mentioned by the honourable Member firstly calls for European guidelines to improve access to healthcare for all and strongly argues for the need to develop an integrated approach to health issues within social inclusion. The Commission considers that the open method of coordination that has just started in the field of social inclusion provides the appropriate framework for addressing these EAPN concerns, keeping in mind the limits of Community competencies in the area of health.</p>
<p>In accordance with Article 152 of the EC Treaty, Community action in the field of health complements and supports that of Member States, by promoting cooperation among them. It shall fully respect their responsibilities in the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care. Recent initiatives in this respect includes a Communication on the health strategy of the Community, and a proposal for a new programme of action in the field of public health (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2000&amp;nu_doc=0285">COM (2000) 285</a> final of 16.5.2000). The communication identifies wide variations and inequalities in health status among the serious public health problems that cannot be ignored. The proposal for a new programme, which is currently being discussed by Parliament and the Council, contains a key action on developing strategies and measures on socio-economic health determinants. The purpose is inter alia to develop a methodology for benchmarking and linking strategies to identify health inequalities, and to review and identify obstacles to access to health services across internal borders in the Community.</p>
<p>Concerning the need to promote equal access to health as a part of efforts for promoting social inclusion, the Nice European Council adopted a set of common objectives for policies against social exclusion and poverty, among which it is mentioned the need for "policies which aim to provide access for all to healthcare appropriate to their situation, including situations of dependency". The Commission is committed to ensuring that this priority is properly reflected in the national action plans to combat social exclusion that Member States will submit by 1st June 2001</p>
<p>The EAPN resolution also calls for universal and equal access to good quality social protection, including health care, to be a condition of membership of the Community for candidate countries.</p>
<p>Membership of the Community requires adoption and full implementation by a candidate country of the acquis communautaire. In the area of public health this covers essentially Community programmes and tobacco directives. In this context, the Council Recommendation 92/442/EEC on the Convergence of Social Protection Objectives and Policies sets out a range of principles to guide the development of social protection systems, including health care. From the starting of the negotiation process the Community has recalled the importance it attaches to assuring a high level of human health protection in the definition and implementation of all Community policies.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the candidates countries are invited to develop a health monitoring system in order to obtain health data and indicators comparable with the Community health monitoring system. At the moment all the candidate countries, with the exception of Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey, have accepted the acquis. This is already implemented in their legal system, or will be implemented before the accession. The Commission continues to monitor this closely.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0175"></a>

<p>Recent research carried out by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions has highlighted the fact that economic efficiency, environmental protection and workplace safety are three key policy areas of sustainable development.

How does the Commission intend to follow up this research, with particular regard to helping SMUs to deal with these issues on the same basis as large companies?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The objective of the sustainable development policy is to ensure that enterprise policies, environmental policies and social policies are conducted consistently. In particular, in their implementation, they must take into account any impact they may have on each other, in order, for example, to ensure that the implementation of environmental measures will have the lowest possible impact on the international competitiveness of European enterprises.</p>
<p>The implementation of these policies can lead to the introduction of new legislation or legal obligations and thus place constraints on undertakings, in particular in the areas of the environment, health or safety, as demonstrated by the research conducted by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions.</p>
<p>In general, such constraints will be proportionally greater for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Taking size into account, the cost of learning about the regulatory framework (access to information, acting on that information, making adjustments for the particular circumstances of the enterprise, etc) is, of course, relatively higher for SMEs.</p>
<p>As a means of reducing the cost to SMEs, the proximity networks solution has been considered to be one of the most effective, and the operation of enterprise support networks such as Euro Info Centres (EICs) is a response to exactly that concern.</p>
<p>Those networks were set up for the purpose of providing, at local level and close to enterprises, information and assistance services covering all areas of interest to SMEs, particularly access to financing, participation in European programmes and the Community standards framework, including in the areas of the environment and employment.</p>
<p>Their mission is not confined to making information available, but extends to a proactive approach that can be adapted to enterprises' needs.</p>
<p>In that context, the EIC network has been especially active on environmental, health and safety matters. A campaign has been launched as part of the SAFE programme to promote best practice on matters of health and safety at the workplace, and considerable expertise on questions of the environment is present across the whole network.</p>
<p>Yet, although the diversity of the existing networks, born of different programmes and answering to specific objectives, makes it possible to respond to a wide variety of needs, it is also liable to project a heterogeneous image which can be a source of confusion to enterprises.</p>
<p>For that reason, and in the context of the multiannual programme for enterprises and in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) (2001-2005), the Commission has undertaken to review the operation of the existing support networks with a view to improving their integration and streamlining.</p>
<p>That approach is consistent with the line of reducing duplication and increasing efficiency in order to guarantee better visibility and ease of access to beneficiaries by boosting the operation of these services at local and regional level.</p>
<p>The Commission approved a first stage in that approach on 21 February 2001.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0177"></a>

<p>To date, International Labour Organisation Convention No 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labour has been ratified by a total of 62 countries around the world, including a very large number of developing countries. The pace of ratification of the new Convention by ILO Member States overall has thus been very rapid, and according to the ILO itself has set a record compared with other ILO Conventions. The Commission is hopeful that this will contribute to the new Convention becoming increasingly recognised as a standard of universal validity.</p>
<p>The Commission is following with particular interest the ratification of the Convention by the Member States, notably in view of the Recommendation adopted by the Commission on 15 September 2000, which encouraged those Member States which have not yet done so to ratify the new Convention. So far, the Convention has been ratified by six Member States: Ireland, Finland, the United Kingdom, Italy, Portugal and Denmark.</p>
<p>While it is difficult to assess the implementation of the new Convention in practice, given that it only entered into force in November 2000, the Commission will follow closely the ILO's own assessments in this regard.</p>
<p>The Commission wishes to take this opportunity to stress that the elimination of child labour is a goal which it is actively pursuing in its own development policy, notably via the funding of projects specifically devoted to this issue in a number of developing countries. The Commission would further underline that the phenomenon of child labour is closely linked to poverty, and that poverty elimination is at the heart of its development policy in general. It is against this background that the Community in the trade context continues to pursue a policy of incentives to promote core labour standards, rather than sanctions, which would be counterproductive in that they risk exacerbating the social problems that they seek to redress.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0179"></a>

<p>The adverse economic conditions and the absence of state mechanisms in the countries of the Balkans have created a climate in which crime flourishes, particularly prostitution and drugs trafficking. In many of the new countries vast drugs trafficking networks have sprung up which work hand in hand with many national mafias. Moreover, over the last three years, the number of women falling into the hands of gangs of people traffickers has increased threefold every year: they are removed from the poor countries where they live and taken to the murky underworld of prostitution in the EU countries. What measures does the Commission intend to take to ensure that the administration of justice is better organised in the Balkan countries, that policing and cross-border controls are improved and, finally, that the countries of the EU cease to function as recipients of trafficking in human beings?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The fundamental objectives of the Union strategy in the Balkans are increased prosperity and a close alignment to European Standards and Laws. Establishing peace, stability and sustainable growth throughout the region is essential to achieve these objectives.</p>
<p>A deeper and more consistent implementation of domestic reform programs, stronger governance and institutions, better developed and integrated infrastructure are all needed to provide a solid foundation for sustainable growth and poverty reduction.</p>
<p>The Commission is committed to enhancing the law enforcement capacity in the Western Balkan states, both by supporting regional cooperation and by strengthening national policing and judicial bodies. The Commission is focusing on organised crime and its associated smuggling.</p>
<p>The objectives through the Commission's assistance program are to promote in the countries strong criminal legislation, effective investigative and border control bodies as well as powerful prosecution and judicial processes. This will be achieved by technical and legal assistance and training, by the development of modern information systems, investigative techniques and the acquisition of surveillance equipment.</p>
<p>In addition, other strategies and actions in the area of Justice and Home Affairs, and Employment and Social Affairs, are coordinated within the overall European approach to these problems.</p>
<p>This effort will help in the fight against crime, especially against the highly visible smuggling of human beings, including women and children as sexual objects, and also against drugs.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0182"></a>

<p>Increased operating costs, especially fuel costs, are resulting in problems for the European fisheries sector. Accordingly, some Member States of the EU are intervening in order to reduce fuel costs for shipowners. Such divergent national and/or regional support measures result in a distortion of competition. A coordinated European approach is therefore required.</p>
<p>Will the Commission ensure that a coordinated European approach is adopted to the increased operating costs in the fisheries sector, given that the divergent support measures taken by national and/or regional authorities result in a distortion of competition?

<p>The Commission is aware that the dramatic rise in fuel prices during 2000 has had a significant impact on the operating costs of fishing businesses and that a large number of those businesses, because of the rise in these operating costs, have not been able to cover all or part of their fixed costs. In view of this situation, and bearing in mind that fuel already enjoys heavy tax reductions in all Member States, several Member States have informed the Commission of their intention to compensate for the rises in the price of fuel by means of specific reductions or exemptions from certain operating costs, in particular from certain social security contributions. These Member States considered that this was an exceptional situation, which threatened the survival of fishing activity.</p>
<p>The Commission, while acknowledging the abrupt and sudden nature of the price rises in fuel and their harmful effect on the financial situation of fishing businesses, considers that this is not an exceptional situation. In fact, this is a fuel price level which, in real terms, has already been reached and even exceeded and which may be repeated in the future. Furthermore, the Commission believes that the impact has been all the more harshly felt since fishing is suffering from a significant excess of capacity and serious overcapitalisation. The combined effects of these factors are an increase in operating costs linked to the absence of real economies of scale, a decrease in income and, for the more modern vessels, excessive costs for finance and depreciation.</p>
<p>With regard to the national aid that has already been discussed and since this is operating aid, the Commission, having concluded in its preliminary enquiry that this does not seem compatible with the Treaty, has decided to open an enquiry in this respect. Furthermore, the Commission notes that this aid does not come within an overall restructuring plan aimed at re-establishing reasonable conditions for the viability of the sector in question.</p>
<p>It is therefore not the Commission’s intention, as the honourable Member suggests, to advocate a Community approach allowing the adoption, without any countermeasures, of specific supplementary measures to reduce fuel costs, because that would contravene the rules of the Treaty.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0185"></a>

<p>Nevertheless, in the light of market developments, and in the context of the preliminary draft budget for 2002, the Commission reserves the right to review the situation and to assess whether it would be appropriate to adopt any legislative initiatives in order to cover the potential budgetary risk incurred from the financial year 2002 onwards. Such initiatives could prove necessary in order to bring solidarity into play, something that must not always be seen as a theoretical concept.</p>

Whatever scepticism or enthusiasm one may have about this approach - and for what it’s worth I remain to be wholly convinced - it is symptomatic of a belief that the world can be kept at bay. Interestingly, this belief has increased US reliance on tools (military threats and action) which, in Europe, are a Member State responsibility.

</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>On 5-7 February 2000, extremely serious incidents occurred in El Ejido in Andalusia. Both large numbers of eye witnesses and the media stated that the riots were racist and xenophobic in nature, and the European Parliament adopted a resolution severely censuring what had taken place. What does the Commission intend to do in view of the fact that there have been no prosecutions or sentences in connection with the events at El Ejido a year ago, although almost 700 complaints have been lodged?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>1. The Commission shares the honourable Members' concerns about the serious incidents that occurred in El Ejido last year, and firmly condemns any form of expression of racist or xenophobic views which may constitute a violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms which are common to all the Member States.</p>
<p>2. The Commission welcomes the agreement reached in El Ejido by the Spanish authorities, the employers, unions and immigrant associations concerning the improvements of the living and working conditions of immigrants in the area.</p>
<p>3. This serious incident illustrates very well the problems which arise from uncontrolled migration into the Community. This is one of the reasons why the Commission adopted, on 22 November 2000, a Communication on a Community Immigration Policy<a href="#defann_75_1" name="refann_75_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which is designed to stimulate a wide-ranging debate in the Member States on a new approach to immigration, This Communication was presented at the same time as a separate Communication setting out the different policy options for the establishment of a common asylum policy<a href="#defann_75_2" name="refann_75_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>4. The Communication on immigration sets out progress already made with the implementation of the different elements of an asylum and immigration policy for the Union already agreed at Tampere and puts forward a new approach to labour migration, taking into account the changed demographic and economic context of the Union and of the countries of origin. It proposes that the current 'zero immigration' policies of the last 20-30 years be abandoned and that a controlled migration policy, which both reflects labour market needs and new patterns and pressures of immigration flows on the Union, should be developed.</p>
<p>5. The Communication emphasises that such a policy must include equal treatment of migrants admitted, especially with respect to living and working conditions, and consequently also further efforts to combat illegal work.</p>
<p>6. As regards the integration of immigrant communities, the Council has adopted, on a Commission proposal, a directive<a href="#defann_75_3" name="refann_75_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> aimed at prohibiting, in all Member States, discrimination on the basis of race or ethnic origin in a number of areas such as employment, education, social security, health care, and access to goods and services, including accommodation. Member States have until 19 July 2003 to adopt the national measures necessary to bring themselves into line with that directive.</p>
<p>7. As regards criminal legislation in this area, the Commission intends to refer to the Council, in the course of the year 2001, a legislative proposal on common definitions, charges and penalties for offences related to racism and xenophobia. Once that proposal has been adopted by the Council, it will be the responsibility of the Member States to adopt the necessary measures to bring themselves into line with the provisions of that instrument. In this connection, the Commission is concerned to point out that it has no authority over the administration of justice in the Member States and that any decision to bring criminal proceedings is a matter for the judicial authorities in those states.</p>
<p>8. The Commission wishes to reiterate its commitment to combating racist and xenophobic phenomena by all the means laid down in the Treaties. These activities were reinforced by the activities of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, set up in June 1997 in Vienna. The Observatory is an independent body that can draw up conclusions and opinions for forwarding to the Community and its Member States, and publishes an annual report on the situation of racism and xenophobia in the 15 Member States. Implementation of those actions can be expected to help to secure respect for and protection of human dignity, which is, of course, one of the basic principles of the European Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights<a href="#defann_75_4" name="refann_75_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, to which one of the honourable Members refers.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In line with the principle of subsidiarity, it is for local, regional and national authorities to decide on the pattern of public transport services they believe their area needs; to decide in what ways these services need to be integrated with each other; to decide on the division of roles and responsibilities between authorities and public transport operators; and to select the operator or operators that will fulfil their public service requirements.</p>
<p>The Community has neither the capacity nor the competence to take over these tasks.</p>
<p>However these tasks, like other actions in the field of services of general interest, need to be carried out in a way that takes into account the requirements of the rules of the Treaty, notably those relating to state aids and to the award of exclusive rights.</p>
<p>In general, these rules come into force only where a particular measure has a potential impact on trade between Member States.</p>
<p>In the past, public transport in the different Member States was organised on purely national or even local lines. Operators were active only within a single Member State; there were no international operators of local and regional public transport.</p>
<p>During the last decade, this situation has completely changed. The majority of Member States, including Denmark, have chosen to open at least part of their public transport sector to competition. International as well as national operators have taken advantage of this opportunity to enter new markets – again, Denmark is an example.</p>
<p>As a result, the organisation of public transport is no longer a matter that has purely local effects. In this emerging single market, abuses of Treaty rules on state aids or the award of exclusive rights can now have a direct effect on trade between Member States.</p>
<p>This is already the case as Community law stands today. However, the full implications of these Treaty rules in the public transport sector are not clear, and authorities and operators are experiencing legal uncertainty. The Commission has therefore made a proposal for a regulation on public service requirements in public transport. The aim of this proposal is to remove this legal uncertainty. Moreover, the proposal aims to ensure, through a system of controlled competition, that public authorities in the Member States have explicit powers to deliver quality and integration in public transport and to protect existing employees in the sector.</p>
<p>The evidence shows that competition, properly regulated, is an effective way to promote these objectives. It is certainly true that public companies often offer services of a high quality, and the Commission’s objective is not to promote privatisation. However it is appropriate for these companies, like any others, to show from time to time that they are still the best for the job of delivering services in their area. Such a demonstration is in the interest of passengers and of the Community at large.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0204"></a>

<p>Food safety plays an important role in the preparation for enlargement. Emphasis is put on the existing acquis and on early implementation. It is essential that the candidate countries adapt their legislation as early as possible to Community rules in order to ensure the highest possible consumer protection within an enlarged future Community. Consequently implementation of food safety legislation is a key pre-requisite for a successful completion of the enlargement negotiations.</p>
<p>The Commission has continuously stressed that administrative structures as well as the operators should implement Community rules as early as possible and take advantage of the technical aid offered during the pre-accession period. To this end all candidate countries receive yearly, a summary of all new legislation added to the existing acquis. Furthermore the Commission organises regular screening exercises to highlight or explain further the new rules in detail.</p>
<p>The proposals of the White Paper have been presented on various occasions. However, it would be premature for the candidate countries to take full account of such proposals, prior to their adoption. As and when, the measures set out in the White Paper become law, they will be presented in the screening process mentioned above. However and in addition to the early implementation it is crucial that the candidate countries adopt already today to the “farm to table approach”, which is the central theme of the White Paper on Food Safety. This point is particularly important as the relevant food safety legislation falls under two very different chapters for which the negotiations are conducted separately: chapter 1 (free movement of goods) which covers the general food safety rules and chapter 7 (agriculture) which covers more particularly the rules on food of animal origin.</p>
<p>The Commission has invited all candidate countries to present a "food safety strategy " setting out their existing or future measures intended to enable them to adapt to the Community food safety system. It has emphasised that it is imperative for the candidate countries’ to provide a coherent timetable for transposition, implementation and enforcement of the acquis communautaire, and that it is essential to demonstrate how they intend to ensure a coherent approach throughout the food chain, whatever chapter is concerned.</p>
<p>Of course the “food safety strategy”, which they should transmit in April, is aiming at a “moving target” as the Community acquis is under constant development. The discussions that will follow the transmission of their “food safety strategy” will address new elements as the Community acquis is adapted over time.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0206"></a>

<p>For some months, the market prices for olive oil have been falling quite sharply. This drop is caused by two factors: a cyclical production surplus due to a substantial harvest, and the arrival on the market, in addition to the good harvest, of oil from recently established olive groves which are gradually reaching maturity.</p>
<p>This production surplus, which is likely almost to become structural, cannot be resolved through simple storage measures. Sooner or later, the stock would have to be placed on the market, and this would exacerbate the problem.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in order to provide temporary relief for the market, the Commission has authorised producers in the regions worst affected by falling prices to make use of private storage, with the result that 100 000 tonnes can currently be stored privately in Spain and Greece.</p>
<p>The Commission does not feel that the right solution to the difficulties lies in supporting supply but in encouraging demand, by means, in particular, of a quality strategy. This is what it outlined in its December 2000 report on the matter.</p>

<p>The Commission provided the third largest contribution to UNHCR in 2000. It is true that there has been a decrease in Community funding to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in recent years from the peaks of mid-1990s., This has not been the result of any policy decision by the Commission.</p>
<p>It rather corresponds to a gradual decrease in UNHCR’s caseload, the changing nature of crises in the late 1990s (generating more internationally displaced persons (IDPs) and less refugees), as well as the number and quality of projects submitted for Community funding.</p>
<p>The overall contribution of the Community to UNHCR has remained around 40% of major donors throughout the 1990s. In 2000, the Community contribution to UNHCR was EUR 66 million. It ended up ranking third highest after the United States and Japan. At any rate, the Commission acknowledges the inadequacy of the current, financially ‘unpredictable’ working relationship with UNHCR and is actively addressing that unsatisfactory situation, aiming at providing appropriate support through a better-structured dialogue in exchange for up-to-standard performance. A change of the Financial Regulation – as proposed by the Commission – that will allow a programme based funding will contribute to this.</p>

<p>The Commission has, since 1993, monitored the evolution of car price differentials in the Community. In its recent evaluation report on the application of this Regulation, the Commission dedicates a section to this issue. A study by independent experts for the purpose of this report analyses certain factors influencing car price differentials in more detail. It comes to the conclusion that a part of such differentials is due to fiscal measures and exchange rate fluctuations, while the remaining portion cannot be explained. The question of car price differentials will be an element to be taken into account in the Commission's considerations on the future regime for motor vehicle distribution. Price differentials as such may not constitute a violation of competition rules and the Commission has no power to oblige car manufacturers to apply certain prices. It can, however, secure that consumers' right to purchase a new car in the Member State of their choice, as provided in the above Regulation is not hindered, and will prosecute any violation of this right.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0236"></a>

<p>According to Greek press reports, the Greek Government has decided, without any prior agreement with the Opposition party, Nea Dimokratia, to celebrate 20 years of Greek membership of the European Union on 31 March, even though it has been known for a long time that this clashes with the N.D. party conference, which means that the N.D. will be unable to take part in the celebrations.</p>
<p>Both the Commission and the Greek Government were notified by letter some time ago that the choice of this date took place without any prior agreement and that some other date on either side of this date should have been chosen for these celebrations to enable the Opposition party to take part. In view of this, what measures has the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, taken to avert this unfortunate scenario which would be detrimental to the unity of the European Union? Is it tolerable that the celebrations should go ahead without the participation of all the political parties and particularly the party which played a leading part in securing Greek accession to the European Union and now represents 43% of the Greek people?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>A quarry for building materials situated at the edge of the urban area (at a distance of 300 metres) of one of the largest and most historic municipalities in Greece, that of Ioannina, has recently resumed operations. Apart from the fact that the quarry has turned the commune of Marmara (one of the oldest in the region which is mentioned in the Golden Bull of the Byzantine Emperor Andronikos II Palaeologos of 1318) into a wasteland, it is also destroying and levelling the hill on which the monastery of Aghia Paraskevi, dating from 1778, is situated. Even more serious is the fact that the quarry is situated in an area earmarked for reafforestation. Local inhabitants have to live with the daily nightmare of very powerful explosions which cause seismic shocks which could make their houses collapse, and their health is threatened by clouds of dust from the explosions which settles on the area, the woodlands and the pastures every day.</p>

<p>In Belgium, the social partners in certain sectors have agreed to pay a proportion of the total payroll into funds which finance training measures. The resources involved are not State funds, but the State has declared them compulsory by Royal Decree. The resources are therefore used to cofinance measures which also receive support from the ESF. Does Recital 6 of Commission Regulation (EC) 68/2001<a href="#defann_88_1" name="refann_88_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> mean that, henceforth, the Commission will regard such contributions as State aid? If that were to be the case, does the Commission realise that the sectoral social partners involved will be inclined to use such resources solely for their own company training schemes or for purposes other than training and not for training schemes which involve more than one company or are not directly applicable?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="middle"><img src="/doceo/data/img/hr.gif" width="100%" height="1" alt="" /></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>As sectoral training funds in Belgium (as well as in some other Member States) are made compulsory by way of national legislation they must legally be regarded as State resources within the meaning of Article 87 (1) EC Treaty and constitute State aid if the other conditions of this Article are met. As a consequence they are in principle notifiable to the Commission for advance approval pursuant to Article 88 (3) EC Treaty.</p>
<p>In respect to training aid, two important exceptions to the notification obligation should be pointed out:</p>
<p>Aid which complies with the 'de minimis' rule (when the amount of aid involved does not exceed the ceiling of EUR 100,000 over a three-year period) is not notifiable.</p>
<p>Aid which falls within the applicable levels specified in the Exemption Regulation on Training Aid (Regulation 68/2001) is no longer notifiable provided all relevant conditions are complied with. This should significantly reduce the incidence of notifications required relating to Belgian sectoral training funds: only all individual projects which involve expenditure in excess of EUR 1 million has to be notified to the Commission.</p>
<p>In the Commission’s view, training usually has positive external effects for society as a whole since it increases the pool of skilled workers from which other firms may draw, improves the competitiveness of Community industry and plays an important role in the employment strategy. In view of the fact that enterprises in the Community generally under-invest in the training of their workers, State aid might help to correct this market imperfection and therefore can be considered (under certain conditions) to be compatible with the common market and therefore exempted from prior notification.</p>
<p>The Commission is therefore of the opinion that Regulation 68/2001 is an important step forward since it considerably simplifies the procedural obligations of Member States who want to grant training aid. Regarding the use of sectoral training funds, the Regulation has clarified the existing situation and thereby provided a transparent framework for sectoral training funds.</p>
<p>In recently approved Objective 3 Single Programming Documents in Belgium, it is clearly stated that sectoral training funds (which fall within the applicable levels specified in the Exemption Regulation on Training Aid - Regulation 68/2001) continue to be used as cofinancing for ESF projects.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
