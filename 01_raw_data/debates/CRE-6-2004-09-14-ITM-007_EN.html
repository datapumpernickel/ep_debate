<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Daul (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, as Chairman of the Conference of Presidents, I would like to start by expressing sincere thanks to Mrs de Palacio for her excellent cooperation and for her constant availability throughout her term of office. Over the past few years, we have covered a lot of mileage together, and have made a success of it. Let us recall that, at the beginning of the last Parliament, there was no structured dialogue between our two institutions as regards the preparation of the Commission’s legislative and working programme. Today, and to a large degree thanks to your efforts, we have a real dialogue between the institutions, which has made it possible for the Commission’s legislative programme, from now on, to better reflect Parliament’s priorities, so the results of this ongoing dialogue are thoroughly encouraging. I would like, however, against the background of our experiences over the last few years – and this is what I understand by stocktaking <span class="italic">–</span> to offer some lines of thought on the main areas of concern for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost, it strikes me that interinstitutional dialogue should focus even more on the main legislative priorities, some current examples of which you have already mentioned, such as future Financial Perspectives or the proposals for REACH. We must aim to identify, as early as possible, the most urgent proposals, in order to be able to better organise our work when the time comes. The package of proposals on future Financial Perspectives is an excellent example. This week, this House will be taking the decision to set up a temporary committee within which work on these proposals will be coordinated.</p>
<p class="contents">Defining priorities also involves identifying what is no longer relevant to present-day concerns. With this in mind, I welcome the Commission’s recent decision to withdraw a whole series of proposals. Having said that, despite this cleaning-up operation, a number of proposals remain on the table with little hope of being brought to fruition. Let me take this opportunity to ask my fellow Members to closely scrutinise the list of work in progress and then ask the new Commission to withdraw or replace any supplementary dossier that is no longer relevant.</p>
<p class="contents">The second major area that concerns me has to do with improving the way in which the legislative programme relates to what is provided in the Budget, and this is where it strikes me as opportune that we should think about better coordination within this House between the debates on the Budget and those on policy priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">To talk in practical terms, one might in future organise a large-scale budget debate in the presence of the whole Commission, thereby making the debate as specific as possible and making it possible to set out the actual directions in which the legislative programme should go. Such a debate should be held at a point when the legislative programme has reached an advanced stage, and the November part-session strikes me – for the present – as the ideal time for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Such considerations prompt me to make a third, and essential, point concerning the schedule for presenting the legislative programme. I see it as imperative that everything possible be done to ensure that this should be available, in good time, to all the actors involved, including the national parliaments, European consultative bodies, and, ultimately, the public themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is essential that we build up still further coordination between our work and that of the Council. We have the tools we need to do this, by which I mean the Council’s multinational programme and the annual programme as prepared by two successive presidencies. Recently, too, I would also add, we have concluded an interinstitutional agreement laying the foundations for ‘better law-making’ in the European Union. At present, our role is to implement these new instruments for the benefit of the public, and I wonder whether this might not be the right time for our institution to take a look at whether those priorities that take the form of a legislative programme have a future.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, we have made enormous progress over the past few years in identifying shared priorities and in planning our legislative work together. There are three things that I see as being important if we are to gain our fellow-citizens’ confidence in our shared project. In future, we will need to communicate the major priorities and issues of our legislative activity. We will have to strengthen participatory democracy, and for that to happen it will be essential that all the interested parties be allowed as much time as they want to identify the priorities for the year ahead. Last of all, we will have to demonstrate the efficiency of our institutions, both in terms of their internal functioning and of their relations with one another.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust that these thoughts will help us to achieve our goals.</p>

I want to discuss just a few points in it. The first is certainly the preparation for the next stages of enlargement and of the Neighbourhood Policy, for it is not perhaps apparent to everyone that enlargement is not over, and you rightly referred to the historic significance of the enlargement project. We have heard from Commissioner Verheugen that, even if discussions with them, and ratification, are completed, there are grave concerns as to whether Romania and Bulgaria will develop in the way they should over the two years remaining before their accession. This means that we need to monitor very closely the actual processes involved and the actual implementation. That would, of course, be particularly true in the case of Turkey, and also of Croatia, if we want to make rapid progress with Croatia, which – or so I believe – is what not only the Commission, but also the Council and this Parliament definitely want to do. It will then also be necessary to monitor what goes on with appropriate care, although the same can also be said of the Neighbourhood Policy as a whole. I am thinking, for example, of the Balkans, where we may well have established peace, but it is very precarious, and where we still have much to do to secure it, along with economic and social development.</p>
<p class="contents">You drew our attention to security policy, and I see it as, in principle, the right approach, that the Commission is already – as I hope the incoming Commission will do even more intensively and to a wider extent – joining with our neighbours in attempting to shape immigration and security policy and to avoid in future the unwelcome developments that we have seen over recent weeks, months, and indeed years, in particular in the Mediterranean, where many have tried to reach Europe, only to die in the attempt.</p>
<p class="contents">The aspects mentioned so far, however, also need financial support. I do not believe that enlargement and the Neighbourhood Policy are exclusively financial in character, but without appropriate financial measures we will not get anywhere with them.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point, one that Mr Schulz has already mentioned, is the issue of competition, the social Europe and sustainable development. As I see it, the social Europe and sustainable development need even more support, without detracting from the importance of competition, but, Madam Vice-President, I am sure you are familiar with the report produced mainly on behalf of Commissioners Almunia and Bolkestein, on the evaluation of the performance of network industries providing services of general interest<span class="italic">.</span> It is a very interesting report; it shows that our competition policy is achieving very real successes in some areas for the benefit of consumers, for that is what lower prices and better supply are all about. This report, though – it comes from within the Commission and is very competition-oriented – shows that a number of problems remain to be resolved, for example in transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me take two examples from an area that just happens to be of great interest to you, that of transport; you may well have worked on them yourself. Many consumers think that, in connection with transport and, in particular, local passenger transport, a number of problems are arising, or remaining unresolved, that cannot be solved through competition alone; they believe that they also call for investment. Today, Madam Vice-President, you yourself referred to the trans-European networks, where we took a common approach; I am also grateful for the Commission’s cooperation. On the other hand, there is also a need for more funding to enable these investments to be made, and consumers have – as this report shows – very long wish-lists in the field of energy, with aspirations towards alternative or renewable energies, which are proving very difficult to promote in some countries. Some countries have done more than was envisaged in the objectives, but others have done too little. Here, too, there is a need for more investment if this sustainable development is to be promoted.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just say something about Budget policy, with which I believe we will be very occupied over the coming months. What matters is not that we stipulate in an abstract way that we need 1% or 1.14% of the national product; rather, we need to ask where the deficits are, by which I mean deficits in the sense of investments that need to be increased. It will be necessary to invest more in the trans-European networks, to which you referred, and, of course, also in education and training. This was something I discussed with the Dutch Presidency in the relevant committee. Despite the Lisbon process, budgeting problems mean ever more cutbacks in training and continuing education at universities, but Europe will get no nearer to the goals of the Lisbon process if we fail to invest more in education and training and if we cannot reverse the brain drain, which continues to flow towards the USA. We must bring the best brains back to Europe or find a way of keeping them here; that is the investment I see as being particularly important in our own countries, but also, of course, in the countries adjoining us, so that we might invest more in education and training in those of the countries adjoining us that are drawing closer to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make a final point on information activities, in which – as the elections showed – we still need to invest more. While I welcome the new Commissioner’s plans for this area, which will have a Commissioner to handle it, there is a need for improvement in the financial and staff resources for the Commission’s and Parliament’s Representations in the various countries, for information activities have to be highly decentralised. They will have to be handled differently in the UK to how they are handled in Austria, and the way they are carried out in France will have to be different from the way they are carried out in Poland, because the problems they address are local ones. I hope that there will be stronger support for them.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude, Madam Vice-President, with something I have said before. We have clashed on various occasions, and we have had quite a few arguments, some of them more serious, but I would like, both for myself personally and for my group, to thank you most warmly for your work. I think it has always ended up bearing good fruit, and whether these be Spanish oranges or something else is irrelevant; what matters is success. Thank you for your cooperation.</p>

The Parliament and certainly the ALDE Group can only agree, but let us look at whether the rhetoric is being translated into reality in the relevant policy areas, in terms of both proposed budgetary resources and democratic accountability to our citizens. Some of my comments are directed at the Council and I am very sorry to see that they are not in their place.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking first the area of asylum and immigration and external borders, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs – when adopting the report of our Rapporteur, Mr Deprez, last night – insisted that the funding for the programme on return management in the area of migration proposed by the Commission be put into the reserve until, firstly, the Council move to codecision, which is required by the treaties but which they have done nothing about, and secondly, there is a proper legislative act. We fully support this programme, but are disappointed that we are being asked to approve something which is lacking in legislative and democratic certainty.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware that there is good work going on in the area of integration and reception of asylum seekers, but we think there should be more money in areas like the European Refugee Fund. The European Agency for the Management of the External Borders still does not have a permanent seat. There has been a lot of talk about external borders, but the Council cannot even decide on where the seat should be.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of crime and terrorism, next year only a modest increase is proposed by the Commission in the budget for Eurojust, which is a key player in the fight against serious crime. The Committee on Civil Liberties wants to increase the funding by two-thirds if we are going to be serious about cross-border efforts to tackle crime.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the area dealing with reinforcing respect for human rights and the rule of law, let me give you one example: the Commission is proposing to cut the funding for the research and evaluation programme on respect for fundamental rights, which includes funding for the network of experts on fundamental rights. These examples perhaps show the gap between rhetoric and reality. We need to put our money where our mouth is to be credible and not create disillusionment among the citizens of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, President Barroso’s Commission has not even made a start and there are already evident signs of disharmony in its ranks. Various Commissioners have put all their differences of opinion on display in the media. Accordingly, the new Italian Commissioner for Justice was immediately met with disapproving comments when he mooted, with regard to asylum policy, the idea that the time had come to take the bull by the horns and set up reception camps for refugees on the Union’s external borders. Anyone who is aware of the harrowing asylum issues in Italy, with the constant stream of boat refugees on the island of Lampedusa, realises that the Commissioner did not float these proposals light-heartedly.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the new Belgian Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, Louis Michel, who already has some experience when it comes to insulting the Italians, considered it necessary to dissociate himself from his colleague straightaway. In fact, it is this self-same Louis Michel who openly declared in the Belgian media that he intends to continue to combine his job as European Commissioner with active political membership of his own party in Belgium, where he claims he would like to return to active campaigning as an ordinary member. In this, he does not exactly show a great deal of respect for his new office. Turkey’s accession seems to be another contentious issue. Depending on the political sensitivities of the Member States from which they come, some Commissioners are in favour, and others against. There is no hope of unanimity in this area either. However, with regard to this tricky issue, I should like to urge the new Commission at this point in time to take into consideration the reluctance on the part of the majority of the European population to allow an Islamic and non-European country to join the European Union. If not, this Commission is at risk of losing its democratic legitimacy before it has properly started. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have valued her energy, her willingness, and the courage with which she expressed certain views and took up positions. Mrs de Palacio, you have been an example to us and we will miss you.</p>
<p class="contents">I also, quite simply, want to express my regret at the absence of any connection between the timetable of the European elections on the one hand and, on the other, the appointment of the new Commission and its taking up of office. Certain delays are particularly regrettable and hold up the work of lawmaking. It strikes us that 2004 is turning out to be something of a lost year.</p>
<p class="contents">There have of course been positive results, some of them very positive indeed. There have been positive results as regards the euro; it is a strong and stable currency, but it does not address the public concern about possible company relocations, and so we see this as a very high priority. There have been positive results, too, in relation to enlargement: the Commission has made a success of enlargement, but it has not been able to conduct a debate on Europe’s future borders, so it is that sort of debate for which we are still waiting, along with the debate on Turkey, which will, without doubt, be beset with perils for all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">As for our work on the legislative front, it has made it possible to deal with certain issues relating to safety, specifically at sea – something for which I will take this opportunity to thank the Commissioner – to food safety and to the fight against terrorism, but there are many still to be resolved as regards migration flows.</p>
<p class="contents">There is much else that we should be doing. Admittedly, there has been an increase in the research budget, but it is important that we should follow that up in view of our serious concerns about the brain drain. While on that subject, let me stress the need to give much more thought to our young people, about whom too little is said in this Chamber. We must discuss their mobility, their education, not to mention equivalence for diplomas, an area in which the situation is not changing quickly enough, where there are still too many difficulties and where there is a need for us to exert pressure on the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">All this depends on financial perspectives, the debate on which must not be solely budgetary in character. There has to be a real policy debate on our aspirations, on what we want for this Europe of ours, and we must be able to equip the Europe we envisage for the years ahead with the funding it needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by congratulating each and every Commissioner. We did indeed value their competence and their efforts as individuals, whilst regretting this Commission’s lack of sufficient vision in certain areas, as well as the lack of punch and effectiveness of its President, Mr Prodi, and his inability to make something of his role. Is that, though, what he wanted? I will end, Mr President, by saying that, for a year, we have found President Prodi’s ongoing absence regrettable. It testifies to his lack of interest in our institution, and I hope that the next President of the Commission will have a different attitude towards us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Most people have little trust in the EU and that often arises because we do not show the right kind of qualities to the people in terms of our deregulatory attitude. We do not have sufficient fiscal discipline in our countries. We do not look at taxes which encourage people rather than discourage them, and although the currency has been debated elsewhere this week, the issue of discipline within currencies is of critical importance in a very competitive world.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the UK are not members of the single currency. I see no reason for us to be members but we still have an interest in the success of the single currency in Europe. We also need to be concerned in our own country with sterling, and indeed with all the other major currencies of the world. We cannot simply sit back and allow these matters to develop in a random way. To set a good example to new Member States aspiring to join the single currency, it is important that the Member States which are already members of the single currency demonstrate the necessary disciplines and controls.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish the currency well, but it is essential that we remember that we are now dealing with a world that is full of other countries with developing economies, in Asia and in China, countries that are not going to wait, countries that are very disciplined indeed when it comes to their fiscal arrangements and the currencies in which they operate.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no alternative. A policy of that kind best serves the citizens of all the countries of Europe who look to their governments to provide them with continued good quality of life. My message is that fiscal responsibility is the key component in meeting those needs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can certainly subscribe to everything she has said here, especially with regard to priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">2005 will also be an important year, and we need to find a way to give our citizens confidence in this area of decision-making. This confidence will be brought about by focusing on priorities, on important issues, and as a consequence of this, results too will be achieved. The top priority is security, a subject that has been raised here during our discussions on solutions and decision-making with regard to the border guard force and the fight against terrorism. We must also, however, focus on local security: the security of every person’s immediate surroundings. That is something our citizens will certainly want to see. All these matters, of course, are interconnected. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, sustainable development is an important issue. We have to solve the problem of how to preserve the viability of industry and at the same time take environmental protection into account. In the future, conjoining the two will be very important in maintaining competition and conserving the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon Agenda is an important issue, but it requires concrete action. We need results in employment policy in terms of competitiveness, but the main factors in this regard are economic policy and budgetary discipline, on which subject we have heard an excellent speech just now. We must set an example here to national parliaments and national governments in maintaining budgetary discipline. We each have our own priorities and would like to see increases in the budget, but this way the budget will grow ever larger, and economic policy will slip through our fingers. Discipline must be preserved, and that will come about as a result of these same priorities. We are bound by a policy where certain matters are dealt with and others take second place, as we only have a limited number of resources at our disposal. </p>
<p class="contents">A healthy and sustainable economy: I was pleased to hear this point being made. In my opinion, however, if we are to have a healthy and sustainable economy in Europe, the Stability and Growth Pact must be kept as it is. It should not be toned down, nor should it be downgraded; instead, it should at least be kept as it is, and we need to ensure that it is complied with in each country in the same way. This is what will inspire confidence, not the idea that, little by little, we are beginning to downgrade the agreements we made together earlier on.</p>
<p class="contents">Next year will be an important year, as it is the first complete year of the functioning of a whole new Parliament and an enlarged Europe. It is with these priorities that we can show our citizens that things are progressing well, and that is a prerequisite for us to be able to continue our work.</p>

That is true both of longer–term ambitions – the financial perspectives to which the Commissioner made reference are a case in point – and of the short-term, namely for the coming year. It is good that a schedule is being drawn up and even better that Parliament is closely involved in it. The latter is necessary from a democratic point of view, and because Parliament is a budgetary authority. This can be perfectly fitted in within Community methods, as the Commission has also understood and applied, for which thanks.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the annual policy strategy which the Commission communicated to us in February, and which we discussed in April, has lost none of its topicality. The three priorities should therefore definitely be maintained, and, without denying the importance of the other priorities, I should like to ask you to pay special attention to those concerning competitiveness and cohesion. If we really want to create more jobs and achieve sustainable development and real social cohesion, we must create a mechanism in 2005 which not only ensures that the Lisbon objectives are put into practice, but should be accompanied by real incentives and big sticks in order to actually achieve those objectives within a framework that does not jeopardise stability. Let us hope that the Kok report offers us a sound basis for having a debate in the near future, which we should guide towards the taking of decisions that allow us to make a kind of quantum leap. We must make room for this in 2005. In my view, only in that way can we demonstrably ensure the policy’s continuity, show that we are delivering on our promises and offering people what they can expect from us, and that we can clear the path for the policy priorities that Mr Barroso, the new President of the Commission, has announced and which our group generally supports. Finally, I should like to say a word of thanks to the Vice-President of the Commission and also all those of her colleagues who have always given priority to the maintenance of sound democratic relations with this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I shall begin by mentioning Mr Daul, with whom we have cooperated in his capacity as President of the Conference of Committee Chairmen throughout all this time in order to facilitate cooperation between Parliament and the Commission. I would like to remind you that when this Commission began its work our relations were very difficult. The outgoing Commission had been obliged to resign precisely because of the pressure and debates and confrontation with this Parliament. We needed to put that situation right and create an entirely different basis on which to rebuild a form of cooperation between the two institutions which is essential to building Europe, and it is through these two institutions, in one way or another, that the interests of the European Union are represented.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I would like to thank this Parliament, the honourable Members and also the officials of this House, as well as the officials of the European Commission who have worked on the various documents and agreements, for making it possible amongst all of us to create a framework agreement and then this <span class="italic">modus operandi</span> for structured dialogue between Parliament and the Commission. Furthermore, these two documents, which have now been supplemented with the interinstitutional agreement – which the Council also participates in for the sake of better regulation – have resulted from discussions and negotiations which have not been easy but in connection with which we have all had the greatest possible interest in ensuring that things go well and work properly in order to build Europe more effectively. I would like to express my gratitude for the active participation of all the honourable Members who had direct responsibilities and for the cooperation of everybody who has participated in this work.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Daul has referred to the progress and the fruits of this structured dialogue and has said that it must be improved in the future. I also believe that we can make it work better, but that that will be negotiated with the new Commission and I wish you luck in those talks and improvements.</p>
<p class="contents">He spoke finally about better communication, about more participatory democracy and increasing efficiency. We are all in agreement on this. He has talked about presenting legislative programmes in good time and introducing new concepts which until now have hardly been taken into account, such as the possibilities national Parliaments will have in the future with regard to certain texts. I would like to say that all of this will undoubtedly have to be incorporated, but at the same time there are limits if we do not want to paralyse the machinery entirely.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, coordination with the Council is something which must be improved and something which we are working on, as well as coherence between legislative programmes and budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">Key to seeing if this is true will be the adoption of the future financial perspectives and whether these financial perspectives are genuinely going to reflect the political priorities of the European Union today, outside of specific agreements which exist on certain specific aspects. We will have to wait and see. The honourable Members will be very active here. I will be somewhere else, but naturally I will be following the debates in question extremely closely.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been pointed out that certain issues remain outstanding, naturally, as well as issues that have been mentioned which are even more ambitious. Well, this is possible. Although it is not my job to say so and President Prodi will say it to this House, I believe that the overall achievement of this Commission has been really positive.</p>
<p class="contents">There naturally remains work to be done during next year, and that is just as well because otherwise our successors would be out of work and that is in nobody’s interest. And anyway things can always be improved.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the new enlargement brings great challenges, that we must continue to make progress on the neighbourhood policy and the Balkans Stability Pact, ensuring that they are accompanied by very concrete actions. For example, the creation of the electricity and gas markets throughout the Balkans are very concrete actions relating to the Balkans Stability Pact which can and must be continued by the new Commission and, throughout 2005, must be vigorously promoted.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe there must be a balance between competitiveness, social Europe and the environment, but we must be aware that if we do not have competitiveness, if we do not generate wealth in a globalised world, it will be difficult for us to respond to the requirements of a social Europe or to environmental concerns. That is something we cannot forget. Competitiveness must provide the framework for everything, and without competitiveness, without creating wealth and jobs, we will achieve nothing more than frustration, because we would have promised and agreed things which cannot be realised. They can only be realised on the basis of economic development and job creation which unquestionably require concrete action on aspects such as technological development and research.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issue of suburban transport, public transport, Mr Swoboda has made a number of observations. On the subject of investments, I would like to point out that there are very important aspects relating to public transport which are affected by the Altmark judgment, a key judgment which will have to be taken into account not only in relation to the transport sector but in relation to all public services in the European Union and in relation to the introduction of competition and the possibility of public support in order to guarantee a certain level of service, but in a transparent and competitive way.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mrs Grossetête for her kind words and this brings me straight to an issue I believe to be essential: a series of aspects relating to the problem of competitiveness. Relocation in certain fields is going to take place and it is reasonable that it should take place, because the only opportunity for new countries at global level is offered by certain types of less technological production, which do not present problems in terms of building, or production in outlying areas, which do not have to be close to the consumer. Relocation sometimes takes place, however, because we do not consider our objectives properly, but rather the instruments for achieving them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, moreover, like to make an appeal in relation to the Kyoto Protocol and the Directive on emissions trading. We have approved a Directive and we must comply with it, but I would also like to make an observation which I have made publicly within the Commission. We must not simply state casually whether we are for or against the Kyoto Protocol. No. I am in favour of the Protocol. I support the reduction of greenhouse gases. What is more, I believe it to be one of the most important challenges not just for the European Union but for the whole of humanity. It is a challenge that truly endangers the future of humanity if not dealt with properly. In this regard, in terms of energy efficiency, I support renewable energy, and a true, honourable and courageous discussion of nuclear energy. This is absolutely necessary – and I am naturally saying this on my own behalf, I would like to make that clear – and I believe that the next Commission and this Parliament must confront this issue over the coming years.</p>
<p class="contents">Time is passing and the urgency is clear. This summer and last summer we have begun to see the first manifestations of the increase of less than one degree in the planet’s average temperature. If that is the case, we cannot resort to solutions which sound good but are false. Let me explain what I mean: the system of emissions trading may be a good one if implemented within the framework of a worldwide agreement, which is the only way emissions trading can have real effects. If that system operates within a context in which only the European Union fulfils those responsibilities, in which Kyoto is not ratified by Russia or the United States – the only two countries able to provide the critical mass to allow it to enter into force – we may find that we lose our steel, cement, tile, ceramics and other industries consuming energy, which would not mean pollution would be stopped, because the pollution would be created in third countries whose conditions are much less demanding. Steel, cement and ceramics would still be produced and we would have to import them into Europe, adding the cost and the emissions of the transport involved, while we would theoretically still be complying with that emissions reduction.</p>
<p class="contents">Is reduction in emissions a reality at an overall global level? No, it is not. This must be taken into account because we are endangering some of our industry without ultimately producing any real results in terms of the essential aim, which is to reduce emissions at global level. That cannot be done unless we have the courage to confront the problems of nuclear energy, to confront them, and we must provide the citizens with transparency and information and hence the Commission’s proposals. We must, moreover, understand that Europe must increase its nuclear energy potential and capacities and we must not put forward flippant arguments in relation to it, if we want to maintain growth and a degree of competitiveness and at the same time combat climate change. We must, furthermore, do this at global level.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe alone is not enough. If we make all the efforts I have referred to, we will reduce CO2 emissions by 400 million tonnes a year, more or less. China alone is going to increase its emissions over the next fifteen years by 4 000 million tonnes of CO2. These are the great challenges which need to be confronted urgently over the coming years and I hope that Parliament will do so and, naturally, I am sure that the next Commission will do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of nuclear energy is a personal position, but I believe that if we do not confront this problem we will clearly be failing to fulfil our responsibilities properly. We must act responsibly, because we all know that there are great problems in terms of popularity and public acceptance. And we must therefore provide explanations, information, transparency, security and guarantees.</p>
<p class="contents">The brain drain. It is not just that our best minds are leaving, but that it is to the United States, which is our ally, friend and partner, that not just our brains, but the best brains from the whole world, are going. And Europe is not receiving the best minds from third countries. We have stopped attracting intelligence, innovation and research. That is the key for the future. Europe must face this and it is one of the priorities we have included in the next financial perspectives and we hope this will be understood.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that, with regard to the aspects raised by Mr Kirkhope concerning competitiveness, he has referred essentially to fiscal responsibility and to the coherence of the broad economic policies, and I can only agree with him. I believe that the debate currently taking place in Europe on improving the functioning of the Stability Pact is extremely important and this is the approach we must take. And that means providing certainty and securities, that is to say, we cannot increase discretionality in our assessment of certain types of circumstance. Discretionality must be avoided, so that we do not act in an arbitrary manner. It must be avoided so that there is certainty, clarity and guarantees for the markets.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to security, Mr Itälä has spoken about security, the environment, competitiveness, the Stability Pact; I agree entirely with what he has said, and I also agree with everything Mrs Thyssen said beforehand with regard to the problems of promoting competition and cohesion; I believe that the Kok report is a wonderful basis for work in this direction, and to Mrs Ludford, who talked about rhetoric and reality, I would like to say that I cannot agree with her, although there are times in politics when we all know that the reality is not exactly as we say it is. Those are, however, the concrete realities of budgetary efforts, the JHA is one of the items which, on the proposal of the Commission, is increased most in the draft financial perspectives for 2007-2013 according to the Commission’s proposal. It will be the Council that will adopt the final decisions. This Parliament also has to give its opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the divisions or lack of divisions mentioned by Mr Dillen, I am not going to get into that. Clearly not everybody agrees all the time, but in the end an agreement is reached – and that is democracy – in accordance with the majority opinion, which is the opinion of the institution. Over all these years we in the Commission have not always held the same views, but we have had to reach agreements and we have all supported that position.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, it has been an honour for me to represent the Commission in terms of relations with the European Parliament, to have been elected, and in this respect I would like to thank President Prodi for having put his trust in me and for having proposed me as Vice-President for Relations with the European Parliament. I must say that I did not merely accept it, but rather I asked for it and I was delighted, because I consider myself first and foremost to be a parliamentarian. I have tried to cooperate faithfully with this House throughout these years and I believe I have done so. Furthermore, what I would like to say in particular is that I thank you for the work you have done in codecision, where generally speaking you have made improvements – sometimes we create some pretty extraordinary things in order to reach a consensus – but the overall result is hugely positive, since this Parliament reflects the sensitivities of the citizens of the European Union, complemented by those of the governments of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this interactive dialogue, in which the Commission makes a proposal and then acts as mediator, I believe we have made the proposals approved in recent times more realistic. I believe that the reforms incorporated into the new Constitutional Treaty, which we all hope will be duly ratified as soon as possible, supplement, generalise and extend these parliamentary functions, ensuring simply that the functions of the European Parliament, which already has practically all the functions of any Parliament of the world, are extended to all areas of legislative responsibility. I would like to point out that the task of control has been enormously effective, at times uncomfortable, but has been carried out extremely effectively by the honourable Members and your predecessors in a responsible, intelligent, professional and honest way. I am sure that this new Parliament together with the new Commission will continue this work. Those are the essential elements of the European Parliament, which is one of the three great institutions which allows everybody to participate in this extraordinary and unique project of building Europe.</p>

I should also like to thank you and your staff for the commitment and seriousness – and charm – that you brought to your other work in the Commission. I wish you every possible success in the future.</p>
