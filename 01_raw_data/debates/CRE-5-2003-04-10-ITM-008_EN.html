They were part of a group of 52 homosexuals arrested in Cairo last year. On 16 January of this year Wissam Toufic Abyad was arrested and later sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment for ‘repeated licentious behaviour’.</p>
<p class="contents">These events are no isolated incidents. They are part of a growing and above all alarming trend that is characterised by an increase in reports of discrimination, arrests, mistreatment and wrongful convictions of homosexuals. This trend is all the more disturbing because homosexuality is not illegal in Egypt. At the same time the Euro-Mediterranean Treaty between the European Union and Egypt is on the point of ratification by both parties. Article 2 of this treaty requires respect for human rights and democratic principles. Everything suggests that Egypt is not respecting these principles.</p>
<p class="contents">My group in the Parliament has always argued for the promotion of tolerance in the Mediterranean Sea area. We also recognise the importance of good relations between Egypt and the European Union for the stability and the development of this area. I therefore very much regret that these relations are coming under pressure because of the repeated violations of human rights by the Egyptian authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I am however delighted by the release of human rights activist Saad Eddin Ibrahim, but wish to add immediately that things cannot stop at this individual case. The Egyptian authorities must keep working on greater respect for human rights in their country, the persecution of homosexuals because of their sexual inclination must come to an end and their individual freedoms must be protected.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore make an urgent appeal to the Council and the Commission to develop programmes in the framework of the European initiative for democracy and human rights that are aimed at strengthening democracy in Egypt. I urge our fellow MEPs in the Delegation for relations with the Mashreq countries to broach the human rights issue in Egypt at their next meeting with Egyptian parliamentarians and also to involve representatives of the social midfield in this process. Should these steps prove to be of no avail, Mr President, then I would plead for a postponement of the ratification of the Euro-Mediterranean Treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want clear replies from the governments who are actually indicted in these resolutions before this House this afternoon. If these governments, including the Egyptian Government, do not take human rights seriously then we must take further action, if necessary suspending any agreements that we have with them.</p>
<p class="contents">The appalling onslaught against minorities in Egypt is terrifying to behold. People are being entrapped on the Internet because of their homosexuality. Let me refer to one individual, because this is what human rights are about: the rights of individuals. We in this House standing here, talking, debating, take everything for granted, yet these people, because of their difference, have everything robbed from them. Do we listen? No. Some of us talk on, whilst others call for tolerance.</p>
<p class="contents">A young man, Wissam Abyad, was entrapped on the Internet. He went with a friend to meet a supposed gay man. He was arrested, along with his friend. He is now in prison. He is awaiting appeal. I call for his sentence to be suspended immediately, because that is this man's only way out.</p>
<p class="contents">The cases of two more men out of the 52 who were arrested over a year ago were not reviewed. They are undergoing not forced labour, but hard labour. As to the three British men awaiting trial in Egypt and the allegations of torture that they have made, have their cases been independently investigated? Of course not.</p>
<p class="contents">I say this to Egypt, and I say it as a friend: the litmus test of any civilised society is how it treats its minorities. It is for Egypt to show us here in this House, that it takes the rights of their minorities seriously, to call for an end to discrimination against those minorities and to release from prison and end immediately the investigations and the arrests of gay men throughout Egypt which worry us here in this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like previous speakers, we wish to emphasise respect for human rights, especially freedom of information, expression and association. These are fundamental values included in the association agreement between the EU and Egypt. What is happening in Egypt at present is therefore beyond the pale.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe it is time to stop persecuting people because of their sexual orientation. People must, moreover, be able freely to express their opinions and values in demonstrations. We are also concerned here with the status of religious freedom in a country in which 12% to 15% of the population belongs to the Christian Coptic minority. The common resolution from all our political groups demands that the minority Coptic Christian group be fully respected and represented in Egyptian society. Allow me to quote some examples of the ways in which they are not so respected and represented. Different regulations apply to restoring and constructing churches as distinct from mosques. The regulations governing churches are very complicated and long-winded. Coptic Christians are not represented at all within the police, higher education and the security service. School books still use terms such as ‘unbelievers’ to describe both Jews and Christians.</p>
<p class="contents">Other examples are the murders of two Christians in 1998 in the El-Kosheh community – crimes which the local Christian population does not consider to have been solved equitably.</p>
<p class="contents">Relations with Egypt are fundamental to the Mediterranean region and the EU, but they must be based upon respect for human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Egypt is a densely populated and important country in the Arab world and we want to conclude an association agreement with Egypt. Yet Article 2 of that association agreement expressly includes a clause requiring the observance of human rights and democratic principles. We ought to develop tools that can be used to promote the implementation of this Article in practice. After all, there is an atmosphere of all or nothing prevailing here and that is not of course the right way to promote a good dialogue. Let us not forget that Charles Dickens too was imprisoned for homosexuality in nineteenth-century England. Evolution is possible therefore. But here we clearly have a case of three kinds of human rights violations.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I would like to associate myself with the protest against the human rights violations in respect of homosexuals, because the free consent of adults in their sexual relations with one another cannot be prosecuted in any civilised country and is even permitted by the Egyptians by law. Why should these drastic charges be brought over and over again? Making intimidation attempts with the use of private information by way of telephone, Internet, etc.?</p>
<p class="contents">A second series of violations concerns those in respect of the Coptic church, one of the oldest cultural communities and a minority in Egypt.</p>
<p class="contents">And thirdly I would like to underline that we have all been witness to the serious violations of human rights during the marches for peace in Iraq. We were amazed at the violent way in which the police opposed them. I therefore ask the European Commission to consider carefully how use can be made of that Article 2 on the signing of the association agreement not only to denounce the practices condemned here, but also to bring about their cessation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Relationships may be of whatever kind they deem appropriate. We are therefore distressed that fifteen homosexuals have received three-year prison sentences in Egypt. Another 29 individuals were effectively cleared, however. In addition, under the provisions of the state of emergency, many people have been arrested recently in connection with anti-war demonstrations.</p>
<p class="contents">Kostas Kastanias, the Greek citizen, is still in poor health. I remember the Spanish Presidency called for him at least to be transferred to Greece. There is one piece of good news, however. This is the decision by the Egyptian Appeal Court to annul the judgment on Saad Eddin Ibrahim and exonerate him. We had already referred to this individual in the House. He is a human rights defender.</p>

There are no smiles on the faces of the gay men and boys of Egypt who have been harassed and their homes raided, and who have been entrapped via the Internet on trumped-up charges. There is no smile on the face of Wissam Abyad, in prison and badly treated since January, after just one meeting. There is no smile on the face of Zaki 'Abd al-Malak. There is no smile on the faces of the 21 Egyptians from the infamous 'Queen's Boat' discotheque trial, whose sentences have been increased on appeal to three years' imprisonment and forced labour. There is no smile on the faces of those anti-war demonstrators who were arrested on 20 March in Cairo and reportedly tortured. There is no smile, as we have heard, on the members of Coptic Church in Egypt persecuted for their faith. Egypt has contributed so much to our civilisation, we must urge it now to follow a civilised path on these issues.</p>

Do you think that this time our voice will reach the ears of its rulers? Because so far they have made a point of ignoring us.</p>
<p class="contents">The second trial of 50 men accused of homosexuality on 15 March and the sentencing of 21 of them to even harsher punishment demonstrates in the most dramatic fashion that this country has absolutely no respect for fundamental freedoms, for human rights or for privacy. The prisoners include a Greek citizen, Kostas Kastanias, who has serious health problems. Unfortunately, the Egyptian Government is refusing to move him to Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Egypt has no respect either for international conventions or for agreements with the European Union or even for its own laws, under which homosexuality is not a crime. It makes one wonder who is ruling Egypt? Does the rule of law exist or is the unofficial Islamic fundamentalist government in charge? Who does the European Union ultimately conclude agreements with, Commissioner? Do you have plans to finally do something about these matters? How do you intend to use the force and influence of the European Union to make Egypt respect fundamental freedoms and immediately release these people who have been wrongly imprisoned? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thanks precisely to the intervention of the European Commission, this goal has been achieved. We hope that the same patience and drive will be invested in the resolution of this case too.</p>
<p class="contents">Almost everything has already been said, but perhaps there is something we have overlooked: it is completely unacceptable for the democratic clause laid down in the various agreements with third countries not to be observed to the letter. I would like to make it clear to the House and to the Commission that the increasing use of European taxpayers’ money to serve the interests of dictatorships and finance violations of human rights, at the same time erasing any hope these countries might have of freedom and democracy, is totally unacceptable. This is the acid test: we have to decide whether these debates are destined never to have any effect outside our archives or whether we want, once and for all, to take that leap forwards and make a clear, definitive political decision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The draft resolutions to be discussed today seem largely prompted by the recent reconviction of 21 Egyptian men for ‘debauchery’. It is therefore with this issue that I shall start.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has followed the 'Queen Boat' affair since the arrest in May 2001 of 52 men under laws to control prostitution. We were concerned by the nature of the charges; the use of security courts and national security legislation; the allegations of police harassment and entrapment; and the severe sentences that were meted out. The inflammatory language at the trial and in the media undermine Egyptian claims that the men were not charged for their sexual orientation.</p>
<p class="contents">We were encouraged when President Mubarak subsequently ruled that the case should be retried in a misdemeanour court. But the conduct and outcome of the second trial were unexpected since the 21 men previously sentenced were re-sentenced to the maximum sentence of 3 years. The 21 men have appealed and an appeal verdict is provisionally expected on 4 June.</p>
<p class="contents">Homosexuality remains a sensitive issue for Egyptian society. But that does not mean that the Commission will condone the harassment and prosecution of people for their sexual orientation, or any measures that deprive them of their normal rights. The Commission will continue to monitor this and other similar prosecutions and has frequently communicated its concerns to the Egyptian authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now pass to other issues raised. We welcome the release of democracy activist Saad Ibrahim and share the satisfaction of all true friends of Egypt that this long-running saga is over. Justice in the best Egyptian judicial traditions has now been done, and has been seen to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">We note allegations of excessive force used against Egyptian anti-Iraq war demonstrators, but emotions and tempers at such events run high and the Egyptian Government has a legitimate concern to preserve public order at such a sensitive time. It is a rapidly evolving situation. But public order should not be maintained at the expense of freedom of expression or of peaceful assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has expressed concern for the Egyptian Copts on several occasions and will know that the Commission continues to monitor the judicial aftermath of the events in el Khosheh in 1998 and in 1999/2000.</p>
<p class="contents">Many commentators regret the recent extension of the state of emergency that has been in continuous effect since the early 1980s. The European Union is concerned at its use at times, and for cases that are difficult to justify. But we are encouraged that the ruling NDP party has recently proposed radically to limit the scope of the state of emergency and the system of state security courts associated with it.</p>
<p class="contents">There are several provisions in the Association Agreement for fundamental breaches by either side of essential elements, one of which is respect for democratic principles and human rights as set out in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights (Article 2). More importantly, the Association Agreement provides for constructive political dialogue on human rights and related issues.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion I should like to say to Parliament that Commissioner Patten told the European Parliament at the debate on the EU-Egypt Association Agreement that the Commission shares the European Parliament’s concerns but also notes encouraging developments notably: new social legislation on the rights of women; the supervision of elections by the courts; ruling party proposals for ending the state security court system, and rulings by the courts on the constitutionality of contentious legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission continuously monitors Egypt’s respect for human rights. When the Association Agreement comes into force any human rights issue may be raised, and hopefully resolved, by either side at the appropriate Association Council or committee. The Agreement, ratified here first and ratified on Monday by the Egyptian People’s Assembly, will provide both sides with important safeguards and an additional forum to extend human and democratic rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Individual cases, such as the ‘Queen Boat’ case, are considered on a case-by-case basis and in close collaboration with Member States. The Commission does not hesitate to make its views known to the Egyptian authorities through normal channels or public statements as appropriate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
