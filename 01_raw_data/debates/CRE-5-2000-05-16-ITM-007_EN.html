<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Provan (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, as you say, this is a new procedure and I hope that it helps to establish in Parliament the importance of the conciliation procedure in achieving legislation to which Parliament has aspired. I want to say today how much I enjoyed the support and the great help of the rapporteur and the Chairman of the Employment and Social Affairs Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Smet, our rapporteur, was President of the Council of Ministers when the original Working Time Directive was enacted. Mr Rocard is a former very well-known French minister and indeed Prime Minister. We had an exceedingly strong team which Parliament was able to deploy in the negotiations with the Council and I am extremely grateful to both of them. Parliament should be extremely grateful to both of them – especially the rapporteur for all the work that she put into this negotiation.</p>
<p class="contents">The delegation also had a great responsibility in this negotiation because we had many difficult decisions to take. We did not achieve everything that we wanted to achieve as a Parliament, but I think we went a long way towards helping all those people who are now going to be included within the Working Time Directive to see some progress so that they can eventually get to the goal that we were all trying to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">If we take, for instance, the junior doctors, we discover that Parliament originally wanted a six-year period in which to achieve the 48 hours. That was never likely to be negotiated with the Council, but we were able to make substantial progress from the Council's original proposal of 13 years. Indeed, we finished up with a nine-year period. Only in extreme circumstances will governments be able to go through a procedure to justify an extension of that period of nine years. The interesting thing in this aspect is that we are making real progress on reducing the time of work for junior doctors. As many people will be aware, today, many junior doctors are working 72 hours in some countries. The progress that we are making is that in the first three years, the junior doctors' hours will be reduced to 58 and over the following two years to 56 hours and 52 hours respectively. We see that the junior doctors are, in fact, going to get a great benefit from this extension to the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">We also were able to clarify the position regarding the classification of mobile workers. The case was argued that, for instance, somebody driving a lorry for a large retail store should be included in retail-type legislation for working time, and only genuine transport workers are now going to fall exclusively within the transport sector. That, I think, was another major achievement for Parliament in this negotiation.</p>
<p class="contents">We move on to the fishermen who were greatly concerned by the application of this directive to their working life because they felt they would not be able to operate properly within that system. In all honour to everybody concerned in the negotiation, the Council and all Members of the delegation, they have made real progress and I recommend the outcome of the conciliation process to the House and hope they support it.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank all the delegates, as it would indeed be impossible to find a compromise on a number of difficult and sensitive issues, if it was not for the fact that everyone moderated their demands, and this is what eventually happened. My thanks go to all of you. </p>
<p class="contents">The vote in the European Parliament tomorrow and in the Council the day after will provisionally end a decade of European legislation concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time. I am adding “provisionally”, because although a number of sectors and activities are already covered by conclusive horizontal legislation, the vertical rules are still pending. The best way to establish these vertical rules is via collective labour agreements, but if these collective labour agreements are not forthcoming, then the Commission will need to take the initiative and propose draft directives. This has already happened in the case of road transport. The European Parliament has made its position clear but it appears that the Council is unable to adopt the common position. This is intolerable, really intolerable, because road transport is one of the key sectors, there are many difficulties within that sector and because so many accidents happen within the Member States due to a lack of legislation and control. I would call on the Council and both sides of industry finally to resolve this matter. </p>
<p class="contents">Since no draft directive has been proposed for inland shipping yet, I would ask the Commission to work on that. Fortunately, agreements have now been concluded within aviation, navigation at sea and also rail transport, which have been translated into directives. Like rail transport, the sea-fishing and off-shore sectors, as well as the activities of junior doctors, fall within the scope of the directive which we are discussing today. </p>
<p class="contents">For the sea-fishing sector, the European Parliament managed to secure a maximum working week of 48 hours, over a twelve-month reference period. Exemptions are only possible under a collective labour agreement or following consultation involving both sides of industry. It is indeed necessary to provide for these exemptions, because not only do sea fishermen stay at sea for extended periods of time, in certain countries even 3 000 hours on average annually, they also carry out heavy work at what is by far the most mobile of workplaces. </p>
<p class="contents">Regarding junior doctors, I would refer to what Mr Provan said, because he explained quite clearly what we eventually achieved. The main thing is that those countries that want a transitional period in excess of nine years will need to follow a very demanding procedure in order to achieve this. The reason why they want to have an extended transitional period and the decision which is eventually taken have to be published in the EU’s Official Journal. I hope that this procedure will create a disincentive for those countries because we do not intend to carry on applying the number of working hours prescribed for longer than nine years. </p>
<p class="contents">In 1993, when I, in the capacity of President of the Council, signed the directive concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time, I was aware that the Commission’s proposal of 1990 did not exclude any sectors or activities. But at the time, it appeared impossible for the Council to draw up a directive which covered all employees in all sectors and activities. Hence the Commission proposed to take a separate and additional initiative for the benefit of those sectors and activities which were excluded from the Council’s directive. That culminated in the 1997 White Paper and the 1998 consultation paper and communication. </p>
<p class="contents">The present directive is the first to be born out of negotiations in a Conciliation Committee within the framework of the European social policy, with the European Parliament acting as co-legislator. The power of codecision proved to be decisive. I think we owe our success, the fact that we eventually reached a sound compromise, to Parliament, among other things, which in its wisdom, only tabled a few amendments. Indeed, had we found ourselves in a conciliation procedure faced with 30 or 40 amendments tabled by Parliament, it would have been extremely difficult ever to reach a compromise. </p>
<p class="contents">In this case, we managed to keep the procedure within bounds. As such, the European Parliament gave evidence of a legislative maturity, which the Council and the Intergovernmental Conference, in particular, would do well not to lose sight of. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The idea that politicians in Brussels or Strasbourg should determine how many hours different people work across Europe is, we believe, fundamentally daft. To extend it to groups such as offshore oil workers and sea fishermen is particularly so.</p>
<p class="contents">However, because of the special issue of over-worked junior doctors in the UK, as Conservative MEPs we voted last November to extend the directive to them. We very much hoped that this would pressure national governments – especially our own – to produce a better deal. Certainly Parliament as a whole was of similar mind, hence the Conciliation Committee on which I was privileged to serve. I extend congratulations to you, Mr President, in your former capacity as president of that conciliation group – plus Mrs Smet and Mr Rocard. I believe in the circumstances we could not have done any better, but those three played a major role in that.</p>
<p class="contents">I should briefly like to mention a point made by some of my colleagues from that delegation. I hope other nationals will forgive me if I mention only other British colleagues, for a reason that will become apparent.</p>
<p class="contents">The first speaker in the main meeting was Mr Hughes. I am not known for agreeing with him regularly but I congratulate him on the intensity of what he said which set the meeting off to a very good start. He was followed by Mrs Lynne – also due to speak today – who reinforced what was said with great vigour. I mention that because, when it came to my turn to speak, it enabled me, as a British delegate from a third party, to speak in support, despite the fact that all three parties have many different policies on different issues. The fact that I could say that on this issue we were speaking as one and it was a cross-party alliance hopefully helped to reinforce the overall message and the will of Parliament. One of my colleagues afterwards said that point was a powerful intervention. Certainly it was meant to be.</p>
<p class="contents">Imagine my disappointment after the meeting when an official came up to me and said that while I was making those points on behalf of Parliament another Member also from the UK was busy shaking his head negatively the whole time that I was speaking. That will not have strengthened our case. It may or may not have made any difference but certainly it will not have done the Parliamentary delegation any good service.</p>
<p class="contents">A few weeks later, we did the best that we could. It will be presented – as you, President, have already presented it – as "nine years". But it is, as you know, nine years, plus two years, plus one year. The UK Government will add that up to twelve years as against the 13 years which the UK Government was asking for initially.</p>
<p class="contents">Having only got what we consider minor concessions, we can confirm that, as British Conservatives, we neither support the Working Time Directive nor its extension to any other grouping. We still support a better deal for junior doctors; we will still continue to pressure our own government to provide it, but a directive from the European Parliament is clearly not the right way to secure it.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hughes (PSE).</span></span>   – I would like to begin by echoing previous speakers and adding my words of thanks to the rapporteur and to our chairman and to you for the magnificent work you did in that conciliation. The progress we achieved is in large part thanks to the formidable effort and attention to detail the rapporteur put in to this.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three main issues which I would like to concentrate on in the brief time available to me.</p>
<p class="contents">In the original working time directive we had agreed way back in 1993 that it would be possible to introduce annualisation of working time for categories of workers, but only where collective agreements allowed that to happen. The first two points I would like to make relate to categories of workers where we have managed to achieve that progress in the conciliation. As far as offshore workers and mobile workers in the transport sector are concerned – there was an attempt in the common position to allow annualisation of working time for those workers without collective agreement. Thanks to conciliation, collective agreement will now need to be the route for an extension to annualisation. That was an important point of progress.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns sea-fishing. There we have now built in to the directive the principle that a 48-hour average working week over a period of one year will be the rule. That can be subject to derogation but again only after attempts to broker collective agreements to involve the social partners. That should be the rule wherever there is an attempt to introduce annualisation and that principle has been safeguarded as a result of the conciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">The third area I want to concentrate on – and it is what other speakers have mentioned – relates to junior doctors. Looking at this part of the agreement without detailed knowledge of the negotiations that went into it, it must seem like a very strange animal. A four-year transposition period – five years transition and then the possibility of extra time beyond that. But of course that was to take account of the special difficulties facing one or two Member States. I would repeat what other speakers have said: for us the period in question is nine years. That will be the normal period within which Member States will be expected to comply with the requirements of this directive in relation to junior doctors. That is why the procedure to go beyond that into what we might term extra time is so open – in a way humiliating for any government that attempts to take that step. I think that in fact we will see all Member States complying with that section of the directive relating to junior doctors within that nine-year time frame. I am confident, speaking today, that will be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">A further important point might have been missed. The provisions relating to nine years for junior doctors only relate to the average working week. The other provisions of the directive relating to daily and weekly rest breaks, annual leave and nightwork will, of course, apply to junior doctors after a three-year transposition period just as they do for all other workers. Those parts of the directive can, of course, be subject to derogation but only by collective agreement so those elements will apply to junior doctors. The sections dealing with annual leave cannot be negotiated away and it is important to bear that in mind: i.e. the nine years for junior doctors applies only to working time – average weekly working time – and the other provisions of the directive apply after three years.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point I would like to make relates to the transport dossier. It is very important that we get movement in that area in the Transport Council. Maybe the Commissioner has some news for us today. There was an agreement in the rail sector that the provisions of the working time directive would apply in that sector so long as there was parallel progress in other transport sectors, particularly the road sector. Unless we get progress in that sector, I am quite certain we are going to see a problem for the rail sector. The agreement will not be implemented in the near future at national level.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lynne (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, I would also like to add my thanks to Mrs Smet in particular for doing an excellent job of work on the working time directive and also, of course, to Mr Rocard and to you, yourself. I would agree with Philip Bushill-Matthews as well. I think the strength of having all-party support throughout the UK on our delegation was very, very useful.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to talk specifically about junior doctors. I am very pleased that they are going to be brought in line with the working time directive. There are 270 000 junior doctors across the EU who will be affected by this. 50.1% in my constituency work over 72 hours a week as do 10 000 in the UK as a whole. You can see from those figures that it is extremely important that all Member States actually meet those objectives and I mean the nine-year objective. The present situation is not good for patients or doctors alike – they have our life in their hands. We would not want to be treated by a drunken doctor and I do not believe that we should be treated by an over-tired doctor. Evidence proves that somebody who is impaired by tiredness is impaired in the same way as drunkenness. The British Medical Association was saying that 15% of junior doctors were leaving the profession citing stress, overwork and length of hours. A lot of those were going to Australia and New Zealand where the working practices were better. We have to stop that drain.</p>
<p class="contents">The nine-year timetable, of course, is an improvement on what the Council of Ministers wanted. It is made up of four years' implementation and five years to bring down the working time from 58 to 48 hours. It is far better than what the Council wanted which was the 13-year period. I, of course, would have preferred a shorter time. As I have said before, our life is in their hands and it is important that we get this right.</p>
<p class="contents">The UK Government, of course, was part of the problem. They maintain that they cannot achieve the reduction in this timescale. I believe that they are wrong and that is why we have the extension for two years and also the extension after that for one year. But as everyone else has said, it has to be in exceptional circumstances. There must be rigorous notification and justification procedures and I hope that the British Government, and other Member State governments who feel that they can delay further by seeking two years and then another will feel so embarrassed that they will not seek to do so and meet the goal in nine years. It is not twelve years – it is nine years and we must state that very, very clearly. It is long enough – I would have liked it to have been shorter, but let us hope the governments, and the British Government in particular, adhere to that.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lambert (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I must apologise for this appearing to be a British show at this moment. I assure you that it does change with the next speaker. I also would like to thank Mrs Smet, our rapporteur, for the excellent work that she has done throughout this entire process. With the support that she has received from Mr Rocard and from yourself, she has managed to make progress in face of the tensions between the high expectations of those whose lives will be affected by these decisions, some six million workers, and the difficulties and some intransigence presented by certain Member States. I speak as my group's representative on that parliamentary delegation and I know what I have seen.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a health and safety issue, as has been said, for both the workers concerned and for the public. While I recognise, like others, that junior doctors are not the only group affected, this issue has proved the most difficult. I have been deeply concerned at some of the arguments put forward by certain governments which have said that other aspects of health provision could be threatened if the reduction of working time for this group was brought in more quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot understand why it is less important for these workers to have reasonable working conditions and hours than any other group of health workers. I want to know whether junior doctors in some countries are some sort of superhuman who can do without adequate rest and who will not harm their own health or that of their patients in the process. The mother of one such trainee doctor said to me recently that she had been writing to the British Prime Minister and his wife, Tony and Cherie, to ask if they would be happy if their new baby were to be delivered by a tired, stressed-out doctor in a semi-drunken condition as that described by Mrs Lynne. I consider that would be a real health and safety issue requiring rapid action.</p>
<p class="contents">As we have all said, we must be clear that nine years has to be seen as an absolute limit, that anything more is an aberration. Any country not managing that should not be surprised if they find their staff moving elsewhere, to countries which have managed to implement more modern working conditions. The stepped approach which has been brought in must not be used to simply give a redefinition of working time such as removing meal breaks or time spent on call but not actually treating patients. That would simply be following the bad practices recently tried out by certain burger chains. However, at least some of those chains pay their part-time 17-year-old staff more per hour than some junior doctors get in overtime payment.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate in advance those Member States that will meet their obligations under this directive for all sectors. The progress of others will be monitored very carefully. I acknowledge the Commission's role in this and hope that the Commissioner at that time will show the same commitment as that shown by Mrs Diamantopoulou.</p>
<p class="contents">Regretfully I am not sure that my group will be able to fully support the proposals overall despite the improvements that Mrs Smet and the Parliament team have been able to obtain in this very difficult situation.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also want to thank other key people such as Mr Provan and Mr Rocard. They have played an important role. </p>
<p class="contents">The Parliamentary delegation was basically very much in agreement, even though we differed in our willingness to compromise when it came to the crunch. It was, of course, important to solve problems. The idea was that seven million people should be brought within the scope of the directive. When I learned that the whole thing was to go off without a hitch, that is to say that there was to be an agreement, I nonetheless took the liberty of voting against. I wanted to make the point that, in spite of everything, I was not satisfied with everything in this compromise. I was especially critical of the agreement when it came to the issue of young doctors. </p>
<p class="contents">If the decision is interpreted as it already has been by some people in this debate, namely as saying that the transposition and transitional periods for doctors should add up to nine years and that there should, above and beyond that, be the possibility of an additional three years’ extra time, then we arrive at a total period of twelve years. This is really little different from the Council’s position, involving thirteen years. There was, therefore, not so much of a compromise on that particular point. I think this is a serious matter, because it is about patients having to suffer and about doctors being placed in impossible situations, from both moral and personal points of view. Young doctors do not choose these working conditions and working hours but are forced to accept them. I thought it was appropriate for at least someone in this Parliament to use his voting right for the purpose of indicating this dissatisfaction. </p>
<p class="contents">I now hope to see the three extra years become a facility which cannot be counted upon but which is only granted in really exceptional cases. The intention expressed by this Chamber has, of course, been that, where junior doctors are concerned, the period for implementing the present directive should be nine years and that the three extra years should only apply in extreme and exceptional cases. Naturally, we hope that, in reality, the process will be still more rapid. </p>
<p class="contents">We also want, in the future, to see the working time directive apply to those groups which have still not been brought within its scope. In common with Mr Hughes, I should like to ask the Commission a question regarding these groups. How far has the work progressed when it comes to the transport sector and lorry drivers? </p>
<p class="contents">I want to conclude by saying that, on more than one occasion, the European Parliament has shown itself to be a significant force where working time legislation in Europe is concerned. I hope that this will continue. It is not just a question of establishing longest permitted working times but of a good deal else besides. There are ever more differences in the way in which working time is distributed in our society. For young families, the difficulty of reconciling full-time work with family and children is becoming ever greater. Working time puts the squeeze on women and children, in particular. It is also an issue relating to age and to where one is in one’s life. Young and old have different needs and different abilities. We need a whole series of changes to working time policy, and it is my hope that it will be possible for the European Parliament to come back with more initiatives in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Rather than reiterate what other colleagues have said, I think the core issue is the junior doctors in training. Obviously, whilst nine years is not the perfect solution which Parliament originally sought, it is the best possible compromise. It is incumbent on us to send out a clear message that we would expect every government in the European Union to comply fully with the nine years. Even though I know there are rigorous tests and standards as to whether or not an extension would be granted, it should only be granted in the <span class="italic">most</span> exceptional circumstances and not for any willy-nilly ideology.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, as Mr Hughes pointed out, the other parts of the entitlements come into force immediately. Even though the overall reduction in working hours may be postponed for some time, the actual rest-period times and so on come into force immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall just deal very briefly with two other points concerning the whole working time directive. Firstly, concerning fishermen, there is some attempt to compromise within the proposals before us. However, it is a notoriously difficult area to enforce because of outside conditions, such as bad weather, that will affect the way fishermen operate. Perhaps we should review this at some stage in the near future and look at it anew to try to come up with a better solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, transport workers: when we already have tachograph legislation in place, why do we need to bring in a separate and new directive on transport workers, in particular lorry drivers and so on? Perhaps now is the time to look at this afresh. New technology – in particular digital tachographs and individual smart cards for individual drivers on the tachograph – could be the best way to regulate the hours during which drivers are on the road and at work. It will also ensure that they can have equal benefits with every other worker in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to pay my compliments once again to Mrs Smet. I have one small, further request to the Commissioner. Perhaps now is the time, after we have agreed this conciliation and brought this new piece of legislation into being, to carry out an impact assessment on how the existing legislation is working, whether it is of benefit to the workers – increasing their health and safety – and whether it is increasing employment, which is one of the original arguments behind it.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like also to extend warm thanks to the Commission, particularly for their declaration on working on Sundays. This was a major obstacle for us, mainly because the Commission had skirted this thorny issue a little too easily in the past. The declaration was therefore a great help to us. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say one thing to the representatives of the GUE/NGL Group and the Greens. If you vote against this compromise – and I would understand if you did, because I myself find nine years for junior doctors far too long – you will then be against everything, in effect. If this line were to be taken across the board, and if Parliament were to say “no”, then we would not have a solution in nine years, or ninety years. If it were up to the British Government – we heard this quite clearly in the negotiations – it could well be 50 years and maybe longer before they resolve this issue. The first problem was that they appeared unable to train a sufficient number of doctors. If, therefore, you do not train sufficient doctors, you need to obtain them from other countries. If this plan fails too, then the whole procedure could take a very long time. If this is not something you want, then you need to approve this directive now, obviously with the reservation that it is an empty exercise – I am still convinced of this – and junior doctors should not need to be in this exemption position at all. That is the problem. </p>
<p class="contents">I have one question for the Commission. It concerns the other matters at issue, specifically that of transport. I would like to know how the Commission intends to deal with this. It is now up to the Commission. The working time directive will not be complete until these issues have been resolved. The ball is now quite clearly in the Commission’s court. The Transport Council is behaving badly. Transport conjures up images of action and movement, but the Transport Council must be the most inactive of all councils and does absolutely nothing. I wonder if the Commission can think of a way to resolve this. Failing this, Mr President, we should seriously consider taking legal action against the Transport Council, as was done very successfully a couple of years ago before the Court. More of this later. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, one of the first people to propose working time legislation was Winston Churchill.</p>
<p class="contents">That was a key moment in history, not only in the history of Great Britain, but also in the history of Europe as a whole, because in the Netherlands too, we adopted this legislation without questioning it. That makes it all the easier to bring this directive about. We thus have the feeling that we are in a way completing Winston Churchill’s work with this directive, especially if we bear in mind that he did at least manage to bring a terrible war to a successful end in five years, while the present British Government would not even be capable of resolving the problem of junior doctors in 50 years. He – more than anyone – should be in our thoughts when dealing with this subject matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is demonstrated by the excellent work of Mrs Smet, and also Mr Provan and Mr Rocard. I would also like to thank the Commissioner, Mrs Diamantopoulou, her department and so many people – also the Portuguese Presidency – who have allowed Parliament, like Churchill, to set a milestone in the construction of a social and more humanitarian Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that there is another reason for recommending that Parliament vote in favour of this report: the difficulties we have faced in making progress with regard to certain governments. I will be truly happy to see these sectors, which were excluded from the 1993 directive, provided with a recognised European regulation on working time, even if it does involve long and protracted timescales.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we should not be dazzled by the light. There is no doubt that public opinion – and I too am concerned about this public opinion – does not understand why these procedures are so slow and why, with regard to the problem of young doctors or fishermen, we have not been able to make any progress. It is not acceptable – since we all agree that we cannot continue to ask these young doctors to work these exhausting hours and that we cannot continue to put our patients at risk – that we have not been able to make speedier progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that, in fact, the timescale will be nine years and not thirteen years, although it pains me to say that, as a Spaniard, I feel restricted by the fact that it has been my government which has insisted most on having this additional period. They may have requested this additional period, but we should take great care to ensure that they do not use it.</p>

Clearly there are significant health and safety issues which can be addressed – not only for the protection of workers but also for the protection of their customers and the general public – and issues of customer health and safety of course are particularly relevant in relation to doctors in training. Like my colleague, Mrs Lambert, I am concerned that this compromise has not gone quite far enough in relation to doctors' hours.</p>
<p class="contents">There would remain though some workers in some working places where practical issues do not readily lend themselves to the implementation of this type of directive. Coming from Scotland, with one of the largest EU fishing fleets, I would like once again to focus on the problem of fisheries and the defining of working time. I note the compromise concerning sea-fishermen – a maximum of 48 hours of weekly work in a reference period of 12 months and the possibility of derogation after consultation and by agreement. This may be an improvement but I still have some questions to put to the Commission. We have to recognise that there were good reasons for the initial exclusion of the fisheries sector.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards fishing there is a deep-seated suspicion of Brussels in many respects and a lot of opposition to the whole idea of fishermen being told when to sleep or when to go to sea, given that their working time is governed by uncontrollable factors such as climatic conditions and the movement of shoals of fish. The directive says that work at sea comprises sea fishing and other offshore work. Many fishermen, particularly in Scotland, are organised on a family basis – they are share-fishermen paid only a proportion of their vessel's catch. They are clearly not employees in the sense of the word that we would understand. Is this directive going to affect them or is it not? I have asked the Commission this question previously in committee and in plenary and have not yet received absolute clarification of this point.</p>
<p class="contents">The Conciliation Committee concluded in the case of those share fishermen who are employees – a statement which seems to me to be contradictory – that it is for Member States to determine the conditions for entitlement to annual leave and payments etc, but there is no explanation as to whether or when a share fisherman is employed.</p>
<p class="contents">I know for sure that the fishermen that I see around the coast of Scotland can only be defined as self-employed and I stress the need for clarification of this. There are huge differences between a large-scale long-distance fleet where fishermen are employed by companies and sent off for months on end and the smaller- and medium-sized boats, which operate on a family or a cooperative basis. This is an issue about the definition of self-employment or owner operation and I know that the compromise deletes own-account transport operators, clearly and quite properly identifying an exception in that area. I call for a similar exception for share-fishermen.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is why an appropriate solution must be found to the problem of all workers in activities that were excluded from the scope of Directive 93, specifically in the area of transport, fishing and the activities of junior doctors. The truth is that, despite a positive proposal by Parliament, which sought to respond to these issues, the Council has insisted on an unacceptable position. This substantially reduces the initial proposals of the European Parliament, specifically the increase of the period for transposing the directive to all sectors from two to three years. The only exception made concerns junior doctors, for whom the period is extended from four to nine and possibly to twelve years. Apart from anything else, this also threatens the safety of the patients themselves who are examined by doctors who work excessively long hours. That is why we have voted against this agreement, since what we want, of course, is a better agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the new directive, of course, and I am pleased that it has been extended to offshore workers, fishermen and doctors in training.</p>
<p class="contents">The most contentious part of the directive was bound to relate to doctors in training who would benefit from this piece of legislation. One should recall that the Council had originally proposed an exemption for a period of some 13 years before doctors in training would secure the benefits of the directive. Naturally, Parliament put forward its own proposals to support the right of doctors in training to be covered by this directive after a period of 4 years. Hence the conciliation procedure which you, Mr President, were involved in.</p>
<p class="contents">But whatever honeyed words are attached to the conclusions of the procedure, the bottom line is that junior doctors will not secure benefits for a period of nine years at least. According to the conclusions of the Conciliation Committee, junior doctors will secure benefits after a transitional period of five years and a four-year transposition period. I fully support the right of junior doctors and doctors in training to secure the benefits of this directive, but the Conciliation Committee conclusions will have reluctantly to be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like in conclusion to refer to one small but very important matter, namely that under exceptional circumstances there may be a further extension of two years and indeed up to three years if governments argue that the reduction would cause real administrative difficulties. I do hope that this directive can be implemented sooner rather than later.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When used preventively, it saves the state and the economy a great deal of money. I have completely failed to understand in this debate why a reasonable set of rules was not adopted back in 1993, especially as the Commission and Parliament did not want any derogations even then. Seven million workers were affected and specific sectors, such as the mobile worker sector, have been subject to ruinous competition over recent years, especially in Germany. It is therefore also a social problem and it is not enough, Mr Crowley, to use tachographs or other technical aids. One does not exclude the other.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need a framework directive, because the employees who are affected have been working in a grey zone for a long time now. They had no rules, they were not covered by a collective agreement, they were exploited and some also engaged in self-exploitation. We know that this overload sometimes gave rise to alcohol-related problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has shown sufficient flexibility; Mrs Smet highlighted our legislative maturity. I think, Mrs Smet, you have proven that we can also fight. The results are acceptable. I am trying to muster support, even if we have not achieved everything we wanted to. But the transition period and the graduated plan are the maximum we have allowed the Council. I hope that no government will use up the full period of time and am counting on constructive competition between the Member States to see which State will be the first to implement the proposals from Parliament and the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It does not harmonise social legislation upwards, quite the opposite. It establishes a European framework which falls a long way short of workers’ expectations: an 11-hour daily rest period, a 48-hour working week, a 24-hour weekly break. What is more, a number of categories were excluded from its field of competence.</p>
<p class="contents">We find the compromise, which Parliament is to vote on today following the meetings of the Conciliation Committee, unsatisfactory in terms of both the health and the safety of workers. It makes flexibility more widespread, particularly for sea fishermen, establishing the systematic annualisation of reference periods. It will permit further exemptions to the already excessive legislation of 48 hours per week. Finally, it will take nine years, in the best possible case, for the working week of doctors in training to be reduced from 58 hours to 48.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the proposed working time organisation institutes social deregulation at the very time when, in France, doctors in training are campaigning for decent working conditions and genuine safety for service-users. Proper organisation of working time would entail, we reiterate, a real reduction in working hours accompanied by moves to create a sufficient number of jobs. We cannot support this report as it stands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, to get a 48-hour week, junior doctors must wait nine years minimum and possibly twelve years. I will not pretend to be happy with this situation. It is, however, the best that we could achieve if we were to end once and for all the Council's delaying tactics.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been obvious since 1993 that those excluded from the directive at that time would eventually come under its protection. One has to ask, therefore, why over that seven-year period virtually nothing was done in Ireland or in Britain to bring the number of doctors forward that would be needed to implement it.</p>
<p class="contents">In Ireland some junior doctors work over 100 hours per week, the average being 70 to 80. Only last night they suspended strike action which they had threatened because they have now reached an interim agreement which will ensure that they are actually paid for the overtime they work. In some cases they were not paid at all, in some cases only half the normal rate. Some progress has been made and no doubt the conclusion of the conciliation has helped them in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Through the Council of Ministers both Britain and Ireland fought tooth-and-nail to slow the process down. That was unfortunate. The working arrangements for junior doctors are like a horror story from a Dickensian novel of the nineteenth century. I find it bizarre that at the beginning of the 21st century we are still arguing for common sense with regard to health and safety. I would appeal to all national governments, including Ireland, not to utilise the additional provisions for extending the implementation of this directive beyond the nine-year period and would remind them that it is intended only as an exceptional measure if all other genuine steps have been taken to implement the measures here.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The recitals of the proposal, nonetheless, stress the specific importance of this file, the first major file on social issues, adding, even, that it is a matter of the health and safety of 7 million workers.</p>
<p class="contents">In France, for example, a number of strikes by junior doctors recently drew the attention of public opinion to the intolerable length of the working day for this category of worker, harmful to the doctors in training themselves, but also to the quality of the care they are providing their patients with. The same question arises, with at least as much urgency, for other categories such as offshore workers or transport workers. What we should have had was a quick decision and an appropriate reduction in working hours. Well, the proposal does intend to cut hours, but by phasing in the cuts. For the first three years, 58-hour working weeks are permitted. We have to wait 5 years for the maximum working week to be reduced to 48 hours, and the Commission is cynical enough to cite technical reasons in order to grant a further 2-year delay in application.</p>
<p class="contents">Who are they trying to kid that these measures could not come into force almost immediately if there was any political will to act in favour of the interests of the workers concerned rather than favouring the claims of management? Some restriction, even a derisory cut, in working hours is better than no restriction at all.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall not vote against this text, but we shall conclude from this experience that workers can have no expectations of social Europe and that, decidedly, nothing can replace the collective strength of the workers when it comes to amending legislation in favour of the workers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thank heavens, my fellow Members have already said what needed to be said about the issue itself. I shall come back to this point. We are not terribly proud of the final result, but I should at least like to pay tribute to it, as some outcome had to be found.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, I should like to thank Mrs Smet, our efficient and indefatigable rapporteur, and Mr Provan, who was also the persistent and efficient chairman of our Conciliation Committees. I should like to thank all our coordinators, Mr Brok, Mr Hughes, Mrs Flautre, Mr Schmid, Mrs Lynne, who demonstrated great understanding in order to reach some sort of outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to pay tribute to the Commission. Without wishing to embarrass you, Mrs Diamantopoulou, throughout almost all this debate Parliament has had the technical and even political support of the Commission, particularly on the important amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one small correction to make, unless I misunderstood, to what Mrs Smet has just said. It is not exactly the first successful conciliation on social matters between the European Parliament and the Council. It is the second, following the successful conciliation on the minor issue of workers working in an explosive atmosphere. This is, however, an infinitely more wide-ranging issue, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I must point out how unusually tough the Council is to deal with. The political truth is that the Parliament team, in an astounding spirit of responsibility and unanimity – and you have witnessed the benign respect which I and Mr Bushill-Matthews, for example, have for each other – was remarkable for its united front as much as for its determination to succeed. Parliament made most of the running. We are not proud of the result in terms of the content. In a real democracy Parliament would have been determining the legislation. I would like to remind the Council that we are just as dedicated to achieving results, but that they must not expect Parliament to make quite so many concessions on a regular basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I feel that the successful outcome of the conciliation procedure proves that where there is a will, there is a way.</p>
<p class="contents">In order for this conciliation to succeed, we had to take account of the fifteen different systems in the Member States, different fields of work and proposals from various employer and employee federations. We also had to take account of the viability of health services as things now stand and competitiveness in sectors such as transport and fisheries. This was no mean feat! It has taken six years to achieve today’s result and it is the first major conciliation decision in the social sphere – and I say major because it affects some 5 million workers. </p>
<p class="contents">I feel that the most interesting point – and this is my third comment – is the number of workers affected by this directive, who are at present excluded from the working time directive and who will enjoy these rights once this directive is applied. In my view, therefore, we should be satisfied regardless of whether or not this directive meets all our requirements. The upshot is that the provisions of the working directive will apply to doctors in training, workers at sea, rail workers and all non-mobile workers in excluded sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like in particular to thank the Chairman of the Committee, Mr Rocard, the Vice-Chairman, Mr Provan, who used his great experience to guide the conciliation procedure, and of course, Mrs Smet who, with her wealth of ministerial experience, helped achieve such a difficult conciliation. I would also like to give special thanks to the Portuguese Presidency and the Member States, particularly those which, for reasons we cannot go into right now, have experienced major problems with their national health services, such as Great Britain, Spain and Ireland. </p>
<p class="contents">Certain speakers raised the issue of the implementation of the directive. I should like to stress that it is indeed a particularly important issue. One of the Commission’s fundamental duties is to monitor the implementation of directives. Here I should like to ask the MEPs to cooperate with us and closely monitor any underhanded plans in Member States, so that the Commission can intervene immediately. </p>
<p class="contents">A further two questions have also been raised, the first by Messrs Hughes, Schmid and Pronk as to what we intend to do in the road and rail transport sectors. First, I must tell you that the Transport Council is involved, making the whole process even more complicated. Secondly, as for road transport, the Commission tabled a proposal in 1996, but it was blocked by the Council in 1998. The Commission intends, with the cooperation of the French Presidency, to re-table the issue. We are awaiting new negotiations by the social partners and we hope to obtain their assent. If we cannot proceed in this way, we shall have to change the whole approach we have adopted so far. </p>
