As a member of the WTO, China has benefited from the elimination of textile quotas since 1 January 2005. Import figures for the first months of 2005 show that Chinese exporters have availed themselves of the opportunities offered by the elimination of quotas. Taking account of serious concerns voiced by European textile manufacturers, trade unions and some Member States, the Commission opened investigations on 29 April, covering a number of products, to determine whether market disruption and disorderly development of trade have taken place as defined under the relevant Community legislation in accordance with China’s protocol of accession to the WTO. Following these investigations, the Commission may decide to open formal consultations with China. In that case China will be under an obligation to limit exports to the Community to certain specific levels, with a growth rate of, in general, 7.5%.</p>
<p class="contents">Such measures may be effective for a period ending on 31 December, or for one year, depending on when the consultations have been requested. They may be reapplied if need be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From numerous media reports, it appears that the Commissioner with responsibility for trade is calling for restraint in this affair and has made a plea to avoid what he calls protectionist thinking. On the other hand, the United States Government has accepted a request from its textile industry to investigate the sharp increase in the import of textiles from China. The US Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez has promised a swift and fair inquiry. He said: ‘We want to do it quickly and we want to do it right’.</p>

The guidelines that were adopted and published in early April provide for swift procedures for analysing the question of whether or not safeguard measures are warranted in response to a surge in Chinese textile and clothing imports. These guidelines stipulate that, if justified by the facts, the Commission may open an investigation with a view to analysing whether the conditions for imposing safeguard measures are fulfilled.</p>
<p class="contents">On 29 April, the Commission opened an investigation of nine categories of textiles and clothing imports. The Commission has stated that it will do its utmost to complete this investigation earlier than the maximum period provided for by the guidelines. In parallel, the Commission will hold informal consultations with the Chinese authorities with a view to finding a mutually satisfactory solution that would provide relief to the European industry and avoid a resort to safety measures.</p>
<p class="contents">If these talks are not successful, the Commission reserves its right to request formal consultations with China via the WTO and, possibly, impose safeguard measures, if warranted by the facts. There have been requests for the application of the emergency procedure provided for by the guidelines. This would mean going directly to formal consultations with China via the WTO without an investigation, if there is evidence of irreparable damage to the EU industry in the absence of such a course of action. The Commission’s services are analysing these requests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why Commissioner Mandelson awaited factual information regarding exports from China into the European Union for the first three months of this year. The Commission has now initiated further action. As a result of this particular action, a number of categories are now being investigated.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as my colleague Mr Mandelson has pointed out, under the agreement in the WTO, Member States throughout the Union have had ten years to prepare for this. Therefore, it should not have come as a great surprise – or any surprise at all – that the Chinese exporters would avail of the opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, irrespective of what action might result as a consequence of the investigation now taking place, it can only last until 31 December 2008 in any event. I am not anticipating what decision might be reached as a result of these investigations; however, whatever happens, this can only last until the end of 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the honourable Member raised the question of customs cooperation. The fact-gathering that the Commission’s services have done gives details from all the Member States as to what the volume of imports from China has been in the first few months of this year. There has been good customs cooperation between the authorities in the relevant Member States and the Commission in order to provide that particular precise information on the real data regarding imports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In addition to providing the Commission with a database containing important information on relevant insolvencies in the EU air industry as of 1 January 2000, the consultant has been asked to consider the issue of passengers stranded due to bankruptcy. It will conclude on the need or not for a protection mechanism for airline passengers and examine possible options. The study is expected to produce its findings by the end of August 2005. Based on these conclusions, and if it is effectively confirmed that a large number of citizens are faced with a lack of protection, the Commission will decide on possible future actions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You indicated that this might be ready by August, which misses this year’s summer holiday period. I think you will agree with me that most European people expect support if the airline goes bankrupt and they appear to be stranded. They imagine – or believe – that they will be supported and that the airlines will give them assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">They think that they are supported by their travel insurance, when in fact most of them are not; they think that if they have used a credit card to book it or have done so on the Internet, they are covered, but, again, they are not. Do you feel that the Commission ought to do some sort of publicity drive in advance of this summer holiday period to encourage people to have proper insurance? If they are not covered, and an airline goes bankrupt, they will be put in a dire situation. People expect more of the airlines than they are apparently getting at the moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As he will know, the Package Travel Directive covers travel as part of the total package. However, as he has pointed out, in the specific instance where a consumer has purchased his or her flight separately from the package, it is not covered. That means that the difficulties mentioned can arise. That is why the Commission carried out a study in this particular area. The first part of the consultancy is being done by Commissioner Barrot, and will cover the general review of regulations in this regard. The second part will deal with the possibility of bankruptcies and what should be done when they occur.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also point out that DG Sanco is carrying out an ongoing review of the Package Travel Directive, which will also deal with this issue. Since 2000 there have been 40 such bankruptcies, but the method of dealing with them varies between Member States. Some Member States take it upon themselves to look after their stranded nationals. Others have agreements with each other. Therefore, it is necessary that we review this in its entirety. Hopefully, we will have the consultancy study by this summer. Commissioner Barrot will then propose some amendments, if he thinks necessary, on the basis of the study. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Various opinion polls suggest that citizens do not feel themselves to be closely involved in the European Union or with its institutions. The information campaigns and the debate being held on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe in connection with the various referenda risk being obscured by other issues, including Turkey's potential accession and the question of whether or not to approve the directive on services.</p>

<p class="contents">The Commission is undertaking ten specific communication initiatives. They range from the wide distribution of the text of the Constitution for free; the Constitution website; training for national and regional journalists; round table discussions with civil society; information actions targeted at universities and schools, such as European Spring Day, and support for the production of radio and television programmes; to targeting the use of the Europe Direct call centre; mobilising our networks of multipliers in various policy areas; undertaking detailed opinion poll analyses and focus group research and, last but not least, supporting the information campaigns in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully understand the concern of the honourable Member that the debate on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe lacks the necessary clarity. Precisely because they have been well aware of this risk, the Commission, Parliament and the Heads of State and Government decided to get involved in the debate from the very beginning and to implement in good time information campaigns on the Constitution which, while respecting the national specificities of each Member State, would inform the citizens and encourage them to take part in the debate and the referendums.</p>
<p class="contents">We must use every communication tool available to allow our citizens to make informed choices based on the content of the Constitution. I want the debate to be based on facts rather than the many myths that are circulating. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The only way to develop this partnership is by bringing in the European citizens and taking their interests into account.</p>
<p class="contents">The first responsibility of the present Commission is, therefore, to connect with citizens. Let me add immediately that this is not just the Commission’s responsibility. In fact, it is very much the responsibility of all players: Parliament, the Council and the Member State governments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will, therefore, put forward a White Paper on communication, which will address the role of all involved and which will give the other institutions the possibility to define and organise their input. The Commission for its part will pursue a new approach on communication, which will focus on the need to interest Europeans in EU politics. This demand-driven communication approach has to involve a better understanding of target audiences and those who act as multipliers, a better use of modern and effective communication tools and techniques, and a more professional attitude to all our communication work.</p>
<p class="contents">What the Commission will have to do first is to improve its listening process. The Commission needs to make better use of its polling and intelligence services – if I may call them that – in its consultation procedures and to use its communication tools according to the needs and interests of its audiences. In order to reach people, the communication of political priorities will be adapted to demographic and national specificities, instead of taking the classical one-size-fits-all approach. Our representation offices in the Member States will have a central role to play here.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will explain its policies and their impact on EU citizens’ daily lives and communicate the tangible benefits of Europe rather than overload people with technical information. Last, but not least, the Commission will encourage and support efforts to establish and improve a dialogue with Europeans. The Commission will, therefore, need to professionalise its communication activities. That involves improving research, planning, coordination and evaluation of communication activities and making better use of the excellent communication tools the Commission has at its disposal and the representations in the 25 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Communication will be integrated into the Commission’s working culture and into policy formulation from the very beginning, and this needs to be maintained throughout the whole political process. Since communication is an across-the-board challenge, all actors – from the European institutions and Member States to civil society and the media – have a role to play. Interinstitutional cooperation is a key element.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has kept Parliament regularly informed on the development of the communication strategy, which was also discussed at the last meeting of the Interinstitutional Group on Information and in the Committee on Culture and Education during the discussion on the Herrero-Tejedor report. The Commission will invite the European Parliament and the Council to comment on its White Paper. The Commission will also continue to improve relations with the media, in particular regional and local media in the Member States, as a key element for ensuring that information reaches the citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have to equip those offices in such a way – and work and plan in such a way – that they can ‘go local’ and communicate with local media. Our contacts with the national parliaments will also help. We have to make sure that European affairs are anchored in local and national political traditions and party systems. They will have to understand European affairs and how this affects the way they work and their tasks. I agree with you that these are challenges.

According to the latest published Eurobarometer survey, which carried out its fieldwork in November 2004, approximately one third of Europeans have never even heard of the Constitution. There is also a huge problem of misinformation. As we have seen in France, discussions concerning the Constitution are often too closely associated with separate issues such as Turkey's accession to the EU.

Furthermore, according to that Eurobarometer, 75% of those who know the Constitution well are in favour and even 60% of those who have only a modest knowledge are favourable. However, the support of those who have never heard about the Constitution so far is only 22%.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusion is clear. There is a vital need to communicate on this cornerstone project for the future of the European Union. As you know, the main responsibility for communicating about the Constitution lies with Member States. Nevertheless, the European Commission is determined to undertake all the actions necessary to inform citizens about the content of the Constitution, but also about its importance for the future of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We have therefore developed this strategy that I have mentioned before, consisting of ten initiatives which form an integrated concept, and support and enhance each other. They are: the distribution of the text of the Constitution for free; a Constitution website; training for national and regional journalists; round table discussions with civil society; information to universities and schools; support for the production of radio and television programmes and targeting the use of the ‘Europe direct’ call centre.</p>
<p class="contents">Our eighth action involves mobilising our networks of multipliers in various policy areas. The ninth consists in undertaking detailed opinion poll analysis and focus group research, and the tenth in supporting the information campaigns of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Through these initiatives, we are seeking to develop an informed debate based on the contents of the Constitution. Members of the European Parliament and individual Member States also have a crucial role to play. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No. 35 by Hélène Goudin (<a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2005-0329_EN.html">H-0329/05</a>)</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: The EU's information and communication strategy</span></p>
<p class="contents">In a draft report on the EU's information and communication strategy (PE 355.447v01-00), the European Parliament has proposed that the Institutions 'should reach agreements with independent television producers able to devise drama series, competitions, films, news reports and in general all kinds of high-quality and accessible programmes which appeal to popular taste and serve to promote the idea and values of Europe' (Paragraph 11). In <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2004&amp;nu_doc=0196">COM(2004)0196</a> final, the Commission stated that there was a need to provide information about the EU's ideas and values. The Commission observed that the audiovisual sector plays an important role in this work and that cofinancing of audiovisual programmes on the EU should be continued (p. 18).</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission consider this to be the right time for cofinancing of TV programmes as part of the Commission's objective of informing citizens in the specific fields proposed by the Committee on Culture and Education, that is drama series, competitions, films and news reports? What are the costs of the relevant budget items for the Commission's present information and communication strategy? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to Eurobarometer’s latest full report, TV is far and away the most popular source of information for people in all 25 Member States when it comes to issues concerning the EU. Radio follows closely in third place, with higher percentages in the new Member States, making the audio-visual media the most effective channels for spreading information about the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">With a view to giving people factual and other information about the EU, its policy areas and the decisions and measures it adopts, the Commission has, every year since 2003, published an invitation to submit proposals for the cofinancing of high-quality and accessible programmes which appeal to popular taste and which at the same time serve to promote the EU’s ideas and values.</p>
<p class="contents">The total budget for 2004 amounted to EUR 6.7 million. Of the project proposals submitted by radio and TV companies or producers, 79 projects were selected. For 2005, the invitation to submit proposals applies only to radio, and the budget for that activity amounts to EUR 3.9 million. Subsequently, agreements will be drafted, regulating the forms to be taken by this cooperation between radio and TV companies or producers and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In devising their projects, applicants are free to choose the type of programmes they prefer to produce and transmit. The formats can include not only drama series, game shows, films and news reports but also debates. So far, no candidates have chosen to develop projects for drama series, game shows or films.</p>
<p class="contents">This is borne out by the results of the Commission’s latest quality studies and opinion polls carried out in the EU’s 25 Member States. The aim was to provide an overview of what Europeans want and expect in terms both of form and content. TV viewers do not actually regard films, drama series or game shows as the ideal way of supplying information about the EU. Instead, they turn out to prefer current affairs shows, live coverage, documentaries and, above all, factual and informative news items in more general news programmes. They may also be interested in historical documentaries, arts programmes and films, but to a significantly lesser degree.</p>
<p class="contents">The applicants are always entirely free to choose what type of programme they want to produce, provided that it helps communicate the European message to people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must ask whether that is Commissioner Wallström’s view, because my distinct impression is exactly the opposite, namely that there is a huge bias throughout Europe in favour of the ‘yes’ camp, which dominates the press.

<p class="contents">On 22 March 2005 the Greek Minister for the Environment, Mr Souflias, stated that the former Hellinikon Airport in Athens would not be converted in its entirety into a park for the capital because – according to him – Greek taxpayers could not be asked to pay for the construction and maintenance of such a park; this meant that at least 100 hectares would be developed. The inhabitants of Athens have to contend with very poor air quality, since it is the EU capital with the lowest proportion of green space per inhabitant.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Reform of European regional policy</span></p>
<p class="contents">A study carried out by the Kassel College of Higher Education in July 2004 on German regional aid (EU and German federal programmes) shows that up to 96% of the appropriations paid in subsidies have no lasting impact in economic terms owing to geographical relocations and the deadweight effect. The current proposal for a regulation laying down general provisions (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2004&amp;nu_doc=0492">COM(2004)0492</a> final) seeks to prevent subsidies being paid for business relocation during the new programming period. However, this scheme relates only to the 7-year period during which the subsidised investment has to remain in a given location. How will it be possible for the relocation of a business before that period to be taken into account under this scheme? How would it be possible to prevent subsidies being used solely for relocation? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Under current regulations there is a provision which clearly states that a firm which relocates within five years of using the funds must reimburse the aid it received. This mechanism will be maintained after 2006; however, we are proposing to lengthen that period from five to seven years. We are also adding a provision that any firm required to reimburse money will not be entitled to receive support from the funds in the future. This proposal is currently under negotiation and discussion in the Council. The regulation envisages the situation that when major project – above EUR 25 million in the case of the environment and EUR 50 million in the case of transport and substructure – are adopted, the Commission also asks the Member State, under cost-benefit analysis, to provide information about any jobs being created or lost in the regions concerned in the context of a given project. So we are taking this issue into account as well.</p>
<p class="contents">With future regulations, the Commission intends to play a more active role in monitoring, which would mean we can gather information on any on-going relocation processes and deliver it to Member States. The latest information on this mechanism currently under consultation with the Member States involves the state aid rules for competition. DG Competition at the Commission has also sought comments from Member States on the issue of relocation. The Commission is currently analysing the Member States’ positions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Decisions on where to base a business are always taken in response to market considerations – infrastructure, the market to which the firm intends to sell, the tax position in different places and the state of the labour market, but subsidies do not enter into it. This is something that European regional policy must take into account, as these subsidies are primarily windfall gains. In terms of getting the European ideal accepted, they are absolute poison, particularly in the regions affected by site closures, and their end product is in fact nothing whatever; they produce neither additional jobs nor added economic potential.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, let me again ask the Commissioner: what additional mechanisms can we bolt on to exclude the possibility of subsidies being given to firms that have already relocated? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Once those conditions are in place, priority should be given to other competitiveness factors, such as knowledge, innovation, research and development, and also the quality of human capital. These are in fact the key areas where we propose concentrating Community assistance, in line with the integrated guidelines on jobs and growth which the Commission proposed and the presidency concluded at the Spring European Council. So the natural logic is that we should move to different priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is, of course, limited resources. Under Objective 2 and the phasing-in transitional scheme, we will have very limited resources, requiring strong targeting of support. The critical mass for growth and competitiveness must be reached as soon as possible. But I must point out that the menu of priorities the Commission proposes under the regulations does not prevent regions from investing in infrastructure to strengthen the secondary networks. This could include improving links to trans-European networks – to regional railways, airports, ports and also multimodal platforms providing radial links to main railway lines – and promoting regional and local inland waterways.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is, therefore, ready to examine the possibility of introducing a degree of flexibly in the definition of the scope of use of the funds in the phasing-in regions. Consequently, the compromise text of the presidency has already been modified on this point and would allow for a derogation. Such a derogation will have to be duly justified and could concern some priorities financed under the convergence objective. But that could also mean social infrastructure, such as education, health and, possibly, some missing links in the transeuropean networks. So this is all possible. It will have to be justified – most likely on a case-by-case basis – but we are opening up this possibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is the outcome of the negotiations between the Greek Government and the Commission concerning the irregularities which occurred during the four-year period from 2000 to 2004? Will any resources be lost? If so, how much and from which programmes? Which programmes is the Greek Government proposing for cuts and which does the Commission consider should be cut because of a low take-up rate of funding?

<p class="contents">I should like to tell Mr Papadimoulis what stage we are at. As you know, the Greek authorities provided at the due time a description of the entire management and control systems of the ERDF established in Greece. As a follow-up, in October 2003 an audit – carried out by the services of the Directorate-General for Regional Policy – confirmed the existence of serious deficiencies in the systems and the management process. We agreed an action plan with the Greek authorities; the final deadline for the implementation of the actions under the plan was the end of September 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The deliverables of the action plan have been analysed. The conclusion was that certain types of operations that were cofinanced and certain operations that were carried over from the Second to the Third Community Support Framework do not justify the contribution from the ERDF. We also confirmed the existence of serious failings in the management and control systems. As the Greek authorities did not investigate the irregularities and did not make the necessary financial corrections, the Directorate-General informed them of the possible suspension by the Commission of interim ERDF payments for specific measures of the operational programmes that were affected by the above-mentioned irregularities.</p>
<p class="contents">Many meetings took place between January and May 2005 and, throughout this process, the Commission stressed the urgency of arriving at an overall solution that would allow payments to continue on a sound basis in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to your question, the amount of any correction will have to take full account of the audit findings, but the consequences in terms of loss of Community funds cannot be quantified at this stage. I can say that flat-rate corrections will be applied, in compliance with the regulations. Also, given that the discussions that have taken place have not led to an agreement so far, the Commission is currently proceeding with measures that may lead to suspension decisions. Nevertheless, we shall keep open the possibility of continued dialogue to find a solution. The next meeting with the Greek authorities will take place tomorrow. When the debate with the Greek authorities is closed I will be able to inform you in writing what programmes have been affected and to what extent.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the modification of the Third Community Support Framework is concerned, the Commission has been informed that the Greek Ministry of Finance intends to submit an application in the course of the year. So far, however, the Commission has received no proposals for transfers of funds between programmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think we should look at the issue from the short-term, medium-term and long-term perspective. In the short-term, as soon as the closure was announced, Commission officials reacted, and we were in close and frequent contact with our counterparts in the West Midlands. Our first priority was to identify the range of actions needed to alleviate the consequences of the closure. These actions are undertaken with a view to securing long-term growth prospects for the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me stress very strongly that we have worked very closely over the last weeks with national and regional authorities, and this case demonstrates that we can cooperate if we want to help overcome this kind of tragic economic event. Working together, we can assist the regional efforts to regain economic strength.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, in the medium term, the Commission decided to work with the European vehicle manufacturers and other stakeholders with a view to improving the competitiveness of the sector. To this end my colleague, Commissioner Verheugen, has set up a high-level group called ‘CARS 21’. The group is expected to present proposals on a competitive automotive regulatory system for the next ten years. In this group, we have industry representatives and also experts.</p>
<p class="contents">For the long term, as you know, the issue of corporate restructuring and industrial policies is high on the European agenda these days, in line with the renewed Lisbon agenda. The Commission adopted, a few weeks ago, a communication on restructuring and employment, setting out measures to be developed or strengthened. It means that the European Union can mobilise as regards anticipating and managing corporate restructuring.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe’s ministers for labour and employment and the European social partners have also met recently, again underlining the need to anticipate and work in partnership for successful corporate restructuring. I think it is important that they have concluded that successful restructuring requires a climate of trust. It requires good communication. By definition, this involves commitment from employers and employees in anticipating and managing change, seeking alternatives to lay-offs and exploring opportunities for training, out-placement and the creation of new activities.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the Rover case has also been a factor in demonstrating that we have to think seriously about restructuring in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have proposed in the future regulation, for example, setting up a kind of special reserve. I cannot remember how big it was supposed to be, but it would be a certain percentage of the funds. Then every Member State would have a reserve for cases like this and there would be no need to shift money between programmes or projects and become involved in a very complicated and bureaucratic process. Unfortunately, in spite of the Rover case, there is no support among the Member States for such a reserve. So we will be deprived of this kind of flexibility in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, not only through the funds but also in general, we have embarked on a process that would allow us to contribute to the European structure in such a way as to ensure that future structures, based on new factors of production and growth, would be more flexible. This would allow the industries to adjust in time and in an evolutionary manner, rather than leading to the kind of restructuring we are facing in the case of Rover.

It is important that your services are also involved with Mr Verheugen in that. Important regional issues are involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly – and this is a lesson that I want to feed back to you from our experience in the West Midlands – restructuring the supply chain for industries, and particularly the SMEs, was something we started on. We did not necessarily get a lot of support from you in the beginning, but it is a lesson I hope you will take for other major industries later. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, Article 88a of Directive 2001/83 calls upon the Commission to present to Parliament and the Council a report on current practice with regard to information provision – particularly on the Internet – and its risks and benefits for patients. The report will be prepared following consultations with patients' and consumers' organisations, doctors' and pharmacists' organisations, Member States and interested parties. It is due within three years of the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 2004/726/EC – which means by 2007 – but the Commission will do its best to present this report in advance of that deadline. In accordance with the results of the report, the Commission is to table proposals setting out an information strategy to ensure good-quality, objective, reliable and non-promotional information on medicinal products and other treatments and address the question of the information source's liability.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the G10 process: the report will also take into account experience from related activities in this area, such as the work of the European Medicines Agency with patient organisations, the public-private partnership under the G10 initiative and other relevant activities, such as the new European database on medicinal products. The Regulation I already mentioned calls upon the European Medicines Agency to set up a publicly accessible database, which will cover medicines authorised by the Community and by Member States. The database will facilitate the search for information already authorised for package leaflets and will contain a section on paediatric medicines. The final report will then need to address the question of whether, beyond the stocktaking of current practice, with its risks and benefits, an improved information strategy is needed and what elements could be included.</p>
<p class="contents">The third matter is the European Union Public Health Programme running from 2003 until 2008, which has as its objective the creation of a comprehensive and reliable information and knowledge system. That is being created on the basis of a shortlist of agreed indicators for which data is collected mainly through Eurostat and ad hoc services and projects. Analysis of data is supported through the programme, leading to regular reporting on public health issues. All project reports are published on the Commission public health website. In addition, in order to improve the presentation and availability of information to the public, to specialised audiences and to patients, the Commission is at an advanced stage of preparing an EU public health portal, drawing together information at EU level, national and regional levels, and with resources from civil society. It is planned to launch this initiative before the end of this year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, she will understand – it is partly in the question – that patients feel the urgent need for more information about their condition, drugs and treatments. Too often they go to the Internet and get information that may be misleading or may be dangerous. Therefore, it is urgent that we have authorised and authenticated systems of information for patients. Perhaps the Commissioner could take back the message that the penalty for Commissioner Verheugen is to speed up the process even more. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission intends to present a new framework for SME policy in the second half of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the presentation of the Growth and Employment Strategy on 2 February, three initiatives of significant relevance to SMEs have already been taken. The first is better regulation. The Commission adopted, on 16 March, a communication on better regulation for growth and jobs in the European Union, one of its goals being to further reduce red tape. That is particularly relevant for SMEs because they have limited resources and suffer disproportionately from red tape.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will refine the impact assessment tool, an important tool for considering the effect of EU legislation on SMEs. The economic analysis of these assessments will be improved, which will strengthen their quality and make a significant contribution to competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will also address regulatory excess in existing legislation. To get the best possible input to legislative simplification, we need to involve all stakeholders including SMEs. Based on their input we will draw up action plans for simplifying regulations per industrial sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is initiating a test phase for a common approach to measuring administrative costs in the EU, an issue of particular importance to SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this is all about access to EU programmes for SMEs. On 6 April, the Commission adopted its remaining proposals for the new financial perspectives. They included two instruments of significance to SMEs: the EUR 4.2 billion Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP), and the EUR 70 billion Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development.</p>
<p class="contents">The CIP is aimed fairly and squarely at SMEs. They will be the sole beneficiaries of the EUR 1 billion earmarked for the Community financial instruments and of the business and innovation support services, which will be provided through the European Union networks. SMEs will also be the primary beneficiaries of the entrepreneurial innovation activities. On the basis of experience of existing instruments, the Commission estimates that well over 70% of this competitiveness and innovation programme budget will be targeted to SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">To step up the involvement of SMEs in research and technological development, we will strive for increased SME participation also in the Seventh Framework Programme. Efforts are under way to simplify the programme's management, diminish the costs for submitting applications, reduce the delay to contract and secure more certainty for applicants. The proposed funds available for the programme, dedicated to SMEs, will be more than doubled in this framework programme, in comparison with the previous one. That will help SMEs with no or little research capacity to get input from research providers.</p>
<p class="contents">Collaborative research remains the core and bulk of the framework programme. The choice of the nine themes will favour SME participation.</p>
<p class="contents">On 16 April a new SME Envoy, Mrs Maive Ruth, was appointed. She is an official of the European Commission and will act as a contact point for SMEs, maintain a dialogue with SMEs and ensure that their interests are properly considered within all EU policies and programmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So at least they felt happy about what is coming out of the Commission so far.</p>
<p class="contents">I know work on this has already started, for example, the inventory to look at access regulation that exists. Within the framework programme there are given dates for what you can apply, etc. The whole approach and the whole message on SMEs has really been absorbed by the Commission and the way we work. This is extremely important. This is where new jobs should be created in the future: in the small- and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

<p class="contents">But there always has to be a balance between different interests. I know from discussing REACH, for example, how difficult this can be. But from the very beginning, when it came to regulating chemicals, we said that this should not hit small and medium-sized enterprises in an unbalanced way.

Since being elected, this House has set up an Intergroup on SMEs, and I would like to invite the Commission to appoint the representative with responsibility for SMEs as a permanent member of it, in order to keep them up to date with what is going on. We meet in Strasbourg on a Wednesday every other month. I ask you to pass on this invitation to Commissioner Verheugen and to ask him, at the July part-session, to give us more concrete examples of what you have been saying today. He may then be able to put things rather more in context. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
