<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lamy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the debate you have included on today’s agenda concerning the World Economic Forum and the World Social Forum gives me the opportunity to share with you, on behalf of the Commission, a few thoughts on these two events which took place recently in Davos and Porto Alegre respectively. I say thoughts rather than observations, because I personally did not take part in either one of these events due to a scheduled trip elsewhere in Brazil to make contact with the new Brazilian President and his government.</p>
<p class="contents">Much has been made of two opposing views of globalisation, which supposedly characterise these two fora. These two events, however, have many things in common. First of all, they were both created as places of thought and places of influence. They were also both created gradually in order to influence global economic and political development. Lastly, they are also both products of the globalisation that they feed, even though their views of what globalisation is and should be differ. Furthermore, these differences do not just exist between these two fora, but also within each one.</p>
<p class="contents">We at the Commission therefore feel that it would be a mistake to analyse these two events from the sole point of view of their differences, their opposition, their confrontation. It is also interesting to note that the main themes of each of these events also have something in common. At the World Social Forum, for example, the debates concerned world democratic order, antimilitarism and the promotion of peace. At Davos, the first theme discussed was ‘security and geopolitics’. The debate at Porto Alegre on what, there, were described as principles, values, human rights, diversity and equality is not entirely unrelated to what at Davos was called a debate on trust and values. Therefore, even if the terms used are different, there is, between these two conferences, a certain degree of convergence on the nature of a fair number of problems that affect our world. I would add that, this year, some people were even warmly welcomed in both fora. I am thinking in particular of the new President of Brazil, Mr Lula da Silva.</p>
<p class="contents">The Davos World Economic Forum clearly continues to attract an international elite, mainly from the world of business, but also from politics, the media, NGOs from now on, universities and religious groups. In quantitative terms, that represents 2000 participants and this is clearly a great deal less than the 100 000 people present at Porto Alegre, which actually attracted five times as many people as the last time this Forum was held, in 2001. As political leaders, we cannot fail to take seriously an expression of public opinion on this scale. This expression, in my opinion, reflects a deep feeling of dispossession felt by a significant number of citizens from every country of the world in the face of the globalisation process. There is a clear message behind all this movement: the citizens are telling us that they do not want to suffer globalisation. They want it to be regulated, they want it to be controlled, they want it to be monitored, they want it to be mastered. They want globalisation to be a project that integrates rather than divides the whole planet.</p>
<p class="contents">What is this globalisation of which we have spoken so much again this year at Porto Alegre and at Davos? First of all, globalisation is not a project, it is a movement, it is the product of the convergence of technological, economic and political processes, whose path is being mapped out more and more clearly before our eyes. I do not believe that there is a plot behind globalisation. There is a logic which is the one that dominates our world: market capitalism. The instability and injustice that were condemned both at Davos and Porto Alegre are one of the consequences of the effectiveness of this market capitalism. In the absence of world regulation and adequate internal policies, this injustice, this instability, this unpredictability are rising today, increasing inequality and widening, in a number of cases, the North-South divide, while continuing to threaten the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, our point of view in the Commission is clear. To those, on one side or the other, furthermore, who would have us choose between growth and justice, we would answer that we refuse to choose between growth and justice, or justice and growth. We need both. We must accept market globalisation, because it releases tremendous development potential. However, we must provide a global regulatory framework for it in order to ensure that this development will be fairer and more sustainable than it is at present. From that point of view, the multilateral negotiation instigated at Doha in November 2001, within the WTO, is in line with this dual objective of opening up the markets, on the one hand, and rules and the integration of the southern countries, on the other, while guaranteeing the latter increased access to the northern countries according to the degree of preferential treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">In a way, this global regulation is the synthesis that we are trying to achieve of Porto Alegre and Davos. This synthesis is difficult and painful. It is taking a while to establish for at least two reasons. The first is that it is coming up against powerful interests, as illustrated by the battle underway in Geneva over access for developing countries to essential medicinal products, which we will discuss again later on. The second is that regulation implies, if we are serious, a convergence of joint preferences on matters such as the environment, health, workers’ rights, the place of public services and cultural diversity. We know that, within Parliament itself, the discussions on this subject are sometimes heated. It is therefore easy to understand that addressing these subjects in order to find an international agreement is naturally going to be a long-term project. It is the task of organisations such as the World Labour Organisation, the FAO, the WTO and various standardisation bodies in the field of the environment, health and cultural diversity to reconcile free trade with respect for minimum standards.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore ensure that the multilateral system is developed, reinforced, and built more solidly, so that it allows countries to adapt differently to market capitalism. In this way, developing countries would be able to implement effective, heterodox strategies to catch up with other countries, in a number of cases, while we, the countries with more advanced economies, would be able to make swifter progress on the road to social justice and environmental protection. I feel that this is the message that has reached us here in Europe this year, from both Porto Alegre and Davos. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wonder why they met in parallel, and thousands of kilometres apart, rather than together. The European Parliament's debate today, with its joint discussion, gives a good example, as these two subject areas do not absolutely have to be in contradiction to each other. If we want to make use of the opportunities afforded by globalisation and to minimise its risks, we need to be prepared to think in an integrated way rather than score points off each other.</p>
<p class="contents">This combined approach is in line with the ecologically responsible market economy, which is our model for the political order. We are in favour of the market, but the market has its limits when it comes to the areas of social responsibility and environmental sustainability. This joint debate accords with the strategies we formulated in Lisbon and Barcelona, and with our principle that business creates work and that everything that creates work is society's business.</p>
<p class="contents">In his closing address, Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the UN, called for a war on poverty. We share the belief that globalisation must go hand in hand with great efforts at fighting poverty. Our resolution therefore lends weight to our endorsement of the goals of the United Nations' millennial declaration of war on poverty and calls on the Commission to submit an annual report to us on what progress has been made worldwide in the war on poverty and what contribution we have made to it.</p>
<p class="contents">We are drawing closer together. State borders, time zones, distance and size divide us less and less as time goes on. We are becoming ever more dependent on each other. We bear ever greater responsibility for each other in global terms. When others are stricken, we are affected. Globalisation is happening, and what matters is that we make good use of the opportunities with which it presents us and minimise its risks, across both hemispheres. This is where we need Europe to have more clout on the world stage. We need a world economic and social order that is fairer and more just. Issues relating to the global social and economic order are matters of European domestic policy in the same way as European policy is part of national domestic policy. We need Europe to be stronger and more determined.</p>
<p class="contents">Our continent has an answer to worldwide globalisation – that answer is Europe. We have to do our homework for ourselves. The Lisbon strategy is the right way ahead, but we have to turn from its lofty aims to the clear definition of specific objectives, laying down timetables and responsibilities. On our continent too, a place must be found for our common objectives in all government programmes and work programmes. That is why we emphasise the fact that the potential of the internal market has not yet been exhausted, that unemployment rates are too high and that we have to put all our efforts into reducing them here as much as anywhere else. We call on the Council to require every single Member State to undertake budgetary and economic reform along the lines recommended by the ECOFIN Council. Lisbon and the Internal Market are the tools we need in order to respond to globalisation and to discharge our obligations to the world at large.</p>

The events of recent months are not exactly cause for optimism in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as the strategic mantra of the Cold War was deterrence, that is, the threat of mutual destruction, now, within a plural and contradictory framework, it appears that the belief is arising that the dominant concept must, in a disturbed and dangerous world, which is increasingly insecure, be that of prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we are seeing a growing and increasingly visible conflict over the form effective prevention policies may take.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, we see the response of a form of globalisation resulting from deregulated market capitalism, the unilateral leadership of the strongest and the new doctrine of preventive, dissuasive military action and ad hoc coalitions.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we see increasingly large sectors with very opposing ideological positions, but which agree that, in view of the globalised world, the response must be a multilateral policy of democratic rules, global reforms and peace, particularly in view of the threat of terrorism, stating that what we essentially have to do is remove the sources of hate and humiliation in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that, in the face of this emergence of a world public opinion demanding reforms of globalisation, we need a realistic vision, broad consensus on reform and concrete and financially viable initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has a vital interest in this issue. It must exert a world influence and be fully aware of its global responsibilities. Its original raison d’être was peace, following the devastating wars of the twentieth century. Over the last fifty years, it has perhaps been the first effective supranational response to the challenges of globalisation. In order to pursue this development, we must establish ourselves as a global player, with a more united and powerful foreign policy, despite all the current difficulties, because these movements, this global civil society, is increasingly demanding a Europe, a united Europe, and we must not disappoint. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to put forward a few points on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is that there is still large-scale and persistent poverty in the developing countries despite all the developed world's pledges to halve poverty by 2015, and our good progress towards this has come to an end. As I see it, this is another area where there is a major role for the private sector. This is not about the major international concerns always transferring production to the countries where wages are lowest in order to reduce their production costs. This is about their consciously seeking partnerships with local firms and organisations. By investing in local trade and industry, by making sure that they make good social provision for their employees and that men and women receive fair wages, they can contribute a great deal to the fight against poverty. Corporate Social Responsibility is not only a splendid expression but also of fundamental importance. This must of course be exercised on a completely voluntary basis and from the bottom up. So I call on business too to be as socially responsible as possible when making investments. The ideal is that business at a national level should implement this in all its policy areas.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point that I want to make has to do with the importance of education in combating poverty. Here, too, the private sector can do its bit. By deliberately using their own know-how to support local vocational training, this sector can give the people a better education. In the long term, this will also be of benefit to their own personnel policy. In all this, I do not, of course, want to play down the part played by the developing countries' national governments and by the international community. Human rights must always be nurtured and promoted. These include good working conditions, along with democracy and good management, for which the developing countries' national governments are themselves responsible; they must take action themselves, even though the developed countries can give them support. Through constructive policies in their own countries, in which the environment and freedom of access for everyone to all the basic amenities, such as water and land, have a major part to play, they too can contribute to spreading prosperity on a fair basis.</p>
<p class="contents">It is to be hoped that the outcome of both forums will be that these points are taken on board, and then we will perhaps have a better chance of reducing poverty, if not by 50% by 2015, then by an amount not too far from that objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Miranda (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, I was able to be in Porto Alegre and can indeed confirm that the large number of participants, the diverse regional nature of these participants and of the organisations they represented and also the richness of the debates and of the proposals and conclusions drafted and adopted in the course of the work undertaken there on the main issues of the day established the World Social Forum as an unparalleled expression of social movements and, in general, of world civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Secretary-General of the United Nations quite rightly said, these factors confirmed the event especially as a crucial and undeniable milestone in the quest for solutions to the enormous challenges facing humanity today in the various plans put forward and also in creating a real alternative to the neo-liberal model.</p>
<p class="contents">Held once again in Brazil, but this time coinciding with the election and inauguration of President Lula da Silva as President of that country, and since he was one of the major driving forces of the World Social Forum, this event was, of course, influenced by these factors. These factors today represent new and more promising prospects, especially demonstrating a new attitude that represents a clear break with the status quo that has prevailed in recent times.</p>
<p class="contents">The need to give substance to a new world order of progress and peace, proclaimed by President Lula da Silva in Porto Alegre and also in Davos, was of course the central issue in Porto Alegre and probably represents the greatest challenge we face today. Consequently, and as was made clear there, the United Nations must be given a new boost and a new profile. It is also crucial to thoroughly change, reform and readjust basic methods and guidelines, in particular of some of the key instruments of the current world order such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, coming at a time when absurd US intervention is being planned for Iraq, the World Social Forum was able, clearly and in line with the will of the broad majority of world public opinion, unequivocally to affirm its rejection of such a war. Porto Alegre was not, therefore, by any stretch of the imagination, merely a critical counterpoint to Davos. In its three versions, it established itself as a fundamental pillar in the construction of a real alternative to the neo-liberal model that Davos broadly represented. This model is inextricably linked to the situations of social injustice, iniquity, division and crisis that we are seeing today. For this very reason and while Porto Alegre grows and is accepted, Davos, which is extremely elitist, is increasingly redundant and caught up in the contradictions inherent in the model it advocates and in the damaging effects it has.</p>
<p class="contents">Solutions to these crises were sought unsuccessfully in Davos, because there was no consideration and even less analysis of the underlying causes of this crisis. Attention was focused on economic growth, but the importance of the fair distribution of wealth that this growth should provide was overlooked. What was omitted in particular were the damaging effects that the primacy of the market causes, especially in terms of deepening the North-South divide, of increasing poverty in the world and of environmental degradation. It therefore comes as no surprise that President Lula da Silva’s speech in Davos should have caused such ripples. I hope that it does considerably more than this in future. As a matter of fact, in this context, I would say that the European Union can and must contribute to ensuring that it does. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Porto Alegre Forum took place against a backdrop of active opposition to and protest against the possible war with Iraq, and the Economic Forum in Davos discussed the future of the world in an atmosphere which one very authoritative commentator described as more regrettable than ever. I feel that, from this point of view, it is extremely significant that dialogue, which has thus far been greatly lacking between these two events, was represented by the presence of the Brazilian President, Mr Lula da Silva, who, in both cases, upheld the need for huge structural reform – the kind of reform that he has undertaken to carry out in his own country – of the world economic system, wholeheartedly condemning the empty principle of free trade at all costs, which only actually applies to the poor countries since the wealthy countries can afford to be protectionist whenever and however they want.</p>
<p class="contents">Not least for all those who firmly believe that the role of the Union on the international stage is not just to be a vassal but to endeavour to bring about democratic globalisation, it is clear that the election of President Lula da Silva and his government is cause for hope and huge expectations, as you will certainly have noticed, Commissioner Lamy, since you were in Brazil in the days immediately following Porto Alegre.</p>
<p class="contents">At Porto Alegre, the movements confirmed their mission to become a kind of outpost for an attentive, active world public opinion, and this was quite clear, not least to the 700 members of parliament who were present and agreed on an agenda which I feel is worthy of mention here. First and foremost, active opposition to the war: four members of the Brazilian Parliament took part in the much-criticised delegation to Iraq, and there was very broad support for the initiatives seeking to instigate parliamentary debates all over the world, in addition to the demonstrations due to take place on 15 February.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenge, however, which we feel to be particularly important for our institution and the European Union is the Cancún conference and reform of the international financial institutions. On this matter, unlike the situation as regards the question of Iraq, Europe does have some clout, and you, Commissioner Lamy, represent it with great authority. Europe can make a difference. What we are asking from you is simple and important: transparency, not least towards Parliament, in terms of the negotiations you conduct, and the possibility of open debate at least as regards basic decisions on investments, agriculture and the liberalisation of services. There is no need to shy away from this. We need to have the courage to uphold positions which are sometimes uncomfortable but which can make it quite clear that the European Union is not blindly following the lead of the United States but takes its responsibility towards the world seriously. For instance, Commissioner, please do not backtrack on the agreements you committed to at Doha on medicines and TRIPS. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will endeavour to go straight to the point. The point is that what we can do, what Europe can do to respond to the many undeniably rightful demands is fight on one particular front, the open, most sensitive front, for North-South relations, and to free, or create the conditions which make it possible to free, hundreds of millions of people from hunger and poverty. We must fight on the front of protectionism, starting with the slogans, with the many things which have been said even in this debate. When we say that the wealthy can indulge in protectionism in any event, we are saying something that is undeniably true, but we saw at Doha that, for the wealthy countries, protectionism means introducing social clauses, environmental clauses, talking about food safety and using these instruments – and we were reproached for this at Doha by Indonesia, Brazil and India – for protectionism.</p>
<p class="contents">‘Do not give us your milk, do not give us your agricultural products, please, because your giving us milk and wheat represents unfair competition for Peruvian farmers … Do what you are asking us to do: open up your markets … Open up your markets … trade means work. If we cannot market our products we will have more unemployed men and women.’ These were the words of the Peruvian President, Mr Toledo, to us a month and a half or two months ago in a formal sitting in this Chamber. We must respond. In this connection, I would like to take advantage of the presence of Commissioner Lamy to say that the modalities for the post-Doha agriculture trade round presented by the European Union do not go far enough. We must be bolder. We must not continue to let the United States carry off the prizes for genuine liberalisation of the agricultural markets. The United States adopted its Farm Bill last spring, sending out a lamentable signal of protectionism and farming subsidies – as they had done with respect to trade – with regard to its internal market, but, in the area of foreign trade, putting forward a proposal which goes much further than the European proposal. I believe that, on this matter, Europe must – if everything we are saying is true, if all the attention we are claiming to pay to the countries of the developing world where others are not is genuine – be much more courageous.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a practical political decision that we have to make, in the knowledge that there is a price for going against protectionism. Not everybody agrees that these are good principles: there will be opposition from the textiles lobby, the farmers lobby. Do we have the courage to do it or not? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe first of all that, as long as the crisis in connection with Iraq continues, it is difficult to talk about these two meetings and the globalisation debate as such. If no constructive solution can be found to that crisis, and preferably a non-violent solution, I believe that our debate on globalisation and the attempts to find constructive solutions to a series of constituent problems will be damaged for a long time to come.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate has gone on for no more than approximately ten years. I amused myself the other day by looking up the word ‘globalisation’ in a dictionary from the beginning of the 1990s. It was not even to be found, so this is a relatively new debate. Nonetheless, we can see how it goes in different phases. What I take to be the message from both Davos and Porto Alegre is that what is now before us is incredibly important and interesting, namely to try more clearly to define the rules and the framework within which we must live for the foreseeable future. It is hardly a case of being in favour of, or against, a market economy. Rather, it is a question of which rules and which frameworks are to apply in the market economy that has now largely spread throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite obviously, there are a number of deficiencies and problems at present. Allow me to address a couple of issues. First of all, poverty and the situation of the poorest countries. It is hard to see how many of today’s poorest countries are to be able to hold their own in the evermore knowledge-oriented economy that is being developed. Trade is important, of course. I agree that we can do a lot to make things easier for the poorest countries, especially in the areas of agriculture and textiles. That is something we must do, too, but, in the case of countries that have almost nothing but raw materials to offer on the market, it is difficult to see their being able in the long term to provide themselves with a stable foundation if we do not, in a quite different way, help them to develop and build up their capacity. Factors as far back in the process as research and research institutions have a role to play in training and the development of trade and industry etc. As the trade system operates at present, with a number of countries entirely dependent upon raw materials which, moreover, have fallen in price, the situation is coming to resemble a boxing match between a heavyweight and a lightweight boxer. I believe we must adopt a quite different and much more generous approach to this area when it comes to issues of capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">A second issue is the whole set of problems in connection with the environment. As long ago as at the Rio Conference, it was observed that current patterns of production and consumption are not sustainable in a world with six, seven or perhaps eight billion people living at approximately our level. The solution is not, of course, to hold back development in the poor countries. Rather, it must be to develop completely new technologies. Commissioner, I am afraid that we are doing much too little to try to help promote technological advance in the poor countries. This is an area in which we could do very much more. There is no reason whatsoever why, when it comes to energy production, transport, chemicals, agriculture and waste management, all these poor countries should have to go through exactly the same phases as we ourselves have done in our own development. It must be possible to give an impetus to technological advance in a quite different way, but then that would also require more in the way of targeted aid in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">These are just a couple of proposals for giving some focus to this debate on globalisation and its framework, rules and basic conditions. In conclusion, I want to argue that Europe and the EU that is now developing in relation to the Convention must adopt a strong leading role in this area if we are to obtain constructive development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Désir (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, some of us did, in fact, go to Porto Alegre. What we saw there was thousands of citizens, trade-unionists, representatives of non-governmental organisations and women’s movements debating and advancing analyses and proposals to change globalisation, its rules and its institutions. From that point of view, Porto Alegre III is no longer simply the anti-Davos demonstration that Porto Alegre I was. These are citizens disputing and rejecting the inevitability of a globalisation devoted to increasing the wealth of the wealthiest, to leaving the poorest on the touchline and destroying the environment. They reject globalisation with institutions and rules that are strong and inflexible when it comes to defending the economic and commercial interests of the powerful and their businesses but weak when it comes to defending social rights, upholding the Kyoto protocol or combating tax havens. This is therefore a highly legitimate protest even in terms of the principles and values of the European Union. Above all, it is an attempt to impose globalised solidarity, or responsible globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, Commissioner, I do not believe we can say that the choice is between growth and justice, in which case it is, of course, easy for you to say that the Commission does not pit the two against each other. I believe the choice is rather between growth of profit alone and justice, on the one hand, the growth of speculative bubbles, the ‘Enron’ economy and, on the other, more redistributive growth that takes account of social inclusion: an economy at the service of mankind. It is a choice between the commodification of all activities, natural resources and genes and, on the other hand, the ideal of access for all people to the world’s public goods, to water, health, medicinal products, energy, education and public services.</p>
<p class="contents">These concerns expressed at Porto Alegre, to which we should add cancelling the debt, reforming the international institutions and peaceful conflict resolution are effectively, in principle, concerns that the European Union has at heart for promotion on the international stage. We must therefore consider this movement as supporting us in our endeavours because, just as we cannot change a society at country level without the support of social movements, so we cannot transform globalisation without the support of this global civil society. It represents great hope because it is not based on people only considering themselves, their own nation, their own ethnic group or their own religious group, but, on the contrary, the establishment of new rules on a global scale. It therefore represents hope. We still need to be equal to the questions raised by this movement in relation to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall cite three examples. Firstly, Europe often prides itself on providing the most public aid for development (55% globally). That is true but, at the same time, our agricultural subsidies are ruining agriculture in the southern countries and, in particular, small farmers. What are we going to do to change this, to promote food security and self-sufficiency? Secondly, the arrival of Mr Lula da Silva in power in Brazil has inspired great hope but the IMF is imposing on him an annual budgetary excess of 3.75%. What are we going to do to loosen the IMF’s vice-like grip on Mr Lula? We are part of the IMF. Furthermore, we have more votes there than the US. Thirdly, as regards public services, there is much protest against the privatisation imposed by the IMF in the developing countries. Today, through the WTO and GATS, these countries are sorry to see that we, the European Union, are asking them to liberalise water, postal services and even energy. Commissioner, are you, in order to respond to this global civil society and the hopes of the southern countries, going to change the demands of the European Union so that, in Cancun, we might say that Europe is genuinely on the side of those who want a different kind of globalisation? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The venues for each were also symbolic: the Economic Forum met in the ski resort of Davos, the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre, in the midst of a continent in full-blown economic crisis. Yet, in my view, opinions do not have to be so sharply divided. It is unfair simply to equate globalisation with an unbridled cross-border capitalism that is to the advantage only of multinationals. Those who were called anti-globalists have themselves understood this, and now call themselves alternative globalists. I think that general free trade still always offers the best guarantee of economic growth in all parts of the world, even in the poorest. The European Union is the best example of this. The thoroughgoing economic integration of Europe by means of the internal market and the opening up of our internal borders have already made it possible for us to live in what is at present one of the wealthiest parts of the world. It is this unique model of true globalisation that we have to take out into the wider world. There is certainly no way back. As the European Union, we have an important part to play in this debate. We must endeavour to bring the speakers at Davos and Porto Alegre together in an attempt to persuade them that liberalising world trade is an equitable way of improving living standards and bringing greater prosperity to the whole world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Davos, it was discussed because of the effects of the economic situation of the war against Iraq that the United States and its allies have decided on. Without denying the disastrous effects on the world economy of the militaristic decisions of George Bush, what was at the heart of the proposals made in Porto Alegre against the war and in favour of peace were the serious political and humanitarian issues raised by the United States’ aggression.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a situation in which ultraliberal capitalism, which can be seen as the domination of globalisation by the most powerful States and the huge multinational corporations, is leading the world towards disaster. Especially today, we are on the brink of a humanitarian disaster in Iraq, causing the death of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people, amongst the poorest and most needy members of Iraqi society, especially young people, with the United States counting on the complicity and action of its European allies.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we must remember that the governments of the United States and of some Member States of the Union, against the beliefs and wishes of the majority of European citizens, are reaching the point where they are calling into question the model of European political integration that brings with it the awareness of another form of globalisation, which is more human and egalitarian and which demonstrates greater solidarity. The United States even want to destroy the idea of a constitutional political Europe with an independent role in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The other issue I wish to raise, Mr President, concerns international maritime traffic, the safety of our seas and of our coastal communities. The World Parliamentary Forum presented this problem as one of the main concerns of the ‘old world’ school of thought. The European Union must attach priority to resolving this problem, which today particularly affects Galicia and other European countries, from the Spanish State to France. The sea represents life itself. We cannot allow it to be owned and contaminated by a greedy, irresponsible and corrupt form of capitalism that enjoys the complicity of some European States. I therefore hope that the European States and this Parliament take the decisions that are needed to prevent the destruction of the sea that gives us life and sustains us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not in Davos, which uncritically embraces globalization, which focuses only on economic growth, which concentrates its attention on the creation of wealth, which supports US foreign policy and which acts as spokesman for corporations and for States. Nor however, was the truth to be found at Porto Alegre, which demonises globalisation, which is only interested in improving social and environmental policies, which focuses on wealth redistribution models, which openly declares itself to be anti-American and which acts as spokesman for NGOs and the unions.</p>
<p class="contents">Davos without Porto Alegre makes no sense and the same applies to Porto Alegre without Davos. The two complement one another and need to work on reconciling their approaches. This reconciliation is now to be found in Rio de Janeiro, in Johannesburg, in Lisbon and in Gothenburg. In the face of globalisation, which has brought undeniable economic and technological advantages but which has also heightened the visible imbalance in the world, it makes little sense to proclaim its end, mainly because it is unstoppable. The challenge is to regulate globalisation, taking sustainable development as the model to pursue.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think it is important, first of all, to have international sustainable development policies that assess social, environmental and economic performance, as we will be doing at the forthcoming Spring Summit. Secondly, we must embark on ‘greening’ the world economy. Today, producing ‘green’ is not sufficiently competitive and consuming ‘green’ is still a luxury. We must take action on prices by adding on the environmental costs of all products. This involves eliminating environmentally unsustainable policies, it involves eliminating trade barriers, it involves analysing products throughout their life cycle, and it involves changing consumer and production standards to ensure that we break the link between economic growth and the degradation of resources. Thirdly, international governance must be given a boost by reforming institutions such as the World Trade Organisation, the World Bank and the Bretton Woods rules and by creating new institutions such as a World Environment Organisation. A new institutional blueprint is crucial if we are to be able to put the tools provided by globalisation at the service of sustainable development</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have taken part in both forums and know what I am talking about – in Davos, around twenty years ago, when I was Prime Minister of Portugal and had to negotiate hard for a loan from the International Monetary Fund. In Porto Alegre, I have taken part for the two last years as a Member of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The last Social Forum, which took place last January, was particularly significant, as has already been said, for the number of participants, around 100 000, who had come from all over the world, it was significant for the around 1 500 NGOs and other civic associations that were present and, above all, for the quality of the speeches. Incidentally, it was not only the World Social Forum that took place in Porto Alegre: there were also other forums such as the World Forum of Judges, the Local Authorities Forum, the World Education Forum, the World Independent Media Forum, and the World Parliamentary Forum.</p>
<p class="contents">This World Forum in Porto Alegre gave rise to a new sociological phenomenon: global citizenship, which means people getting together as part of a network, freely and regardless of their political parties or religious or secular affiliations and fighting, in a peaceful and orderly way, for their rights and for what they consider to be fair. This is an important civic and participatory form of activism, which will continue on every continent with the meeting of various regional forums, since the next World Social Forum will be held in India.</p>
<p class="contents">This year, the Porto Alegre World Forum was attended by a unique personality, the recently elected President of the Republic of Brazil, Luís Inácio ‘Lula’ da Silva. In his extremely coherent speech to a crowd of hundreds of thousands of listeners, he explained to the Forum why he had accepted an invitation to attend, following the Porto Alegre Forum, the Davos Economic Forum, which some of his supporters found hard to understand. It was not so hard to understand, however: Lula explained to the audience of politicians, businessmen and experts gathered at Davos, and I quote ‘that his war was different; it was the fight against hunger and poverty, for access to better education, against diseases and epidemics such as AIDS, not the war against Iraq or to call for higher rates of growth at the expense of unemployment and of greater poverty’. Curiously and paradoxically, his speech, which was the same at both forums, was characterised by sincerity and truthfulness, and perhaps this is why it was applauded so loudly in Davos, considerably more than Colin Powell when he defended the inevitability of the war against Iraq. Even when they are defending interests, people also have a conscience and this is what drives the world forwards, even in these current troubled times. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Greens, like Mr Désir and a few others, we who were behind the Porto Alegre parliamentary forum, are delighted to learn that alterglobalisation is beginning to find an echo among you.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that President Lula has, indeed, taken the right step, because he came to present first to Porto Alegre what he was going to defend in Davos, in other words, the reconstruction of a fairer economic order. I feel that this democratic, socially aware, political move is a step along the right road: civil society should have its say first and then the decision-makers of the global economy. Market capitalism cannot continue to be the dominant form of politics. I would remind you – even if this is perhaps a sophism – that democracy and politics normally take precedence over economic considerations. It is vital to prove this, as that would also make it possible to avoid a pre-emptive war such as that proposed by the Bush government, which is largely subservient to multinationals which have a far greater need for oil than for ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, these same multinationals want at all costs to reappropriate sustainable development and the common goods belonging to all mankind such as water, air and energy. It seems to me, however, that in Cancun, Commissioner, you should help us to defend our idea of globalisation. It is right that we should concern ourselves with current GATS negotiations, because they represent quite a risk, and it is right that the southern States should know that we support them with regard to each individual’s right to food, drinking water and breathable air. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Business resources and entrepreneurship combined with the know-how, skills and legitimacy of the rest of civil society can provide lasting solutions to the problems of globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The average cow in the OECD countries receives two euros every day in state aid, while more than two billion people live on less than two euros a day. More than a billion people have to get by on less than one euro a day. That is such a small sum of money that it does not even meet the basic requirements of international human and fundamental rights. The right to life cannot be separated from the right to food, water, health services or work, and the right to have an opinion cannot be separated from the basic rights of a civilised society. These rights are what the economy is built on. Human rights are not a luxury which we can afford only when the economy is growing: they are a necessary prerequisite for companies’ viability and stability.</p>
<p class="contents">In Russia, for example, conditions for business cannot improve significantly without some fundamental adjustments being made in the implementation of human rights and in the law. At present in Russia it is possible to solve problems informally with reference to arbitrary, unwritten and ever-changing laws, which only adds to corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore in the interest of companies too to be involved in the implementation of human and fundamental rights. One way is participation in the UN Global Compact. Under this scheme first proposed four years ago at Davos by Secretary-General Kofi Annan, a company commits itself to nine simple basic principles in the area of human rights, labour standards and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in the EU a framework for the social responsibility of companies has been promoted, but alongside voluntary action we need binding legislation. We should show up those companies operating in the EU, which either here or elsewhere have contributed directly or indirectly to human and fundamental rights violations, by naming and shaming them. In addition, we should develop suitable sanctions to impose on companies which are guilty of, or have contributed to, human rights violations and corruption outside the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Businesses ultimately have enormous influence whatever the community, region or state they are located in. The day business genuinely decides to fight against corruption and human rights violations is the day globalisation will mean and consist of something quite different from what it does at the present time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Davos, where the elite were to meet, against Porto Alegre, where popular opinion would meet.</p>
<p class="contents">The theory is now belied by the facts. While the Davos Forum seems to be unsure of itself and on the defensive, the global social movement, that of the citizens, meeting in Porto Alegre, does not hesitate to enter into the dysfunctional world of the elite of Davos and the strength of its proposals is based on civil public force.</p>
<p class="contents">In the face of environmental deterioration, the NGOs that take part in the forum propose the internationalisation of environmental protection and universal sustainable development. In the face of the exploitation which often results from a market economy with no restrictions, the trade unions propose the globalisation of social rights, in particular through universal respect for the seven fundamental work standards laid down by the ILO. In the face of unilateralism and the return to the policy of pre-emptive war, the World Social Forum proposes global political and social mobilisation in favour of peace.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the WTO and GATS trade rounds, the Social Forum outlines the territory of universal public goods and declares them world common heritage: water, health, energy and culture are thus included in the list of inalienable rights. Lastly, in the face of the flagrant inequality with regard to hunger, it was proposed in Porto Alegre to implement better global redistribution of wealth, in particular through cancelling the debt, but also through taxing capital transfers for the benefit of development.</p>
<p class="contents">At Porto Alegre, in the face of the discredited image of Europe that the United States wants to disseminate everywhere, another Europe was also discussed, a Europe about whose shortcomings we have no illusions but which many envy us, a Europe that is a model of successful integration.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the specific proposals arising from the Porto Alegre Social Forum, where only popular opinion meets, Commissioner. I am sorry. The main question remains, however: how will we in the European Union, in the Commission, receive these proposals? Could we imagine, more broadly speaking, that these hopes might be included in our European political agenda for another kind of globalisation, our kind of globalisation? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It outlined a range of constructive proposals for world policies on the environment, peace and freedom of expression and combating hunger and disease. It is particularly important that the European Parliament should take into consideration what was said at the Forum regarding the forthcoming World Trade Organisation meeting in Cancún. We know that an agreement on services is planned, but we do not yet know which services will be covered by the agreement and made subject to the rules of free international trade. The Forum and, I believe, Parliament’s concern is the possibility that the services to be liberalised might include certain essential social services such as education or health and certain essential public commodities such as water. Any subjection of such services to market rules would be a breach of the fundamental rights enshrined in the Nice Charter and other formal international treaties. The Commission must give Parliament prior notice of the list which it intends to propose and uphold in Cancún, so that it can assess it and express the views of the European citizens on these extremely sensitive issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The Forum also recognised and welcomed enthusiastically the possibility that the European Union should become a model for other structures of supranational and regional democratic governance, first and foremost as a means of limiting conflict and establishing peace. From this particular perspective, it is no coincidence that the Porto Alegre Forum was held in Brazil and that President Lula da Silva has now intervened. Indeed, not only can the European Union become the model for a similar political initiative in Latin America, but its very existence and independent international structure will benefit from a decisive boost in a world in which, thanks, not least, to President Lula da Silva and Latin America, multipolarity is developing, although that multipolarity is currently under great threat from the intention of the United States and some of its most faithful allies to declare war on Iraq unilaterally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would be preferable not to have two opposing fora – one economic and one social, one governmental and one civil – each calling for completely different political orientations for the future. In Porto Alegre, local authorities, members of parliament, trade unions, non-governmental organisations, judges and teachers proposed – perhaps idealistically – that another world is possible, and not just possible, but necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">In Davos, directors of multinational companies and ministers concluded that the key elements for the new world economic agenda are the real value of companies in view of the volatility of their share values, trade as a fundamental instrument for sustainable development and the principles to govern the activities of the multinationals. In other words, the distance between the citizens and the people with real power is only increasing. During these two minutes, I will just give a couple of examples: in Davos there were references to AIDS, but there was no reference to the need for pharmaceutical laboratories, whose investments in advertising and marketing are double their investments in research, to open up their patents to developing countries. Another example: it is considered that commerce is an important factor in development but there is no reference to reciprocity in the opening up of markets. The protectionism of the rich countries, including the European Union’s agricultural policy, has a negative impact on development.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, Commissioner, that Europe must be a model for reducing the distance between each position. The economic order promoted in Davos must be accompanied by a social and political order such as that called for in Porto Alegre. The participation of European parliamentarians in Porto Alegre is a good symptom, but the European Union’s partnership with citizens’ movements must go further. We urge the Community’s institutions to join in with global campaigns on access to water, agriculture, food safety and public services. We also ask the Commission to support the creation of a world fund to combat hunger and poverty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first are Mr Karas and Mr Obiols i Germà, who both, in a way, asked us the same question: is it possible to seek, on a global scale, this domestication, this capitalist government that Europe has cultivated on its own soil for over 200 years? Could this social market economy with which you all, with very few exceptions, credit Europe, be a project for the world?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the response could be affirmative. This could be our response, with a certain number of conditions. The first is accepting that sustainability in the economic, social and environmental sense can be a genuine common project, and it is that sustainability that is the real basis for stability and security. If we agree on the first point, the second condition to be met is undoubtedly to form alliances on this subject with other parties in the world, and I find the concept of global public goods mentioned by Mrs Zrihen and Mr Désir interesting in that respect. Then, clearly, the third condition is to succeed in providing our planet with the system of governance it needs. Undoubtedly that system will have to be more comprehensive than the measure available to us today, which is both partial and unbalanced. On this point, I agree with what both Mr Miranda and Mr Moreira Da Silva said.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear from the wording of all these conditions that this is unlikely to take place without a Europe that is more solid, more united and more involved than today’s Europe. In any case, that is what I think I understood on hearing Mrs Frassoni’s statements and, on this point, the Commission agrees. Much remains to be done, as Mr Désir said with regard to the IMF proposal, and I agree with him on that point, even if his interpretation of the WTO’s General Agreement on Trade in Services continues to pose us a few problems here or there. However, that is a discussion that I will also have to have with Mrs Auroi and a number of others. Much clearly remains to be done, and I believe that the consideration of the current geopolitical situation, whether in terms of Iraq or the Middle East, reminds us, if this were necessary, that the objective of a common foreign and security policy – which is inextricably linked to the projects that you would like Europe to implement in the field of globalisation – is still a long way off.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now speak on a number of more specific points. I agree with Mrs Sanders-ten Holte and Mrs Korhola about the importance of companies’ social responsibility. Private initiatives might come from the world of business to achieve better management of globalisation, just as, furthermore, there might be citizens’ initiatives on what President Suarez called citizen and social mobilisation. This is proven, in particular, by fair trade and by consumer movements in favour of labelling that is environmentally friendly or promotes better social conditions for production. We are quite aware that, in these areas, nothing will be done without mobilising society itself.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the role and intervention of the parliaments and democratic control, Mrs Frassoni, you are aware of the Commission’s position on the place that this House, this Parliament, should occupy in this kind of debate, particularly where multilateral trade issues are concerned. We would refer you to the Convention, which once again must rule on this point. Let us hope that, on this point as on others, the Convention will be more productive than the last intergovernmental conference.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall not dwell on agricultural issues. We will come back to them in the debate that is to follow.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the technological gap to be overcome, Mr Wijkman, you are correct, and I believe that we in the Commission agree on the fact that our public aid to development should, in a number of cases, be reoriented or reviewed.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the service industry, the Commission’s proposals are now on the table. Your Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy may take them up under the conditions of our institutional agreement. These same proposals are also on the table of the Council of Ministers. Thus, the time for public debate has begun, and I personally am delighted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
