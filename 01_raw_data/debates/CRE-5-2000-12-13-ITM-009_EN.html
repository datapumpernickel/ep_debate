The Commission sees, therefore, no indication that the announced measure introduces direct discrimination on the basis of the nationality of the haulier or the origin or destination of the vehicle. Provided that the implementation aspects of the charge in question do not introduce indirect discrimination either and they respect all other relevant specific rules governing the introduction of user charges in the European Union, such a charge seems at this stage to be in line with current Community law, that is Directive 1999/62/EC.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive, adopted by unanimity in 1993, laid down the conditions under which Member States could, if they wanted, apply time-related user charges or motorway tolls. The overall aim of this legislation was the elimination of distortions of competition through the establishment of fair mechanisms for charging infrastructure costs to hauliers and the harmonisation of levy systems within the EU internal market. Twelve of the 15 Member States have already adjusted their levy systems with more emphasis put on direct charging, user charges or motorway tolls and less on taxes. The Commission considers that such adjustments go in the right direction towards the establishment of fairer charging systems which give also an incentive for a more rational and efficient use of the road network. The measures announced by the UK signal such a readjustment of their charging system. The Commission is following closely the development of the UK scheme in order to ensure its full compatibility with EU general principles and specific legislation. The UK government has confirmed it is in the process of preparing its reply to the Commission's request for detailed information on the entire package of measures planned in the UK. The Commission will then analyse and evaluate those measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Depending on the outcome of this analysis, the Commission will decide what course of action to take next in view of fulfilling its role to assist Member States to take the measures which are right for them and at the same time respect the rights of the others. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My understanding is that in making the announcement the British ministers stated quite clearly that this was a tax on foreign lorries and foreign hauliers. The supplementary question I would like to ask is: Is it, in the Commissioner's opinion, in accordance with European law that a haulier, fully taxed and compliant with the legislation of their own country, may not drive across the border into a neighbouring state? I live in a part of the Union where in order to move from part of the state to another it is necessary to drive through the United Kingdom. So is it acceptable that a vehicle may be stopped at the border of a neighbouring Member State if they comply with all the legal requirements in their own country?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: If, as the minister originally intended, he proposes to put a tax on foreign lorries to subsidise hauliers of his own nationality, is that contrary to European law? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I thought mine and this would be coupled together but apparently that is not the procedure in this House. I thank Mr Monti for his reply. I take some reassurance from it because reading between the lines I think he is getting the message.</p>
<p class="contents">Could I ask him whether he is aware that the announcement made by the British Chancellor on 8 November stated specifically – if he needs copies of the press release we can ensure he gets them – that this haulier ‘Brit-tax’ as we call it, was for foreign or non-British hauliers? The point is that it was to placate the irate British hauliers who were protesting at fuel prices in Britain. Subsequently I asked the Commission if it was aware of this. That was changed in the face of criticism, especially from Ireland and France, and a different spin has now been put on it by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer: it is now being portrayed as a user charge for all, including British lorry drivers. I am sure in an election year in Britain their own lorry drivers would be interested to know that they have an extra £1 500 a year to pay on top of their taxes. Would any attempt to rebate the British hauliers the equivalent be contrary to intra-Community trade? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope you will understand this and I can only refer back to the elements I gave in the reply provided a few minutes ago.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to the honourable Member who asked how the structure of the charging system in the UK affects competition in the road haulage sector, perhaps I could add that at the moment British hauliers pay road-tolls or user charges – "<span class="italic">vignettes</span>" – when travelling in other countries such as France or Belgium, while at the same time they pay at home high vehicle taxes through which they contribute towards the infrastructure costs of the road network in Britain. On the other hand non-British hauliers pay nothing when travelling in Britain. They therefore do not contribute at all towards road infrastructure costs in Britain and at the same time pay lower vehicles taxes at home. This imbalance of an economic nature between the charges and taxes imposed on hauliers in different Member States distorts the conditions under which hauliers of different nationalities compete in the UK. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition, the Scientific Steering Committee is carrying out an assessment of the geographical BSE risk of individual third countries, on which the results are expected in the first half of 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">Policy towards imports from third countries will be decided in the light of this assessment. I have recently visited Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic where I have underlined the necessity to be vigilant in regard to the risk of BSE. I am committed to ensuring that the food consumers have available, whether it comes from within or outside the European Union, meets the highest standards. The Community has several mechanisms to protect the health of consumers with regard to the safety of food imports from third countries. The Food and Veterinary Office performs on-the-spot inspections and audits in third countries to verify that exports from these countries meet the EU's animal and public health requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, Council Directive 97/78 of 18 December 1997 lays down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries. Under this directive third country exports of meat are subject to systematic checks at the Community's external frontier to ensure that Community requirements have been respected. The Commission is also conscious of the necessity to ensure that exports from the European Union to third countries do not constitute a risk to food safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Having said that, there are, of course, different instruments for different purposes, and in the Community legal order, the Merger Regulation has the very limited, and yet important enough, objective of ensuring the protection of competition in the interests ultimately of consumers on the occasion of mergers. I do not believe that it would be appropriate to aim at more than one objective through a single instrument. The Merger Regulation is a powerful tool to ensure that the interests of consumers are protected when companies combine their activities. Its efficiency should therefore not be hindered by adding other objectives of a complex nature that are difficult to assess and that would at any rate not be effectively served by this specific legal instrument.</p>

However, among the various actions proposed, it committed itself to examine as soon as possible the possibilities to propose measures to address the Korean problem in accordance with the Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">At its meeting of 29 November, the Commission reaffirmed that it is against any prolongation of operating aid. However, it indicated that it is ready to explore the possibilities for greater use of national support for research and development, including appropriate changes to Regulation 1540/98. The Commission also recalled that substantial funding for research and development is available under the Community research framework programme. As regards trade actions, on 2 December the Commission published its decision to open an investigation following industry's complaint under the Trade Barriers Regulation (TBR). In the context of this TBR procedure, the Commission can decide to resort to WTO dispute settlement procedure unless a mutually satisfactory solution is agreed with the authorities of the Republic of Korea. The final investigation report will be transmitted to Member States by April 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, if in the framework of the TBR procedure the Commission does not achieve a negotiated solution with Korea satisfactory for the European Union, the Commission will report to the Council by 1 May 2001 and will propose to bring the case to the WTO in order to seek remedy against unfair Korean practices. In addition, the Commission will, at the same time, propose a defensive temporary support mechanism, specifically designed to counter unfair Korean practices for a period necessary for the conclusion of the WTO procedure. This mechanism will be limited to those market segments where it has been demonstrated that EU industry has been directly injured by unfair Korean trade practices.</p>
<p class="contents">On a multilateral level, the Commission will pursue its efforts to establish a level international playing field for the shipbuilding industry within the OECD.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's position was presented to the Industry Council on 5 December and the Council welcomed the Commission's determination to tackle the problem of unfair Korean competition and took note of the Commission's proposals in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The WTO will condemn – it must condemn – the unfair competition on the part of Korea.</p>

As a result of the investigations, it was concluded that there is no doubt about the dumping and the damage it causes and that the effect of the anti-dumping measures on the user industries would be limited.</p>
<p class="contents">Particular attention has been paid to the issue of employment. Coke-using industry employs a total of 70 000 people, but this product represents only a very marginal portion of its costs, in the region of 2%. It has also been established that the coke-using industry was able to pass on a moderate increase in its prices to its clients. There are therefore unlikely to be harmful effects on employment and competition in the coke-using industry.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard, however, to the coke industry itself, which directly employs 1 900 people in coke production, the situation has deteriorated to such an extent, due to dumping on the part of the Chinese, that site closures are now envisaged.</p>
<p class="contents">The increase in prices which would result from the anti-dumping measures should enable the coke industry to become profitable again. In the light of all the arguments presented, it has therefore been concluded that imposing anti-dumping measures was in the general and overall interests of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the investigations into dumping do not consider the environmental aspect, which should, however, be considered in the wider context, I should like to point out that Community environmental legislation sets emission limits which must be respected both by producers and by the user industry, whatever the origin of the coke. So, whether the coke is from China or elsewhere, the environmental consequences are the same.</p>
<p class="contents">This investigation has been carried out according to the usual procedure. I believe it to be fair and transparent, and all the arguments put forward by the user industry have, as usual, been duly taken into account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission’s proposed regulation which we have designated ‘Everything but arms’ is designed to give least and less developed countries access to the Community market, duty-free and quota-free, for all exports except for arms.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal, which follows on from the multiple commitments made by the Community in favour of least and less developed countries, is aimed at promoting the integration of these countries into the world economy. We think that it is, indeed, imperative that the process of globalisation should not cause the poorest developing countries to become marginalised.</p>
<p class="contents">This initiative is based upon a Council regulation amending the regulation which defines the current GSP. The Commission’s proposal is based upon Article 133 which, as you know, does not at present lay down any legal obligation to consult Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I entirely agree that this proposal is an important decision which should be subject to the codecision procedure. That is what the Commission proposed to the Intergovernmental Conference. In tabling its proposal, which was fully supported by Parliament, the Commission envisaged having recourse to the codecision procedure in the case of all standards of general scope, such as this one, defining the essential features of common trade policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The result has now been obtained and you know as well as I do that the Intergovernmental Conference has not taken up this suggestion, since no Member State supported it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot contravene current Treaty rules. Consulting Parliament on this proposal and taking account of arguments which Parliament might be led to put forward is therefore a political decision which, as the texts currently stand, is solely at the Council’s discretion. Out of a concern to ensure effective political scrutiny by Parliament, I have however made efforts to keep the European Parliament informed as far as possible. In particular, I informed your Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy of this initiative on 11 October 2000, and I am of course prepared to appear again before Parliament’s relevant committee in order to discuss this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Glenys Kinnock’s question concerning the link between this initiative and the Cotonou agreement, I should like to say again that the Commission entirely respected the spirit and the letter of the provisions of this agreement when it came to informing and consulting the ACP countries. We forwarded our proposal to the ACP countries at practically the same time as to our Member States. We invited the ACP countries to begin consultations. These consultations were conducted within the framework of the ACP sub-committee for commercial cooperation which met on 21 November 2000. The Member States intimated that they would like the Commission to present a more detailed impact assessment before taking a decision. The assessment is under way and the results will be communicated to the ACP countries as soon as they are available. Obviously, the real impact of the initiative in favour of the least and less developed countries will depend upon their ability to respond, something which is extremely difficult to foresee and to model.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore prepared to monitor the effects of this initiative and its results very carefully and to examine, if need be together with the ACP States, the measures which might be required in order to preserve their competitive position in the Community’s markets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Would you confirm, Commissioner, that the Coreper GSP Working Group has been postponed for the second time? Is that because they are waiting for a revised proposal from you and for the impact studies?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, you talked about the spirit of Cotonou being honoured. That is not the view of the ACP trade ministers who met this week, who said that they would expect the European Commission to honour existing agreements. What they feel, Commissioner, is that Cotonou was very carefully negotiated by the ACP and that within five months, almost before the ink is dry, there are proposals without any consultation. Of course, you had consultation after the event, but not before, which is part of the agreement under Cotonou, as you know, as is the need for joint impact studies to be undertaken.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Commissioner, would you agree with me that vulnerable small island economies, particularly of course in the Caribbean, who are dependent on certain commodities like bananas, sugar and rice, should deserve to be a special case? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that the price of sugar in the European Union is now three times higher than on the world market. This does indeed present a problem. I should like, moreover, to reassure you that this initiative is not designed to solve that problem, given that the additional amounts which might be imported into the Community market are so small. In fact, it is a question of authorising access to greater quantities which are small as far as we are concerned, and therefore not destabilising, but which represent large amounts for these countries, given the size of their economies. The initiative is not therefore of a kind which will destabilise the highly protected Community sugar market. If need be, we shall include the necessary precautions in the amendments we are working on.</p>
<p class="contents">This ties in with Mrs Kinnock’s question. We are in fact working on a number of amendments with a view to making this proposal acceptable both to the Council and to Parliament. We are working on these in committee, but no decisions were taken on the matter this week, as Poul Nielson was absent on a visit to the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Mrs Kinnock, I am aware of the difficult situation facing small islands. We shall ensure, by means of safeguard clauses or transitional periods, that these proposals do not have too serious an impact upon these regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would thank Mrs Kinnock for informing me about the work of the meeting of ACP Trade Ministers which took place in Brussels this week. I was present at the meeting and broached this issue with the ministers who, following the meeting, voted for a resolution favourable to the Commission’s initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These funds can be allocated by means of the commitment appropriation under budget item B7-663 in the budget for the year 2000. One of the four organisations is ECPAT, whose measures in this area during 2001, which are eligible for aid, are wholly covered by this application.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's procedure for granting the desired financial support will soon be complete, and this also includes the funds which ECPAT requires for 2001. As from 2001 it is the Commission's intention to finance actions against sex tourism by implementing the on-going programmes against child sex tourism. Programmes like Stop and Daphne have been earmarked by the Commission to allow child sex tourism to be fought as a form of sexual exploitation of children and violence against children in the candidate countries too. In addition, specific projects financed within the framework of the European Union's policy for development and external relations can also relate to work in the fight against child sex tourism in countries outside the European Union. These different instruments are also open to organisations like ECPAT and their partners in the countries concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These new legal powers, however, require a change in the European Treaty. A few days ago, the European Council took a positive decision to this effect in Nice. A new article in the Treaty provides for a possible increase in the powers of the European Court in this sense. The issue of the geographical location of the new tribunal is not discussed in the Commission proposal. The new tribunal will be integrated into the Community court, which is, of course, the Court of Justice of the European Communities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At present, the efforts of myself and my offices are focused on limiting the effects which the distance between the parties and the future tribunal may have. Indeed, we intend to ensure that the centralised jurisdiction is near to all members of the judiciary across the Community. I would like to add that it is difficult to have a Community or centralised patent without centralised jurisdiction. Because if that was not the case, this would mean that there would be a tribunal in all Member States of the European Union for administering justice on patent infringement procedures, and that could mean that a German company could find itself in a tribunal in country X, far removed from the registered office of that company, and with enlargement in the offing, that could imply far greater distances still. It is essential that one judicial body be put in place, both in first instance and in appeal, where patent disputes are settled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Hitherto the main thrust has been one whereby litigation is primarily focused in Member State courts but problems of interpretation of Community law are centralised in the sense of references to the Court. That has been a way of ensuring that the law is consistent throughout the Union and yet is locally administered. I would like to be assured that the Commission will consider very carefully the virtues of such an approach, because I suspect a proliferation of jurisdictions may, in the end, fragment our legal systems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Does he mean a geographical proliferation or a functional proliferation, according to various subject matters?</p>
<p class="contents">If Mr MacCormick means a functional proliferation of courts of justice, I can see his point of view. I understand that his concern is that there should not be a proliferation of special tribunals dealing with this, that and the other. That is certainly an understandable point of view, which I share.</p>
<p class="contents">However, patents, represent very specialised work. Just as the law courts in Düsseldorf, Munich and elsewhere in Germany have specialised in the law of patents and there is also a specialised court in London, a Community court to sit upon and judge cases concerning Community patents would have to be very specialised. It is not work that could be given to a new judge – if I may put it that way – even though that judge might be very experienced in other fields. Therefore, the specialised courts which the European Commission wants to see come into being, to deal with all possible litigation concerning Community patents, would have to consist of specialised judges and would, therefore, perhaps be organisationally a part of the Court in Luxembourg but, as far as its work is concerned, form a specialised part of that Court.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said all that, I agree with Mr MacCormick that one should be very sparing in erecting special tribunals. We do not want a tribunal for traffic accidents, international agreements, or for maritime law, etc. These matters would continue to be the normal province of the Court in Luxembourg and certainly the Commission would not want any special arrangements for normal cases. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission empathises with the situation Mr Berenguer Fuster has cited. This situation not only applies to Spain, but also to other Member States, such as France, Luxembourg, Italy and Greece. This is why the Commission contacted the Member States concerned prior to sending the reminder. Those contacts have been successful to the extent that, over the past year, another three Member States have submitted their lists with courts of first and second instance for the Community trade mark. Despite this, we are of the opinion that the situation, which has admittedly improved but is still unsatisfactory, cannot continue any longer. Accordingly, the Commission will take all measures which it deems necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 5 of Article 91 of the Community trade mark regulation stipulates that, as long as a Member State has not notified the Commission which courts of first and second instance are authorised, each procedure must be instituted at the judicial body of that Member State which is given absolute or relative powers. To prevent this provisional situation from turning into a permanent one, on 13 July of last year, the Commission reminded the Member States concerned in a letter, of their obligation to designate courts for the Community trade mark. Since then, those countries have still not notified the Commission that they have taken steps. Consequently, as the Commission has no information whatsoever on the basis of which it can conclude that these Member States have taken the necessary measures, it recently sent a written reminder to those countries. If the Member States do not respond to this reminder, or give an unsatisfactory response, the Commission, in accordance with Article 226 of the Treaty, can decide to open an infringement procedure on account of non-compliance with Community legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">After more than eight years, the Thessaloniki underground rail system – an infrastructure project designed to promote the sustainable economic development of the city – still unfortunately exists only on paper in the 2nd CSF, the local newspapers and the Ministry for the Environment, Regional Planning and Public Works. The Commission's answers to my previous questions since last February (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2000-0011_EN.html">H-0011/00</a>, <a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2000-0066_EN.html">H-0066/00</a>, <a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2000-0513_EN.html">H-0513/00</a> and <a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2000-0566_EN.html">H-0566/00</a>) are a prime example of evasion and the Community's endless political and bureaucratic procrastination, reflecting as they do the Commission's mismanagement and evident inability to investigate swiftly and effectively the allegations that Community rules have been breached in the performance of the contract.</p>
<p class="contents">How many years does the Commission intend to deliberate over the measures to be taken in response to the allegations and what are the implications of the delay in taking a decision? What stage has been reached in this affair and what does the Commission intend to do if it is established that Community rules have been broken? Can the work go ahead with joint funding from the Community through the 2nd CSF and the European Investment Bank or is there an obstacle in this respect? Have appropriations been set aside under the 3rd CSF to carry out the project? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The plaintiff claims that Community provisions have been violated with regard to state support and public contracts. As the honourable Member of your House is aware, the lodging of a complaint has in itself no bearing on the progress of the project. The Commission is of the opinion that questions regarding delays in the execution of the project must be put to the competent Greek authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as those aspects of the case which pertain to provisions on public contracts are concerned, the services of the Commission have made their position clear to the plaintiff in a letter which will be sent in the next couple of days. Accordingly, we are unable to provide the honourable Member with the information requested at this moment in time. Also, the Commission has assessed whether the funding of the project can be reconciled with the rules of the Treaty in terms of state support and has not reached a verdict yet. It appears that the Greek government has not yet reached agreement with the franchise holder on all the conditions for funding the project. The Commission has not yet received notification pursuant to Article 88 (3) of the Treaty. Consequently, the Commission is unable to examine all the facts of this case and take a final decision in which it gives its assessment of the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">In broader terms, the Commission would like to make the honourable Member aware of the fact that a complaint of such complexity must be investigated very carefully indeed. This is why the Commission is closely following the case within the procedural framework which encompasses the relevant provisions of the Treaty and derived legislation. With regard to the actual funding of the project, the Commission would notify the honourable Member that the Community has already funded activities leading up to the project to the tune of EUR 5.8 million under the second Community EFRO specification. The request to fund the balance has been included in the operational programme proposed by the Greek authorities. The programme, entitled transport axes, ports, urban development, has been submitted to the Commission under the 2000-2006 Community specification. It is expected that the proposal will be approved by the Commission early next year, which is very shortly. It stipulates that the Thessaloniki underground rail project can be part-financed by the EFRO for a maximum of EUR 122 million, whilst the contribution of the national government will amount to approx. 122 million and the franchise holder must pitch in with EUR 413 million. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the Commission has already explained and as Mr Trakattellis is aware, I suspect, this is an extremely complex matter and the alleged violations of Community law are not clear. Furthermore, the aspects of the case regarding state support cannot be investigated by the Commission before the financial side of the agreement has been completed. In this context, I would also like to point out that the plaintiff, from the time that the franchise agreement was made public in Greece, has taken eight months to make up his own mind and lodge his complaint with the Commission. In other words, I do not think that the Commission can be accused of any negligence. The Commission acquits itself of its duty as quickly and meticulously as possible. I would very much like to assure Mr Trakattellis of this fact. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I refer to the answer from the Commission to my question <a href="/doceo/document/P-5-2000-3079_EN.html">P-3079/00</a>, in which it states that the right to strike has to be respected pursuant to Regulation (EC) 2679/98<a href="#def_1_3" name="ref_1_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. At the same time, it indicates its willingness to intervene against barriers to the freedom of movement regardless whether they stem from industrial action. This is a clear internal contradiction which can be clearly seen in the following hypothetical example.</p>
<p class="contents">In the course of a lawful industrial dispute in Swedish ports the trade unions impose a blockade and the loading and discharging of ships is brought to a halt. Would that be a situation in which the Commission would have to order the Member State government to intervene to ensure that the free movement of goods in the internal market is not interrupted? How long could the strike continue before it threatened free movement? How far would the Member State have to go to restore free movement? Would the Member State have to use legislation to oblige the two sides of industry to accept a settlement via compulsory mediation by the government? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is why, on behalf of the Commission, I would like to make a point of imparting the following piece of information to Mr Sjöstedt. All Member States are bound by Regulation 2679/98 which clearly states that the regulation may not be interpreted in a way which could in any way prejudice the constitutional rights as recognised in the Member States, including the right to strike or freedom to strike. It is obvious that the Commission respects this principle. Having said this, pursuant to the same regulation, Member States need to take all necessary and proportionate measures to restore the free movement of goods on their territory as soon as possible so as to avoid serious disruptions to the free movement of goods when a restriction as defined in the regulation has occurred in the context of a strike or similar action.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, Member States must notify the Commission of any restriction occurring on their territory and of the action undertaken by them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw attention to the fact that Member States must decide for themselves what constitutes a legal strike pursuant to their legislation. I would like to underline that the Member States have exclusive authority to define whether, when and to what extent measures are necessary and commensurate so as to facilitate the free movement of goods on their territory. This is clear from recital 6 of the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The principles which I have outlined apply to all questions raised by Mr Sjöstedt. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As to the matter itself, it is really quite simple. A French university and a British university have entered into a contract with an educational establishment in Greece and students from France, Britain or any other country study in those institutions in Greece. They take their examinations there under the supervision of the French or British university, and the degrees which are eventually granted are British and French degrees. If then the student in that establishment, perhaps a Greek student, does not gain recognition for his diploma or degree in Greece, then I am afraid there is no alternative other than for him to address himself to the Greek authorities saying that he has been awarded a French or a British degree <span class="italic">en bonne et due forme</span>, as the French expression is.

<p class="contents">Shipping in the narrows of the Gulf of Bothnia is to be discontinued, since it is unprofitable now that shipping firms have no opportunities for tax-free sales.

<p class="contents">obtaining a EU subsidy to support the unprofitable regional traffic network,</p>
<p class="contents">building a bridge (or tunnel) to cross the straits at a suitable point, or</p>
<p class="contents">declaring the island of Raippaluoto off Vaasa an independent kingdom, through which shipping firms can pass and thus continue their tax-free sales.</p>
<p class="contents">In the last case, the city of Vaasa which owns the area could content itself with renting out the island for the kingdom’s use, or could even set conditions for its use, e.g. by prohibiting tax-haven activities.

It is, however, up to Member States to identify possible needs for action and to set their priorities for the use of such instruments. For the period 2000 to 2006, Finland and Sweden in cooperation with Norway have submitted a programme proposal under the Interreg Community initiative for the Kvarken-Mittskandia area. This proposal is currently under consideration by the Commission services. The proposal includes actions to examine infrastructure and communications across the Kvarken and also between Sweden and Norway, and it is expected to be approved in the coming weeks, which would allow projects to be submitted early next year. At this stage I am not able to assess the impact of this programme, which has yet to be put into place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, when the vessel returns to Community ports, customs provisions including appropriate controls apply and that means that the passengers are allowed to import excisable goods free of taxes and duties up to the limits laid down in the customs provisions governing travellers' allowances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
