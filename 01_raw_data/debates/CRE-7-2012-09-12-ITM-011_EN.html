It was an extremely interesting conference, which opened up a situation that had been closed for too long, and I must say that the participation and efforts of our Cypriot hosts were decisive in making the event a success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Andreas Mavroyiannis, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council. </span><span class="bold">− </span>Mr President, honourable Members, let me first thank you for your kind comments on the success of the meeting in Paphos. We are looking forward to continuing until the end of the Cyprus Presidency, providing both hospitality for meetings but also substantial meetings that will contribute to moving forward our common European agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me to begin this debate by stating that the Presidency is well aware of the concerns that have been expressed by many Members of this Parliament at recent political developments in Romania over the last few weeks and months. Given the implications of some of the actions and decisions taken at the highest political level in Romania, it is very understandable that this Parliament has not only followed developments closely, but has also wished to express its profound unease.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike Parliament, the Council has not discussed this issue. You will appreciate that, since as a Presidency I speak on behalf of the Council as a whole, it follows that my contribution to this afternoon’s debate will necessarily be limited. I would, however, like to make some more general comments and offer some reflections which are relevant to the wider context. I hope these will also clarify the situation from the point of view of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly and importantly, I would like to stress one point which is well known to all of us – that the European Union is founded on a number of basic values and principles which are set out in the treaties. These values and principles, which include freedom, democracy and the rule of law, are also enshrined in the constitutional traditions of all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council attaches particular importance to ensuring that these values and principles are fully respected. I know that this House also fully shares that view. However, there has been no suggestion – either within or outside the Council – that any procedure involving the Council linked to the respect for the values on which the European Union is founded, should be invoked in the light of recent events in Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">All Member States are required to ensure that their legislation respects the basic values on which the EU is founded. But the rule of law and democratic values have not only to be enshrined in the texts, but also put into practice. That means that the legislation has to be respected and enforced. If there are any concerns or doubts that this is not the case, this is firstly a matter for the Commission. I know that the Commission has raised its concerns in various contacts with different parties within Romania. The undertaking given to the Commission by the Romanian Government to act swiftly to ensure respect for the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary will certainly be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">On a separate note, and though legally not linked with Schengen accession, I am sure that the Commissioner will wish to say more about the concerns which the Commission raised with the Romanians and which are set out in the Commission’s latest report under the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism which it adopted on 18 July. The Council is expected next week to take a view on this report as a whole and recall that the existence of an impartial, independent and effective administrative and judicial system is indispensable for EU policies to function properly and for citizens to benefit from all the opportunities offered by membership of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope you will understand that I am not able at this stage to make a more detailed contribution to this debate, given that the Council has not adopted a position on this issue. I can, however, assure Members that I will listen with particular interest and attention to your comments and reactions to this issue. Let me finish by greeting the presence of Vice-President Reding and the Ministers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Viviane Reding, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission. </span><span class="bold">− </span>Mr President, honourable Members, at the beginning of this summer we witnessed a combination of actions by the Romanian authorities, which called into question the rule of law, democratic checks and balances and the independence of the judiciary. We have built our Europe on judicial independence and on the respect for the rule of law. Those are fundamental values for our Union and the Commission, as guardian of the Treaty, has a duty to see that they are respected by all.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me be clear about the nature of the concerns the Commission expressed during the summer. They concerned respect for constitutional norms and judicial independence. They concerned the rule of law, because in Romania laws and emergency decrees were passed against constitutional practice with the aim of reducing democratic checks and balances, notably by imposing sudden limits to the powers of the constitutional court. At the same time, judges and prosecutors were subject to intimidation and pressure by political forces. Let me be very clear on the following: pressure on the judiciary is unacceptable regardless of which side of the political spectrum it comes from. That is why the Commission reacted swiftly and decisively.</p>
<p class="contents">On 6 July, in a press release, the Commission expressed concerns about the developments in Romania. On 11 July I met the Romanian Justice Minister in Brussels and President Barroso met Prime Minister Ponta the day after to share the Commission’s concerns about the developments in Romania. As a result of our exchanges, the Romanian Government made a number of important commitments in response to the eleven specific points that we had raised. The Romanian authorities addressed some of our concerns and, in particular, restored the constitutional norms, notably in the run-up to the referendum to impeach President Băsescu on 29 July. The referendum, unfortunately, did not bring an end to the political strife.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the referendum there was again evidence of pressure on judges and of prosecutors’ attempts to influence the circulation of the referendum turnout. President Barroso again set out the Commission’s concern in a letter to Prime Minister Ponta on 10 August. In this letter the Commission called upon the Romanian Government to cooperate fully with the constitutional court and to act swiftly and decisively on allegations of intimidation against judges.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also recall that the Venice Commission echoed the Commission’s concern. The President of this Venice Commission stated on 7 August and I quote: ‘it is a general principle of the rule of law that pressure on any court, whether constitutional or ordinary, in order to influence its decisions, is inadmissible’ and he also appealed to ‘all state authorities and political parties of Romania to fully respect the independence of the constitutional court and to refrain from exercising pressures’.</p>
<p class="contents">On 21 August the decision of the constitutional court to declare invalid the referendum for the impeachment of President Băsescu was respected by all mainstream political forces. This is an important step because it provides an opportunity for the normalisation of political life. In this context the Commission urges all political forces to seize this opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">The Romanian people deserve a political discourse based on policy arguments, not on personal attacks. I hope that the coming weeks and months will show that all political actors in Romania are determined to fully respect the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary in a sustainable and irreversible way.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the situation in Romania remains fragile and requires our attention and support. Since Romania’s accession to the EU in 2007, the Commission has a particular responsibility – as the Minister has just said – to monitor progress on the rule of law and the judicial independence in Romania under the cooperation and verification mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">The political developments in Romania over the summer were of particular relevance to this monitoring exercise. The Commission therefore set out in detail its concerns in its report on Romania, which was adopted by the Commission on 18 July. Not all concerns and recommendations by the Commission regarding the rule of law and judicial independence have been addressed. The Commission will therefore continue to closely monitor the situation in Romania and maintain close contact with the Romanian authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">In the coming days President Barroso and I will be seeing President Băsescu. President Barroso will receive Prime Minister Ponta and I will receive the new Romanian Minister of Justice. Before the end of the year the Commission will prepare a report on Romania within the cooperation and verification mechanism, as announced in July. In this report we will critically assess whether the rule of law and the stability of institutions have been restored in Romania and whether confidence lost over the summer has been regained by the necessary cooperation among all political actors.</p>
<p class="contents">I am confident that this Parliament shares the Commission’s conviction that the rule of law and judicial independence are at the heart of the European Union and must be respected with impartiality in all 27 EU Member States. That is why the Commission calls on all political forces in this House and outside this House to act with responsibility and restraint in order to contribute to a stabilisation of the political situation in Romania. All political actors will have to contribute to this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Two pieces of emergency legislation were passed that drastically reduce the powers of the constitutional court and change the legal position for a referendum to suspend the president from office while the case is in progress. An extremely dubious suspension procedure was pursued against the state president that was no longer under the supervision of the constitutional court as a result of the emergency legislation. The quorum requirements of the constitutional court were ignored. Finally, there are reports of irregularities in the electoral lists for the referendum on the suspension of the office of president, indicating that the electoral lists were even changed after the ballot was complete. To cap it all: constitutional lawyers and advocates have received personal threats during the process.</p>
<p class="contents">As I read this list, you might think I am talking about a banana republic in some obscure part of the world. However, I am, in fact, talking about reports that we received during the summer from Romania, a Member State of the European Union. These reports and the discussions we have had to hold about them are disappointing and quite simply unacceptable. I am therefore pleased and grateful that the President of the Commission and, above all, our Vice-President, Ms Reding, have responded in a committed and decisive manner, demanding an explanation from Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unacceptable, however, for Prime Minister Ponta to promise the President of the Commission that the illegal and highly undemocratic emergency legislation will be repealed, while doing nothing at home in Romania. On the contrary, Mr Ponta has exploited the opportunity to bad-mouth the European Union. This is unworthy of a democratically elected prime minister and shows a profoundly undemocratic attitude of mind. Thanks again to the Commission for its decisive stance. The citizens of Romania and of Europe as a whole appreciate this.</p>

I never heard anything like this from you, Mr Weber, or from Mr Daul in the case of Hungary. The same Mr Orbán, who is still the Vice-President of your party, naturally came down on the side of Băsescu, exerting external influence on the decision by the people of Romania, or at least attempting to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Reding, I hold you in great esteem on many counts. However, your observations have once again called into question the objectivity of the Commission. I find that regrettable. You have several times on other occasions referred to a parliamentary coup. This is a contradiction in terms in itself. It is not a coup, however. In Lithuania, a democratically elected president has been dismissed by parliament without a referendum. In the Romanian case, a referendum was held, and there was no talk of a coup at the time. Now we are hearing the word coup being used.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are well aware, Mr Weber, Mr Băsescu introduced the 50% provision just before the referendum, in fact while the campaign was still in progress, because he knew what to expect. I am opposed to such measures. Nonetheless, I clearly stated prior to the referendum that it would be necessary to stick to this figure of 50% afterwards. I am very pleased that the government has kept its promise and that this has been changed. The fact is that Mr Ponta is keeping to his promises. It is scandalous to speak of a coup in this context. That is not true. Also, Ms Reding and Mr Weber, why is it that you said nothing in all the months prior to this when Mr Băsescu and his people ruled by emergency decree? What Mr Băsescu did with emergency regulations was alright because they were nothing new. I did not hear any complaints from the Commission either. Then suddenly you turn around and say that this is a scandal. The fact is that when Mr Băsescu and his people did the same thing, it was not a scandal. That is not being objective, and what I demand is objectivity.</p>
<p class="contents">This is all very interesting: Mr Băsescu was elected with 5.3 million votes. 7.4 million have now rejected him. That is very interesting. Is it not one of the functions of the president of a state to ensure that people come together in reconciliation? That is not the way of this particular state president. I agree with you, Ms Reding, in that I, too, would like to see all sides play their part here. However, I see no sign of Mr Băsescu playing his part. After all, a figure of 7.4 million means that 2 million more people have now tried to dismiss him from office than voted for him in the first place. You must take note of how popular and how effective a president is when the majority of the population has voted to dismiss him, except for those who boycotted the referendum, because this boycott, which he and Mr Orbán supported, was the only chance he had to survive. I am not concerned with whether this is right or wrong. I simply want to point out that here a man has failed to carry out his duty as president of the country. Many Romanians have recognised this and many continue to do so. As a social democrat I also believe that Mr Băsescu has failed in his task of bringing people together and that we are also feeling the effects of this.</p>

From this recent episode no party, the European Union included, emerges with much credit.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Reding, this was not in any sense a coup d’état, even in your phrase ‘a parliamentary coup d’état’. A majority of Members of a democratically elected assembly voted to impeach a President with a long history of abusing his office, for trying to turn a parliamentary democracy into a presidential fiefdom. The constitutional court declared the procedure for suspending the President to be constitutional. The President himself accepted the procedure when he went to Parliament to answer questions.</p>
<p class="contents">What happened then is almost the stuff of fairy tales. It leads many of us to agree with Emil Constantinescu in his letter to President Schulz that the current mandate of the President of Romania is unlawful. In Romania, appointments to public positions are too often partisan. The President has protected his post by placing his pals in positions of power. Transparency International, Freedom House and others have warned against the gradual reversal of the rule of law. Not for the first time, President Băsescu faced impeachment. When he had the referendum law changed, against the advice of the Venice Commission, his friend the Ombudsman rejected a petition to challenge the move at the constitutional court.</p>
<p class="contents">In no other EU country is a vote invalid if fewer than half the people participate. So why did the Commission insist on it for Romania? In any other country, if over 85% vote for a president to go, that president is toast.</p>
<p class="contents">Part of the problem is that the European People’s Party, keen to boost its majority position, has welcomed into its fold people such as Berlusconi, Borisov and Băsescu – Europe’s B team, playing fast and loose with the rule of law but all part of the EPP and all protected by the EPP. Europe’s Socialists have decided to move their congress this year from Bucharest to Brussels. We know the EPP has no such sense of shame since they gave Prime Minister Orbán a five-minute standing ovation.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">They are on the same slippery slope with Saakashvili. I remind you of the words of your own Konrad Adenauer: God placed limits on man’s wisdom but not on his stupidity. Unless all Europe’s parties are scrupulous in their insistence on the finer points of democracy and the rule of law, Europe’s future is in peril.</p>
<p class="contents">The best thing for Romania would be new elections both for Parliament and the President, following the advice of the Venice Commission, and then a convention between all parties to set some ground rules about how to behave in a democracy. And the European Union, Commissioner Reding, might also reflect on the advantage of parliaments over presidential systems.</p>

I am not sure that we are doing any favours to European values and European democracy by allowing this debate to descend into an extension of the Romanian election campaign, which has already begun. I would like to pick up on a comment made by Mr Watson. You said that, whether debating on Hungary or Romania, we were dealing with countries that had not really made a full transition from communist regime to European democracy. I completely agree. However I believe that Mr Ponta is also one of the players who has not made this transition. The parallels I see between Hungary and Romania are simply that a political majority, when it feels securely in power, will not hesitate to reorganise the institutions of the state to such an extent that independence from the majority power in the government in Parliament is lost. I certainly see a parallel with what we discussed regarding Hungary, although the situation is different.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that we have this instrument, the cooperation and control process that has allowed us to take a closer look with the help of the Commission, shows that we have long known that something was not right with the rule of law and the whole campaign against corruption in Romania, as well as Bulgaria, where the same instruments also exist. The same goes for President Bǎsescu. Hence my insistence. It is good that the Commission has now taken a closer look at Romania. I would be very pleased if we had such measures available for the EU as a whole, so we would not find ourselves again and again facing a situation where it is claimed that we have no powers or authority or that we are guilty of playing party politics when we focus attention on a particular party that belongs to a large party grouping in this House, whether on the left or right.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I am frequently ashamed to see how the large party groupings are really fellow travellers with non-democrats in the European Union. If this practice does not stop, I am pessimistic about the development of the rule of law, which Ms Reding has upheld in this case, but also in Hungary, despite the opportunities that were open to us there.</p>

Romania is currently projecting an image of itself as a banana republic. But we knew that already. Romanian politicians would certainly not win any prizes for decisive action or transparency of government.</p>
<p class="contents">However, these are Romanian problems; this is who the Romanian electorate are voting for year after year. The country might be in a mess, but it is their mess, their own sovereign choice. The European Union must stand apart from internal political struggles and elections. The European Commission is constantly overstepping its remit by imposing EU dictates on to sovereign states. As soon as there are elections in sovereign countries, the Eurocrats start tumbling over themselves to interfere. They often resort to using EU commissioners from the relevant countries for that purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Netherlands, Ms Kroes had occasion to promote her Europhile drivel in the press and, in Finland, Mr Rehn was never far away, either. In Romania, Mr Reding and Mr Barroso found it necessary to interfere with domestic affairs.

However, the impact is not only nationwide, even though, by its action, the socialist majority in Bucharest added to the European economic crisis an extensive political crisis in one of the Member States. In fact, the events of 3-6 July caused confusion, given that they dramatically brought into opposition the European and national policy discourse.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, what can Europeans do when a country’s majority becomes tyrannical, dismissing the Ombudsman, the Presidents of the Parliament’s Chambers and the Head of State in just three days, in contempt of the Constitution? How should I react when the Parliament in Bucharest requests the Constitutional Court to rule on the President’s suspension within 24 hours? What can I say when the majority members of the Romanian Parliament are lodging criminal complaints against European MPs for having criticised their country’s government? How should I react when Romanian citizens working or studying in one of the other 26 Member States are being denied the right to vote? Is it not absurd when a politician believes the electoral list should be established after and not prior to the citizen consultations?</p>
<p class="contents">The entire European public opinion was concerned with such questions in July and August. The Commission’s intervention was prompt, in support of those Romanian institutions which could stop the drift of the majority and, for this reason, we must thank the Commission. I too wish to do so, on behalf of those Romanian citizens who do not perceive the European identity as a burden, but as enriching the national identity.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this is not the interpretation given in his turn by Victor Ponta, the Romanian Prime Minister. Accused of plagiarism by the same University that had awarded him the title of Doctor a decade ago, Mr Ponta did not have the courage to come here today and explain why he has not answered all the requests made by the European Commission. Instead, he chose to stay in Bucharest and criticise the Commission, using that nationalist and populist discourse which, as President Barroso said this morning, is a denial of Europe. Such a politician embodies the past, not the present. For this reason, I demand his resignation. </p>

Here – and if not here, then where? – you must tell us why the vote of 8.4 million European citizens did not count at all for you this summer; why a rule that is valid nowhere else, in no other Member State of the European Union, was imposed on Romania by the Commission, and I am referring to the 50% voter turnout; how a decision made by six of the seven political groups forming the national Parliament ended up being considered a parliamentary putsch.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Reding, with all due respect, this summer you acted as if you were one of Traian Băsescu’s electoral agents. You were precisely as you reveal yourself today, with that orange jacket you are wearing: namely, an impeccable member of the Liberal Democratic Party (PDL), supporting Traian Băsescu unconditionally. By the statements you have made, you have caused serious damage to Romania, not only politically, but also economically. You managed to humiliate an entire people, tread on the sovereignty of a Member State of the European Union and annihilate the right of a national Parliament to make its own decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps you care to explain to us today how a referendum, in other words, a popular vote – and the decisions of the Constitutional Court have indicated beyond any doubt that the referendum had been organised in compliance with the Constitution and the existing legislation – has been turned into a <span class="italic">coup d’état</span> overnight.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Commissioner Reding, I wish to congratulate you on creating a very dangerous precedent in the European Union: you managed to impose a head of state on a Member State of the European Union against the will of the very people of that State. There are another 26 EU Member States. The question remains for my fellow Members, when elections are held in their countries, whether they will be able to count on Ms Reding’s support, as we did this summer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is what it is about, Ms Reding. It is about the principles and values you have reminded us of, which Romanians, and not only Romanian politicians, but also the citizens of Romania, abide by. I would like to remind you of one of the fundamental obligations of the leaders of the European Union and of its citizens – namely, to protect democracy, cultural diversity and the organisation of the public powers of the Member States at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">Could you tell me, Ms Reding, specifically which are the constitutional provisions violated by the suspension procedure, which is stipulated in the Constitution of the Romanian state? Because the decision of the Constitutional Court states very clearly that the constitutional procedures have been complied with during this suspension procedure and the Constitutional Court of Romania validated the constitutional procedure. Moreover, this procedure was validated by the Romanian people, as 7.4 million persons voted for the president’s dismissal. Of course, Ms Reding, people may not count for some of you in the European Union. However, people do count for the great majority of us sitting in this chamber, Ms Reding, and I wish to remind you of the words of Jean Monnet, who said that more Europe will not be achieved by building a coalition of states, but by uniting people. This summer’s events, your brutal intervention in legitimate constitutional and legal procedures of the Romanian state, have only managed to divide people.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Reding, as a liberal politician, I stand for ‘more Europe’. I support a Europe of diversity and I am convinced that together we will be stronger. But we will not be stronger, Ms Reding, through a manifest political partisanship. We will never be stronger if we favour our ideologies and political families. We will be stronger, Ms Reding, when we know what cultural diversity is, when we learn a little about the countries we are criticising, when we respect their traditions and, especially, when we respect the fundamental principles of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Ombudsman in place in Romania has been revoked without any legal grounds. A few days later, emergency decrees were passed with the aim of reducing the remit of the Constitutional Court. A new Ombudsman was appointed, close to those in power. I am not going to repeat what my fellow MEPs have said, and yet the fact remains that we are extremely concerned within the European Union about what has been happening since the new social-liberal ruling coalition came to power.</p>
<p class="contents">All mechanisms of democratic control have been undermined, from the impartial Ombudsman to the Constitutional Court, with total disregard for procedures in force, and even electoral regulations. The referendum was held. I am now told that a certain number of investigations have been carried out in Romania. I have been told that several hundred thousand votes are alleged to have been in all cases fraudulent. We can understand there to be haste to move towards new policies when there is a change of government. Changes of government are familiar to us in all the countries of Europe. In my country, France, my government fell and the Socialists came to power, but that took place properly, without any change in legal regulations. Why have the Socialists not come to power properly in Romania, like in other European countries?</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Reding, Mr Barroso, I call on you today to ensure that the rule of law is upheld. That is your duty. That is what you must do and I call on the new ruling coalition to do the same.</p>
<p class="contents">Democracy in Europe cannot be bought and sold. I call on the socialist group to make sure that it keeps its word and its commitments. Democracy is at the heart of our Europe, and at the heart of the European Union. Today we have visitors in this House, and I wonder what they think of what you have done in your country.</p>

This crisis is not only financial or economic, it also affects trust between Member States, given that one of the aspects of the crisis consists in the community method having been displaced by an intergovernmental method in which some governments, as in Orwell’s <span class="italic">Animal Farm</span>, are more equal than others.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, distrust is spreading between Member States and among public opinion in Member States. For that reason, it is good that Parliament debates this issue, because it affects the role of Parliament, which should concern itself with citizenship, fundamental rights and the quality of democratic standards, whilst also ensuring the Commission safeguards those standards fairly and without double standards.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the events, it appears that a solid parliamentary majority initiated the referendum. The Constitutional Court has validated the referendum process and, despite being very significant, the results are not effective, given that the legally required quorum was not reached.</p>
<p class="contents">What is clear is that a large majority of Romanian citizens do not wish President Băsescu to continue in the role. On that basis, the Romanian Government should make themselves available for dialogue with the Commission and cooperate to clarify all the possible relevant information for the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important, however, that there is not even a whiff of double standards, neither in terms of corruption among Member States, nor in terms of taking part in the free movement of persons provided by the Schengen area, given that Parliament has repeatedly provided its support and backing for Romania and Bulgaria to join, nor in any other area, even as regards ensuring the Copenhagen criteria are fulfilled.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, you must be aware that the Copenhagen criteria are used not only for joining the European Union, but also for being a member on the same footing as everyone else and thereby deserving the ongoing respect of everyone else. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There has been a great deal of surprise and anger expressed at the way in which the two groups have attacked one another, despite the fact that they have colleagues in government in the various countries, using the same tone and never actually making it clear what the real issue was. It is a truly terrible thing to place the credibility of the European Union in jeopardy in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">If the EU is to champion human rights, democracy and the rule of law, how is it that we simply criticise one another here without making it clear what the real issue at stake is? We need new, faster and more efficient procedures to counter violations of European values quickly, not just the procedure under Article 7, as it is being used in relation to Hungary here in this House at present, but also the control process that the Commission uses. Everything takes so long and we are making no real progress against violations in the areas of human rights, democracy and the media in the Member States of the EU. We need to go further. I also regret that Mr Ponta is not here today. I do not entirely understand why the European Parliament and the Bureau did not exert greater pressure on Mr Ponta and Mr Orbán to come here today.

<p class="contents">Among the legal requirements and political objectives that unite and bind together the Members of the Union, the rule of law is an indispensable prerequisite for the democratic organisation of society.

I agree with him. Yet neither President Barroso, nor Commissioner Reding reacted when the Hungarian Parliament amended the constitution in November 2010 and limited the powers of the constitutional court. The reason for the amendment was that one month earlier the constitutional court had annulled a new law put forward by the government. Calling court judgments in question and removing the fundamental checks and balances casts doubt on the government’s commitment to the rule of law, said José Manuel Barroso to Prime Minister Victor Ponta in July 2012. I agree with him.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet the Commission did not react when the <span class="italic">Fidesz</span> Government annulled court judgments, rearranged the electoral districts to its own benefit, appointed its own people as heads of independent institutions, and adopted 365 laws over a span of one and a half years while disregarding even the most basic rules of social consultation and parliamentary discourse. In his statement made in January this year Joseph Daul, Chairman of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) states that Mr Orbán will prove that he is committed to freedom rights and the values and principles of democracy. Upon the visit of Victor Ponta to Brussels in July this year, Mr Daul said that they strongly doubted that the diplomatic statements made by Prime Minister Ponta in Brussels would be followed by concrete action on the part of his government.</p>
<p class="contents">Double standards have no place in Europe; we must take joint action to protect democracy and the rule of law when they are under attack in a Member State, regardless of whether it is under conservative or left-wing leadership. I find it unacceptable that Commissioner Reding, who did not raise her voice against the violation of the rules of democracy in connection with the earlier actions of President Băsescu, is in the present situation making political judgments and is threatening Romania with a postponement of its Schengen accession while both the experts and the Commission found the country to be ready for accession in every respect. We have a right to expect objectivity from the Commission. This requires a monitoring mechanism that utilises impartial expert opinions to provide us with appropriate tools to investigate and sanction Member State measures violating democracy and the rule of law at Community level.

The European Union cannot ignore any intervention in the independence of the judicial system, for example in the separation of powers, and it cannot allow any suspicions surrounding fundamental rights in the Member States. The EU citizens require that kind of confidence. It is in the spirit of our Treaties, it is spelt out right there in Article 2 of our Treaties, and we cannot ever forget that the judge of an EU Member State, a Romanian judge, is also a European judge who will judge other EU citizens. As a matter of mutual trust, we must be able to rely on the separation of powers in all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I am the rapporteur on fundamental rights in Hungary. Hungarian citizens, the Hungarian Government and journalists all ask me if we will apply the same standards to other EU Member States, and their questions are justified. There must be no discrimination. I think it is essential that this Parliament and the Commission stop living under the illusion that, once a Member State has acceded to the European Union, its fundamental rights record suddenly becomes impeccable. This could never be the case and we must end this asymmetry, in which financial violations lead to the Troika visiting EU countries while fundamental rights violations pass without consequence, by continuously monitoring the EU’s Member States. This is what we need to think about and implement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have achieved this now. We thank the Commission and the European Parliament for their support during the pre-accession period and afterwards.</p>
<p class="contents">The prosecutors and judges who are handling cases against politicians are the ones being praised today; they are the ones who have been acknowledged in each report of the European Commission regarding the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism. They are not handling political cases; on the contrary, they are investigating any member of the government. I wish to emphasise this because, in reality, what has happened in Romania was aimed at stopping these investigations and holding justice captive in the back garden of certain political parties. Therefore, it is extremely important to return to this state of normality.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, prosecutors and judges are investigating referendum frauds, following certain claims. There are over 500 cases. Let me give you just a few figures: one of the cases involves allegations regarding 1.5 million votes stolen during the referendum and, several days ago, the Chief-Prosecutor of the National Anticorruption Directorate stated that leads and evidence of fraud amounting to 5-10-15% have been found in the investigated polling stations. These files must, therefore, be finalised, these prosecutors must continue to hold office, in spite of the efforts being made to dismiss them, and we must see the result of these investigations. Voting fraud is the vilest form of corruption because it is directed against the people. </p>

Only three weeks later were these allegations formulated, although it is clear that, despite what has been said here, the procedure for suspending the President of Romania, like the initiative of 2007, complied with the Constitution and the decisions of the Constitutional Court. Unfortunately, this time around, the European Commission adopted the position of President Băsescu’s political ally, instead of that of a neutral mediator in an election process, in a domestic political dispute, blaming, from the very beginning, both the government and the democratically elected Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I have not seen you in the debate on safeguarding democracy in Hungary, but I see that now you intend to make a completely groundless analogy between these two countries. For years, you have ignored the signs of the abuses committed by the PDL government. You have brought up two emergency ordinances of the Ponta government without saying a single word about the hundreds of emergency ordinances abusively issued by the PDL government. The double standard you are applying to the Romanian internal political groups is so obvious that it is no wonder the Romanian citizens’ confidence in the European Union has dropped by 10% in one month alone during this summer. </p>

I am truly amazed and surprised by the statement made by Mr Watson, a liberal democrat leader in this Parliament, that the majority has a right to impose its view and the right to decide what the truth is, as is the case in dictatorships. Mr Watson, protection of the rights of minorities is a cornerstone of liberal democracy. We now have a situation where a majority of Romanians rejects the Romanian Ombudsman, introduces changes, challenges the constitutional court, and wants to dismiss the President. The majority is not right only by virtue of being the majority. What is right is right, but not because it enjoys a majority.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to add one more comment – there can be no comparison between Romania and Hungary. In Hungary, the socialist party has, along with its once-liberal coalition partner, led the country to ruin. It has been rejected by the vast majority of the nation in a clear manner. Two thirds of the Parliament – two thirds went over to the Fidesz Party. These two thirds had the authority under the constitution to introduce constitutional amendments. There is a big difference between two thirds and half or less than half in a referendum when it comes to making changes such as dismissing a president.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a Romanian exception. In Poland, a referendum is valid only if half the population participates in it, since the alternation of power is a principle of democracy and either we defend such principles or else we will end up governed by the law of the jungle or the steppe – might is right. Such customs are not European, they belong to the steppe. Socialists and liberals, remember this.</p>

<p class="contents">I wonder, however, not just in view of the present debate, whether all those involved are really concerned with an objective clarification of events, or whether they are not more interested in party political mud-slinging or scoring party political points through sound-bites. This will not help us win back the confidence of our citizens. We need to arrange for an objective investigation to be carried out, using the same yardstick for all Member States, rather than different standards depending on whether we are located in the north, south, east or west of the European Union. If we consider the issue at the heart of these matters rather than relying on rumours and newspaper reports, then this discussion will have added value for the people of Hungary, Romania, France and Germany, and everyone else. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Băsescu’s regime was based on a parallel system of personal power. It was the same old story – using intelligence services, the police, and the office of the prosecutor to spy on citizens, to intimidate political opponents and protect friends. The mafia, corruption and clientele were closely associated with this parallel system that was finally challenged by a popular reaction.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission did not lift a finger against all these abuses. Romania got a new parliament that started an impeachment process which it carried out according to constitutional rules.

We protested against this, and the Prime Minister requested the supreme council of justice to investigate whether the protest and the statements made there could be regarded as pressure on the judiciary.</p>
<p class="contents">Many, including us, the members of minorities, ask the question what the solution could be in the case of Romania, for example. The solution is to enforce the Copenhagen criteria even after accession. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After Hungary, Romania. And the debate today, like those we have had in the past on a similar question, was very much led by party political concerns, similar attitudes in similar debates.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is the guardian of the Treaties and this is why we always need to act with fairness and impartiality. When there is an attack on the rule of law or a breach of EU legislation, irrespective of the political colour of the government, the Commission will remain firm in expressing concerns and taking actions, and this does not apply only now but has also applied in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">I still remember a time when I took action on a very similar matter, which was in 2009 when I was Telecoms Commissioner. I started infringement proceedings against Romania to protect the independence of the national telecoms regulator. At that time a right-wing government coalition had introduced emergency legislation to deprive a court ruling of its effect and to remove the president of the national telecoms regulator from office.</p>
<p class="contents">It was the same rationale that the Commission followed earlier this year when we brought Hungary to the Court of Justice for violations of the independence of the Hungarian data protection legislation and other infringement procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course such legal issues may seem small in the overall context. So what about the big picture? What about the rule of law in general and what about the independence of the judiciary?</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with those who asked these questions. Yes, the Commission has to play its role as guardian of the Treaties and it has to go after breaches in EU law by means of infringement proceedings. It is a general principle, and small violations count too. What about the big violations? Here I would to draw two lessons from the recent experiences.</p>
<p class="contents">First, of course, we always need to tackle these matters with independence and objectivity. Respect for the rule of law has nothing to do with the political party in power. For President Barroso and for myself, this has been very important throughout these processes. Lady Justice is blind. She does not recognise party political colours. She only reacts to the rule of law which is in danger.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we can see very well by these very concrete examples that we have experienced this year that we lack effective mechanisms in the EU to enforce respect for the rule of law more generally and more systematically.</p>
<p class="contents">Today everybody mentions the situation in Hungary and Romania. Are we sure that we will not see such a situation again in a couple of weeks in another EU country? Now let us be honest – and some of the parliamentarians have said it very clearly – we face a Copenhagen dilemma. We are very strict on the Copenhagen criteria, notably on the rule of law in the accession process of a new Member State but, once this Member State has joined the European Union, we appear not to have any instrument to see whether the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary still command respect.</p>
<p class="contents">We as a European Union need to stand firm on our values and on the rule of law, and that is why I think that we need to put in place an objective mechanism to assess the judicial systems in all of our 27 Member States, because our infringement procedures are too technical and too slow to react to high-risk situations concerning the rule of law, and because the Article 7 procedure is a nuclear option that should only be used by the Commission, Parliament and the Council when there is really no other solution.</p>
<p class="contents">But what do we have in between? I would therefore like to work with the European Parliament and with the justice ministers of all Member States on a new intermediate and more focused mechanism. I propose to add to the economic and social benchmark in the European Semester a new mechanism for measuring, comparing and benchmarking the strength, efficiency and reliability of the justice systems in all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">So my experts are at this moment developing for the European Semester a justice scoreboard that will allow a detailed assessment of the justice systems of all Member States, their strengths and their weaknesses and I am going to start a discussion with Parliament and with the justice ministers in the coming weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">We Europeans have built a Community based on the rule of law – <span class="italic">Rechtsgemeinschaft</span> as the Germans say – and we therefore cannot allow the rule of law to become an object of any party political game. We need a strong, reliable rule of law in all 27 Member States of the Union and I count on this Parliament to strongly support the European Commission in this endeavour.</p>

Moreover, the serious violation of Parliamentary regulations and the attempts at obstructing justice have had an adverse impact on the country’s future. The excessive depreciation of the national currency, the drop in foreign investments, the increase in bank rates, the decrease in the number of jobs and the collapse of Romania’s accession to the Schengen area are but a few of the problems caused by an incompetent government.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely feel sorry for the difficult position which the European socialists and liberals find themselves in at the moment. On the one hand, they are aware of the serious violations of the rule of law principles committed by the Social Liberal Union (USL) government and, on the other hand, they are wondering whether or not it is a good thing to embarrass their fellow members belonging to the same political family, whom they would like to teach the basic concepts of democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Article 4 of the Treaty on European Union states that the Union shall respect the equality of Member States before the Treaties, as well as their national identities, inherent in their fundamental political and constitutional structures.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the European Commission has exceeded the mandate voted by the European Parliament in that it has established and transmitted to the Government of Romania the list containing 11 requirements, some of which going beyond its competences and violating the sovereignty and subsidiarity of a Member State. President Barroso was also speaking today of a contract of confidence between the Member States and the European institutions. I think this partnership should be based on mutual respect, cooperation and, in particular, on respecting the role, duties and scope of the mandates of each institution, both at national and European level. Finally, I regret and denounce the intention of certain Liberal Democratic Party (PDL) MEPs to suggest the temporary suspension of several of Romania’s rights, such as the vote in the Council. I believe this is an action directed against the Romanian citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the reasons why we, the Hungarians of Transylvania, consider the attention of the EU and Parliament to be important is that the post-communist Romanian Government broke a record in anti-Hungarian measures, launching a series of attacks against our minority institutions. Its series of hostile attacks began with its action against the Hungarian faculty at the Târgu Mureș University of Medicine and Pharmacy, in connection with which President Traian Băsescu rightly said that it is a fundamental right for a minority to have access to education in its native language at a university that is obliged to provide native language education for minorities. The series continued, among other acts, with an arbitrary attempt to re-nationalise the Székely Mikó Reformed College, which had been confiscated during communism and was later returned through restitution to its rightful owner, the Hungarian Reformed Church. Despite all this, we can ultimately conclude with satisfaction that ‘one way or the other, the Romanian institutions are resisting political pressure, and have managed to stay true to their mission as far as the Constitutional Court, the Chief Prosecutor’s Office and the Anticorruption Prosecution Office are concerned’ (Traian Băsescu). One of the reasons why the Ponta–Antonescu Government has launched a campaign of retribution against us is that the Hungarian community refused to support its unlawful and unconstitutional policy, namely the coup-like removal of President Traian Băsescu. In conclusion, I would like to ask Parliament and the Commission to continue to monitor the situation in Romania and the fate of the Hungarian minority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like all the other political forces in Romania, the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR), the legitimate representative of this community, has gone through a stormy period. The societal split, the suspension of the Romanian president, and the institutional and political crisis have forced us to face some difficult decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the general crisis, my community has also faced an attack directed against one of our specific wishes that originate in our history and traditions, namely the restoration to the community of property abusively confiscated by the communist regime. Almost 30 000 people protested in Sfântu Gheorghe on 1 September against the abusive decision to renationalise the building of the ‘Székely Mikó’ Secondary School, which had been legally returned to the Reformed Church in Transylvania in 2002. This decision completely disregarded the principles of the rule of law and brought into question the guarantee of the property rights of Hungarian historical communities and churches. The only long-term solution to the institutional conflicts in Romania, which have reached their peak this summer, as well as to guaranteeing property rights is a real judiciary system reform and the long overdue constitutional reform. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
