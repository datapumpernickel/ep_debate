<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lehne (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, I hope I will not use up all these five minutes. This procedure has to do with an application for the waiver of Mr Cohn-Bendit’s parliamentary immunity made by the Public Prosecutor’s Office in Frankfurt on the basis of charges laid by a member of the Hessen <span class="italic">Land </span>parliament. In these charges, Mr Cohn-Bendit is accused of obstructing the course of a prosecution, in that – as stated in newspaper reports – he, together with others, a number of decades ago now, helped a Mr Klein, a terrorist alleged to have taken part in the OPEC attack in Vienna, to flee to France.</p>
<p class="contents">In the normal course of events, Parliament would comply with such a request when it was made. There were, however, a number of peculiarities, which led the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market to take a somewhat different approach to this matter. One reason why it did so was that the original application submitted to us was – let me put it frankly – relatively flimsy; that is to say, its substance did not amount to very much. The result of this was that, in the summer of 2000 – only a few weeks after the application was made to us – the then chairman of our committee, Mrs Ana Palacio, wrote a letter to the German authorities asking for further detailed information. The German authorities supplied this further detailed information after two more years had elapsed – that is how long this process took – and this meant that our committee could then rule on the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself had, as rapporteur, originally proposed that, in this specific case, a conditional waiver might be considered, as is provided for in our Rules of Procedure, but – as I mentioned earlier – there is a whole array of peculiarities associated with this case, and these meant that the great majority on the committee saw it as right and proper not to waive immunity in this specific case. Such was the prevailing opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the reasons for this is that, as regards at least some of the things Mr Cohn-Bendit may have got up to at the time, he did them at the behest of the German internal secret services, or with their direct or indirect involvement; it is in any case quite remarkable that the secret services should involve themselves in such things, while, on the other hand, the law enforcement authorities of the same country seek to take action against them. Another point was that Mr Cohn-Bendit indicated that it was him alone against whom investigations were in progress, rather than against all the others named in this newspaper article as possible accomplices. The third point has to do with the proceedings against the terrorist Mr Klein, which have now run their course, and in which the judge, in stating the grounds on which his judgment was based expressed admiration for what Mr Cohn-Bendit had done and depicted it as a typical example of what constructive help could be given to enable such people to break free from terrorist circles.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, the committee came to the conclusion that the special circumstances of this case mean that the waiver of immunity does not appear to be justified. I would like to make it quite clear that this does not mean that we are accusing the Frankfurt Public Prosecutor’s Office of <span class="italic">fumus persecutionis,</span> that is, of criminal proceedings intended to prejudice Mr Cohn-Bendit’s political activities. That is something that I too repeatedly opposed in the debate in the committee, quite simply because, as German law on immunity stands, a German public prosecutor’s office simply cannot do otherwise; it is not permitted even to open a file and commence investigations before a definite decision has been taken on the waiver of immunity. Taking the overall circumstances of this case into account, however, it seems appropriate to us – particularly in view of the European elections being not that far off – that immunity should not be waived in this case. I ask the plenary to endorse the committee’s proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Zimeray (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, I agree with the opinion of the rapporteur. I would like to take this opportunity to say a word or two on the reasons leading us to believe that we are looking at a case of what we call <span class="italic">fumus persecutionis</span>, that is to say, something which, in legal proceedings, gives the impression that something is going on other than the desire to see justice done in a dispassionate and normal fashion.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, as the report points out, of the various people who could have had proceedings brought against them for the same alleged offences, Mr Cohn-Bendit is the only one who has been accused, something which I see as a criterion in itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the lateness of the proceedings: they have been brought, arbitrarily, a long time after the alleged offences were committed. Clearly, the difficulty with this case relates to the fact that the offences of which Mr Cohn-Bendit is accused happened a long time before he took up office. It is precisely because these proceedings have been brought now he is an MEP that we should be asking questions.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, this complaint – and I would add that I consider this a significant point – does not come from just any old person. It comes from a Member of Parliament who is an opponent of Mr Cohn-Bendit and who has used these accusations as one of the elements of his political battle. This is made abundantly clear by the victorious press articles and <span class="italic">communiqués</span> issued by this plaintiff just after the indictment or, should we say, the acceptance by the public prosecutor of his charges against Mr Cohn-Bendit.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that all of this leads us to believe that if Mr Cohn-Bendit had not been a Member of Parliament, he would not have had proceedings brought against him. We are therefore dealing with a genuine case of <span class="italic">fumus persecutionis</span>, as the rapporteur has pointed out, and there is good reason to preserve Mr Cohn-Bendit’s immunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First, and most importantly, we are dealing with a matter of great public concern, but a matter that has been in the public domain for a long time. We are dealing with a course of events which Mr Cohn-Bendit has not merely not denied but has also publicly avowed. We are dealing with a course of events in respect of which Mr Cohn-Bendit was specifically praised by the trial court involved in the trial of Mr Klein some years ago, where the court drew attention to the courage and public spirit of the people who had assisted in getting that particular accused person to come out of hiding and give himself up to the public authorities. So this is not a case of somebody seeking surreptitiously to hide from accusations or from public justice, but of somebody who has openly avowed his actions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lehne was absolutely right to say that there can be no question of the public prosecutors in Frankfurt being themselves in any way deviously motivated. They have a public duty to take up a complaint that has been laid before them on ostensibly justifiable grounds.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it does not follow that those who laid the accusation before the public prosecutors, thereby triggering that public duty, were themselves wholly lacking in any deviousness of motive. When account is taken of two aspects of the public interest here today – firstly, that there ought not to be unreasonable protection of MEPs or anybody else from public prosecution where circumstances warrant it and, secondly and importantly, that electoral debate and discussion should be able to go forward without unreasonable impediment or harassment of leading figures in it – the balance of the public interest in this case seems to be absolutely clear: the public prosecutors are doing their duty and we should do ours. In this case, that duty points clearly in the direction indicated by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market to decline waiving the immunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the case of Mr Cohn-Bendit, we have decided not to waive immunity for a very specific reason, although, ultimately, it might have been in Mr Cohn-Bendit’s interests for this trial to go ahead. For Parliament, on the other hand, the fact that the case has been raised many years after the alleged incident and that there could objectively be a suspicion or a suggestion that, behind this belated recognition by the German authorities of the possible guilt of Mr Cohn-Bendit, there might conceivably lie ‘<span class="italic">fumus persecutionis’</span>, justifies the stance taken by our committee, which I and my fellow Radical Members support. I am saying this in anticipation of other cases too, Mr President, for although it is true that in some countries we have reduced the scope of immunity, confining it strictly to the political activities of each Member of Parliament, it is also true that the scope of political activities cannot be limited solely to what is said in the Chamber, at least where those political and legal systems which provide for extensive immunity for Members of Parliament are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Until we have the single Statute for Members of the European Parliament, until Mr Rothley’s line becomes law in our Union, I hope, from this point of view, that it will be precisely the examination of our texts which will prompt the Intergovernmental Conference to accept the idea that the Members’ Statute should have a prominent place in the forthcoming European Constitution and specifically recommend that specific immunity and specific privileges be included in the Statute for Members of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the evidence in a case which indicates the political nature of an act can fall down, whether in this or in future cases. For example, as you know, you will soon be called upon to deal with the case of Mr Dupuis, who handed out doses of hashish as a way of condemning Italian legislation on drugs, which will lead to the opening of a case.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, I support the line taken by Mr MacCormick, and I believe that, in acting in this way, Parliament will be setting a precedent for subsequent cases. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
