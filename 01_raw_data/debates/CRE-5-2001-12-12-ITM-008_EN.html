<p class="contents">Before we move on to the debate, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that there is going to be a slight alteration to the timetable: with a great deal of effort, we are going to exceed the time limit of 7 p.m. With the cooperation of the interpretation service, I think that we can work until 7.15 p.m., which means that, from 7.15 p.m. there will be no interpretation service, no Commissioner and no President, because we all have other commitments. I am sorry to have to tell you this, but this is the truth of the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I think that the best way to deal with this situation is to let the rapporteur speak, then the Commissioner, and then the Members of this House, depending on how much time we have left. Therefore, the more concise we can be, the more possibility there will be of ending the debate before 7.15 p.m. For those of you who will not be able to speak, you will have the chance to do so once again when we resume at 9 p.m. tonight.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gahler (PPE)</span></span>  , <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, I think we will get the last speakers just before the break. On 7 February this year, the Commission published a communication on relations between the EU and Iran, in which it notes that dialogue, which began in 1995, has from 1998 onwards been in the form of half-yearly consultations between the troika and the Iranian Government and has taken on a comprehensive character, including global issues such as terrorism, human rights and the proliferation of nuclear weapons, as well as regional issues and cooperation in the areas of drugs, refugees, energy, trade and investment.</p>
<p class="contents">According to this communication, the EU, with about 40% of Iranian imports, is Iran's biggest trading partner, but at the same time bilateral relations are impeded by the absence of the framework that a treaty could provide. The Commission recommends development of closer relations building on the progress made in the following areas: the rule of law, minority rights, freedom of the press, legislative and economic framework conditions and Iran's role in foreign relations and its position on security issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the communication was published, President Khatami has been confirmed in office by a seventy-five per cent majority, and the world's attention has been focused on Iran's immediate neighbours by the terrorist attacks in the USA, which Iran has unambiguously condemned. The draft Council decision on negotiation guidelines for a trade and cooperation agreement with Iran, drafted by the Commission, was delivered to the Council on 20 November.</p>
<p class="contents">In this report, I have especially tried to shed light on Iran's internal developments in the political, economic and social spheres and to draw from them political conclusions for our attitude towards Iran. My concern was to explore the EU's interests in enhanced commercial exchanges in view of the country's wealth of raw materials, but also in political dialogue on the fight against terrorism and the trade in drugs, and our respective contributions and potential contributions to resolving the Middle East conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I would particularly like to make it clear that we in this Parliament take the Commission and the Council at their word, when they take progress in the rule of law, minority rights and press freedom as their benchmark when assessing to what extent relations should be stepped up. We welcome on principle the planned trade and cooperation agreement and do not make its conclusion conditional on the prior attainment of a specified standard when it comes to the rule of law and respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to highlight two reasons why that requirement can be dispensed with. One is that we expect the agreement to include a human rights clause comparable to the Cotonou Agreement, which will help us at any time to effectively demand adherence to the international agreements Iran has signed on this subject. The formularies on this subject in the preamble to the draft mandate, and the general reference to the final provisions on the possibility of suspension in the event of grave offences against significant elements of the treaty do not strike me as adequate.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, moreover, convinced that Iranian civil society is capable of implementing under its own steam the reforms appropriate to a modern and developing Islamic society. Its intellectual potential, shown by its students, press and cultural life, is clear to outsiders. Looked at as a whole, this country, with its culture and natural raw materials combined with human resources has in essence every chance of opening up to a better future. However, the fact that elements in the judiciary and the clergy find it necessary to repeatedly ban newspapers, which then often re-establish themselves under new names, shows something of its dualism and contradictions and, in the final analysis, of the still-open question of who should wield power – a question which dominates in almost every area of this society.</p>
<p class="contents">The most recent example of this is the disappearance of the journalist and film critic Siamak Pourzand, to which the PEN Club drew attention on 5 December. We have seen appalling photos in magazines of death sentences being carried out, as they have been to an increasing extent. There have been repeated reports of stoning being used as a method of execution, and there have been many public floggings this year, all of which indicate that ever greater effort is required to keep civil society in check.</p>
<p class="contents">The most recent reports by the United Nations also, and also the report of 12 November by Maurice Copithorne, the Special Representative of the Commission on Human Rights, are noticeably more critical than their equivalents in previous years, in terms of their estimate of the situation and the language they use. All this makes it, in my view, a matter of urgent necessity that we should for our part build up our contacts and thereby strengthen the forces that the majority of the population know to be behind them. By that I mean the forces that are in Parliament demanding greater freedom for the press and more rights for women; and the economic sector, which wants to demolish the encrusted structures and to promote a constructive role for Iran in the Middle East peace process. It is our desire that these forces be encouraged by parliamentary dialogue, so that they may better do justice to the task committed to them by the electorate and to the hopes and expectations of society. The contradictoriness I have mentioned runs like a thread through other areas. I gather that Iran, although not actually at the table of the Afghanistan conference in Bonn, played a very constructive role behind the scenes. I think that should definitely be mentioned to Iran's credit. Iran could, on the other hand, exert a more moderating influence on certain groups tending to seek confrontation in the Middle East. The European Parliament will not, though, do a deal on human rights in exchange for participation in the anti-terror coalition.</p>
<p class="contents">I expect the Council and the Commission to take a similar line. Women have struggled to gain a number of positions in parliament, government, administration and culture, more so, perhaps, than in other neighbouring states. On the other hand, regulations on clothing are imposed on them by male exegetes of the Koran, along with much else besides. Nor are they adequately represented in many areas of society. They are quite explicitly not on an equal footing as regards many aspects of the law, for example in family law. We must – and will – treat all this as a central theme, just as we will acknowledge any progress made.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, in this context, to thank all my colleagues whose amendments have further improved this report. What mattered to me was that none of the facts should be passed over in silence, but also that the words used should not unnecessarily make the commencement of dialogue more difficult. It is important in the economic sphere that it be made clear to the Iranians that fundamental reforms are needed, such as, in external terms, conformity with the standards set by the WTO and the opening-up of the market to overseas investors and their products; collaboration in combating drugs is in the interests of both parties, and changes in Afghanistan mean that we must play our part in putting an end to their transit via Iran. There is an extensive agenda for this dialogue. We in Parliament want to make contact with our colleagues in the Iranian parliament. I hope I can count on your support.</p>

I hope the House will understand if I am not able to be here until the end of the debate, but the Commission will be represented.</p>
<p class="contents">As a regional power, Iran has an important influence on developments in its area that has sometimes been called the arc of crisis. We in the European Union have every interest in encouraging the authorities in Teheran to use this influence constructively, to promote stability, cooperation and development in the region. And as the process of reform and liberalisation goes forward in Iran, we also have every interest to develop our bilateral relations as we tried to do with our troika visit a few weeks ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past few years, and especially since the first election of President Khatami in 1997, the European Union has engaged in a broad dialogue with Iran. It has been useful but now we should go much further. That is why we recently presented draft directives for the negotiation of a trade and cooperation agreement. Once we have a contractual basis for our relationship, we will be in a much better position to develop exchanges not just in the economic area, but also on matters such as migration, drugs, energy and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">That will also give us a sounder basis, with real shared interests, for continuing and deepening our political dialogue with Iran on regional and international issues.</p>
<p class="contents">We have welcomed Iran's constructive and measured response to the atrocities of 11 September, to which the honourable Member referred. Even before those terrible events President Khatami launched a very useful initiative in the UN for a Dialogue between Civilisations. I was interested myself to have an exchange with the president about the works of Nicolo Machiavelli.</p>
<p class="contents">I have the impression that Iran fully understands the importance of implementing UN Security Resolution 1373 in the financial fight against terrorism, the need to ratify the twelve existing anti-terrorist conventions, and the need for a comprehensive convention.</p>
<p class="contents">In the aftermath of 11 September and in line with the efforts of the global coalition against terrorism, there will be increased scrutiny and less tolerance of states attempting to build arsenals of weapons of mass destruction. In this regard Iran has adhered to the relevant treaties and conventions, but we want to see additional steps and increased transparency. Full compliance with these agreements is essential. We will also welcome co-operation to ensure a better future for Afghanistan under a new, broadly based administration.</p>
<p class="contents">We wholeheartedly support and encourage the process of reform in Iran. But unfortunately things have slipped in the last year. We share the concerns expressed by the UN Special Rapporteur, Mr Copithorne, in his recent report on human rights in Iran. So we still have to adopt UN resolutions on this subject. I believe we should explore other ways of conducting a more effective human rights dialogue with Iran, and I have begun this dialogue with the Iranian Foreign Ministry. I have repeatedly told my Iranian interlocutors that we are keen to do that, if they also show a real commitment to reform. The growing contacts of the Iranian authorities with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs Robinson, is a promising sign, as is the recent agreement between the UNDP and the Islamic Human Rights Commission on human rights covering monitoring and capacity building. A lot more can and should be done, and the Commission will watch these developments closely and contribute in whatever way we can.</p>
<p class="contents">The potential for EU/Iran cooperation in trade, energy and economic matters is enormous. That is recognised in our draft mandate for a trade and cooperation agreement. The discussion among Member States in the Council has already got under way and I hope it will soon lead to a decision allowing us to start negotiations. As always, there will be some difficulties on detail, but I am confident that everyone accepts that we have a strategic opportunity to develop our relationship with Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to some of the queries in the report, I can confirm that there will of course be a clause on human rights in the agreement, as there is in all our agreements with third countries. Equally, we will include provisions on readmission of illegal immigrants, while also developing our cooperation with the Iranian authorities on the broader issues of migration.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I share the honourable Member's pre-occupation with the drugs control issue. I know that our Iranian counterparts do as well. So I expect that the agreement will also help us extend and deepen cooperation in this area. And in terms of the structure of our dialogue with Iran, I wholeheartedly support the suggestion of closer parliamentary contacts.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, let me thank Mr Gahler again for a very well-argued and balanced report on EU-Iran relations. I take note of the constructive comments, and am pleased to see that the report encourages the line pursued by the Commission, including the establishment of contractual relations with Iran. I will report back to Parliament on the progress that is made. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That in itself is reason enough for expressly concerning ourselves with that country and especially because what we see happening there is not only negative, for there are also some positive developments.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why it makes sense to call for a dual-track policy: on the one hand, to maintain effective cooperation in the field of trade, the fight against drugs, against terrorism and such like, and possible cooperation in the reception of refugees, which is a full-scale problem in Iran at the moment, and on the other hand to level tough, clear and honest criticism on everything that contravenes the rule of law, democracy and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, backed by the underlying attitude that we would like to see more democracy in Iran and the introduction of the rule of law – this can be encouraged in all kinds of ways – we could break through the deadlock which has come about in Iran in the wake of its conflict with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s own attitude could possibly break this deadlock, and this is why I warmly welcome what the rapporteur has stated. We should bear in mind that Shiite Iran, of course, represents, in fact, a modern version of Islam, although there are all kinds of things which we do not like, particularly the fact that a clericracy has declared itself a theocracy, which has always sounded rather blasphemous to me, and which means that the normal, human wishes of young people and women are suppressed.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we should note that the career opportunities of women too can indeed withstand the test of modernity. With regard to the introduction of democratic wishes, we hear of quite a few positive developments. In any case, I should like to subscribe to the rapporteur’s conclusion that it is a logical step for us to contact the parliament in Iran, and offer my congratulations to the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its merit is that it lists the signals of progressive opening-up coming from Iran, particularly from its people, who, in the last elections, quite clearly expressed their desire for a policy of economic, social and political reform. However, at the same time, the ultimate point of reference for us, for the European Union and for Parliament must be respect for human rights. In this sense, I think we can say to the rapporteur that we do not support some of the amendments he has submitted for the perusal of this plenary in that they seem to be inspired by excessive indulgence in the area of human rights, an area in which we must never make any concessions.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the Iranian Government has condemned the violence of the destruction which took place on 11 September in New York; of course, it declared its willingness to discuss human rights issues – we welcome that just as we welcome the way that women too have been able to resume their role in the course of recent years in institutions and in schools and university education, and also the Iranian Government’s responsible endeavours to help stabilise the region. However, certain facts remain, such as the unfulfilled expectations of Iranian society and the international community regarding the abolition of torture, the abolition of the death penalty, the abolition of the special religious courts and press courts and the abolition of particularly degrading and humiliating punishments. I believe our task is to encourage the democratic forces, civil society and the many women and students who feel that, in the struggle between theocracy and democracy, it is possible for democracy to prevail.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to urge the Iranian Government to fully respect the mandate it has received from its people.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we must promote political dialogue between the European Union and Iran. In this sense, we are in favour of sending an <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> delegation to Iran and we hope, in particular, that the European Union will be able to play a full, useful political role to help Iran find its own path to democracy as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel, Mr President, that it is never our place to judge. Encouragement and persuasion are part of the spirit of this report and must also characterise the way the European Union reinvigorates its relationship with Iran in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Commissioner Patten and Mr Gahler have said, positive moves are being made, but there is also much that is negative. Improved relations should not lead to criticism being weakened. This report raises the issue of whether criticism of a country with which general cooperation is improving needs to be toned down. I believe this is a wholly incorrect view but, unfortunately, it appears to be the view of those on the right in this House, who wish to water down Mr Gahler’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">In contrast, we believe that the Gahler report has its merits, but that it is too weak and must be made bolder on a number of points. We have therefore submitted no fewer than ten amendments, of which I will mention only two. Amendment No 13 is based on the proposal submitted by the EU to the UN, in which the Council is stronger in its criticism than Mr Gahler is in his report. The amendment mentions issues such as stoning, which continues to occur. I heard Mr Gahler mention it orally just now, but it is not included in the resolution. I see this as watering down. It is an omission not to clearly state that we utterly condemn such a terrible form of punishment. There are a number of other matters which we believe should be included and which we have addressed in our Amendment No 13.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No. 19 states that Iran is not a safe country for refugees. It is very important to point out, in these times of strong sentiment in favour of expelling people from within the EU in a quite haphazard manner, that Iran is a highly unsafe destination for refugees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The human cost was tremendous but they made us all much wiser, both us and Iran, I think, and we understand the need for new bridges, dialogue, discussion and cooperation between the European Union and Iran to get under way in such an extended, important and dangerous area of instability.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that both the troika and Commissioner Patten have done interesting work and I think that the report and the motion for a resolution are generally on the right tack. However, I must say that there is a little schizophrenia going on. I am worried that the report contains a double message. It is like saying to a neighbour with whom you are on bad terms, for whom you have little respect left, "Let us sit at the same table, but just remember that I think you a vulgar, good-for-nothing thief". That is more or less what our report says. In paragraph 19, for example, we are, I think, directly intervening in Iran's internal affairs, given the past pattern, the lack of faith in even in the most straightforward people in Iran, who look at the United States, Great Britain and the European Union and suspect that they are about to come and impose their control again.</p>
<p class="contents">This being so, I think that we should tread very carefully. We need to be in favour of the reforms. Not for the reformists or against the conservatives. As with any other country, we only have the right to insist on our own terms, based on the principles of the European Union and European culture, as the basis for meetings and discussion, but not for intervention if Khatami behaves or the clerics do not. Because we shall be the ones opening up an opposition front in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the logic behind our past and present approach to Turkey, which is now a candidate for integration into the European Union, should also inform our relations with Iran. This does not mean, I repeat, that we should underestimate the importance either of basic questions of human democratic rights, women's rights, prisoners' rights or the rights of religious minorities. If we are careful, I think that these steps, which are important to both sides, can be taken. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This particularly applies to the country’s internal power struggle which flared up recently. An interesting phenomenon in this connection is that quite a few current reform-minded people were once advocates of the power system they now denounce.</p>
<p class="contents">It is only natural that the conservative forces in Iran consider this sense of reform as an erosion of the political system. They control the essential positions of power and neutralise reformist initiatives at their discretion. They do not eschew highly repressive means.</p>
<p class="contents">With this, we have, in fact, outlined the duality in Iranian society. The very detailed report by Mr Gahler analyses this in more detail. We are on the side of the Iranian reformists. They pursue a more open society and openly denounce coercion in religious matters. Their fervent opponents, on the other hand, create an uncertain internal climate.</p>
<p class="contents">Our hesitation about endorsing a formal trade and cooperation agreement between the EU and Iran is epitomised by two concerns. These are the violations of constitutional rights – think of the beleaguered position of religious minorities in that country – and the material support to terrorist Lebanese and Palestinian organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, an agreement would give us a formal foundation for addressing Tehran on a permanent basis with regard to the social abuses cited by Mr Gahler. It is of crucial importance, however, that we do not wish to isolate the forces of change internationally in ancient Persia. In fact, this course of action corresponds to the wishes of the majority of the population. Like the reform-minded forces in the Islamic Republic, Iranian citizens are reaching out to the west, to Europe for help. We must lend a truly helping hand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
