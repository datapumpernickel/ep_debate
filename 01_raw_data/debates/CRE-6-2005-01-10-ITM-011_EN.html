Its President is elected following inter-party negotiations. Nevertheless, the President is obliged to represent all Members of the European Parliament of the 25-member EU to the outside world.</p>
<p class="contents">We were therefore astonished by the remarks made in public by Mr Borrell, President of Parliament, before various international assemblies. These unfortunate and objectionable remarks have shocked the Polish public. It is nothing short of scandalous that a President of Parliament should go so far as to express extreme and biased opinions that are offensive and defamatory to Poland, a sovereign state and an EU Member State. It has been brought to our attention by Polish governmental departments that Mr Borrell has made similar remarks on many occasions in the past. I trust the opinions Mr Borrell has voiced are a reflection of his own personal views, and not those of the European Parliament as a whole. I should therefore like to demand that he resign from the office of President. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I imagine that you are referring to the comments that appeared in the Polish press last week in relation to the content of my comments in Madrid in a debate on Europe on 10 December. Mr Piotrowski, you, like all the Polish Members of this House, must have received a letter that I sent to you last Friday in which I explain in great detail what really happened there and what I said. The object I am showing you now is a video cassette containing the live recording of everything I said there. You will certainly be able to receive a translation into Polish of my words and you will see that, in eighty per cent of cases, the note of the Polish Embassy in Madrid is nothing more than an invention. I have asked Poland’s Minister for Foreign Affairs for a public rectification, because I did not say any of the things it is claimed I said, and the proof of that is here. Sometimes we blame interpreting or translation problems, but I have no need to do that, because the phrases attributed to me are quite simply not there: neither they nor anything similar to them. However, there is no reason for you to take my word for it: you will see the reality for yourself in this video transcription and its translation into Polish. So if anybody has to leave their job, Mr Piotrowski, it is certainly not me, but perhaps somebody from the Polish Embassy in Madrid.</p>

Once they had examined it, they refused to return it to me for my convenience while I waited. This means that, while I wait, I have no independence, not even to visit the rest rooms, to which I have to be accompanied. This is obstruction on the part of the police and reduces my dignity. This does not happen in any airport in the world, not even in French towns. I have travelled the world on joint missions with disabled persons and I have never come across such conduct anywhere. When, having accepted that my wheelchair would not be returned to me and would be loaded as baggage, I then wanted to use my hands to push my body through the metal detector, in order to avoid using a strange wheelchair rather than my customised wheelchair, I was not allowed to. The fifteen policemen who had gathered round me threatened to arrest me. They asked for my passport and they sent a message to get my luggage back so that I could not travel, while 10 colleagues and journalists tried to stop them. I consider this conduct to be unacceptable; I consider that I have an inalienable right to travel freely and safely in the wheelchair adapted to my needs, without of course preventing any security checks from being carried out. I would ask that you contact the authorities so that the necessary measures can be taken to prevent the reoccurrence of such an incident, which borders on racism at the airport of a single town. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On 3 January I wrote inviting all Members of the European Parliament to give up a day’s pay for the people who fell victim to the earthquake and tsunami.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that EUR 250 is certainly not an enormous sum for us, but for those people, who are perhaps used to living on just one euro a month, EUR 250 multiplied by the number of Members may ensure their survival for some time. In your kind reply, Mr President, you said you had brought my idea to the attention of the Conference of Presidents: of course, it was agreed that it was not possible to force all Members to donate their daily allowance.</p>
<p class="contents">Even so, Mr President, I take the liberty of calling on all MEPs, in all the political groups, to give up today’s allowance so that they can make a practical gesture of help as individuals and not just as politicians, since help at a political level will be provided in the Committee on Budgets. It will show that each one of us – representing countless European citizens – is prepared to make a tiny sacrifice in order to give a hand to those who need help and the little things in life.

We must be glad that the Ukrainians repeated the Polish and Lithuanian experience, bringing about change in their country peacefully, without arms or coercion. Now we – the whole of the European Union, all nations – must say: we need Ukrainians, we offer you the following steps and you must perform the following tasks.

<p class="contents">The Chief Constable of the Northern Ireland police service has been very clear and concise in blaming Sinn Féin/IRA for this robbery. That is very interesting, because at the very time that Sinn Féin/IRA were negotiating peace in Northern Ireland and a way forward for a new government, they were also planning the greatest ever robbery in the British Isles.</p>

They have destroyed any prospect of a peaceful solution in Northern Ireland in the short term. They are not fit to sit in government with anyone else. They have shown this on numerous occasions – in Colombia and in countless other areas – through their extra-democratic actions. You cannot be a democrat by day and a criminal and thug by night. That is what I object to.</p>
<p class="contents">Why did they do it?

I wish to emphasise the impact that the Council's political agreement of 22-23 November on the protection of animals during transport will have on the transport of registered equidae for competition or breeding purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">While I broadly welcome the general provisions of the regulation, I regret that the Council did not apply scientific best practice in the details of the requirements laid down for the transport of this particular class of equidae.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation as it stands contains a number of inconsistencies and dangerous prescriptions, which need to be changed if it is to be enforceable and meet its objective of protecting rather than endangering these horses. For example, floors and bedding should ensure adequate control of urine and faeces, not necessarily absorption. Non-slip rubber matting is the hygienic flooring of choice today. The provision of free access to water is inappropriate, impractical and potentially dangerous for these horses. Space allowances should be proportionate to the size and temperament of the particular horse being transported and not set down in a table of rigid, unintelligible, unenforceable dimensions. The maximum short-journey limit is not consistent throughout the text and in any case is far too short.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that the regulation will not return to Parliament for a second reading, I urge the Council to review its agreement and to iron out these irregularities before publication of the regulation in the Official Journal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This problem already affects one quarter of Polish provinces, and such growth often violates health, veterinary and environmental standards. During the previous parliamentary term, four members of the Polish political party Samoobrona (Self-Defence) asked for action to be taken on this issue, but no response has yet been received from the parliamentary committee competent in such matters. This problem affects not only Poland, but also a number of other new Member States. It is unfortunate that such growth is taking place with the support of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would ask you to intervene again on this matter with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which at present is acting deaf and blind.

In the light of her party's association with that robbery, she indulged in the utmost hypocrisy by appealing to the European Union for funding. If Ms de Brún wants to talk about funding, then let her start with her party's ill-gotten gains from the Northern Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also very disappointed that, at a time when ordinary people throughout the world are digging deep into their pockets, this week the EU intends to waste millions of euros on celebrating the new Constitution. That is in shameful bad taste at this time in this world.</p>

I should like to ask you in your capacity as President to send a letter to the Mayor of Carlisle expressing our solidarity with the people of the city and of the county, and also to ask the Commission whether it can afford any help at this time of crisis for those people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have sent you a letter to the same effect, in which I have asked that a virtue be made of necessity and that we should try, in view of the current disaster, to work more efficiently. After all, we finished here in Strasbourg in 2004 with a plenary meeting, and we are starting again with a plenary meeting, without any meetings taking place in between.</p>
<p class="contents">Rather than that being efficient, I see it as a missed opportunity, and believe that we should look into the efficiency of this HHHouse and into plenary meetings. We could have quite easily condensed matters slightly. I have not yet received a response from you, but I assume, given the agenda, that it will be negative, because you may be wary of setting a precedent. I do believe, though, that you should seize every opportunity to have efficient meetings, where necessary, and not to have meetings for the sake of it, only because that is what the Treaty happens to stipulate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
