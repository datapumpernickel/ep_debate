<p class="contents">Colleagues, welcome to this special debate on the European Convention. I should like to welcome President Giscard d'Estaing, President Romano Prodi, Deputy Prime Minister Fini and Foreign Minister Frattini who will take part today in this reflection on the work of the Convention. This is the first opportunity that we in the European Parliament, in plenary session, have had to hear directly from the President of the Convention, reporting to this House on the outcome of the Convention and on the way forward for its content through the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">At the outset I should like to place on record the deep admiration and respect that this House has for the work of the Convention and for the leadership provided – especially but not exclusively – by its President, Mr Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, who made an indispensable contribution to the successful and comprehensive outcome of the work of the European Convention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Giscard d'Estaing,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Convention.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, I am really extremely moved to be standing here before you to present the Constitution for Europe drawn up by the Convention, over which I have had the exceptional honour of presiding.</p>
<p class="contents">As you have just said, Mr President, the Constitution is being presented now because this is the first plenary part-session of the European Parliament following the conclusion of our work. You invited me to come at the beginning of July but I had not yet presented the text of our work to the Council Presidency and because it is the Council Presidency that called for this work to be done, it was, therefore, to the Council that we were bound to submit the text first. This is why I am presenting the text to you in this part-session.</p>
<p class="contents">I must tell you that you are fully entitled to have this presentation, because the European Parliament is really the institution behind the Convention and thus the draft Constitution. As long ago as 1984, spurred on brilliantly by Altiero Spinelli, Parliament drew up an initial draft constitution for Europe, at a time when nobody dared talk about it or even think about it. You had the boldness – the calculated boldness – to rename your Committee on Institutional Affairs the ‘Committee on Constitutional Affairs’ at the beginning of the legislature, and I am hoping to catch the eye of its Chairman, Mr Napolitano. He is not yet present but I am sure we will see him soon.</p>
<p class="contents">Shortly after the disappointing results in the Treaty of Nice concerning institutional matters, you called loud and strong for a Convention to be formed. At the instigation of the Belgian Prime Minister, the Laeken European Council of December 2001 backed your call.</p>
<p class="contents">When we addressed the substance of the matter, your preparatory work in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, as I said, under the chairmanship of Mr Napolitano, made our task considerably easier, as did your reports, which sometimes preceded and sometimes accompanied our debates, such as the report by Mr Alain Lamassoure on the key issue of competences in the European Union. I wish to emphasise the outstanding and willing participation of all your representatives in the work of the Convention, as well as the pivotal role played by Mr Klaus Hänsch and Mr Iñigo Méndez de Vigo – I believe that working together with them for eighteen months gives me the right to call them by their first names – in the deliberations of the Convention’s Praesidium.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, I am not forgetting that you have given the European Convention a home on your premises. I also visited you in July to thank you for your generous hospitality. As for the benches in your hemicycle, they ended up not knowing whether they were members of Parliament or of the Convention!</p>
<p class="contents">This presentation is, therefore, an emotional occasion, but also a realistic one, because I stand here before you both in order to present and assess what we have accomplished, and also to reiterate what remains to be done to ensure that Europe gains a real Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">In attempting to assess any type of situation, one tends to forget what the starting point was. Two years ago, the very word ‘Constitution’ was still taboo, to the extent that the Laeken declaration only alluded to it indirectly. Today, the idea of a Constitution for Europe has entered the consciousness of the European: Europe’s citizens are now ready for the Constitution. According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, drawn up by the Commission, Mr President, and conducted in June and July throughout the European Union, 70% say that they are in favour of a Constitution and only 13% are not in favour. In Italy, which is the current holder of the Council Presidency and which consequently has a major responsibility for the success of the Intergovernmental Conference – I must take this opportunity to welcome the Vice-President of the Council, who is a member of the Convention and the Minister of Foreign Affairs – 82% approve of the idea of a Constitution. Even in the traditionally more cautious countries, there is greater approval than disagreement. I shall give the example of Finland, whose representatives have played a very active role in the Convention: 53% of the public is in favour and 37% against.</p>
<p class="contents">Our joint endeavours to explain the content of the Constitution have also enabled us to make progress in increasing European citizens’ understanding of our project. It must be acknowledged that we have come quite a long way, from a time when there was little recognition of our work and little understanding, whereas a survey conducted by the Commission at the end of June, in other words two months ago, suggests that 70% of the public who do hold an opinion about our work consider it to be positive. And to you who represent them, ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, I have one request to make: never forget the citizens. One hears many opinions expressed; by leaders, decision makers, by those in government, but you must never forget the citizens: it is for them that we are working, after all! During the Convention’s deliberations, when I was sitting in your place – only temporarily, Mr President – I thought continually about the man or woman in the European street, and have attempted to imagine their reactions to our proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">What, then, is the outcome of all our work? The draft Constitution that I am presenting to you is the outcome of an intense effort. It was published, as you know, in all the languages of the Union and in the language of every new Member State. This was done in time for all citizens, throughout the Union, to be able to access the text as soon as it was presented at the Thessaloniki European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The members of the Convention have worked long and hard. They have taken part in twenty-six plenary sessions, some of which have lasted two days and they have heard more than 1800 speeches. Every proposal, every amendment, every alternative solution, whether it came from a Convention member, a Member State, the European Commission, civil society or, of course, from the European Parliament has been rigorously examined and pored over with a critical and objective eye. This is why, and I must be frank with you, I do not believe there is a single solution that the Convention is not aware of or that it has not explored.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that our proposal goes as far as it is possible to go, given the political, social and cultural climate in Europe today. Far from being the lowest common denominator, as might have been feared at certain times, I would say that it represents the upper limit of what can be achieved in Europe in 2003. If we seek to go further, as some would like to see, and perhaps I am one of those, there is a danger that, as a result of some people’s rejection of the idea or of other people’s disapproval, we will tear apart a Europe that has only just been united. This is an unacceptable risk that no one has the right to take. And you yourselves, the Members of the European Parliament, have encouraged us to go as far as possible, whilst outlining the limits of what is reasonable and acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">What then are the basic proposals put forward in the Constitution? You have learned of them as our work has progressed and I do not, therefore, need to describe them to you in great detail, which would also cause me to far exceed the time scheduled for the debate. I nevertheless wish to emphasise that barely two years ago many of these proposals still appeared to be inaccessible and beyond reach but today form a solid and coherent whole. I shall now recall these proposals for you.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, a central point, which underpins the entire system: the affirmation of the dual nature of the European Union, a union of European peoples and a union of European States.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, the establishment of a single text that replaces all existing Treaties, of which there are four, plus a few others, and the attribution of legal personality to the European Union. When, in spring 2002, I looked into the possibility of Europe having a single text, I studied the previous work, the research that had been carried out in this area, and discovered that those involved had encountered obstacles that appeared to be insurmountable.</p>
<p class="contents">Next we have the incorporation into the Constitution of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which enshrines citizens’ rights. My attention is drawn to Mr Vitorino, who contributed an enormous amount to the discussions on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Another proposal is the clear, transparent and stable definition of the Union’s competences, and these are three aspects that I wish to reiterate. The definition must be clear so that the citizens can understand these competences and it must be transparent so that these are not open to interpretation by institutions that might have a more opaque way of doing things. As well as defining competences, the Constitution also states that they must be exercised by means of simple procedures, a point to which I will return.</p>
<p class="contents">The last proposal is the political guarantee that the principle of subsidiarity will be respected, involving national Parliaments in conjunction with the European Parliament. Mr Méndez de Vigo, a Member of the European Parliament, who is present here today, has played a major role in his capacity as chairman of the working group on this issue, which had been deadlocked since 1990.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Union is given new means with which to act in three areas in which the citizens believe them to be a priority. First of all justice, because in this field we envisage the construction of an area of security and of justice that will enable us to fight more effectively against major cross-border crime and to achieve the mutual recognition of civil rights between Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of the Union’s foreign policy, the Convention has met the citizens’ second expectation by proposing the appointment of a European Union Minister for Foreign Affairs, who will chair the Foreign Affairs Council and work to ensure the development of a much-needed common foreign policy. In the field of common defence, it has met the citizens’ expectations by establishing, amongst other provisions, a European arms agency.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the Union’s economic and social governance will be improved, especially but not exclusively, between the countries that have adopted the euro, to ensure the stability and success of our common European currency.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of these provisions, the much-vaunted three pillars that have complicated the management and the perception of the Union’s actions since the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties will disappear from the European landscape. The Constitution will give Europe a single institutional system, and by that I mean just one institutional system that will replace the system of the three pillars.</p>
<p class="contents">The institutions that the Constitution proposes are stable, democratic and effective. The European Parliament, the main Union institution featured in the Constitution, becomes the Union’s main legislature and the overseer of budgetary policy. The European Council, which will from now on be distinguished from the Council of Ministers because they share neither the same composition nor the same competences, will provide the necessary impetus for the Union’s development and will set its broad political priorities. This Council will now have a face, with a President elected by his or her peers, who will organise its work and plan for the future. The Council of Ministers will be refocused towards the tasks of the Legislative and General Affairs Councils and the various formations within it will be regrouped.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission, which is to be structured in a way that confirms its collegiate nature and whose composition is in line with the number of functions it performs, will act as the driving force and the main executive body of the Union. It will express and embody the common European interest. The President of the Commission will be able to appoint non-voting Commissioners in order to ensure, if he or she wishes, that all Member States are kept informed.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking now to you, who have worked so hard on this matter, I wish to reiterate one essential point: the democratic legitimacy of the system proposed in the Constitution. There will no longer be any justification for talking about a ‘democratic deficit’, an expression that has become part of the everyday language of the critics of our political system. Parliament is now given its central place as legislator in the European system. Apart from a few rare exceptions – and we have endeavoured to limit these as much as was politically possible – the entire body of European law or framework law must be voted on by you, otherwise it will be rejected. Parliament’s rights are also extended in budgetary matters. When the Constitution enters into force, the President of the Commission will be elected by you.</p>
<p class="contents">Admittedly, the debate on the issue of the possible presentation of candidates was a difficult one and I am unfortunately unable to take it any further. After lengthy deliberations in which both the Convention members, of course, and the political groups participated, we reached a common solution. Candidates will be presented at the proposal of the European Council, but with two new features: firstly, the outcome of the elections to Parliament will be taken into account and, secondly, the necessary consultations will be held. This is, therefore, an open proposal. Most significantly, you will have the right of rejection. If you do not select, by the majority of your Members, the candidate put forward by the European Council, the Council will be obliged to submit another candidate within the space of one month.</p>
<p class="contents">At the behest of Giuliano Amato, the Convention has succeeded in undertaking an enormous task of simplifying and classifying European decisions. I recall the discussions held in your Committee on Constitutional Affairs at the time and the proposals by Mr Jean-Louis Bourlanges.</p>
<p class="contents">In now making a distinction between legislative and executive acts, we are taking a step closer towards the traditional systems in force in the Member States, systems that are familiar and understandable to all citizens. The democratic system imagined by Montesquieu and the thinkers of the enlightenment – I, like many others, have been greatly interested in Montesquieu’s thinking – cannot, contrary to what is sometimes said, be transposed, because Montesquieu’s system was designed to meet the needs of a nation State and what he calls the ‘balance of powers’ is a balance that exists only within such a nation State.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we have managed to transpose it to some extent, to define a new balance of powers that takes account of the duality that is and will no doubt remain a unique feature of the European Union: the union of peoples and the union of States. We have consequently defined a democratic model on a European scale, which takes account not only of the size of the population – 450 million inhabitants – and of the diversity of the Member States, both old and new, but also of the desire for the European continent to be united. In short, if I may say so respectfully and cautiously, we have created a form of Montesquieu for the Europe of the twenty-first century.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter and applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Before entering into force, this Constitution still faces two sizeable obstacles to overcome: its approval by governments and its ratification by the democratic expression of Europe’s peoples, in the form of Parliaments or referendums.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say a few words about the role that you will have to play in this process. Before doing so, however, I wish to remove any ambiguity about the future role of the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention has achieved what it set out to do. On 20 June 2003, in the Convention’s name, I sent the first two parts of the Constitution that had been drawn up by the Convention to the Greek Presidency. When in Rome, on 18 July, I handed over to the Italian Presidency the by then completed text of the draft constitutional treaty, I added – I shall quote this short passage in full, for Parliament’s records – that the Convention has executed the mandate conferred on it by the Laeken European Council and has completed it. In presenting the draft treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, the President of the Convention believes he has fulfilled his duty and consequently his work is at an end. This means that the Convention no longer has a role and that it is no longer able to intervene in the process of the Intergovernmental Conference, because it would have no mandate to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the Convention members, not least the President of this Parliament, the vice-presidents and myself, will remain available to anyone, and that includes those within this hemicycle, who wishes to ask us about the arguments that have led us to put forward any particular proposal contained in the Constitution. The Intergovernmental Conference will open in precisely one month, under the Italian Presidency, a representative of which will perhaps say something about this a little later. Most of the Convention members, before going their separate ways, expressed the desire that the conference will be brief and can be concluded by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Thessaloniki European Council decided that the conference would take our draft Constitution as its starting point. Three solutions are then possible. Either the Intergovernmental Conference will improve the draft Constitution although it is hard to imagine how it could achieve this,</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">…and I say this not out of the collective vanity of the text’s authors, but because this Conference will come up against two obstacles that the Convention did not have to face: shortness of time and the rule of unanimity. How, in fact, could a draft that took us sixteen months of continual work to draw up be improved on in two and a half months? Furthermore, how can unanimity provide more thorough solutions than those on which we struggled to reach consensus? Let us be good sportsmen, however! If the Intergovernmental Conference succeeds in improving the Constitution, the Convention Members will be the first to applaud its success.</p>
<p class="contents">The second possibility is that the Intergovernmental Conference will end up submitting proposals that are less worthy than those put forward by the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">This could have serious consequences. The reservations or criticism expressed in various quarters about our proposals, in particular those concerning institutional matters, suggest a very real risk. We cannot alter one part of the building without risking bringing down the entire construction. Those who think they can make substantial changes to our institutional proposals are, I believe, mistaken. By probably satisfying a few people, they run the risk of dissatisfying and disappointing everyone else.</p>
<p class="contents">The third solution, which appears to be the most suitable one, consists of approving the draft Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">If the draft Constitution produced by the Convention is to be approved, however, we would equally have to accept, of course, and I address my words now to the Presidency representatives, that some unanimously accepted amendments will need to be made to it. I wish to ask you, without dwelling too much on the matter, to consider the gravity of the consequences of failure. Because of the time of year, the location, the sunshine and the pleasure I am taking in being here with you, a degree of optimism appears to permeate this meeting. I ask you nevertheless to consider the consequences and the seriousness of failure, the disappointment and the frustration that this would create amongst the entire European public.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, let us not forget that after the Intergovernmental Conference, we will face the real ordeal by fire: the draft’s ratification in each Member State, in each of the twenty-five Member States. This ratification is by no means a foregone conclusion. My personal conviction is that, after making an intense effort to provide explanations and to persuade people, if the draft Constitution as drawn up by the Convention is submitted to ratification by the people, in the form of referendums in some countries and of parliamentary approval in others, it will ultimately be approved everywhere. If, on the other hand, what is submitted is a mutilated or truncated draft Constitution, I fear that it will be rejected in one or more Member States. Indeed, if the draft is forced to undergo cuts in this way, it would lose two of the crucial arguments used to support and defend it: coherence and balance, which have come together in the draft Constitution. We would, therefore, be unleashing a crisis that Europe really does not need in the current climate, and this is a crisis to which it is hard to imagine a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the European Parliament has a crucial role to play throughout this process and I would ask you to be active and vigilant. Indeed, it is your duty to ensure that the general public is well informed. What is needed is not a traditional-style Intergovernmental Conference and by that I mean a diplomatic one, where what is being debated between politicians, experts or diplomats are the mutual advantages that some attempt to achieve at the expense of others. No, this will be a constitutional Intergovernmental Conference of a type never seen before, which must result in the creation of a Constitution. It must, therefore, adhere to specific rules. Observers from your Parliament will take part in this conference, and they must alert the public and demand transparency!</p>
<p class="contents">At the last sitting of the Convention that you attended, Mr President-in-Office of the Council and members of the Convention, I suggested that the Intergovernmental Conference should take its inspiration from our working method, which was actually imposed on us, by making it mandatory to make public, if necessary on the Internet, any proposal to change the Constitution and any amendment to it.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This will give the general public and the media a precise idea of the content of the debates. Similarly, I feel it would be legitimate for you to be informed at each of your plenary part-sessions of the state of the Conference’s work, as I informed the European Council on behalf of the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">You will, therefore, deliver an opinion on this Intergovernmental Conference and you will do so before the conference opens in Rome. It is you, of course, who have the crucial responsibility of drafting this opinion and of adopting it, but it could, I believe, serve as a warning. If the scope of the constitutional treaty, which has been drawn up with the utmost transparency by the Convention and with your considerable contribution, is substantially diminished by the Intergovernmental Conference and is consequently rejected by the European Parliament, it will have little chance of being ratified by the States and by the peoples of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">If, on the other hand, the Union’s governments adopt at the Conference a constitutional treaty that closely resembles the draft Convention – we do not expect it to be exactly the one we have drawn up – and if this receives the approval of the European Parliament, it will occupy a central position in the great political debate that will take place in the European elections of June 2004. This will provide an opportunity for appealing to all players on our continent, for garnering the interest of civil society and for helping the ‘don’t knows’ to make up their minds. These are the people who have lost confidence in the Union’s ability to unite and to renew itself.</p>
<p class="contents">The main debate in the European elections will consequently echo the more modest work of our Convention, by helping to bring Europeans closer to the Union, to better understand it so that they can ultimately recognise themselves in it. Ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, at the very end of our work, we added into the Constitution, at the request of your representatives, a number of symbols and, in particular, a slogan for the European Union, which is ‘united in its diversity’. I urge you, I beg you to help Europe to provide itself with a Constitution that will enable it to remain free, peaceful and content through being united in its diversity.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fini,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, I would like to start by expressing my sincere, heartfelt thanks – on behalf of the Italian Government, which I have had the honour of representing throughout the European Convention – to the Chairman, Mr Giscard d’Estaing, and the Convention for their work. The Italian Government and the Italian public, which is deeply pro-European and fully endorses the Chairman’s words and, more generally, the text adopted by the Convention, echoes the applause with which the House received Mr Giscard d’Estaing’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">This was a genuinely significant moment and one which may justifiably be described as historic. I would like, first of all, to express my deep satisfaction at the fact that the Thessaloniki Council endorsed the draft Constitution adopted by the Convention, describing it as a historic step towards achieving the objectives of European integration and then describing the Treaty as a ‘sound basis’ upon which to open the Intergovernmental Conference which is to take place during the Italian Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, the Convention’s task went far beyond the – albeit important – role of adjusting the institutions’ mechanisms and rules. The Laeken mandate was explicit: to rethink the entire European institutional set-up on the eve of the major historic event of the reunification of the old continent once and for all. For the first time in the history of European integration, the task was not entrusted to – albeit esteemed – government officials, but to a genuinely democratic, representative assembly, in other words to a Convention made up of representatives of the national parliaments, the European Parliament and the Commission, and representatives both of those countries which have been part of the European Union from the beginning and of those which are about to become full members of our great family.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, after 16 months of work, we have achieved a major result which was, in many respects, unhoped for and which I feel is even more significant if we consider the innovative nature of the working method which the Praesidium proposed to the Convention. We have consistently sought to achieve the widest possible consensus, without ever having to resort to the traditional method of a vote. That is why the Intergovernmental Conference’s work, while not without difficulties, will certainly be facilitated by the fact that it is not dealing with several alternatives for a text but, quite the opposite, with a single text which has the broad support of the members of the Convention and has already been endorsed by the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">It is why the Italian Presidency considers that Mr Giscard d’Estaing is right when he states categorically that the further the Intergovernmental Conference moves away from the agreement reached by the Convention, the more difficult it will be to find consensus again and, therefore, the greater the likelihood of failure, and that failure would be a resounding defeat. It would not just be the failure of the Presidency or the Convention: it would be failure to live up to the expectations of those millions upon millions of Europeans who genuinely believe that the time has come to establish not just common rules but common, shared values too.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore pleased with the end result. We have made that clear publicly before our own citizens, before the Italian parliament, but it is right to state the fact once again in this Chamber. The text was, indeed, a compromise, but a superior, noble compromise between different bodies, perspectives and interests, a compromise based on a number of points which we feel to be essential and which I too want to mention again briefly: the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the text of the Constitution; changing the complex and, in some respects, outdated pillar structure of the current Treaties; clearer distribution of powers between the Union and the Member States with all due regard for national identities and the internal organisation of the respective States, that dual principle to which Mr Giscard d’Estaing referred; the introduction of mechanisms to ensure genuine respect for the principle of subsidiarity and to bring about increasingly extensive involvement of the national parliaments in the work of the Union. The Convention established that there are four institutions: the Council, the European Parliament, the Commission and also the national parliaments, which represent the will of the people.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the classification of legal and financial documents and instruments, with the introduction for the first time of a proper hierarchy of norms; the creation of the office of European Minister for Foreign Affairs – possibly the most innovative institutional figure to have emerged from the Convention’s work, following the merging of the duties performed thus far by the High Representative and the Commissioner for External Relations. Of equal importance is the potential future merging of the posts of Mr President-in-Office of the Council and Commission President. In addition, qualified majority voting will be further extended to other areas.</p>
<p class="contents">A great deal has been achieved. If anyone were to ask whether any more could have been done, I would say yes, more could and should have been done, but the compromise reached may be the only one possible. In a 25- or 27-Member State Union, continuing on the basis of unanimous decision-making would have brought the end of the Union’s ability to govern properly owing to<span class="bold"> </span>the complexities of public opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by saying a few words, Mr President, regarding the institutional balance of powers achieved by the Convention: a delicate balance, a balance that has been sought right from day one because it was quite clear to the entire Convention that the power of one institution could not be increased to the detriment of another. It is a balance based on the distribution of powers between the European Council, which takes on the role of a political institution, with the task of laying down the Union’s guidelines and general political priorities, the Commission, representing the Member States, which keeps its central role of guardian of the Treaties and guarantor of the Community interest, and the European Parliament, which becomes a full colegislator.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to stress in this Chamber that one of the most important innovations is the election of the Commission by the European Parliament, which thus sees its legislative codecision and budgetary powers increased – with the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure ceasing to exist – and which acquires the right to propose a future revision of the Constitution, if necessary, using the Convention method.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the others, this innovation is part of an institutional package which, as Mr Giscard d’Estaing said, certainly leaves room for improvement, although it would be extremely dangerous to attempt to modify it to any great extent for fear of upsetting the balance of a complex system based on the dual legitimacy granted by national States and citizens, as achieved in the Convention. That is why the delicate but considerable balance achieved by the Convention will be the basic reference for the Intergovernmental Conference. To preserve this spirit and ensure continuity and consistency with the work carried out by the Convention, I believed and continue to believe it desirable for the representatives of the Commission and the European Parliament to take part in Conference and for the Chairman of the Convention and its Vice-Chairmen, Mr Amato and Mr Dehaene, to take part too.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament must continue to play a fundamental part in this stage of the project of constitutional reform. During the July part-session, Mr Berlusconi called for the greatest possible involvement of the institution and I would like to stress the need for this once again.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to express a hope which I am sure will be realised: that the European Parliament take up its monitoring duties without delay, not just to ensure that the proceedings of the Intergovernmental Conference are open and transparent, as we are seeking to guarantee, but, first and foremost, to ensure that it reflects the expectations of the citizens and that the governments do not give way to the temptation to destroy the valuable fruit of the Convention’s labour. Indeed, if this major opportunity were to be lost, it would be a negative signal for all the European citizens and we would certainly be doing irreparable damage to the project of European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have certainly come a long way in the over 50 years which have elapsed since the day of what may be considered the birth of the European Union: the Robert Schuman declaration of 9 May 1950 which proposed the joint management of a small number of interests – relating to energy, raw materials and economic affairs – to promote and implement the principles of solidarity and peace.</p>
<p class="contents">The project of building a united Europe is currently going through a crucial stage in its history with, on the one hand, reunification with the countries of the east, which are once again fully embracing the principles of freedom and democracy, and, on the other, the transition from an economic dimension to a political dimension, which can only go hand in hand with the building of a European identity which will enable the Union to become an element of stability, prosperity and peace on the world stage. These are the epoch-making challenges facing the Europe, united in diversity, which is evoked in the preamble to the Constitution: a Europe composed of States which are pooling their sovereignty and powers without losing their identities.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in a spirit of fidelity to its Europeanist tradition, which is the heritage of the Italian people and of all the political groupings of my country, that the Italian Presidency intends to conduct the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference. The first Treaty of Rome launched European unification; the second must – and will – bring about the transition to the new reunified Europe: a Union which is politically and economically stronger, destined to become an element of stability and prosperity on the world stage. We can say with confidence, on the basis of the text of the reform Treaty adopted by the Convention, that we really are just a step away from achieving this historic goal.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Frattini,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(IT)</span> As Mr Giscard d’Estaing and Mr Fini have said, the Convention has indeed represented and established a pillar in the process of European integration, and the Italian Presidency sees this achievement as a basic reference for the work of the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three guiding principles which the Presidency intends to follow in directing the proceedings of the Intergovernmental Conference, which, as you are aware, will open on 4 October in Rome. First of all, the Presidency considers it essential to adhere to the timetable drawn up by the Thessaloniki European Council: this will mean pressing ahead resolutely in an attempt to achieve a positive outcome in time for the European Parliament elections scheduled for June 2004. This requirement has dictated the Italian Presidency's primary objective of conducting the IGC proceedings at a rapid pace, in the hope of reaching an overall, comprehensive agreement on the constitutional text by December. The future Constitutional Treaty – a Constitution for Europe, as Mr Giscard d’Estaing has described it – can then be signed sometime between 1 May 2004, the date on which the ten new Member States will join the Union, and the European Parliament elections scheduled for June 2004. Any extension of the constitutional negotiations beyond those dates would raise two serious problems of legitimacy and democratic transparency: on the one hand, it would mean a gradual dissipation of the constituent foundations built up by the Convention, and, on the other, it would mean asking the European voters to elect their Parliament without knowing the constitutional shape of the future Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The second objective of the Presidency is to preserve the structure and balance of the text drawn up by the Convention. We do, as I have already said, consider it appropriate to respect what can only be described as the constituent foundations built up over 16 months by a democratic body in which governments, national parliaments and Union institutions were represented. At the same time, we consider it inappropriate to reopen debates which are now well and truly over. The political wealth accrued as a result of the success achieved will not be dissipated or weakened by the Conference’s proceedings; rather, the Conference must undertake to improve and supplement those parts of the Treaty on which full agreement has not yet been reached, the parts of the Treaty – I reiterate for the sake of clarity – which do not deal with the institutional pillars defined by the Convention. The Italian Presidency will therefore oppose any questioning of the overall balance of the draft and its basic features. The Presidency believes that the interests of Europe and the European citizens must prevail over any defence of particular interests which could lead to substantial amendments of any kind to the Treaty. From this point of view, the opinions presented by Parliament and the European Commission will be factors to be taken into full consideration in the course of the Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">The third and final point which will constitute a guideline during the Conference is the need to achieve consensus on a number of topics which are still controversial using the desired principle of unanimity: this will, under no circumstances, force the Italian Presidency to negotiate a ‘downwards’ compromise which would constitute a retreat from the Convention’s proposals.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Our aim is to achieve a high-quality outcome commensurate with the European public’s expectations and capable of ensuring that the Union functions effectively and democratically on a long-term basis. We are not drafting a Constitution for Europe designed to last only a few years, and here we are relying on the fundamental support of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Italian Presidency has started the procedures for convening the Intergovernmental Conference, which will open in Rome on 4 October. We believe that the Conference must be conducted at a high political level, as has already been stipulated by the European Council, namely at Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister level, but we also believe that the representatives of all the European institutions must take part so that the IGC is genuinely the ideal continuation of the Convention’s work. On that basis, I will put forward a proposal to the effect that the European Parliament should be guaranteed participation through its representatives in the work of the IGC, both at the level of Foreign Affairs Ministers and at the level of Heads of Government, with the participation of the President of the European Parliament. Any other solution would, indeed, represent a step backwards in relation to the democratic method for revising the Treaties based on the principle and the requirement of transparency and consideration for the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we intend to seek the views and recommendations of Parliament and the other European institutions in the firm belief that, as Mr Fini has already said, endowing the European Union with a Constitution is a challenge not just for some countries more than others, still less just for the Italian Presidency, which has the honour of guiding the Council through this phase: it is a challenge for everybody. We owe it to our citizens: if we fail to meet this challenge we have failed everyone, including those – and I hope that there will not be anybody – who have attempted to make particular interests prevail over the general interest. We undertake to prevent any such destructive attempts succeeding.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Commission</span>. <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Giscard d'Estaing, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my warm thanks to all the members of the Convention, and to you, Mr Giscard d'Estaing, in particular, for the dedication and intelligence you have shown in the long months of intense work that have distinguished this phase of the constitution-building process. The successful experiment of the Convention has brought a lasting change in the course of democratic life in the European Union. A great job well done and an unhoped-for result.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft prepared by the Convention thus provides the basis – I would say an excellent basis – for drawing up the final version of the Constitution. This is a good thing because, above all, the text has great symbolic value: this is the first time the Union's foundations have been debated in an open, democratic forum representative of the peoples and States of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the draft Constitution resolutely tackles the issues of the institutional balance of powers and the complex nature of the Union. The debate has been intense and thorough, and it has allowed all the fundamental issues put forward to be dealt with coherently, namely: finding a new, more effective way of reconciling the two tracks of European integration, the Community and the intergovernmental; striking a balance between the States' political representation and that of the people, and the resulting roles of Parliament and the Council; devising a way to organise the representation of the Union's general interest and the legitimate interests of the individual Member States. Thirdly and lastly, the Convention has laid the basis for the essential task of bringing the Union's policies up to date.</p>
<p class="contents">The Intergovernmental Conference that is to finalise and formalise the work of the Convention is now commencing. I see two extreme standpoints emerging and I believe we need to discuss this frankly. On the one hand, there are those who believe the Convention's draft should be left unaltered because it represents the only compromise possible. Then there are those who would like to throw everything up for discussion again because sovereignty is ultimately vested in the States and the last word should be theirs.</p>
<p class="contents">However understandable those standpoints might be, I believe both are open to criticism. From the start – ever since the Commission and Parliament advocated the Convention approach after Nice – we in the Commission have always said that the Intergovernmental Conference should be a short, focused, conclusive phase. This does not mean, however, that it should just be a rubber stamp, because that would deprive the Intergovernmental Conference of its political responsibility. Clearly, this Intergovernmental Conference cannot be compared with any other that has gone before, since it will be working on the basis of the excellent work of the Convention. It still has its primary function, however, which is to allow the Heads of State and Government to exercise their political responsibility and present the definitive text for approval to the institutions and, as Mr Giscard d’Estaing said, the citizens of their Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It therefore involves a new phase of political ownership. That does not, of course, demand a lengthy Intergovernmental Conference, but it does call for a proper period of reflection. Indeed, there are aspects of the draft Constitution that bear clear witness to the fact that the compromise reached is incomplete and that the result achieved to date cannot be the end of the line, as we had originally hoped. Therefore, it is right for the Member States, in whom sovereignty is ultimately vested, to be able to discuss it further in order to see whether there are areas where it can be improved. It is the Commission's duty and responsibility to point out such areas.</p>
<p class="contents">As it stands, the draft Constitution still provides for unanimous decision-making in over 50 sectors, including some key areas of the Union’s work. Everyone agrees, moreover, that one of the shortcomings in the current situation is the lack of a proper instrument for coordination of Member States' budgetary policies. However, I wonder how people think such coordination can be achieved if the current power of veto is preserved, and the same applies to indirect and company taxation.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the key issue of the future balance of powers between the Commission, the Council and Parliament. The draft Constitution proposes a Commission made up in a way that will, in my opinion and the opinion of the College, make the institution representing the Union's general interest less able to do its work effectively and credibly. The solution put forward creates a distinction between Commissioners by creating a second, unnecessarily lesser, category. No people of the Union deserves to be represented by a second-class Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It would mean splitting the College, where the link with the Member States has been the Commission's driving force for the last 50 years. More progress is therefore needed – and this is not at all incompatible with the need to keep the Intergovernmental Conference brief and bring it to a swift conclusion – to make sure every Member country has a full Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the present text of the draft Constitution leaves choices open on key points, such as the way the Councils are to work and responsibilities in the field of external relations. The task of the Intergovernmental Conference is to make the work of the institutions more transparent and more effective and to prevent duplication and halfway solutions that may breed future conflicts. This is a matter of facilitation rather than innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the Convention did not have time to update the current wording of the Community policies. In some cases, this dates back to the 1950s and has been partly or wholly superseded. It will obviously be difficult to settle all the issues still outstanding, but it is our duty to take a step back from the current political circumstances and give careful, discerning thought to those points where it is still possible to make the changes which are necessary to make the constitutional structure even more capable of meeting the challenges ahead. We do, of course, need to see whether the political will exists. Is there no such will or is it a sense of realism that is inducing us to refrain from tackling these issues and to leave the text as it is? If this is the case, the Commission is, of course, willing to take note of this calmly and realistically, mindful of the fact that very significant progress has, in any case, been made.</p>
<p class="contents">Essentially, this has been the case every time the Treaties have been amended. It was true for the Single European Act and for the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties, and it may be true here too, but we must realise that, as happened in those cases, we will need to be ready to cope with further crises and, therefore, to negotiate further changes and adaptations. This may always have been part and parcel of European integration – a mixture of vision and reaction to crises induced by growth. It is the history we have lived through and we know it well, even if there are times when we need to move forward more quickly. This is definitely one of those times.</p>
<p class="contents">At all events, if we want to capitalise on our experience and if we genuinely want to draft a Constitution that will last, we must provide for mechanisms that allow decisions to be taken tomorrow where they cannot be taken today. We therefore need – and I am coming to the end but also the final key point of my brief speech – to look at more realistic procedures for amending the Constitution that will allow us to act quickly and effectively where, under pressure of crises – and crises there will inevitably be – the arrangements we are setting out today prove to be insufficient. Indeed, the worst-case scenario would be to find ourselves with inadequate constitutional provisions that, in practice, simply cannot be amended because of the requirement of unanimous agreement among 25 or more Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This is true of unanimous decision-making, which still applies today in many sectors, and it is therefore even more true when it comes to bringing policies up to date, a process which we are unable to tackle now. A Constitution set in stone for all time which could not be relied on to provide the solution to future crises would be the negation of the whole history of European integration. This we must avoid at all costs if we want to perform the historic task entrusted to us responsibly.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in our work, we need to keep a clear vision of the path the Union must continue to follow: peace, freedom and solidarity must continue to be our goals in the day-to-day work of the institutions. To do this, we must give the Union the practical tools to achieve those goals. The Union must speak with a single voice in the world – a strong, authoritative, peaceable voice. Internally and externally, it must be able to uphold the force of law which imposes duties but also protects the individual, safeguarding freedom to act in an ordered, creative society.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the Union must have the means to show solidarity. This takes the form of support for the most vulnerable in an inclusive society. It is expressed through joint action to provide assistance in the event of natural disasters. It is based on the duty of mutual defence, in the firm conviction that the defence of each and every Member State is the best way to show that we belong to a single family.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, a new phase has now started: we must finish off the excellent work of the Convention wisely, resolutely and with courage. Of course, it needs to be brought to a swift conclusion, but, above all, it needs to be brought to a satisfactory conclusion. The Commission will continue to do its part to help achieve that aim.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Méndez de Vigo (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, a few weeks before the Convention began its work, when Mr Klaus Hänsch and I visited the President of the Convention in his house in Paris, after we had left that meeting I noted in my diary, ‘We will be successful if we manage to create the spirit of the Convention’.</p>
<p class="contents">What did we understand by ‘the spirit of the Convention’? We meant ensuring that the members of the Convention were aware of the historic importance of the moment, of the difficulty of the challenge and of the will to rethink Europe in accordance with what was best for the citizens in the new Europe following the great enlargement. </p>
<p class="contents">I believe that in the creation of that Convention spirit, which has been the key to this success, you have played a leading role, Mr President. I believe that the applause following your speech today demonstrates that this Parliament has appreciated your work at the head of this Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Why in this task of rethinking Europe was it so necessary to convince ourselves of its difficulty? I believe that what we have carried out is an exercise in realising those slogans which this European Parliament has had since the 1990s: more democracy, more efficiency and more transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this Constitution is more democratic, more efficient and more transparent. It creates a Europe which is also imbued with these ideas. Why? Because we have modified the institutional system. It is true that we have done so, but we have done so precisely in order to provide the European Union with greater democracy. </p>
<p class="contents">We only have to remember and compare the model of the ECSC Treaty; we only have to remember what that assembly was, that predecessor of this Parliament in the ECSC Treaty. Today this Parliament, with this Constitution, is a fully democratic Parliament, fully integrated into the decision-making process. But we have also managed to integrate the national Parliaments into this decision-making process. And we have also ensured that the citizens can activate popular initiative when the law so establishes.</p>
<p class="contents">This idea of more democracy is reflected in the Constitution. Also the idea of more efficiency – and that is why we have modified the institutional system. We have modified it profoundly. I believe we have always borne in mind the idea of safeguarding the necessary balance between the institutions, that that has been the fundamental premise of all our work. The truth is that only time will tell whether we have achieved that or not. But I believe that, in the modifications we have introduced, the idea of preserving the balance was absolutely essential.</p>
<p class="contents">Our work has ended. Now we have the Intergovernmental Conference. I believe that to criticise the Constitution – to say that it should have been done this way or that – is the work of experts and professors, but I do not believe it is the work of the European Parliament. The work of the European Parliament is to take a political position with regard to the Constitution. We are going to do so in the report for which our fellow Members, Mr Gil Robles and Mr Tsatsos, are rapporteurs.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, Mr President, that you have presented the European Parliament with a challenge today. I remember that in the twenties there was a debate in Germany on the guardian of the Constitution between Carl Schmitt and Hans Kelsen: <span class="italic">Der Hüter der Verfassung. </span><span class="italic">Wer soll der Hüter der Verfassung sein? </span>[The guardian of the Constitution. Who should the guardian of the Constitution be?]</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the political work of this European Parliament today, the political message we have to send is that we are becoming guardians of this Constitution. This Constitution is one which this Parliament believes to be good for Europe and for its citizens. I therefore believe that our political message should be to become the guardians of this Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, Mr President, we must play an active part in the Intergovernmental Conference. And I am glad that Mr Fini, who is also imbued with that Convention spirit, has said that the presence of the European Parliament will be real. We do not want it to be ceremonial, we do not simply want to take lunch in Rome, although Rome is a wonderful city. What we want to do is to continue bringing our ideas and our impetus to this Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, it has been an honour to chair the delegation of the European Parliament, it has certainly been one of the most wonderful adventures, without doubt the most wonderful of my political life, but above all I would like to say here today in this House that I believe that in the end the great beneficiaries will be the citizens of Europe.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hänsch (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, President Giscard d'Estaing, our work in the Convention was not always free of conflicts – and nor, indeed, was the work of the praesidium – but we agreed on our objective, which was to create one single text for a European constitution, and in that we succeeded. We followed the wise counsel of Jean Monnet, who said that writing down what should be is easy, but that what matters is writing down what can be. The Convention did precisely that. What we are putting before the governments is well-considered, balanced, and, above all, achievable if we have the will to do it. Previous Intergovernmental Conferences and EU summits have always made themselves the yardstick for success or the lack of it. That now belongs in the past. The results of the Rome Intergovernmental Conference will be measured against those of the Convention. That, ladies and gentlemen, is our success.</p>
<p class="contents">We have not managed to achieve everything that we wanted, and not all of what has been achieved can be counted an undoubted success. We would have liked all future laws – including especially those on taxation – to be decided on by qualified majority in the Council. We would have liked the Common Foreign and Security Policy to be another area in which the Member States would reach decisions by qualified majority. We know how fragile some solutions are, the compromise on the size of the Commission and on voting in it being one example. All this is on the outermost boundary of constitutional good sense. We also know, however, that what is described therein is a compromise and not, moreover, one reached on the lowest common denominator. This draft constitution has not become a mere list of compromises, but has remained an internally coherent piece of legislation, and so we must resist all temptations to repackage these compromises.</p>
<p class="contents">The governments were represented at the Convention. They had a hand in what was finally agreed on. The desire of some of them to withdraw from this consensus not only fills me with concern, but it is also dangerous. The fact is, ladies and gentlemen, that we will not end up with a new and better draft, but with a second Treaty of Nice. That is something we have to prevent.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s evident willingness to play along with this leaves me astonished and baffled.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Do you really believe, Mr President of the Commission, that what you have said here has not also been said and discussed in the Convention? Do you believe that the Commission’s delegates did not put these ideas forward when they sat in the praesidium and the Convention? What you and they desire is perhaps the right thing, but you will get the wrong result. What you have put forward will result in nothing more than a return to the old, traditional Intergovernmental Conference, to the same old horse-trading that we saw at Intergovernmental Conferences in the past. Do not imagine that you will gain support for this, Mr President of the Commission, so abandon your game. What the Convention has built up, you are pulling apart.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Finally, once this Intergovernmental Conference is over – and we hope it will be a success – I can only urge and implore Mr Fini and Mr Frattini, whose statements I welcome, to stand by what they said, to ensure that the Intergovernmental Conference makes this draft Europe’s constitution; then, ladies and gentlemen, let us mobilise the people in our Member States. Let us then tell them what is unique about what the Convention has brought forth, a constitution for so many states and peoples, separated from one another for half a century by the division of Europe and by Communist dictatorship, given by this Convention their first opportunity to play their part, through their representatives, in shaping Europe’s future. To our parliamentary counterparts from the East, from Central and Southern Europe, who took part for the first time, I have this to say: not only did you follow the work that was done, but you gave something to the Convention!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">For it is unique, this constitution for twenty-five – and more – states and peoples who, for centuries, have robbed and killed each other, waged war on one another and laid each other waste, and who now want to join together in shaping the future. It is a constitution for twenty-five – and more – peoples, each with their own traditions, tongues and histories, all desirous of retaining their identities, yet uniting in a common destiny. That is the great thing about this draft constitution. That is the great thing about the unification of Europe, to which we must hold fast and with which we must press on. That responsibility is ours. We face the same situation as did the fathers and mothers of Europe’s unification in the 1950s. By joining in a European Community, they were courageous and far-sighted enough to set aside the thousand-year enmity between Germany and France and to make a start on uniting Western Europe. We, as politicians of our generation, have, for the first time in a millennium, the opportunity to unite the whole continent in freedom and peace. We must summon up the same courage and far-sightedness as did the founding fathers of European unity fifty years ago. That, ladies and gentlemen, is our destiny.</p>
