<p>Rural areas account for 80% of the EU's territory and 25% of its population. Rural depopulation is continuing, and, despite the Union's efforts to support rural development, the countryside remains at a severe disadvantage in terms of social, labour and human indicators by comparison with urban areas.</p>
<p>The closure of rural schools is in many cases not a consequence but a cause of depopulation. However, the successive rural development programmes have not used existing rural educational resources as dynamising agents: the Community programmes aimed at redressing imbalances in less-developed and more isolated areas have not interacted sufficiently with those aimed at improving the education and training levels of their inhabitants. By contrast, the use of the human and material resources of rural schools would require the mobilisation of key strategic factors for the realisation of EDRF and ESF objectives and, in general, those of all the various policies for regional cohesion in the Community.</p>

<p>Council Regulation (EC) No of 17 May 1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), among the rural development measures eligible for cofinancing under the programmes presented by the Member States, provides for support for vocational training intended to contribute towards improving the vocational skills and competences of farmers or other persons involved in farming or forestry activities, and their retraining. This applies, for instance, to the implementation of production methods compatible with the upkeep and improvement of the landscape and environmental protection, or to gaining the level of professional qualification required to manage an economically viable farm.</p>
<p>The following are, however, explicitly excluded from support under Commission Regulation (EC) 1750/1999 of 23 July 1999: any educational or training courses which form part of the standard secondary or higher education curriculum in agriculture or forestry, and, in the programmes submitted to the Commission, Member States must, in addition to outlining the eligible schemes and beneficiaries, provide assurance that no standard educational programme or scheme is put forward for Community funding. The scope of these measures for the purposes of vocational training is therefore not the same as that of the Socrates Programme which the Council, in response to the Commission proposal, has just decided to renew.</p>
<p>Socrates, the Community’s action programme in the field of education, the second phase of which was established by decision No 253/2000/EC of the Parliament and the Council, seeks to contribute to the development of quality education by encouraging cooperation between the Member States and by supporting and supplementing their action. According to Article 149 (ex-Article 126) of the EC Treaty, the responsibility for the content of teaching and the organisation of the educational systems lies with the Member States.</p>
<p>The school education chapter of the programme, Comenius, aims at enhancing the quality and the European dimension of school education throughout the Community. Comenius targets all schools of the Member States, be they rural or urban, and it seeks to encourage transnational cooperation between schools, to contribute to improved professional development of staff in the school education sector, and to promote the learning of languages and intercultural awareness.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0838"></a>

<p>The Commission has already had occasion to present its views on the conditions for the application of Structural Funds in the event of natural disasters in its statement to the European Parliament of 25 October 2000.<a href="#defann_3_1" name="refann_3_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></p>
<p>With regard to the resources of the European Agricultural Guarantee and Guidance Fund (EAGGF), the Commission has not received any official requests from the authorities of either Spain or Italy with a view to reallocating resources from this fund following the recent natural disasters.</p>
<p>It should be pointed out that the Council Regulation on support for rural development<span class="sup">2<a href="#defann_3_2" name="refann_3_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a></span> gives Member States the option of including in their rural development plans measures pursuant to the twelfth item of Article 33 on restoring agricultural production potential damaged by natural disasters and introducing appropriate prevention instruments. A number of Spanish and Italian regional plans have indeed included a provision of this sort for the programming period 2000-2006.</p>
<p>EAGGF resources could consequently be set aside on this legal basis, on the proviso that they remained less than the financial contribution of each Member State. With regard to the regions affected, and in consideration of the extent of the damage, reprogramming within the limits of the available appropriations seems probable but must be submitted to the Commission for examination and, if necessary, approval.</p>
<p>With regard to the Community initiative Interreg III, there have been no specific requests from the Member States concerned. This does not, however, exclude the possibility that some action with regard to natural disasters, particularly with a view to prevention, may be included in the proposed programmes for sections A and B of Interreg III which are to be submitted to the Commission in the next few weeks. The Interreg programme cannot take actual expenses related to such action into consideration until the competent national and/or regional authorities present their proposed programmes.</p>
<p>More specifically regarding the Italian regions mentioned by the honourable Member, on 27 July 2000, the Commission finalised the list of Italian regions eligible for Structural Fund action under Objective 2 for the period 2000-2006. The regions of Trento, Piedmont, Val d’Aosta, Liguria and Lombardy, which were affected by the flooding in September and October, have not to date officially presented their Single Programming Document proposals under this objective. As soon as these proposals have been received, the Commission will assess the possibility of undertaking action in these areas along the lines already presented to the European Parliament on 25 October 2000.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Since the honourable Member’s oral question was tabled, the Commission has implemented a raft of measures intended to improve the effectiveness of the provision of information, both centralised and decentralised.</p>
<p>Efficiency has been sought in the structures implemented in order to ensure cooperation and coordination. Coordination is effective at a number of levels:</p>
<p>- At departmental level: regular meetings chaired by the Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs bring together the Commission departments directly or indirectly affected by the issue of the euro. The European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Parliament (EP) are invited to attend these meetings.</p>
<p>- At the level of ECB and the Eurosystem (European System of Central Banks), the Commission monitors, as an observer, the meetings of the group responsible for monitoring and directing the euro information campaign. A monthly meeting is held in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>- At Member State level, and, more specifically, at the level of ministries and other bodies responsible for conducting the euro information campaigns, meetings of the euro communication campaign directors are convened by the Commission (the Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs). Five or six meetings are planned for next year. The last meeting, held on 23 and 24 October in Strasbourg, at the invitation of the European Parliament, made it possible to hear Mr Karas and Mrs Randzio-Plath speak, and also, for the first time, to bring together all the national and institutional operators involved in the euro information campaigns. Many Members of Parliament took part in this meeting. This experiment will be repeated in 2001, as it provides a useful opportunity to exchange ideas and experience informally and to involve the Members of Parliament. Another initiative, a scoreboard for the euro information campaigns being conducted in the Member States and by the Commission, will be drawn up and regularly updated. Details of this will be passed on to the Members of Parliament.</p>
<p>- At national level, the Commission representatives and Parliament services take part in euro committee meetings (or similar meetings).</p>
<p>- At institutional level, the high level meeting between the European Parliament and the Commission provides the political forum for coordination.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to stress its determination to make every effort to ensure that the information on the euro provided by the various operators, our partners, is such as to overcome the lack of information noted today and to meet the expectations of citizens. Quite obviously, the role of the Member States is primordial and, in accordance with the principles of subsidiarity and decentralisation, it falls to the national states to devote their own budget and human resources to ensuring that their nationals are informed to as high a degree as possible and trained regarding the euro.</p>
<p>The Commission will play its role of coordination and promotion to the full, but only to the extent that its abilities and powers allow.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0803"></a>

<p>A serious oil spill has occurred off the island of Gotska Sandön, near Gotland in the Baltic, and the authorities have not – at least at the time of tabling this question – succeeded in ascertaining who caused it.</p>
<p>Several sources in the European media report that the oil spill, which occurred on Monday, 2 October 2000, has polluted some 90% of the island’s coast. The cleaning of the beach, which must of course begin without delay, will be extremely labour-intensive, because the island has no harbour and its coastal waters are shallow. The oil will have to be picked up by hand and taken back to the mainland.</p>
<p>The island, 3700 ha in area, has sandy beaches, and is known amongst other things for its 900 species of beetles, its plants and its grey seals. Fortunately no dead animals have yet been found on the islands. The timing of the accident was also fortunate in that most of the birds have already migrated. However, the oil presents a threat to the bird species which remain on the island.</p>
<p>What measures does the Commission propose to take to ensure that the person responsible for the oil spill off the coast of Gotska Sandön is found out as soon as possible and brought to justice?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The response to be given to marine pollution incidents primarily falls under the responsibility of the affected Member State.</p>
<p>In the field of accidental marine pollution, a Community action plan has been developed since 1978. The major elements of this plan are joint training initiatives, pilot projects for the development of combating means, the provision and exchange of information, and a task force including designated experts from the Member States, which is activated in case of accident.</p>
<p>A new decision setting up a Community framework for cooperation in the field of accidental or deliberate marine pollution should soon be finalised by Parliament and the Council. This instrument will not only bring together and consolidate the different actions carried out until now in the field of accidental pollution, but also include Community cooperation in the field of deliberate pollution at sea, in particular concerning operational spills from vessels. The financial reference for this amount for this decision for the period 2000 to 2006 is set at EUR 7 million. Once the decision is adopted, the Commission will propose concrete initiatives to be developed under this new Community framework. Such measures should in particular address reinforced cooperation in order to improve the identification of contravening vessels and further exchange of information on the efficiency of the prosecution systems applied in the different Member States. This will create synergies at Community level and should ultimately permit the application of dissuasive sanctions against the parties responsible for such criminal acts.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0825"></a>

<p>According to the Commission, the Netherlands failed to take appropriate measures with regard to the management of the cockle and mussel fishery in the Wadden Sea – designated as a special protection area under Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild birds – to ensure that the quality of the habitats of certain bird species does not deteriorate and that no significant disturbance occurs for those species, as required in Article 4(4) of Directive 79/409/EEC. The size of the area closed to the fishery was too small and limiting fishery to a level at which only at least 60% of the food requirements in the form of cockles and mussels remains available for birds in years of food shortage was considered to be insufficient.</p>
<p>The Netherlands failed to reply to both the letter of formal notice (sent 16 January 1996) and to the reasoned opinion (sent 23 September 1997). For this reason the Commission decided to take the case to the Court of Justice on 2 March 1998 (case registered by the Court under C-63/98).</p>
<p>Within the context of the Court proceedings the Netherlands responded for the first time to the allegations made in the case. This led to the Commission withdrawing the case since the substantive information provided by the Dutch authorities had to be taken into account. As a result, the allegations mentioned in the letter of formal notice and the reasoned opinion could not be considered any longer as sufficient to demonstrate a causal relationship between the fishery and possible effects on the birds, particularly since those allegations related to the period from 1993 and the Dutch shell fishery policy was under review. The Commission by letter of 30 November 1998 requested the Court to withdraw the case. By decision of 4 May 1999 the Chairman of the Court decided to delete the case. The Netherlands was condemned to pay the costs as it had failed to reply to the reasoned opinion in time which led to the Commission taking the case to the Court.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0833"></a>

<p>The Danube pollution caused by a cyanide spill following a damburst of a tailings pond in Baia Mare/Romania and an accident that occurred in 1998 in Aznalcóllar/Spain where a damburst poisoned the environment of the Coto Doñana National Park have increased public awareness of the environmental and safety hazards of mining activities and have also raised the question of the effectiveness of Community policies intended to prevent such disasters.</p>
<p>On 23 October 2000, the Commission adopted a communication on the "Safe operation of mining activities: a follow-up to recent mining accidents" (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2000&amp;nu_doc=0664">COM(2000) 664</a> final). This Communication describes the steps that the Commission envisages to take as a follow-up to recent mining accidents, as announced in its Communication of 3 May 2000 on Promoting sustainable development in the EU non-energy extractive industry (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2000&amp;nu_doc=0265">COM(2000) 265</a> final).</p>
<p>With regard to possible initiatives in the framework of Community environmental legislation, the Communication sets out three priority actions envisaged to improve the safety of mines. They relate to industrial risk management, management of mining waste and integrated pollution prevention and control:</p>
<p>- amendment of the Seveso II Directive (96/82/EC) to include mineral processing of ores and, in particular, tailings ponds or dams used in connection with such mineral processing of ores. Industrial operators performing these activities would thus be obliged to put into effect Safety Management Systems, including a detailed risk assessment on the basis of possible accident scenarios (proposal foreseen by mid-2001);</p>
<p>- an initiative on the management of mining waste. This initiative will take into account the results of a study launched by the Commission on the existing legislation and practices concerning the management of waste from the extractive industry. The study is to be completed by the end of 2000 for the 15 Member States and by mid-2001 for the candidate countries. The initiative on waste management will cover the environmental issues of the management of mining waste as well as the best practices, which could prevent environmental damage during the waste management.</p>
<p>- a reference document (BREF) under the Integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC) Directive (96/61/EC) describing the Best Available Techniques (BAT) to reduce everyday pollution and to prevent or mitigate accidents in the non-ferrous metals mining sector. This document would provide guidance and address both industry as well as the Member States' authorities responsible for issuing permits under the IPPC Directive.</p>
<p>These initiatives will be prepared in close cooperation with the candidate countries for accession to the Community. The Communication and the priority actions identified will constitute an important input to the ongoing work of the Baia Mare Task Force (BMFT), an international task force set up to examine the causes and consequences of the cyanide spill into the Danube, to propose remedial actions and to identify other high risk installations in the area, to avoid similar accidents in future. The BMFT will present its Final Report to the member of the Commission in charge of Environment on 15 December 2000.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0843"></a>

<p>The Commission initiated the Article 88(2) (ex-Article 93) of the Treaty procedure against the Swedish reduced social contributions scheme, because it has doubts as to its compatibility with Community State aid rules.</p>
<p>As pointed out, the low population density regions covered by the scheme are severely affected by high transport costs. This is why the Guidelines on national regional aid allow Member States to provide transport aid in such areas. In order to avoid abuse, the Guidelines provide that transport aid should be granted exclusively in relation to the extra costs of transport of goods incurred by companies located in low population density areas. They also provide that there should never be overcompensation of the extra transport costs.</p>
<p>A company's social security contribution is a function of the size of its workforce, and not of the extra transport costs it has incurred. There is therefore no link between the aid under the scheme and the extra transport costs incurred by the beneficiaries. This also means that there is no guarantee that there is no overcompensation of the extra transport costs. In view of this, the Commission maintains its doubts as to whether the scheme is in conformity with the regional aid guidelines.</p>
<p>The honourable Members draw the Commission's attention to the fact that Norway operates a similar aid scheme in its low population density regions. The Commission is aware of the existence of this scheme. The Norwegian scheme was approved by ESA in 1997. Following the opening of the Article 88(2) procedure against the Swedish Reduced social contributions scheme, the Commission has taken up the issue with the European free trade area (EFTA) Surveillance Authority. When the Commission has taken its final decision on the Swedish scheme, it will examine with the EFTA Surveillance Authority how best to proceed to ensure that State aid rules are implemented in a consistent manner throughout the entire European Economic Area.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0841"></a>

<p>The Commission shares the honourable Member’s opinion regarding the need to create conditions favourable to the development of renewable energies and the cogeneration of heat and power. That is why the new draft framework for State aid in favour of the environment stipulates the possibility of granting aid according to the following conditions:</p>
<p>For renewable energies, investment aid is possible at the base rate of 40 % of the eligible costs. This base rate may be incremented by bonuses of 10 % for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs), if the investment is to enable the supply of an entire community, such as, for instance, an island, as well as for businesses established in the regions eligible for regional aid.</p>
<p>Member States may, moreover, grant operating aid in accordance with several options.</p>
<p>In the first place, they may grant aid for a limited time period of 5 years, in principle to be degressive, according to the conditions applying to operating aid.</p>
<p>They may also grant aid intended to compensate for the difference between renewable energy production costs and the market price for electricity. Such aid is not limited in time but must cease when the investment has been written off. If necessary, financial costs and the reasonable remuneration of capital may possibly be taken into account in the amount of the investment.</p>
<p>Member States may also grant aid by using market mechanisms such as ‘green certificates’. Such aid may be authorised if it is essential in order to ensure the viability of renewable energies. It must not, however, lead to widespread overcompensation and must not serve to deter renewable energy producers from striving to increase their competitiveness.</p>
<p>For combined power and heat production, investment aid is possible at the base rate of 30 %, to which the same bonuses should be added as for renewable energies.</p>
<p>For cogeneration, operating aid is also provided for on the same conditions as for renewable energies, if the Member States can clearly demonstrate the need for this aid.</p>
<p>The Commission considers this to be a generous approach in terms of state aid, but one that is justified by the need to enable the Member States to take every possible measure to develop energies that are environmentally friendly and, in particular, in order to achieve the objectives of the proposed Parliament and Council directive on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources as well as the objectives set out in the Commission communication on cogeneration.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0789"></a>

<p>The Commission, however, shares the disappointment expressed by the honourable Member, that this positive development does not appear to have led to any marked reduction in the number of complaints about delays on travellers crossing between Spain and Gibraltar. The Commission considers that the checks conducted at the border which lead to these delays could not be proportionate to the legal and practical objectives they are intended to pursue.</p>

<p>Socotra is one of the most precious natural assets, not only for the Republic of Yemen but for mankind. It has been designated as a ‘World Heritage Site’ and a ‘Man and Biosphere reserve’ by UNESCO. The Yemenite Government has declared it a ‘Special Protected area’.</p>
<p>The outstanding plant bio-diversity of Socotra, and its rich marine environment are of global significance, and must be preserved. But we must also be able to attend the basic needs of the people who live there, and to give them a chance to enjoy all the benefits of modern society without damaging their fragile environment.</p>
<p>The Government of Yemen has recognised the need to formulate a master plan for the sustainable development of Socotra and has requested assistance in this task from the Commission. In recognition of the global value of these islands the Commission has agreed to provide up to 995 000 euros for the establishment of the Socotra Archipelago master plan. The project is presently undertaken by a consortium of European and Yemen consultants. The project which aims at striking the right balance between conservation and development, has just increased its second phase and will be completed early 2001.</p>
<p>The Master Plan will set out a programme for the economic and social development of the Archipelago during the period 2001-2010. This phased programme will include social, economic, financial, and environmental aspects. The Master plan must fully take into consideration the Archipelago’s presently particularly low level of development and its outstanding environmental assets and conservation policies. These latter are contained in the “Zoning Plan for Socotra Archipelago for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Bio-diversity and Natural Resources” which was prepared with the assistance of (UNDP) and recently approved by the Yemenite Government.</p>
<p>The recent Red Sea dispute with Eritrea made the Yemeni Government aware of the importance of fostering economic development in the Socotra Archipelago. At the same time it recognised the need to take adequate measures to protect the unique and valuable flora and fauna of the archipelago, in the interest of the local population as well as of the international community. Uncontrolled development would cause irreparable damage and thus be counterproductive in the long term. In agreeing to provide funding for the master plan study the Commission therefore aimed to support a balanced approach by the Yemeni authorities to the development of the Socotra Archipelago, giving equal importance to the needs of the local population and the protection of the habitat and natural resources of the islands. Only through such a comprehensive set of policies can the overall objective of sustainable development in the Archipelago be achieved.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0791"></a>

<p>As per its announcement to the plenary sitting of the European Parliament of 5 October 2000, during the topical and urgent debate on the subject of the shipwreck of the Samina, the Commission will in 2001 look into all the safety regulations covered by Directive 98/18/EC, particularly the issue of an age limit on ships and the exemption which applies to some Greek ships.</p>
<p>As regards the second part of the question, the Commission wishes to check that Directive 98/18 was indeed transposed by Greece in 1999 by Presidential Decree 103/99. This decree stipulates that all passenger vessels must have safety certificates. Given that the practical application of Community directives continues to be the exclusive responsibility of Member States, the Commission does not at this stage have information regarding Greece’s implementation of the directive.</p>
<p>After the wreck of the Samina, however, the Commission sent a letter to the Greek Government expressly asking for copies of the ship’s safety certificates as issued by the Greek authorities. It also requested evidence that the other provisions of Community legislation as applicable to passenger vessels had been complied with, namely the 1995 regulation on the safety management of ro-ro passenger vessels<a href="#defann_17_3" name="refann_17_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, the 1998 Directive on the registration of persons sailing on board passenger ships<a href="#defann_17_4" name="refann_17_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> and the 1994 Directive on the minimum level of training of seafarers<a href="#defann_17_5" name="refann_17_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In view of the fact that certain provisions of Directive 98/18/EC were to have been applied by 1 October 2000 at the latest, the Commission asked the Greek Government for confirmation that, as of this date, all passenger ships providing domestic services in Greece – except those covered by the exemption under Decision 1999/461/EC – have been operating in accordance with the relevant terms of Directive 98/18/EC.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The fact that the limits are both advisory and discretionary can cause much confusion for the travelling public.</p>

<p>In accordance with the principle governing the single market, private individuals may purchase goods tax-paid in one Member State, and then transport them to their own Member State without such goods being liable to further taxation there. In the case of products subject to excise duty, such as tobacco and alcoholic beverages, the same principle applies, provided that the products are purchased for personal use and are transported by the purchaser.</p>
<p>In order to assess whether products subject to excise duty are being held for commercial purposes rather than for personal use, Member States are authorised to consider various evidential factors, such as:</p>
<p>the commercial status and motives of the person holding the products,</p>
<p>the place where the products are located or the mode of transport used,</p>
<p>any documents relating to the products, and</p>
<p>the quantity of the products.</p>
<p>Where the last factor is concerned, the Member States are authorised to lay down, solely as an evidential factor, indicative levels which in no circumstances may be lower than those laid down in the directive (e.g. 800 cigarettes, 90 litres of wine, 10 litres of spirits).</p>
<p>It is only after considering all the factors referred to that the Member States may decide whether a person's transporting of products subject to excise duty should be deemed to be commercial in nature. Consequently, consideration solely of the information relating to quantities can never be sufficient on its own.</p>
<p>This administrative approach is clearly derived from Community rules. Moreover, whenever the Commission has been informed of situations in which the importing of products subject to excise duty by individual persons has been interpreted too restrictively at national level, it has immediately called upon the Member State concerned to change its administrative practice.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0802"></a>

<p>In March 2000, the US State Department's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs published a report entitled 'International Narcotics Control Strategy Report' which states (verbatim) that 'the flow to Europe (from Turkey) has remained steady for the last two years at between four and six tons of heroin each month.' The report describes Turkey as the foremost transit centre for hard drugs and as 'one of the world's two traditional opium growing countries, as recognised by the U.S. government and the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB). What is the Commission's position on this vast flow of drugs from a country which is an applicant for accession to the Union? What monitoring mechanisms and sanctions has it adopted? What measures does it intend to take to put an end to the activities of the international gangs which smuggle drugs from Turkey into the Member States of the Union? Has the Commission taken up the entire issue with the Turkish authorities who are calling for closer relations between their country and the Union, while dozens of tons of heroin and other narcotic substances pour into Europe from Turkey every year? Finally, will the criteria for Turkey's accession to the European Union also include a drastic reduction in drug trafficking and will the pre-accession partnership agreement incorporate a provision to that effect ?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In its 1999 Regular Report on Turkey’s progress towards accession, the Commission considers that "Turkey remains a major trafficking centre, particularly for drugs coming from Afghanistan, Iran and Central Asia. It is also a centre for refining opium.”</p>
<p>It continues by saying: "The Turkish authorities need to devote attention to dismantling hidden laboratories and combating the chain of trafficking more effectively. Greater efficiency will require significant reinforcement of police cooperation with EU Member States, an area hitherto marked by insufficient exchanges of information. The Turkish authorities will have to acquire legal instruments, which are compatible with international police cooperation practices, particularly in connection with controlled delivery".</p>
<p>The fight against drug-trafficking was one of the fields covered by Union experts during the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Mission which took place last September over two weeks in Turkey. This mission was very similar to those that were organised in the other candidate countries and intended to identify major differences between Turkish and Union legislation and practices in the JHA field. This should be considered as a first step in the cooperation process that is being established in this field in the context of Turkey’s preparation for accession.</p>
<p>The strengthening of the fight against drugs will be clearly a priority in view of Turkey’s accession. This will be done through promotion of and support for the development of a comprehensive and multidisciplinary response to the drug phenomenon at a national level as well as through furthering the cooperation with Member States and other candidates countries in the field of drug information, drug supply and demand reduction.</p>
<p>The Commission is also cofinancing the Joint United Nations international drug control programme (UNDCP)-PHARE drug law enforcement programme for South-eastern Europe which aims at improving the efficiency of the fight against illicit drug trafficking in this region by strengthening the law enforcement capacity of Bulgaria, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Romania. This should reduce the activities of the international gangs which smuggle drugs from Turkey into the Union.</p>
<p>The Commission has recently participated in a meeting in Turkey which set up an international monitoring programme aimed at preventing the diversion of acetic anhydride, the major chemical used in the illicit manufacture of heroin. This chemical is already under international control but it is hoped that the further measures that will be taken by participants in the operation (Operation Topaz) will significantly reduce its diversion.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important not to confuse illicit production with traditional and legal opium production in Turkey which is monitored by the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0805"></a>

<p>There are no official statistics for European airlines on cases where passengers have been denied boarding due to overbooking. The estimates available to the Commission indicate that approximately one in a thousand passengers is affected within the Community. In order to remedy this lack of information and to thereby enable passengers to make a better informed choice of air companies, the Commission intends to encourage the publication, for the benefit of consumers, of reports comparing the performance of different transport companies within the Community.

<p>Denial of boarding due to overbooking causes considerable delays in travel and serious inconvenience to passengers.

Regulation 295/91<a href="#defann_21_1" name="refann_21_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 1</span> requires Community transport companies to offer alternative flights or to reimburse the ticket price, with financial compensation and appropriate assistance to passengers (refreshments, meals, hotels, etc.).

<p>In bringing forward this proposal to recast three existing directives on tobacco, account has been taken of experience with their application and of scientific facts which have appeared since the adoption of the directives in 1989, 1990 and 1992 respectively. On the advice of its scientific advisory committee for cancer prevention, a number of other areas were also considered, and a survey carried out of potential internal market implications. A Commission report from last September sets out a detailed analysis of these matters and a specific assessment form analysing the economic impact of the proposal has been attached to the proposal.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that the trade in tobacco products is of sufficient importance to justify continued concern for the abolition of actual or potential obstacles to the achievement of the internal market. The proposed directive covers all products imported into or manufactured in the Community, thus ensuring neutrality of treatment. All products manufactured in the Community need to be covered, whether domestically consumed or exported, to ensure that the rules set up to ensure the smooth operation of the internal market are not undermined by parallel trade. Unfortunately, tobacco products are a highly smuggled commodity. If different product rules were applied for domestic and exported products, the Commission could not be sure that a high level of public health protection could be assured, as Article 95 (ex-Article 100 A) of the EC Treaty requires.</p>
<p>As regards exports, the reports of the effects of applying the tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide ceilings to exports are greatly exaggerated. The Commission does not believe that there is a genuine market demand abroad for more dangerous products which would be banned for health reasons on the Community market. It would recall that on previous occasions, the threat of job losses was invoked, but that in practice the greatest job losses have been due to rationalisation in the tobacco industry itself.</p>
<p>When the 1990 Tar Directive was being considered, books and pamphlets were published to argue that that directive would result in considerable employment losses in the Community, a forecast which has happily proved completely unfounded. The same applies to exports in the proposed directive: there is no evidence of a market demand for more dangerous tobacco products. Lastly, on this point, the negotiation of a World Health Organisation framework convention on tobacco control was the subject of a Council negotiating mandate to the Commission in October 1999 on the basis of Article 300 (ex-Article 228) of the Treaty. The negotiations on this convention envisage the creation of international tobacco product regulation, which underlines the Commission’s view that the present proposal for a directive is going in the right legal, trade and ethical direction.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0821"></a>

<p>The honourable Member has raised a particularly important and serious issue, namely the problem of taxpayers who move to another Member State without paying their outstanding tax debts in their Member State of origin.</p>
<p>While the Commission welcomes the increased mobility of Union citizens who are reaping the full benefits of the Single Market, it also recognises the scope for tax avoidance and evasion this creates. The Commission acknowledges the legitimate needs of Member States to maintain their tax revenues and has presented a number of initiatives aimed at combating tax avoidance and evasion within the Community</p>
<p>In the direct tax area, the Council is currently discussing a package to tackle harmful tax competition, consisting of a code of conduct for business taxation<a href="#defann_25_1" name="refann_25_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 1</span>, a proposal for a directive on taxation of savings<a href="#defann_25_2" name="refann_25_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 2</span> and a proposal for a directive on interest and royalty payments<a href="#defann_25_3" name="refann_25_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 3</span>. The Commission has also been actively involved in the work of the Ad hoc Group on Tax Fraud, which presented its final report to the ECOFIN Council on 5 June 2000. The Commission is presently considering the arrangements for following up the report’s recommendations in the area of direct and indirect taxes.</p>
<p>The specific problem of uncollected tax debts raised by the honourable Member can only be addressed successfully through administrative cooperation between tax administrations and more specifically through mutual assistance in collection of tax debts. The original Community arrangements for mutual assistance on recovery of claims were put in place because it was recognised that it was increasingly likely that the debtor, or recoverable assets belonging to the debtor, were within the jurisdiction of another Member State. The arrangements were originally developed to cover agricultural levies and customs duties as sources of Community revenue<a href="#defann_25_4" name="refann_25_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 4</span>, but were later extended to cover VAT and excise duties<a href="#defann_25_5" name="refann_25_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 5</span>.</p>
<p>On 26 June 1998 the Commission presented a proposal for a Parliament and Council directive amending the existing directive <span class="sup">6</span>. The aim of this proposal is to improve the functioning of the directive and to widen its scope to cover direct taxes. On 12 February 1999 the European Parliament endorsed this proposal and suggested certain amendments. The Commission duly presented an amended proposal on 7 May 1999<a href="#defann_25_6" name="refann_25_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 7</span>. The proposal is currently being discussed at Council level. In view of the seriousness and urgency of the problem which the proposal aims to solve, the Commission would highly recommend its early adoption.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission has stated its intention to close the Economats in Brussels and Luxembourg, substantially in recognition of the fact that responsibility for providing such facilities cannot now be regarded to be a suitable task for the Commission as an institution.</p>
<p>The Economats currently employ a total of 8 permanent officials (4 each in Brussels and Luxembourg) and 28 external staff (21 in Brussels and 7 in Luxembourg). In 1999 the annual turnover of the Economats was EUR 8.66 million (EUR 6.3 million in Brussels and EUR 2.36 million in Luxembourg).</p>
<p>It will be important to ensure an orderly phasing-out and closure of the activities. It is therefore envisaged that the Economat in Brussels and Luxembourg will finally close at the end of 2001.</p>
<p>In view of the fact that the provision of shopping facilities to staff, in particular in areas where no adequate shopping facilities exist, can play a useful role in helping personnel to reconcile their working and private lives, the Commission will look at possible alternatives to the Economats. The possibility of launching a tender that would allow private companies to deliver products directly to Commission staff is, consequently, among the options that are currently being examined.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0827"></a>

<p>The Commission is keeping a close eye on developments in the implementation of the Western Saharan Settlement Plan as adopted by the United Nations Security Council. Like the European Union Member States, it fully endorses the efforts undertaken by the UN General-Secretary and his personal envoy, James Baker, to look into ways of arriving rapidly at a lasting concerted settlement of the dispute. The Commission supports the direct negotiations between the parties, in the conviction that the current deadlock can be overcome only by means of open and frank dialogue on all the aspects of the conflict between the parties concerned.</p>
<p>To this end, the Commission is willing to provide support for the implementation of the various phases of the Peace Plan, both the voter identification phase and the repatriation or land rehabilitation phases. It has informed Mr Baker of this. Moreover, the Commission continues to raise this issue within the framework of the political dialogue with the Mediterranean partners that are most directly concerned, to wit, Morocco and Algeria.</p>
<p>As for humanitarian aid, the Commission continues to provide, via partner non-governmental organisations (NGOs), substantial food aid and medical aid to the Saharawi refugees of the Tindouf region. So far, EUR 56 million have been provided. An additional EUR 9 million, in the form of food aid, medical and rehabilitation aid, have been proposed for the current year, representing a considerable increase on previous years.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0835"></a>

<p>The Commission is very concerned by the severe drought in Tajikistan. As a consequence it has decided to allocate an additional EUR 3 million to humanitarian assistance via its Humanitarian Office (ECHO) and to provide additional support to the World Food Programme worth over EUR 9 million for nearly 14,000 tonnes of flour and 2,000 tonnes of vegetable oil. This follows an allocation of about 11 000 metric tonnes of cereals in 1999, amounting to about EUR 5 million.</p>
<p>Currently there may be around 200 000 people in the north of Afghanistan who could flee into Tajikistan if the security situation deteriorates further. Of the 200 000 it is estimated by organisations in the country that 60 000 would probably try to flee to the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast (GBAO) region of the country which is the poorest region in Tajikistan.</p>
<p>Since 1993, the Community has provided EUR 108.89 million in humanitarian assistance and nearly EUR 50 million through Food Security programmes. Contracts worth EUR 4 million have recently been signed for a demobilisation programme principally in the Karategin Valley and for a further EUR 1 million for rehabilitation works in GBAO of schools, hospitals and roads.</p>
<p>In 2000, macro financial support is also available for Tajikistan in the form of a new loan of EUR 60 million and a first grant tranche of EUR 7 million, was paid after full settlement by the country of its arrears towards the Community.

<p>The oil crisis which is still unfolding is having multiple adverse effects both on the economies of EU Member States and on the standards of living of various sectors of the population: workers, farmers, professionals and transporters. In addition to the rise in the international price of crude oil in US dollars, the effects of the galloping increase in the exchange rate of the dollar and the undervaluation of the euro in the international markets are making the crisis more severe. In Greece, the situation is even worse because of the fact that in addition to the already high special consumption tax on fuel, VAT is also imposed, not only on the added value of petrol and oil but also on the special consumption tax. This double taxation represents an added burden of 8% on the final price for the consumer. Does the Commission not consider that it is unacceptable to impose a tax upon a tax? What measures does it intend to take with regard to this issue?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The rise in fuel prices observed from the beginning of 1999 is due to the evolution of crude oil world prices. However, taxes form a significant part of the consumer price of oil products and their level varies considerably from one Member State to another. There are two kinds of taxes: (1) an excise duty in the form of a specific duty amount expressed as a fixed amount in euros and national currency per 1000 litres of fuel; and (2) VAT which is a consumption tax, levied on the total sales price of goods and services to final consumers.</p>
<p>As far as the excise duties are concerned, a harmonised specific excise duty (which is applied to quantities rather than values) has been introduced by Council Directive 92/82/EEC<a href="#defann_34_1" name="refann_34_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>1, the level of which represent the minimum rate to be applied by each Member State. Although in practice Member States apply rates that far exceed these minimum rates, for oil products used as motor fuel Greece applies rates which are very close to these Community minimum rates. They are among the three lowest rates in the Community. For diesel used as a propellant, for instance, Greece applies a rate of 252.55 euros/1000 litres, which is very close to the Community minimum rate of 245 euros/1000 litres.</p>
<p>Taking into account the specific nature of the excise duties it is clear that they are not influenced by inflation, or by the fluctuation of world prices of crude oil and therefore, their relative weight to the final consumer price is reducing when these prices are increasing.</p>
<p>As far as VAT is concerned its basis includes, where appropriate, any other taxes, levies, duties and charges, which may also be levied on the goods in question. When the price of goods increases, for whatever reason, the logical consequence is that the amount of VAT will also increase, as it is calculated as a fixed percentage of the total sales price. These rules are fully in line with Community VAT legislation (notably Article 11 of the Sixth VAT Directive). This is valid for all products and the Commission does not envisage a change to them. Greece applies a VAT rate of 18% on oil products which is below the average rate applied by the Member States.</p>
<p>The Commission does not share the idea of using the tax instrument in order to neutralise increases on consumer prices when the crude oil prices increase. This correspond in reality to a transfer of revenue from the oil consuming to the oil producing countries and would run counter to our environmental objectives, notably under the Kyoto protocol.</p>
<p>The only conceivable adjustment mechanism relates to VAT. It could be possible to stabilise VAT revenue in the event of significant fluctuations in oil prices.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Swedish media (via the Swedish Government representative to the Convention) have spread the idea that the Charter of fundamental rights would restrict freedom of movement through the right to strike. This might occur, for example, if a transport strike is considered to be 'more important' than the freedom of movement of persons or goods. The Charter contains a general article, Article 54, which deals with the problem of 'conflicting' rights. It is my understanding that, as the Charter refers to national law, the right to strike as currently formulated in the Charter does not affect freedom of movement in the Union.</p>

<p>In line with the determination of the European Council, the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights unites in a single text the range of fundamental rights already in force at European Union level in order to give them greater prominence in the eyes of the citizens of the European Union.</p>
<p>The freedom of movement of persons as enshrined in the EC Treaty is retained in Article 45 of the draft Charter, while Article 28 thereof outlines the right of workers, in accordance with Community and national law, to take collective action, including strike action, in cases of conflicts of interest with their employers.</p>
<p>In practice, situations where there is a conflict between these two fundamental rights cannot be ruled out. Observations of this kind may also be made with regard to several other fundamental rights.</p>
<p>Article 52(1) of the Charter, by establishing a system allowing potential restrictions on the exercise of fundamental rights, makes it possible to resolve this conflict between the freedom of movement and the right to strike. This provision makes it clear that the exercise of a right may not override any other right or freedom which is also recognised in the Charter. In no case, then, is it possible to suggest that one right may be ‘more important’ than another. Quite the contrary: the authorities, in imposing restrictions on the exercise of the fundamental rights at issue here – restrictions which may be perfectly legal – are required to establish a balance between the rights at issue in order to ensure that both rights are respected, proportionately, in the specific conditions of each case.</p>
<p>The Commission would draw the honourable Member’s attention to the fact that the circumstances she refers to are covered by a Community regulation, insofar as the free movement of goods is concerned. Council Regulation (EC) No 2679/98 of 7 December 1998<a href="#defann_36_1" name="refann_36_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 1</span> on the functioning of the internal market in relation to the free movement of goods among the Member States, while expressly making an exception for the right to protection of fundamental rights (including, in the terms of the regulation, “the right or freedom to strike”), seeks to overcome obstacles causing serious disruption to the proper functioning of the internal market and inflicting serious losses on the individuals affected. The Charter does not have the effect of amending this regulation, which clearly respects the various fundamental rights involved.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The process of the construction of a new museum for the Acropolis – jointly funded by the EU – has been dogged by continual obstruction and poor decision-making. After approximately twenty years, the fact that a new architectural competition, the fourth in total, is being held for a building in the same location, with vague construction specifications, is an indication that the Greek authorities are guiding this large-scale and essential project towards a dead end.</p>
<p>In view of the fact that the Central Archaeological Council describes the finds from the excavations which are still going on as important archaeological discoveries, and that scientific bodies say the construction site is unsuitable because it is cramped and difficult to gain access to, will the Commission say what measures it will take to ensure that the museum is constructed within a reasonable time-frame and that it is built in a location which will not cover up other important archaeological finds. Will the Commission also say whether it will be worthy of its exhibits and guarantee full protection for the objects and for visitors?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The European Regional Development Fund has cofinanced a study for the design and construction of the new Acropolis museum under the Community Support Framework (CSF) for the 1994-1999 programming period.</p>
<p>Under the decentralised arrangements for the management of programmes financed by the Structural Funds, responsibility for this project is entirely with the Greek authorities. The Commission expects the Greek authorities to include it in the Operational Programme ‘Culture’ of the new CSF for the period 2000­2006, in order to complete the necessary technical studies and to allow construction to begin in the near future.</p>
<p>According to information obtained by the Commission, an early start may indeed be possible. The organisation for the construction of the new Acropolis museum (OANMA) appointed a new President and Board of Directors in May 2000. In July 2000, the invitation to tender for the new Acropolis museum was published. Over the past few days, the first stage of the process for the selection of the architectural, structural and electromechanical designs has been undertaken. In early spring 2001, the preliminary designs and models will be completed and an international jury will decide on the best design.</p>
<p>During 2001, OANMA anticipates the completion of the final plans, and towards the end of that year it hopes to commence building works. In the meantime, it will complete the purchase of local properties and a committee of archaeologists, in collaboration with OANMA has commenced the necessary conservation of the exhibits and is preparing the final plans for the total exhibit programme.</p>
<p>The Central Archaeological Council has determined the zones where construction of the new museum can proceed and the areas within the ancient ruins where foundations can be laid. The archaeological finds which have come to light through the excavations on the site will be incorporated into the new Acropolis museum and specific provisions for their appropriate exhibition will be made. The new museum will be linked with the archaeological site of the Acropolis and it will also provide a panoramic view of the hill and the monuments of the Acropolis.</p>
<p>A special commission of archaeologists and architects of the Ministry of Culture has discussed the building programme of the new museum in a series of meetings and is now shaping the final draft of the building programme of the new Acropolis museum.</p>
<p>In conclusion, there now seems to be grounds for optimism that the Greek authorities will proceed quickly to ensure that the project is carried out.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
