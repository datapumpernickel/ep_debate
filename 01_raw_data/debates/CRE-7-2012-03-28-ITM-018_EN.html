The motion for a resolution highlights a number of significant issues and concerns, and comes at an important point in EU-Turkey relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey is more to Europe than a candidate country. It is also an essential strategic ally, playing a key regional role. As such, it has a privileged relationship with a number of crucial actors in the region. Turkey is also an important and growing economic player. Turkey and the EU have an obvious mutual interest in upholding strong ties with each other. Only in this way can we contribute to containing and overcoming tensions in our neighbouring regions.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU-Turkey relationship is a close one and goes back several decades. This clearly not only illustrates our many shared interests; it also demonstrates the power of the enlargement process to give impetus to political and economic reform in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">We can all see that the accession negotiations are not advancing as quickly as we would like. However, if the opportunity for progress in negotiations arises, the Danish Presidency stands ready to seize it. We will do our utmost to facilitate progress, but needless to say, this will require additional significant efforts from the Turkish side.</p>
<p class="contents">We will also act in support of the Commission’s positive agenda. We must not lose sight of Turkey’s and the EU’s mutual interest in deepening our relations, in spite of the challenges encountered in the formal accession talks. It is clear that the positive agenda should be a complement to the negotiations and not a substitute for them. As stated by the Council last December, Turkey’s contribution to the EU will only be fully effective in the context of an actual negotiation process that makes progress. Work on the actual content of this agenda is still at an early stage, but we are following and supporting developments with great interest.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the reforms in Turkey are concerned, I will begin with a few words about constitutional reform. Preparing a new constitution is now well under way. The process is an opportunity to address a number of important issues. It has to take place in a broad and inclusive way, and in a spirit of constructiveness and compromise. We very much welcome initial steps towards ensuring this. Much of the work on this key reform is of direct relevance for the enlargement negotiations with Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">While constitutional reform is important, further progress by Turkey in other areas is required. As noted both in your resolution and in the Council conclusions of December, some very important issues have to be addressed. However, further progress is needed on issues such as fundamental rights and freedoms. I would especially like to highlight freedom of expression. We have witnessed a large number of cases brought against writers and journalists, and although there have been some positive developments, such as the recent liberation from prison of four journalists, the high number of cases against writers and journalists raises serious concerns, which need to be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to the one unresolved issue which has a direct bearing on both the negotiations and, more widely, on EU-Turkey relations. The Council notes with deep regret that Turkey – despite our repeated calls – has so far failed to fulfil its obligation under the Additional Protocol to the Association Agreement. The EU position on this has not changed, and in the absence of progress in the full non-discriminatory implementation of the Protocol, the EU will maintain its measures from 2006, which will continue to affect overall progress in the negotiations. We also continue to expect Turkey to make progress towards normalising its relations with the Republic of Cyprus without further delay.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to recall that the Council has regretted statements by Turkey threatening to freeze relations with the EU Presidency during the second half of this year. The rotating presidency is a fundamental institutional feature of the EU provided for in the EU Treaty and must be fully respected – a position which I know is also included in your resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the aim of the Presidency is to do our utmost to facilitate progress in the enlargement negotiations, to promote political and economic reform in Turkey and to strengthen the relationship between the EU and Turkey. This is a task that we can only realise with the support and cooperation of the Member States, the Commission, and not least this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also, on behalf of the Danish Presidency and the Member States, thank this Parliament, and in particular your rapporteur Ria Oomen-Ruijten, for your work on this issue. Your continued commitment to enlargement is vital to its success, as is your particular role in promoting popular support in the EU for this cause.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution on Turkey and its endorsement in the plenary is indeed a forceful political and strategic message. I also believe that, in contacts with fellow parliamentarians from the Turkish Parliament, this House will be able to make an important and much-appreciated contribution to enhancing understanding of the EU, the values that we share and the way we work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This debate and your resolution come at an important time for European Union-Turkey relations, and the draft resolution underlines a number of issues of great importance for the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Last Friday the High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission Cathy Ashton and I met ministers Davutoğlu and Bağış and we had a very positive and open political dialogue. Once again, I realised that we have much more in common at strategic level than there are differences. We discussed our ever closer foreign-policy dialogue and progress related to the political criteria and agreed in particular to work concretely and constructively to make the positive agenda a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">The positive agenda is there to provide a realistic and feasible way of injecting new life into EU-Turkey relations in general, and into the accession process in particular, and I wish to thank you for your support as expressed in the resolution we are discussing today. Let me emphasise once again that this agenda exists to complement and not to replace the accession process.</p>
<p class="contents">The positive agenda means renewed efforts in a number of key areas, including support for political reforms in Turkey, such as the alignment with our acquis, a closer cooperation on visas and migration and a closer dialogue on foreign policy. All are highlighted in your resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy to tell you that since the Member States endorsed the positive agenda last December we have made very good progress in putting it into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and Turkey have agreed to work on eight chapters, including the chapters on company law, on the information society and the media, on the judiciary and fundamental rights and on justice, freedom and security. We have also agreed to work on bringing the relevant Turkish legislation closer into line with the EU acquis.</p>
<p class="contents">Working groups will be set up for each chapter in May/June. The Commission services will use kick-off meetings to update the Turkish authorities on all developments regarding the acquis. And we will of course involve stakeholders, as appropriate, at further stages of the process.</p>
<p class="contents">Work continues also in other areas of the positive agenda. As regards energy for instance, Turkey and the Commission have agreed to set up a joint working group, which will develop a road map by May to identify concrete actions for intensified cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now briefly to some recent developments in Turkey which are also reflected in the resolution: I have welcomed the overall consensus on the need for a new constitution – which emerged after the general elections last June.</p>
<p class="contents">The specific work launched by the Turkish Parliament to bring this process forward, including constructive collaboration between the four main political parties, has started. Obviously, the real test will come with the first discussions on the substance. Consensus through a democratic, participatory process with the broadest possible consultation is essential if this new constitution is to serve all Turkish citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me in this context also refer explicitly to the conclusions of the most recent meeting of the reform monitoring group, held in Istanbul on 16 March. These conclusions list a large number of political reforms already underway or planned for the near future by the Turkish Government. I would like to single out the intention to table a fourth judicial reform package which envisages further reforms in the area of freedom of expression and the media. We hope that his package will address the outstanding core concern as regards freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial. These issues are rightly highlighted as persistent concerns in the resolution you intend to adopt later. We hope that our cooperation with Turkey on these issues, notably as part of the positive agenda, will bring badly needed improvements in legislation and practice.</p>
<p class="contents">We will report in the 2012 Progress Reports on developments in trials and in investigations of alleged criminal networks, as we have done over the past years and as expressly requested in your resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me in closing take this opportunity to raise the concerns increasingly being voiced by civil society in Turkey as regards recent developments relating to freedom of expression. Freedom of expression is intimately linked to political debate in a country, and thus to the quality and maturity of a democracy. In a mature democracy, the majority respects and protects the views of minorities and their rights. In a mature democracy, dissenting voices are not ridiculed or pushed into self-censorship, but valued for their contribution to the democratic fabric of society. In the words of Voltaire: we can disapprove of what someone says, but we need to defend to the death his or her right to say it. If this right is not defended, democracy inevitably withers.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution of this House gives a fair assessment of the important challenges that Turkey is taking on in the area of the judiciary and fundamental rights. Only a mature domestic political debate, with full respect for dissenting voices, will ensure that these reforms deliver the democratic standards and practices the citizens of Turkey expect. Expect and deserve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have such a balanced resolution because we all worked on it together, so my thanks also to all the shadow rapporteurs.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to convey in this resolution the message of interdependence between the EU and Turkey. Turkey is a key country for the security and prosperity of the European Union. Turkey has enormous potential for economic growth and it has a strategic role as a corridor for the European Union’s energy supply. Complemented by the value of potential synergies between the EU and Turkey, the foreign policy and security policy can do a lot for us both.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, however, that interdependence can only produce positive results when it is framed in a context of mutual commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">This requires efforts from both sides. For Turkey, this means concrete results in the reform process and also an improvement in bilateral relations with its neighbours. From the EU and its Member States, I expect renewed efforts to create the conditions for the opening of chapters. I fully support Mr Füle’s new positive agenda for EU-Turkey relations. It was initiated by him and we support it. We must now increase our cooperation through that, but that also means we must have more coordination in areas like foreign policy and the fight against terrorism. There is much to gain for both of us.</p>
<p class="contents">This resolution expresses our concern about freedoms: the deterioration of press freedom and freedom of expression in Turkey. I have just met Mr Ahmet Şık who was released from prison just this week. He came here to visit us in Parliament. In Turkey pre-trial detention lasts too long, legislation on terrorism is too wide-sweeping and these sorts of things do not fit in with a country which should have independent and all-over impartial justice. The long pre-detention happening now is, de facto, a punishment. So I ask my colleagues to look into that.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to bilateral relations: bilateral relations continue to affect deeply the negotiation process. I call on the government to do something, to come up with positive steps.</p>
<p class="contents">We have not just reported on negative elements in this resolution. We have also highlighted positive developments and I would like to stress once again that we fully support the Parliament of Turkey in its obligation to draw up a new constitution with checks and balances which are important for a modern and prosperous Turkey. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was approved by a broad majority at committee stage, and that is a good sign. A good job has been done, based on a good draft by Ms Oomen-Ruijten, and I believe that all this is very positive. It is a contribution by Parliament to improving and boosting the relationship between the European Union and Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this should not stop us from saying that all this has taken place without any substantial progress being made in the negotiation process regarding Turkey’s accession to the European Union, despite the great changes taking place in the Mediterranean and the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the development of the positive programme proposed by Commissioner Füle, which is not intended to replace the negotiation process but rather to drive forward and improve bilateral relations, deserves our most decisive support.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, this report is positive in the way that it helps to improve the position, but it also fulfils our obligation to point out the negative aspects in our relationship with the country and its situation.</p>
<p class="contents">It focuses heavily on the positive programme, it calls for the opening of new negotiation chapters, it maintains a firm stance on defending freedom of expression and media pluralism and it expresses concern about the excessive use of antiterrorist legislation and the detention of journalists, politicians and activists. In short, I think it can help make the forthcoming period a positive one for relations between the Union and Turkey.</p>

Turkey seems distracted by the other pressing priorities that it faces. Europe is clearly not ready to move forward the accession process, and the central problem is Cyprus. Because Cyprus is shortly to assume the Council Presidency, I think it is appropriate for us to spotlight that problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Nothing could be more intelligent and strategic than for the Cypriot Presidency to call the bluff of Turkey and to open Chapters 23 and 24 on rights and justice. Such a move would not be about power and pride and prejudice but about the people – about Greeks and Turks, Christian and Muslims – who could then look forward to a period of reconciliation in which they could live together in freedom, security and justice.

I think that this report, as a whole, calls for and supports the democratic reforms and the protection of fundamental freedoms in Turkey. I believe that the messages that it sends are extremely clear and precise and that they are of course addressed to the authorities, but also to all the actors in the political arena and civil society to encourage them to become more involved in further strengthening the democratic State in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">The report does not fail to make clear our grave concerns regarding the way in which the law against terrorism has been applied, directly threatening freedom of expression and opinion, the right to hold demonstrations, the freedom of the press and we are asking for this law to be amended, particularly Articles 6 and 7. We also support and call for a thoroughgoing reform of the judicial system: citizens, all citizens in Turkey, must be able to trust an efficient, impartial and independent judicial system and we support any reform that works towards this end.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also looked at the Kurdish question and we are clearly of the view that education in one’s native language is a perfectly satisfactory proposal to provide a response to the Kurdish question that is political and not merely for reasons of security. I think that these strong messages are all more credible when we do not hold back on our demands in the Council, particularly to ensure true consistency and to enable the European Union to finally recover its ability to pioneer reforms in Turkey and to use leverage to promote them. We are asking for all these measures to be taken with a view to opening chapters 23 and 24. Our demands are also clear in the case of visas: we need a roadmap for the liberalisation of visas, as this situation in a country in the process of accession to the European Union is quite unique, and therefore totally discriminatory.</p>
<p class="contents">We want these essential messages to be heard in Turkey and I would not wish for the readership of this excellent report and its importance in relation to the current situation in Turkey to be diminished or detracted from by questionable statements. What is the purpose of the reference in this text to the secular integrity of the armed forces? We are delighted with the huge amount of work which has been achieved in Turkey over a number of years to ensure that the armed forces recover their place, under the control of the civil authorities, and for military expenditure to be brought under the oversight of the Court of Accounts. What is the purpose of this reference to the secular integrity of armed forces which have served NATO since 1952, which are one of its largest armed forces and the presence of which is being made conditional on this secular integrity? We know the nature of the armed forces of a secular, non-religious State. That is what we want for Turkey and I think that together we must delete those words.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the Ergenekon trial, lastly, it is not credible to cast doubt on all cases in the Ergenekon trial as we know, and the European Court of Human Rights reiterated this in December in a judgment, there are perfectly well-founded cases where arrests on the basis of accusations of crimes or criminal acts have been judged to be well founded by the European Court of Human Rights. We cannot let ourselves be suspicious of and rule out all the cases involved in the Ergenekon trial. My opinion is this: if we remove these two references, we will have the widest possible readership, which is extremely important, in Turkey, in society as a whole, and in its entire political and social fields.</p>

It is a good report. Of course there are many aspects of the report which we might have liked to see worded in a rather different way and I appreciate that there are strong feelings on the subject of Turkey on all sides of the House.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I have always been supportive of Turkish aspirations towards the European Union and I am particularly appreciative of Turkey’s role as a key ally over the years. But I have to ask, is the European Union being helpful enough? Is it sending a really positive message to Turkey? In particular, we see consistent obstruction from certain rather obvious quarters regarding Turkey’s European aspirations and status. This is unrealistic, it is unjust and it prevents progress. We make demands of Turkey but we should reciprocate with movement in Turkey’s direction. For example, Cyprus, which my good friend and colleague Mr Duff has mentioned: this should not feature in Turkey’s accession but we all know that it is in fact a factor. There are constant demands for Turkey to make unilateral concessions and in return she gets nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is supposed to have ended the isolation of Northern Cyprus. Whatever happened to that? By all means call for reductions in Turkish troop numbers in the north of Cyprus and for agreement to the Additional Protocol, but match this with opening trade through the ports and airports in Northern Cyprus. I have to say that the assumption of the EU Presidency by the Republic of Cyprus in the second half of this year would present a great opportunity for progress if there was real courage. If there is a genuine desire to reunite the island of Cyprus then the Turkish Cypriots need to feel they are actually welcome and respected in the island that they share.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say we regret that some unhelpful amendments have been tabled to the resolution, but overall the resolution is balanced and reasonable and the ECR Group will support it.</p>

But the fact is that Turkey does have an aspiration towards joining the European Union and I think Turkey’s strategic position is a very important one. Turkey has been an excellent ally for many years and we therefore need to meet her aspirations in a positive way. I have always said that, if we send negative signals to Turkey, we should not be surprised if she starts heading off in a rather different direction. Once or twice, in recent months and years, there have been one or two little indications that maybe there were feelers going out in different directions. We have to very careful about that.</p>
<p class="contents">So I would say that of course Turkey can be a good ally without being in the Union, because that is the situation at the moment. But we need to meet Turkey’s aspirations, and what she wishes is accession to the European Union. But I hope that by the time that happens – which I hope will not be too many decades distant – we will be talking about a very different European Union to the one that we have now, and a European Union that is heading in a rather different direction to the one that it is heading in at the moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would have to say that the whole question of the impact of Turkey on the European Union is not one of the major factors as to why we should be supporting European Union accession by Turkey. It is true that the European Union would inevitably be very different with a country like Turkey as a member. But, as I say, I hope that, by the time that comes about, the European Union will be very different to what it is today.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union needs to get away from this course of insistence and obsession with political integration. What we need is a European Union of overlapping circles of engagement where, if there are those that want to push forward with intense integration, by all means let them. But others, including perhaps my own country, could be part of that Union without having to be intimately involved in that particular movement. So I hope it will be a very different European Union when Turkey joins and that Turkey will help that process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to say to him that the trouble I have gone to for the Turkish Cypriots exceed the trouble he has gone to for the Turkish Cypriots ten thousand times over and that their isolation, which is a fact, is due to the 40 000 Turkish troops there, who are occupying this part of Cyprus and who, merely by their presence, are imposing their will on the Turkish Cypriot population.</p>
<p class="contents">It does not take much effort to understand that: forty thousand troops among 100 000 Turkish Cypriots means one soldier outside every house. Just think about it: how can that be right? We are in favour of eliminating the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots, which is due to the Turkish occupation.</p>
<p class="contents">If Mr Van Orden had come along this morning to the hearing organised by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, which was attended by dozens of Turkish Cypriots and representatives of large trade unions and Turkish Cypriot parties, he would have heard the anguished cries of Turkish Cypriots complaining that they number 100 000 among 500 000 Turks. How can this community declare its faith and will when it comes to developments in Cyprus? I do not think that it would take much argument to make someone understand that the Turkish Cypriot community is held captive by the occupation, far more captive, if you will, than the Greek Cypriot community.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to the report on which, there can be no doubt, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has worked extremely hard. However, ultimately we cannot but find that this is a political balancing exercise which, in the final analysis, merely highlights the reality that exists in the eyes of Parliament. We have to go beyond wishful thinking when it comes to the problems of the Kurdish population in Turkey, of whom there are 10 million. Why does Turkey not give the rights you demand for the Turkish Cypriots – and I am the first to demand them – to the Turks also, Mr Van Orden? Why does it not apply them to its own people? You weep tears over abuse of the human rights of the Turkish Cypriots – and rightly so – but they are due to the fact that Turkey is not prepared to demonstrate that will. Turkey’s refusal to have contacts with the Presidency of the Republic of Cyprus in a few months’ time is not only an insult to Cyprus; it is an insult to us to, to our institutions, to the European Union itself and its <span class="italic">modus operandi</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to close by saying that we are in favour of the accession of Turkey; we demonstrated as much with our vote in favour of the opening of negotiations on the accession of Turkey. It was a very critical moment and Cyprus gave the go-ahead. However, Turkey needs to honour its undertakings, like every other country.</p>

I emphasise here the urgent call of the Turkish-Jewish scholar and publicist Rifat Bali, with whom I am in correspondence. This is what he wrote to me: ‘The EU should make it clear, in very strong terms, that the passive attitude of the Turkish Government and judiciary to anti-Semitic statements in the Turkish media is unacceptable. Such actions should be punished severely’.</p>
<p class="contents">I expect you, Commissioner Füle, to tackle Prime Minister Erdoğan immediately over this abject anti-Semitism. The leader of the Turkish Government is denying this dismal reality with the irrational argument that Islam does not allow anti-Semitism.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Protestant community – and that is my second point – I have three more urgent requests for the Commission. These action points for the Turkish Government are: a lot more permits and a generous policy on church construction, abolition of the separate mention of religion on identity cards, because that leads to numerous cases of discrimination against Turkish Christians and, finally, abolition of optional Islamic religious education from school curricula, because it makes Christian students a constant target of their teachers and classmates. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The situation in Turkey is not heading in the right direction. There are lots of journalists being held in prison and cartoonists are being taken to court. Freedom of expression is being increasingly limited under the Islamisation agenda of the AK Party.</p>
<p class="contents">Corruption is rising and illegal immigration via Turkey is continually increasing. The most outrageous thing, Madam President, is the fact that the illegal Turkish occupation of a part of Cyprus, an EU Member State, has continued for more than 35 years already. The Turkish Minister Barış is even threatening to annex Northern Cyprus and will soon be carrying out illegal gas drilling in Cyprus. This is a threat of war, pure and simple, which Turkey is addressing to Europe. This is unacceptable. Every year we see critical reports on Turkey, but this Parliament does nothing. Turkey is even rewarded with more than EUR 500 million taxpayers’ money from Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by Ms Oomen-Ruijten is a joke. It does not contain a single sanction against Turkey. If the Turks boycott the EU during the Cypriot Presidency, Turkey need never again return to the negotiating table, as far as we are concerned.</p>

<p class="contents">The first of these is its visa policy for third country nationals. Speaking two years ago in Parliament, I expressed my surprise that Turkey did not bring this policy into line with that of the European Union. According to the European Commission’s 2011 Progress Report, Turkey has recently signed visa waiver agreements with Sudan and Yemen. I have also been informed that Iranian, Libyan, Lebanese and Syrian nationals do not require visas either.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, a very widely read Spanish newspaper claimed that Turkey’s visa exemption for some countries, together with its land border, which runs for thousands of kilometres, make the country a corridor of choice for organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, Turkey should make a serious effort and progressively bring itself into line with the Union’s visa policy. It is part of the acquis. It should align itself with Europe rather than continuing on its current line, which takes it in the opposite direction, distancing it from European Union policy. It should progressively align itself, and I believe that the Commission should carefully monitor this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I think political dialogue between the European Union and Turkey should be closer. Turkey has recently become close to the Arab world. It occupies a very significant position in a region that is very close and very important to Europe, and which is undergoing major changes. Dialogue and cooperation between Brussels and Ankara would be very positive.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the range of reforms that Turkey has introduced, and I hope it pursues them with determination and strength, as the report that we will approve tomorrow calls on it to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Turkey continues to send out contradictory messages about its intentions and its European ambitions. On the one hand, it has initiated dialogue on the new constitution, from which the heritage of the military regime will be expunged. On the other hand, it continues to persecute journalists and opposition intellectuals. Today over 100 journalists are still in gaol and Mr Erdogan himself recently stated that a book can be as dangerous as a bomb. Turkey takes every opportunity to maintain that it does not intend to abandon its European ambitions. However, it continues to threaten Member States with the use of violence and to insultingly maintain that it does not intend to have any contact whatsoever with the forthcoming Cypriot Presidency. If Turkey really wants accession, it must understand that this attitude will have consequences. Its accession negotiations have ground to a halt. It is therefore time for those who are to blame in Ankara to be called to account for what has not been done right and to assume responsibility. Accession is not an automatic procedure. It requires a constant commitment, proven through works and actions, not reversals. Turkey’s approach of one step forwards, two steps backwards is unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is very important to highlight that Turkey is the only candidate country with such a strict visa regime. This is why I welcome the constructive approach of the rapporteur who urges the Council to give a mandate to the Commission to initiate dialogue on visas and set a road map for liberalisation of the visa regime after Turkey signs the readmission agreement. This will not only strengthen economic and trade relations between the European Union and Turkey, but is also a fundamental prerequisite for bringing its citizens closer to the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the call by the Commission to consider measures that would result in the opening of Chapter 24 on Justice and Home Affairs and Chapter 23 on Judiciary and Fundamental Rights. I believe that, if we really want the European perspective to continue to act as a catalyst for the political reforms in Turkey and to be a factor in discussing issues such as freedom of speech and the media, the Member States that are still opposed to this opening must reconsider their position.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to highlight the strengthening of the existing political dialogue between the EU and Turkey, as well as Turkey’s role as a source of inspiration for the democratisation of the Arab states.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I regret that a balanced approach regarding Cyprus has still not been reached in the report. I am completely certain that we should not expect unilateral concessions from Turkey, but EU Member States, in particular the Republic of Cyprus, must also assume their responsibility, and the Council conclusions of 26 April 2004 to end the economic isolation of Turkish Cypriots must be implemented. I think that this is of key significance to reaching a compromise solution.</p>

However, my criticism concerns the fact that, in the draft report, only Turkey is accused of not fulfilling its commitments. Yet, once again, no criticisms, or rather self-criticisms of any kind have been allowed to be made in this report concerning the European Union’s failure to meet its commitments, publically made in the conclusions of 2004, to end the economic isolation of the Turkish Cypriots as a result of the referendum held in the same year under the conflict resolution plan, the so-called Kofi Annan Plan.

The Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad explained its popularity through the mouth of a cinema goer who said: ‘It is a pity than in 1453 we did not massacre all Christians straight away, then they would not have been bothering us now’. Turkish nationalism is mingling with the dark side of Islam. We see this also in the course taken by the Erdoğan Government. It is becoming increasingly close to Hamas. Erdoğan is the great leader of the so-called Arab Spring, a spring which in Egypt has now led to the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no coincidence that Aramaic monasteries have recently been the target of many legal actions over land ownership. Mr Erdoğan is firmly in the saddle and is busy extending his power base with his Islamist AK Party, including through these court cases. That is a dangerous cocktail of Turkish nationalism and the dark sides of Islam. Allowing Turkey into the EU would be a mistake of historic proportions.

It is also threatening, in a most unbecoming manner, that if the Cyprus question is not resolved as it wants, it will break off all communication, both official and unofficial, with the forthcoming Cypriot Presidency.

However, overall it gives the impression that the EU and this Parliament are to a certain extent failing to face up to the reality of the situation in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite its new constitution, Turkey is moving further and further away from Europe. In addition, the new constitution does not change the fact that the Turkish Prime Minister, Mr Erdoğan, is becoming increasingly authoritarian. This move away from Europe is demonstrated by the growing Islamisation of the country, by the behaviour of Turkey regarding the question of the Armenian genocide and by Turkey’s arrogant attitude to the next holder of the Council Presidency, Cyprus. Overall it is clear that Turkey is distancing itself from Europe. However, it is still accepting pre-accession assistance.

<p class="contents">The Antiterrorism Act has an enormous impact on free speech by journalists. Under Articles 6 and 7 of this Act it is enough for a journalist to publish information about a Kurdish demonstration to find themselves in jail. Such arrests are a reality and, acting as the European Parliament, we must insist on court cases involving journalists being carried out transparently, under appropriate conditions and with due respect for the law. Unfortunately we still do not have precise data concerning the number of journalists arrested or the number of current court cases involving journalists. Work is continuing on constitutional reform and the criminal code. The repeal of existing regulations is not, however, a solution. Turkey must change the way it applies existing laws. Even the best legal regulations will not ensure justice and respect for human rights if they are not interpreted sensibly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So it is right that we keep the pressure up for judicial reforms to show full respect for human rights. The release of jailed journalists, Nedim Şener and Ahmet Şık, shows that our criticisms are effective. Indeed I was honoured recently to meet the daughter of murdered Armenian-origin journalist Hrant Dink, to speak in support of her appeal against the findings that this was not an organised crime, and to hear from Etyen Mahçupyan, the proprietor of his newspaper at the time, that popular revulsion to his murder has eased attitudes in Turkey towards the Armenian question.</p>
<p class="contents">I have nothing but praise, on the other hand, for the help Turkey has given to the 17 000 Syrian refugees who have crossed its borders. I join with the Commissioner in welcoming the constitutional debate but ask him to join with me in asking that the submissions be republished on the website from which they were abruptly taken off.</p>

Turkish women are still less educated than their male counterparts, and there needs to be a special focus on rural women, especially with regard to literacy. Three million rural Turkish women remain illiterate. Kurdish women in particular are disadvantaged by the double burden of being women and Kurds.

<p class="contents">The question is: does Turkey itself have the same will to become an EU Member State? The drawbacks of the system in Turkey have to do mainly with the prevailing views of democracy. Basic structural elements of real democratic governance are freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of the various ethnic minorities to preserve their cultural identity, constitutional reform in keeping with the modern model of democracy, a diplomatic approach to foreign policy issues and avoidance of threats, commitment to the principles of good neighbourly relations, not violating the national space of other States and provoking neighbours, respect for the principles and values of the construct of which Turkey wishes to become a part and, therefore, its obligation to recognise all parts of the European Union. The issue of illegal immigration via Turkey and its refusal to apply agreements already entered into also raise numerous questions.</p>

It is true that a number of reforms have been implemented and that progress has been made with democratisation. In addition, the economy is booming. However, on the other hand there have been some very disturbing developments. New restrictions have been imposed on freedom of expression and journalists and politicians have been imprisoned. We are also very concerned about the threat by the Turkish Prime Minister to freeze Turkey’s relationship with the EU during the Cypriot Presidency of the Council. This is totally unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the process of reform and democratisation must continue. It is also clear that Turkey is not a supplicant country, but a partner with which the EU is conducting accession negotiations on the basis of its own unanimous decisions. Many people here may not have noticed this. In response to the many people who are talking about values, I would like to say that I am horrified to see only traces of these values. We must keep our promises.

<p class="contents">Our emphasis on these key issues prompts the Turkish authorities, the government first and foremost, to ensure the rule of law is upheld. While we are open to cooperation in relation to the Middle East and on mutual security challenges, we strongly condemn the abuse of anti-terrorism laws. It is, after all, NATO’s second largest army, but a significant portion of this army’s leadership now faces the most serious charges of committing terrorist activities or of plotting a coup. It is essential for Turkey, its role in NATO and its relations with the EU that both process and outcomes of these trials are fairly conducted and that suspects get a due process.</p>
<p class="contents">The same goes for the high number of journalists imprisoned, as many colleagues have mentioned. The climate of fear and mistrust in institutions in Turkey is undermining its potential to be a leader in a changing world and we urge the Turkish Government to take its responsibilities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Turkey, of course, has a customs union with the EU, but it also has a customs union with the five Turkic-speaking countries of Central Asia. The inconvenient truth is that Turkey is a regional power of the Middle East, and this is because of the actuality. Turkey is an Asian country, moreover one that does not tolerate meaningful dissent.

<p class="contents">Of course, I congratulate the rapporteur on a difficult job but, despite the fact that the report is a balanced compromise, Turkey is stubbornly refusing to recognise our goodwill. Therefore, if Turkey wants to progress on the road towards accession and for chapters to be opened, it must comply with the decisions of the European Council and the European Court of Human Rights. It must respect the European <span class="italic">acquis</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">How is Turkey demonstrating its good will? How is it reacting to the positive agenda and the positive messages we are sending it?

Turkey’s economy is growing and Turkey is becoming a regional and global power. Europe and Turkey need each other more than ever. But ironically the accession negotiations have entered a stalemate. The Commission has no real leverage on important issues, due to the blocked chapters. The positive agenda is important to keep supporting the reforms, but if we want real changes we must support the opening of Chapters 23 and 24.</p>
<p class="contents">The report we will vote on tomorrow is important because it recognises these issues and it gives support to the positive agenda. It supports the reforms but also says that there are still reforms that need to be carried out, especially on freedom of speech and press freedom. We are concerned about the wide margin of appreciation allowed by the anti-terror law; we are concerned about the arrested journalists and those working under the threat of being arrested. But I am also concerned about attacks in Europe on Turkish press offices and ask for investigations to be carried out in Europe to find the perpetrators.</p>

<p class="contents">Mr President, I think there is a need for a greater degree of honesty in this debate and for us to say whether we actually want Turkey to join the EU or not, because then we will actually have to try and get a different attitude from some quarters than I think has been the case here.</p>

I have heard many objections to this process and I believe many of them are well grounded, but I believe also that these objections are overshadowed by three facts.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the contribution of Turkey to the stability of the world economy. Its economic growth, along with the performance of the BRICS, averted the transformation of the financial crisis in Europe and the USA after 2008 into a genuine catastrophe.</p>
<p class="contents">The second fact is the strengthening of global peace generated by Turkey’s democratisation process and its related problem-free foreign policy. There has been a huge change of course of Turkish foreign policy in the right direction, which is positively affecting all East-West relationships.</p>
<p class="contents">The third is the quality of Turkish social policies. In just six years, from 2003 to 2009, the country reduced its poverty rate by an astonishing 36%, and as Socialists and Democrats we particularly appreciate this achievement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I expected Ms Oomen-Ruijten’s report to contain sanctions against Turkey for failure to apply the Additional Protocol, for the Turkish threats and for the continuing occupation of Cyprus. The absence of sanctions encourages Turkey, as do the dangerous references to links between direct trade and the question of Famagusta and about the opening of two new accession chapters on the pretext of the positive agenda. Turkey is already preparing illegal colonisation of the closed area of Famagusta.</p>

Therefore, we need to find other forms of integration. I am also in favour of a policy of honesty with regard to Turkey. One of your predecessors, Mr Füle, once said to me: ‘Do not worry about it, Mr Posselt. Turkey will never become a member whatever happens.’ He was someone who in public constantly spoke out in favour of Turkey’s accession. The Turks are aware of this dishonesty. We want a clearly defined partnership, but not full membership. This will help to stabilise Turkey.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Štefan Füle, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span><span class="bold">−</span> Mr President, the Turkish accession process has to move forward. It is urgent now for Turkey to comply with its obligation of full implementation of the additional protocol to the association agreement, and to make progress towards normalisation of bilateral relations with the Republic of Cyprus – the same Cyprus which is soon to become a proud and, I am confident, effective Presidency of the Council to the benefit of the European Union and to the benefit of the interests of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been a fascinating debate. It is only a pity that not that many people who were so outspoken during the debate have stayed until the end, because I would like to share a couple of thoughts here.</p>
<p class="contents">Number one – what really surprised me, though maybe I was occasionally not attentive enough, is that no one has really mentioned the comprehensive talks on Cyprus, and tomorrow’s important meeting, and the road map as put forward by the United Nation’s Secretary-General and implemented by special representative Alexander Downer. Is it a sign of this House being content with the status quo? I hope not. I hope that the energy which I have sensed in your discussion will be turned towards supporting the two leaders who will be meeting tomorrow, addressing the core issues and allowing Downer to recommend to the Secretary-General to go for the finalisation of the process and not to leave it for a plan B – because I have news for you: there is no plan B.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as for the reform process, looking at the progress achieved in the past years we can conclude that Turkey is moving forward. Even if progress is sometimes too slow or uneven a lot of taboos have been removed, a lot of questions are now being debated. Who could have imagined Turkey restoring properties to non-Muslim religious communities, the latest example being the title deeds of the Greek primary school of Galata in Istanbul?</p>
<p class="contents">My third point concerns the remarks about my predecessor and about double standards. I have only one standard, and it is to be sincere and truthful both in open meetings and in meetings behind closed doors. Despite my age I have enough experience and diplomacy to be aware that the worst enemy of success is to say one thing in an open arena and something different behind closed doors. I will never, ever do it.</p>
<p class="contents">What this House should not be split on, I believe personally, is the issue of clear rules of the game at the end of this process. What are these rules of the game?</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the accession treaty which clearly reflects Turkey’s position in this case, approximating its legislation fully with the European Union acquis, as stipulated by all negotiating chapters. Number two is the consensus of all Member States, and the procedure to ratify this approval. And the third is an impact study showing clearly the impact of, in this case, Turkish membership and also showing clearly to all Member States and all of us that we are going to talk about how the process is to be managed to the benefit of both the European Union and Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">Those are the rules of the game and I hope the House is not split on this particular issue. I also hope that this House is not going to split on the issue that the best way to achieve this, the best way to help Turkey, to strengthen democracy, is actually the accession process. Does anyone in this House believe that building a big wall between us and Turkey would improve the very fundamental rights so many of you referred to? Because I do not.</p>
<p class="contents">The accession process is the only way to make the European Union the benchmark of the reforms in Turkey. The accession process is not there to compromise on our values. The accession process is for Turkey to embrace the values the European Union is so firmly based on. Why should this House be split on this process? Because, interestingly enough in this debate, I have not heard one single idea how to do it better and more efficiently to the benefit of the Turkish people. I have not heard it and I am afraid I will not hear it in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Now coming to particularities, but important ones: as regards a paragraph in the resolution on civil/military relations I would like to agree that the formulation of the sentence on the integrity of the armed forces could be improved in order to clarify more precisely what is meant and take away any ambiguity that might arise.</p>
<p class="contents">The next point: at the start of the debate I also expressed my concerns about the respect for freedom of expression in general. It is something I will continue to raise with my counterparts. I will not miss any opportunity. In Turkey we will continue to exchange views on civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me stress, in conclusion, something I feel personally very strongly about. The European Union should continue to encourage the reform process in Turkey. Our leverage and influence in Turkey will become all the more credible and stronger if our commitments, as outlined in 2005 when we launched the accession negotiations, remain unambiguous. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The attraction of the EU has actively been used to get a number of countries to implement far-reaching social, political and economic reforms. We have gained an ever larger community in which we share the same values and we exchange and trade with one another across the length and breadth of the Union, which is something that benefits security and prosperity throughout Europe. These values are the same ones that Commissioner Füle mentioned in his powerful speech just now. I look forward to continuing our constructive and positive cooperation with the European Parliament during the Danish Presidency – not only in respect of Turkey’s accession process, but also in relation to the other candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that the process is complicated and difficult and that it places considerable demands on the countries that choose to participate in it. Even though the negotiations with Turkey are in no way easy, I believe that the debate today has shown that continuing the negotiations is the best way to help Turkey along its continuing path towards political and economic reform. As emphasised in Parliament’s resolution, it is fundamentally in the interests of both the EU and Turkey that we continue down this road.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with the Member States, the European Parliament and the Commission, the Danish Presidency will do whatever it can to support this process, but I would also like to make it clear today that the final decision rests with Turkey. The accession negotiations can only move forward if there is progress in Turkey’s own reform efforts. It is hard work, which must not be underestimated, and it is also dependent on political will and commitment. The Danish Presidency will continue to follow developments closely and we will support the process where we can.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to emphasise the importance of the European Parliament in a broader political context. Debates like the one we have had today are crucial for engaging the citizens of both Turkey and the EU Member States and for ensuring the continued support for, and understanding of, our joint project. This is important work that we must not underestimate and that we should all focus on to a greater extent. The European Parliament has an incredibly important role to play in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Broadening the scope of the restoration of property rights to all non-Muslim communities since August 2011 is an encouraging development. It is equally important for the religious communities to obtain the status of a legal personality. I refer in particular to Aramean (Syriac) Christians who live mostly in the south-east of Turkey and represent one of the oldest cultures in that region. Owing to their very limited numbers, they are one of the most vulnerable ethnic and religious groups. They are exposed to assimilation by surrounding cultures; therefore, it is vital for Arameans to be able to freely teach their language in schools and to be granted officially the legal status of a minority group as suggested in Council of Europe Resolution 1704/2010. So far, the Arameans have been refused such a status, which could guarantee their cultural survival in the future. The legal ownership of the 4th Century St Gabriel’s Monastery and its surrounding lands, which is a major cultural treasure for all Turkey, should be secured and the monastery and lands protected in their entirety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Rapid economic growth has been made possible by its favourable demographic profile and continuing rises in productivity. Thanks to its strategic location at the junction of three continents – Europe, Africa and Asia – Turkey has a key role to play in ensuring stability in this highly volatile region. As a member of NATO, Turkey is an exceptionally important partner for the EU in its ambitions to create an area of stability and prosperity in its immediate neighbourhood.</p>
<p class="contents">The greatest problems in Turkey are still in the areas of democracy and human rights. It would appear that the reforms introduced by the government of Prime Minister Erdogan are primarily cosmetic in nature, and intended to deflect external criticism. Measures to protect the rights of women and ethnic minorities are still insufficient. In addition, there is no real understanding of the past in Turkey, and many legal proposals that have been adopted have not been implemented. If it fails to resolve its historical disputes with neighbours and ethnic minorities, Turkey will find it hard to create a successful future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a vital piece of the jigsaw that can provide the Union with the prospect of energy independence. It is also an important economic partner and a 77-million-strong market for our products.</p>
<p class="contents">With all its positive qualities, Turkey is still a country that has failed to condemn the first genocide in 20th Europe, namely the massacre of Armenians in the years 1915-1917. It is a very poor country, with considerable differences in growth between the western and eastern regions. There is insufficient media freedom or respect for human rights. The issue of Northern Cyprus also remains unresolved. For these reasons, among others, accepting Turkey into the European Union would appear to be completely unrealistic and illogical. It would be a disaster for such pillars of the Union as the protection of human rights, the common market and cohesion policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union and Turkey must remain economic partners, and for this reason we should aim to facilitate trade between EU Member States and Turkey and to construct joint infrastructure projects such as the Nabucco oil pipeline, for example, but they should remain separate legal entities without the possibility – or any need – for further integration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
