We are dissatisfied with the very restricted way in which the Commission has reacted to the resolutions so far. </p>
<p class="contents">The violence in the Moluccas erupted as long ago as last year. Initially, it was dwarfed by the events in East Timor, but that does not make the situation in the Moluccas less serious. In October, hundreds of people were killed. Meanwhile, three months later, there are reports of thousands of killings and many more people wounded and becoming refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">The causes are wide-ranging, of course. The area has been economically disadvantaged under the Suharto regime and this regime is also partly responsible for the country’s questionable migration policy. What is more serious, however, is the fact that there are now agitators, like on East Timor, who are setting groups of the population against each other, while the army is playing a questionable role, unfortunately. The latter was confirmed, in fact, in an interview with President Wahid last night on Dutch TV, in which he stated that the army’s behaviour in this conflict is also reprehensible. </p>
<p class="contents">Our resolution’s criticism is emphatically not aimed at the new government in Indonesia, which is making a genuine effort to restore democracy and address the human rights violations. It seems that evil in Indonesia is mainly to be found in the form of aggressive Muslim organisations and agitators in sections of the army. </p>
<p class="contents">What can the European Union do? To start with, it could give a warning sign, much like that given by Mr Holbrooke, that a coup d’état by the army in Indonesia will not be tolerated. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, an independent committee of inquiry could be set up and sent to Indonesia, preferably with a UN mandate, to establish what has happened in the past couple of months. At the same time, a conciliation committee could be sent to the area to reconcile Muslims and Christians. </p>
<p class="contents">President Wahid has already made this request and also put a name forward. It would be a good idea if the European Union were to support such an initiative. Of course, a great deal more aid is required than is given at present. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to point out that the arms embargo must be extended. There is every reason to do so as long as the role of the army is so questionable. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to note that the conflict and violence in the Moluccas have been going on for too long. The Netherlands has a large Moluccan community. It is a European community and for this reason, the European Union cannot ignore the problems of the Moluccas. We would urge both the Council and the Commission to be more decisive than they have been so far. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President, the decision taken by the Council of Ministers to lift the arms embargo against Indonesia is short-sighted and premature. Indonesia has meanwhile made the first few steps towards a democratic society. But as the American UN ambassador, Mr Holbrooke, underlined again this week, warning us of the Indonesian army, the transition to a fully-fledged democratic system is certainly not a foregone conclusion. </p>
<p class="contents">The role which the Indonesian army played in the riots on East Timor has still not been cleared up. Tension in Indonesia is mounting. Djakarta has not got the situation in the Moluccas under control. MEP Maat has just made this point as well. Large groups of citizens no longer feel safe. </p>
<p class="contents">With a premature lifting of the arms embargo, Europe threatens to be an accessory to the escalating violence. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the Council needs to reconsider its decision. We strongly urge the Member States, pending a new decision, not to resume arms supplies. </p>
<p class="contents">We would ask the Commission and Council to take four steps. First of all, the European Union needs to send a mission to Djakarta to discuss with the Wahid government a way out of the crisis. Secondly, the EU needs to conclude agreements with the Indonesian government about permitting independent observes in the Moluccas. Thirdly, more humanitarian aid is needed for all sections of the population. Lastly, more aid via the UN and NGOs is needed for refugees and the homeless. </p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, could I just say how disappointed we, the Dutch social-democratic delegation, are at the attitude of our Foreign Minister who, like a weathervane, cannot stick to any one position. At first, he supported the arms embargo but changed his mind after his visit to Djakarta. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has to act now before it is too late. I would strongly urge the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union to take the lead in this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But I urge the EU Council of Ministers to reconsider.</p>
<p class="contents">Meantime, there should be no resumption of the arms trade by Member States. This gives the wrong signals at the wrong time.

The population in the Moluccas, which was converted to Christianity, was recruited for the colonial army which had to keep the other nations under Dutch power. Fifty years ago, a large number of the Southern Moluccan population moved to the Netherlands and since then, the inhabitants of the densely populated island of Java have emigrated in massive numbers to the other islands. This has made the Moluccans who were left behind a minority in their own region. In 1965, the Indonesian army carried out a coup d’état which probably took the lives of one million people. Even after the 1999 elections, the army is still not under democratic control. It acts as an instigator of disagreement between different groups of nations. Monday last, I asked the Council to maintain the arms embargo against Indonesia. In this way, Dutch and French companies are not in breach of contract if they do not carry out prior orders of military equipment. Europe should not be surprised that civil wars keep breaking out in Indonesia if we refuse to recognise that the army has an interest in the thrashing out of ethnic and religious conflicts rooted in the colonial past. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Just to make it clear, this was not to devalue the specific discussion and the specific problems in the Moluccas at the time, but an analysis of the problem in Indonesia which goes far beyond the issue of the Moluccas and which is very deep-rooted and structural. Unfortunately, I have to say that I was right. The most recent reports now indicate that the worst atrocities are taking place on Lombok, scenes which remind us of the Moluccas and other places in Indonesia where conflict broke out, and that the next hotbeds of unrest are already revealing themselves, for example on Sulawesi. All this is the result of, among other things, hate campaigns orchestrated even by the chairman of the legislative meeting, among others. </p>
<p class="contents">President Wahid’s reaction, however, is encouraging. In my opinion, it would be beneficial if the European Parliament were to support him in his fight against intolerance and for a moderate, liberal form of Islam, but also, in particular, in his fight against large sections of the army, the army which does not take sufficient action against troublemakers and even refuses to account for its own role on East Timor, for example. </p>
<p class="contents">What I fail to grasp, however, is how President Wahib would benefit from the resumption of arms supplies. The EU has all kinds of means to influence the process in Indonesia. One of the Members has already listed them: observers, humanitarian aid. But this also includes – with a special appeal to the Member States – an arms embargo. What is needed in Indonesia is for the role of the army to be suppressed, not to be reinforced by supplying more weapons. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The situation in the Moluccas, clearly set out in the joint motion for a resolution, is evidence that the reasons for the embargo have not changed, which is why Parliament’s position remains the same. As the current Indonesian Government itself decided a month ago, after the free elections, to be ruled by the values of democracy, including respect for human rights, it deserves the appreciation and solidarity of the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in the Moluccas, which is not an isolated case in Indonesia, requires caution and discretion in the expression of this solidarity. This situation has arisen in particular due to the internal migration policy promoted by the Suharto military dictatorship with which the current actions of the Indonesian armed forces are associated. These actions represent a repetition of the worst events in East Timor, as if nothing had changed in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore support the necessary reinforcement of international cooperation, mainly through humanitarian aid to Indonesia and assistance with respective development. In this way we can demonstrate our appreciation of the democratic nature of the current government, thereby helping to increase its authority.</p>
<p class="contents">I am against the sale of arms to armed forces which have yet to understand their position in a rule of law which should bring them under the control of the government. Given the circumstances, the right signal would be sent by extending the embargo on the sale of arms to Indonesia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is why Europe has to support President Wahid in his attempts to restore peace in the Moluccas. So far, the European Union has done precious little. We need to provide more humanitarian aid and help the Indonesians gather Muslims and Christians round the negotiating table. A European mission, for example under the guidance of former Dutch Prime Minister Lubbers, could be of benefit here. The ELDR Group regrets that the arms embargo is not being extended. There is still a hotbed of tension and human rights are still being violated. As such, the General Affairs Council fails to observe our own European criteria for an arms embargo. The European Union’s decision is playing into the hands of the military and this is exactly what should not happen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is time to express our absolute repugnance at these dreadful events.</p>
<p class="contents">The message of the religions of the book, however, is clear, simple and positive. It is inconceivable that it should be hijacked to justify such horrors. Through slow and regular pressure, Islam has already driven most eastern Christians into exile. What are we doing in practical terms to support them? A whole galaxy of associations, in France and in Europe, is trying to come to their assistance so that exile is not the only option left open to them. I congratulate them most sincerely.</p>
<p class="contents">What impoverishment and what a loss for these countries. The Christians who have lived in these countries since well before the expansion of Islam also form the cultural roots of these countries. Admittedly, in the Moluccas, the situation is different, as the Indonesian government is trying, unsuccessfully, to control the situation, although it is evidently unable to control its own armed forces, hence the importance of not lifting the arms embargo.</p>
<p class="contents">It is to be feared that once again through their blood the Christians will serve as a scapegoat for crises that overtake them. The crisis of the Indonesian State has deep-seated economic, social and political roots as well as religious ones. Our Group therefore expresses its absolute horror at what is happening in the Moluccas, as it did at what happened in East Timor, and its great concern about the fate of Christians in the Middle East, and now in Asia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to him, the religious violence is generated by a violent minority, the so-called ‘dark forces’, who keep breathing new life into the conflict. </p>
<p class="contents">Recent images and reports, however, seem to contradict this. The gravity of the situation is illustrated by the large-scale arson attacks on churches and mosques and the repeated appeals for a holy war, jihad. The spreading of the violence to Lombok and Sulawesi is also great cause for concern. The mutual bloodshed in the Moluccas has now lasted for a year.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, of course, tempting to track down those directly responsible for such a conflict. The Indonesian press is heavily involved in this activity. Whether this will really contribute to solving the conflict very much remains to be seen. At present, it even seems that the media are, in fact, feeding the violence. Their reports are quite frequently the cause for new attacks. </p>
<p class="contents">Apart from the press, the army is also playing a dubious role. Both Muslims and Christians have levelled accusations against the army. Wahid has attempted to restore control over the army, but he has not been entirely successful. It seems unwise, therefore, to lift the arms embargo against Indonesia for the time being. </p>
<p class="contents">The common resolution calls on the Council, the Commission and Parliament to help resolve the conflicts in Indonesia via delegations. Needless to say, we cannot barge in and prescribe a number of solutions. Within Indonesian society, ethnic and religious minorities and all other social operators must help in the construction of a civil society. Humanitarian aid must be provided as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
