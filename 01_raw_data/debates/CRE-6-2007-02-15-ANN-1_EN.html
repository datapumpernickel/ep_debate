<p>(DE) The following answer, which was drafted by the presidency and is binding on neither the Council nor its members, was presented in a non-oral form at the Council’s question time in the European Parliament’s plenary sitting in February 2007 in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>On 28 November 2006 the Council reached political agreement on the proposal for a directive on the exemption from valued added tax and excise duty of goods imported by persons travelling from third countries.</p>
<p>The Council decided to raise the current 175-euro monetary threshold, which was laid down in 1994, to 300 euros for people travelling over land, including on inland waterways, and 430 euros for air and sea passengers. In the view of the Council, it was appropriate to adjust the threshold in line with the evolution of monetary values. As a result of the planned removal of the specific maximum quantities for perfume, coffee and tea, these items will also fall beneath the threshold in future. If the threshold were not raised, travellers would be able to carry fewer duty-free items than before.</p>
<p>The amendment to the directive also gives the Member States greater flexibility and reduces the administrative burden involved in routine controls and, especially, calculating charges in the case of small quantities. In the interests of travellers, goods of relatively low value need no longer be declared.</p>
<p>As far as tobacco products and alcoholic drinks are concerned, I should point out that these are subject to quantitative restrictions and are thus unaffected by the increase in the threshold. On the contrary, in the interests of supporting their health policies, Member States are to apply lower maximum quantities for imports of tobacco products.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-1074"></a>

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on its members, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the February 2007 plenary sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>In essence, the honourable Member’s question relates to two points, namely what he terms the ‘constitutional crisis’ and enlargement.</p>
<p>Further to the first point, the honourable Member is referred to the statement by the Heads of State and Government, on the occasion of their meeting in December 2006, to the effect that the Union’s approach is twin-track, in that it makes use of the best possible options afforded by the Treaties currently in force in order to achieve concrete objectives, while at the same time working to prepare the way for the continuation of the reform process. As announced in December, the Finnish Presidency handed over the outcomes of its consultations with the Member States on the constitutional treaty to the German Presidency as part of its preparations for the report to be presented in the first six months of 2007. The intention is that the report should highlight possible future developments. It will also serve as a basis for further decisions as to how the process of reforming the EU should be planned.</p>
<p>I can answer with greater brevity the second point of the honourable Member’s question, relating to enlargement. Firstly, in reaching, in December, their renewed consensus on enlargement, the Heads of State and Government stressed that the EU would honour the promises made to the countries already in the enlargement process. Secondly – and this is no less important – they stated that, as the enlargement of the European Union progresses, European integration can be successful only if the EU institutions continue to function efficiently and if EU policy continues to develop and be funded in a sustainable manner.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-1079"></a>

<p>Royal Decree 1316/2001 regulates the discounts given to residents of the autonomous communities of the Canaries and the Balearic Islands on standard fares in air and sea transport (43% discount on the price of tickets, rising to 50% in 2007). This measure was introduced to offset the disadvantages associated with islands.</p>
<p>The regional government of the Balearics is seeking to extend the right to claim this discount to immigrants resident in the Balearics. It is basing its action on the principle of 'equal obligations - equal rights', since immigrants residing in the islands are obliged to contribute to the public purse but do not enjoy the right to benefit from discounted fares on scheduled air and sea transport services. Achieving a genuine integration policy entails offering non-Community residents the same incentives as those granted to national or Community residents. This will make it possible for these residents to be effectively and genuinely integrated, in a context of solidarity and equality.</p>
<p>Does the Council believe that the European institutions should be involved in this issue, since it relates to integration policy seen from the point of view of human rights, democracy and the rule of law?

The EP has called for a code of good practice on the rights and quality of life of people with MS, which would look at crucial issues around employment and job retention, a joint research agenda and meaningful participation of people with MS themselves.

<p>The Council thanks the Honourable Member for his interest in this matter.</p>
<p>The Council has not yet discussed a Code of Good Practice such as this. However, the Programme of Community Action in the Field of Public Health (2003-2008) offers the possibility of implementing measures and programmes to establish indicators on neurodegenerative brain diseases, impairments of neurological development and non-psychiatric brain diseases, including multiple sclerosis. The European Commission is supporting the European Multiple Sclerosis Platform’s ‘MS-Information Dividend’ project, which is due to start this year.</p>
<p>The Council has reached political agreement on the Second Programme of Community Action in the Field of Public Health, and the presidency hopes to reach agreement with the European Parliament at second reading. The programme provides for the possibility of furthering an exchange of knowledge and best practice, collection and analysis of health-related data, and distribution of information on health issues.</p>
<p>In addition, the Seventh Research Framework Programme opens up possibilities for health research in the field of neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on its members, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the February 2007 plenary sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>On 21 December 2006, the Council adopted Regulation 1933/2006/EC temporarily withdrawing access to the generalised tariff preferences from the Republic of Belarus<a href="#defann_6_1" name="refann_6_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. It needs to be emphasised, however, that this measure is not conceived as a sanction, but rather as a suspension of preferences resulting from Belarus’ failure to comply with international labour standards, particularly the right to freedom of association.</p>
<p>The Council is aware of the potential economic consequences that might result, for certain Member States, from the withdrawal of access to the generalised tariff preferences and from the consequent return to the generally applicable tariffs. It has to be said, however, that such economic consequences would be limited, since most goods imported into the EU from Belarus have not hitherto enjoyed preferences under the generalised scheme. What is also at issue is the maintenance of the European Union’s credibility, of coherence in the application of its decisions and the upholding of its core values.</p>
<p>The withdrawal of access to the generalised tariff preferences does not, however, enter into effect immediately, but rather only six months following the decision being taken, and even then only if it has not become evident before that date that Belarus has remedied the deficits as found and a decision has therefore been taken that the conditions resulting in this Regulation no longer apply. This gives the authorities in Belarus a further opportunity to comply with the relevant international standards. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) will be continuing its examination of this matter at the 298<span class="sup">th</span> sitting of its Governing Body in March 2007 and at the 96<span class="sup">th</span> International Labour Conference in June 2007, and will be subjecting to particular scrutiny the latest changes to the law submitted by the Belarus Government. The Commission has undertaken to report to the Council on current developments in Belarus following the ILO governing body meeting in Geneva in March 2007.</p>
<p>As for the last part of the question, the withdrawal of the generalised tariff preferences has had no effect on Russia’s determination to increase gas prices for Belarus, and the Council has no evidence of any attempt on Russia’s part to depict the EU’s policy as hostile.</p>
<p>There is no contradiction between the withdrawal of access to the generalised tariff preferences and the non-paper ‘What the European Union could bring to Belarus’, according to which the EU is unable to normalise and deepen its relations with Belarus for as long as the authorities there continue to offend against democratic values and violate the fundamental rights of the country’s people.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(DE) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on its members, was not given orally at Council Question Time at the European Parliament's February 2007 part-session in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The negotiations on the EU-US air transport agreement were wound up in November 2005. The EU subsequently waited for more than a year for the outcome of the US Government’s internal procedures as a result of which rules were to be drawn up on foreign holdings in US carriers.</p>
<p>At its meeting of 12 December 2006, however, the Council was informed that the US Department of Transportation had withdrawn the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) concerning extended scope for holdings in US carriers, which had been issued as long ago as November 2005. The Council expressed deep disappointment and its regret at that decision, and reaffirmed its commitment to the goal of securing a historic, first-stage EU-US comprehensive air transport agreement that would increase legal certainty and replace the existing bilateral agreements. To that end, and further to the proposal of the US, the Council requested the Commission to enter into urgent consultations with the US as soon as possible in order to seek elements that could be used to restore a proper balance of interests.</p>
<p>EU-US relations in this area are addressed only in the context of the EU-US air transport agreement referred to, and the possibility of concluding bilateral air transport agreements between EU Member States and the US is not being considered by the parties involved.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-1090"></a>

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on its members, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the February 2007 plenary sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The honourable Member points out that, in the United States, more stringent NOx emission values currently apply than is the case in the European Union. Because of differences in the test procedures, however, the limit values are not directly comparable.</p>
<p>The ‘Euro 5’ and ‘Euro 6’ limit values recently adopted accomplish a drastic reduction in NOx emission in Europe. Compliance with the requirements in Europe – as also in the USA – is achieved by enforcing the removal of the most particulates possible from the exhausts of diesel private motor vehicles.</p>
<p>It is worthy of note that there has been, to date, only a small market for private diesel motor vehicles in the USA, and so the technology required to achieve the American limit value was made available only for a few diesel cars at the top of the medium range. Private motor cars of all classes equipped with the most modern diesel engines occupy a markedly larger segment of the European market than they do in the United States, and one of the effects of this is a reduction in the amount of CO2 emitted by vehicles in the EU. The problem of CO2 emissions will be addressed in the forthcoming Commission communication on the amendment of the Community’s strategy for reducing the emission of CO2 from motor vehicles, to which the Council will be giving close attention.</p>
<p>The EU is engaged in putting the case for further harmonisation of the requirements applicable to motor vehicles to the UN Economic Commission for Europe, which is based in Geneva.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0003"></a>

<p>The Council wishes to assure the honourable Member that security of supply represents one of the most important priorities of the Community’s energy policy, as is evident from the many approaches being employed, in accordance with this policy, in order to make the Community’s supplies more secure, including, among other examples, the diversification of sources of supply and transport routes, the diversification of energy sources, greater energy efficiency, an external energy policy, the optimisation of the functioning of the internal market in energy and measures aimed as promoting transparency.</p>
<p>The objective of guaranteeing the security of the Community’s supplies is also a key characteristic of the Community’s dealings with Russia concerning energy. The Council is persuaded that the Community’s interest in secure supplies is best served by a mutually beneficial and stable energy relationship with Russia – a relationship that is transparent and must function in a reliable manner.</p>
<p>The European Council of 23/24 March 2006 stated that improvement of security of supply involved ensuring common operational approaches to address crisis situations in a spirit of solidarity, taking subsidiarity into account. It ought also to be noted that the 2006 statement on security of supply by the G8 explicitly endorsed the principles of the energy charter.</p>
<p>The Council can assure the honourable Member that no effort was spared or is being spared to find a compromise as regards the incorporation of relevant references to the Energy Charter Treaty into the negotiation guidelines.</p>

<p>All operators of nuclear power stations are required to comply with the Community and national safety regulations. The national authorities to which safety and protection against radiation are entrusted are responsible for ensuring that the necessary checks are carried out.

<p>The Council wishes to thank the Honourable Member for his interest in this important topic. Since 2005, the EU has made considerable progress in stepping up its contingency planning for a possible flu pandemic.</p>
<p>Throughout Europe, contingency planning for a pandemic is currently being tackled with great political commitment. All Member States now have national contingency plans for flu, which have now progressed beyond the drafting stage to the implementation stage. At EU level, guidelines are also available for contingency planning for a flu pandemic (e.g. the Commission communication on Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Planning in the European Community<a href="#defann_13_1" name="refann_13_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>). In most EU countries, systems are in readiness to identify and investigate initial cases of pandemic flu. In November 2005, an EU-wide pandemic simulation exercise was carried out, in which all Member States took part, in order to test the national plans and warning systems; a second exercise is currently being prepared.</p>
<p>Both at EU and at Member-State level, substantial investments have been made in research into flu vaccine ingredients and virostatics. At international level, the EU and the World Health Organisation regularly hold European workshops on contingency planning for pandemics.</p>
<p>The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) constantly assesses the Member States' contingency plans and makes recommendations for improvements.</p>
<p>The Member States and the Commission have made great progress in preparing the EU for a pandemic by means of joint action and with the support of EU agencies such as the ECDC.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council’s video streaming project is a new project. It has been running since September 2006, but is being developed further in many respects and, hence, can still be improved upon. It is part of the general effort by the Council to make its activities accessible to the public. The goal of the project is to enable Internet users to follow open events at the Council, thus including its public debates, 'live' or on recordings. The project is geared to openness and accessibility for European (and other) citizens and is therefore not intended to exclude anyone.</p>
<p>In this connection, the Council’s IT departments are currently working on the question of compatibility with other systems, including open-source software. Open-source users can already follow video transmissions of the Council's open events over the Internet by means of open-source programs such as VCL Media Player, which is available free of charge on the Internet and runs on various platforms such as MS Windows and a number of open-source operating systems.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0026"></a>

<p>The Council cannot yet make any definite statement as to how political and economic relations between the EU and Serbia will develop this year, as they will depend, inter alia, on certain developments in Serbia and the Western Balkan region as a whole which are difficult to predict. The results of the elections of 21 January 2007 afford an opportunity to form a coalition government in Serbia which commits itself to the necessary reforms and puts the country on the road to Europe, which would, inter alia, entail constructive cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. If such a government were to be formed and to take the appropriate action quickly, this would do much to bring about progress in relations between the EU and Serbia in the next year. If the right preconditions were in place, negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement could be resumed. However, the talks between the parties belonging to the 'democratic bloc' on a coalition government have only just begun, and their outcome remains to be seen.

<p>The Council is monitoring closely the situation with regard to human rights and fundamental civil rights in Ethiopia, in particular following the elections of 15 May 2005 and the ensuing events.</p>
<p>The EU’s diplomatic representatives in Addis Abeba have identified respect for human rights and the rule of law in general as key topics in the political dialogue conducted with Ethiopia under Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement. In that connection, they have repeatedly, in some cases at face-to-face meetings with Prime Minister Meles, voiced the Union’s concern at the human rights situation in Ethiopia, and in particular at the arrest of opposition leaders, newspaper publishers and journalists and representatives of civil society organisations. The EU’s representatives have urged the Ethiopian Government to halt the harassment of the opposition and civil society organisations by the security forces and to allow the private media to work freely. With particular regard to the situation of the media, the EU has expressed concern about press freedom and at the high number of imprisoned journalists.</p>
<p>The EU will continue to monitor the situation in Ethiopia closely and raise relevant issues with the Ethiopian Government.

<p>(DE) This answer drawn up by the Presidency, which is not binding on the Council or its members, was not given orally at Question Time to the Council at the February 2007 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>One of the aims of the EU's Strategy for Africa, which the European Council adopted at its meeting in December 2005, is to ensure that Africa's wealth benefits its people and does not fan conflict. Support for the Kimberley Process is one way of attaining this goal. The Kimberley Process has reduced trade in conflict diamonds to a very low level (an estimated 0.2% of annual world production).</p>
<p>The Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS) is applied by virtue of Council Regulation (EC) No 2368/2002<a href="#defann_20_1" name="refann_20_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, which introduced a Community system for certification of rough diamonds and import and export controls relating to them.</p>
<p>Since the initiation of this process in Kimberley, South Africa, in 2000, the European Community has actively supported it. The Community played a pioneering role in creating the system for reviewing internal controls. In addition, the European Community has successfully advocated the necessary strengthening of this system. In 2007 it is playing a leading role, as the Commission is chairing the Process this year. During this period, the European Community must demonstrate the requisite leadership qualities to implement the recommendations adopted at the plenary meeting at the end of 2006. The objectives for 2007, whose keywords as defined by the Commission are 'consolidation' and 'crisis reaction', are fully endorsed by the Council.</p>
<p>It is largely thanks to the Kimberley Process that illegal trading in rough diamonds has largely been halted. Because of the successful application measures, imports of legally obtained diamonds have risen substantially; countries which can show that they are abiding by the certification scheme have benefited from this. One example is Sierra Leone, where the diamond industry is now one of the principal industries in terms of employment.</p>
<p>In the case of certain other countries, the Kimberley Process continues to play an important part in combating illegal imports. In accordance with the UN-imposed sanctions, imports of raw diamonds from Côte d'Ivoire and Liberia to any EU country have been prohibited by common positions adopted under the CFSP or by EC Regulations. The sanctions are reviewed regularly. In the case of Liberia, the UN Security Council has welcomed the progress made in instituting the requisite internal controls to comply with the minimum requirements. A further review will be carried out within the next six months.</p>
<p>Appropriate financial and technical support is the basis for the effectiveness of the KPCS. Adequate funding essentially has to be provided by the participating States for their territory. At last year's Kimberley Process plenary meeting from 6 to 9 November 2006 in Gaborone, Botswana, it was debated whether and to what extent participating States and the diamond industry could, more than hitherto, provide support for certain participating States or observers. This would particularly mean building up capacity to evaluate rough diamonds and to perform internal controls, and opportunities to participate in review visits. Various individual measures have already been carried out or initiated, for example by Belgians.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>There are plans to hold an EU-Canada Summit during the German Presidency. The discussions are likely to focus on international security, crisis management, energy issues/climate change and trade issues. The EU and Canada are working together in an effort to tackle the key foreign policy challenges facing us, for example in Afghanistan, the Balkans and Sudan/Darfur. Canada is already involved in various EU crisis management operations. This cooperation could be stepped up. Canada's status as one of the world's largest energy producers would make a strategic discussion on climate change and energy issues highly relevant. In the area of economic policy, the central topics are our joint commitment to the Doha development agenda, moves to step up trade relations and the possible resumption of negotiations on an agreement to foster trade and investment between the EU and Canada. The abolition of the visa requirement for all EU citizens entering Canada is an important objective. This issue is regularly discussed with Canada.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0046"></a>

<p>As the honourable Member will be aware, Parliament and the Council are currently examining a proposal by the Commission on roaming charges for mobile telephony.<a href="#defann_23_1" name="refann_23_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> Although action previously taken by the Commission has to some degree resulted in reductions in price and in greater transparency among service providers, the range of international roaming charges is nonetheless still very considerable, and consumers are often still missing out on price transparency, and so the Council shares the Commission’s view that legislation is needed in order to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>The German Presidency plans to stay in close contact with the Commission and with Parliament’s rapporteurs, Mr Rübig and Mr Muscat. Working together with Parliament, the Council wishes to achieve a satisfactory result as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The Council has, on many occasions, argued that the future regulation should be easily implemented and legally watertight in order to become effective without delay and bring about a considerable reduction in roaming charges for end-users, and that it should be founded on the principles of transparency, of better regulation and of consumer protection, while, at the same time, ensuring that the service providers have the flexibility they need to develop innovative new services and to be enabled to remain competitive in the long term.

<p>The Council takes the view that racism and xenophobia constitute direct violations of the principles of freedom, democracy, respect for human rights and basic freedoms and the rule of law, upon which values the European Union is founded, and which are indispensable to peaceful coexistence in the EU. The framework decision on the combating of racism and xenophobia does not, therefore aim to draw distinctions of value between one fundamental right and another, but rather to bring them into harmony with one another.</p>
<p>The draft takes account of the stringent requirements that the Member States and the EU itself, in varying ways, impose on curtailments of national and European fundamental rights, in that it is explicitly not intended to touch upon the duties laid down in Article 6 of the European Union Treaty as regards respect for fundamental rights and the general principles of law, including free expression of opinion and freedom of association. It will also accord the Member States the necessary discretion to continue constitutional traditions that have developed over time.</p>
<p>All that having been said, the Council is working on the assumption that the planned framework decision will not have any adverse effects on Europe’s development as a democracy, but, rather, that it can be expected to have a positive effect on the climate of coexistence in the EU.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0053"></a>

<p>Although the situation in Lebanon remains tense, a certain degree of calm has returned. We are continuing to observe the situation in the country as a whole, Southern Lebanon included.</p>
<p>In the latest Council conclusions (of 22 January 2007), the EU stressed that it is vitally important in terms of the stability and further development of the Lebanon, as well as in the interest of all its people, that a way should be found out of the currently intractable political situation. Such an exit route should be found only through dialogue and with unconditional respect for Lebanon’s democratic institutions, sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence. We welcome the prospects for inter-party dialogue and, with that in mind, wish to express our appreciation of the efforts at conciliation made by the Secretary-General of the Arab League.</p>
<p>Our continued commitment to Lebanon is demonstrated by the undertaking given at the Paris III Conference by the EU and its Member States to commit over EUR 2 billion, and by the deployment of 8 000 peace-keeping troops.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0056"></a>

<p>Acting in breach of international human rights conventions, the US administration has decided to build a wall along most of the length of the Mexican border - 1 125 km. - at a total cost in excess of US$ 6 billion, on the pretext of stopping illegal immigration from the countries of Central and South America. This reactionary move has angered economic migrants and unions in the US and caused outrage among the peoples of Latin America and internationally. This disgraceful decision by the US administration attracted vehement criticism at the 16th Latin American Summit, because it constitutes a flagrant violation of human rights. The increase in repressive measures at the US-Mexican border has led to an increase in the number of victims, since some ten million economic migrants have not been officially recognised by the US authorities, even though they have been living and working in the US for many years.</p>

<p>In her speech to the plenary of the European Parliament on 17 January, Federal Chancellor Merkel, the President of the European Union in the first half of 2007, made it abundantly clear that the Middle East is one of the main priorities for the German Presidency, and this position was reiterated by her foreign minister, Mr Steinmeier, when he met with the European Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs on 23 January. The Council has also clearly expressed its desire to bring the present stalemate in the peace process to an end and to help reduce tension right across the region, and the EU, further to this, has stressed its determination to play an active part in the work of the Middle East Quartet in achieving a comprehensive solution to the conflict between Israeli and Arab.</p>
<p>The Council has been constant in its support for efforts towards Palestinian unity, which have been made under the leadership of President Abbas and with the support of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and of other partners in the region, and it was thanks to these that, on 8 February in Mecca, an agreement on the formation of a government of national unity was reached. For its part, the Council has declared itself willing to work together with a legitimate Palestinian Government that is united on a platform corresponding to the principles of the Quartet.</p>
<p>The Council has called for the immediate and unconditional cessation of all acts of violence and terrorism, and for a consolidation of the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and its extension to the West Bank of the Jordan. It has urged Israel to desist from all acts that might jeopardise the sustainability of an agreed two-state solution, including the settlement of the area in and around East Jerusalem and of the valley of the Jordan. The Council has also repeatedly stressed how important it is that the agreement on access and freedom of movement be implemented without conditions being attached and that Israel should pay out all the Palestinian tax and customs revenues that it has collected and currently retains.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0061"></a>

<p>Because of the difficult situation in the region, the Troika of EU Ambassadors has not yet visited West Papua, although the Heads of Mission in Jakarta have taken an active approach to this issue. In late January 2007 a start was made on preparations for the visit by a mixed group of embassy advisers in which experts/specialists in political, economic and development matters will take part. The purpose of the visit is to investigate the situation in the region on the spot and to obtain information at first hand from the governors, other political agencies and non-government representatives of civil society. The visit is intended to help the EU carry out a comprehensive, up-to-date assessment of the situation in the provinces of West Papua, including the local need for EU assistance.</p>
<p>As part of its regular political dialogue with the Indonesian Government, the EU repeatedly raises this matter, for example at the EU Troika's annual ministerial meeting with Indonesia. The EU regularly reiterates its call for efforts to be made to secure a sustainable solution for West Papua through the implementation of a special autonomy law, the transfer of responsibility for social, economic, health and education matters to the native population and the settlement of disputes concerning natural resources in a manner consistent with the principles of fairness and the rule of law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0063"></a>

According to the manual, neither will the defence lawyers of terrorist suspects have the right to reveal classified information during proceedings unless it has been reviewed beforehand by the government.

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on its members, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the February 2007 plenary sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The EU and the United States are engaged in in-depth dialogue on international law and the combating of terrorism, the significance of which dialogue was highlighted in the statement arising out of the 2006<a href="#defann_30_1" name="refann_30_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> summit meeting between the EU and the USA: “Consistent with our common values, we will ensure that measures taken to combat terrorism comply fully with our international obligations, including human rights law, refugee law and international humanitarian law. We attach great importance to our ongoing in-depth dialogue on our common fight against terrorism and our respective domestic and international legal obligations.”</p>
<p>The dialogue between the EU and the United States also touches on the issue of the status, rights, and treatment of the prisoners in Guantanamo. One object of this dialogue is to highlight ways in which international terrorism might be fought effectively without infringing international law. To a country as committed to freedom, the rule of law and the guarantees afforded thereby as the USA, Guantanamo is quite foreign, and the EU takes the view that the US Government should take steps to close it down as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In the Guidelines for EU policy towards third countries on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment<a href="#defann_30_2" name="refann_30_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, it is laid down that it needs to be guaranteed by a country’s domestic legal system ‘that any statement which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made’.</p>
<p>The Council summed up to the EU’s position in its conclusions on 11 December 2006<a href="#defann_30_3" name="refann_30_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>: “The EU remains firmly committed to the absolute prohibition of torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and punishment. It guides our own actions and we raise our concerns with third countries.”</p>
<p>Further to this, the Council emphasises that human rights, the rights of refugees and humanitarian international law must be respected and safeguarded even when terrorism is being combated. The Council will continue to follow closely developments with regard to human rights in combating terrorism and take adequate measures for their protection. The existence of secret detention facilities where detained persons are kept in a legal vacuum is not in conformity with international humanitarian and human rights law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(DE) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor its Members, was not given orally at Question Time to the Council at the European Parliament’s February 2007 part-session in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council takes the increase in opium production in Afghanistan extremely seriously.</p>
<p>Drugs from Afghanistan continue to have top priority for the EU in the fight against international drug trafficking. The EU resolutely advocates anti-drug measures in Afghanistan. For that reason, the EU supports Afghanistan’s national drug control strategy, a balanced strategy which represents a suitable basis for dealing with the drug problem in the long term.</p>
<p>The EU is continuing to implement its paper on practical measures to combat the cultivation of drugs in and the smuggling of drugs from Afghanistan, which was adopted by the Council in May 2006. We are providing targeted support on that basis. In that connection, on Monday, 29 January 2007 the Council held a meeting with Afghanistan to discuss our cooperation in the area of anti-drug measures.</p>
<p>In connection with all aspects of its support for the Afghan Government, the EU can rely on regular, close cooperation with the United States and other international partners. The most recent instance came on Tuesday, 30 January 2007 in Berlin, when the members of the Joint Coordination and Monitoring Board, the central steering body set up at political director level to implement the Afghanistan Compact, met. In addition, the EU holds regular bilateral talks with the United States.</p>
<p>Long-term, sustainable development is the only way of creating alternative, sustainable employment for poppy farmers. This has been proven in areas such as Nangahar; here, against the background of a functioning administration, and in a safe environment, poppy cultivation has been reduced on a lasting basis. The EU strategy attaches high priority to measures to combat drug smuggling, border controls and alternative development. Most of the assistance provided by the Community and the Member States goes to fund alternative development and rural development programmes.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0071"></a>

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on its members, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the February 2007 plenary sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council, in response to a proposal from the Commission on the subject, has adopted a resolution on the signing of the readmission agreement concluded between the Community and the Russian Federation. The Agreement was signed on 2 May 2006.</p>
<p>The legal basis for the drafting of a Council Resolution on the conclusion of the readmission agreement was Article 63(3)b of the Treaty on European Union in conjunction with Article 300(2)(1) first sentence of the same Treaty. The procedure to be adopted in such a case in accordance with the Treaty involves the consultation of the European Parliament, which is expected to give its opinion on this matter.</p>
<p>The honourable Member’s attention is drawn to the provision, in the readmission agreement, for the appointment of a Joint Committee (Article 19), which would have the task of monitoring the application of the agreement, of ensuring its uniform implementation, and of proposing amendments.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission adopted a proposal on 12 September 2006 laying out procedures and assessment criteria for mergers and acquistions in the financial sector. The intention of this proposal is to provide legal certainty, clarity and transparency of the assessment process whereby competent authorities in the Member State concerned may examine the proposed aquisition, the originator of which may be in the same Member State, another Member State or a third country.</p>
<p>There is no provision in the above-mentioned proposal to specifically protect entities in the Banking Sector from hostile bids and mergers. There are safeguards that apply to all potential acquirers that are aimed at ensuring the continued sound and prudent management of the ongoing entity.</p>
<p>Hostile takeover bids and mergers are a part of the functioning of today's markets. Just as a European entity may bid for an entity in a third country, an entity from a third country may bid for a European entity. The Commission cannot encourage or discourage acquisitions; however, it can strive to provide a more robust legal framework within which market participants may implement their business decisions.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that the fundamental World Trade Organisation (WTO) principle of non-discrimination, the so-called Most-Favoured Nation (MFN) clause, which is laid down in Article II of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), obliges the EC and its Member States to apply the same treatment to all WTO Members as far as market access conditions relevant for trade in services are concerned. This includes the setting up or consolidation of a commercial presence through cross-border investments in the financial services' sector.</p>
<p>The Commission would also point out that holdings and acquisitions in financial institutions are capital movements within the meaning of Article 56 et seq. of the EC Treaty. Article 56 prohibits all restrictions on the movement of capital between Member States and between Member States and third countries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0048"></a>

<p>(EN) With increasingly globalised markets, there is a need to improve access to major third country markets as well as to promote regulatory convergence with and financial stability of these markets. The development of the Commission's external dimension was therefore set out as one of the priorities in the White Paper on the financial services policy strategy 2005-2010. The Commission's regulatory dialogue with China is part of this strategy.</p>
<p>The Commission started in 2005 a high level dialogue on Financial Services with the Ministry of Finance and the Chinese regulatory authorities. Two high-level meetings were held in 2005 and 2006 and two technical subgroups in accounting and in insurance have taken place in 2006. The Commission reports widely the result of all its third countries dialogues to all institutions and other interested parties.</p>
<p>In order further to improve coordination and efficiency, the Commission will, starting in 2007, be permanently represented by an official, expert in regulation and internal market matters (on Financial Services) in its delegation in Beijing. This expert will mainly work on financial services issues, will promote the EU regulatory framework and help financial services companies to gain a better market access in China.

<p>On 20 December 2006, the EU Council of Ministers decided to withdraw access to the generalised system of tariff preferences from the Republic of Belarus. This sanction was imposed because Belarus was failing to observe the commitments it had made at the International Labour Organisation on trade union activity. However, I doubt whether the EU will succeed in achieving its aims by such means: sanctions are a blow above all to the Belarusian people and not to the leaders of the authoritarian regime. Experts calculate that the country will lose 44% of its exports, affecting 130 000 workers in the textile industry.</p>
<p>As we know, Belarus was recently also dealt an economic blow by Russia. Despite the above, is the Commission still not inclined to review the situation again?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The scheme of generalised tariff preferences (GSP) is one of the EU's key instruments to respond to the needs of developing countries and to promote sustainable development and good governance. Through the GSP the EU unilaterally offers preferential access to the EU market, while encouraging developing countries inter alia to comply with core international standards related to workers' rights.</p>
<p>However, continuing granting preferential benefits to countries which breach the provisions of the GSP scheme by seriously and systematically violating human rights and international labour conventions, would weaken the incentive for others to comply with these standards. This is why the GSP Regulation provides for the possibility of a temporary withdrawal of the preferential arrangements in case of non-observance of core workers' rights, as described in the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions listed in the GSP Regulation. A detailed procedure, which has to be followed in case of such breach, is set in Chapter III of the GSP Regulation.</p>
<p>Under this procedure, and on the basis of a joint complaint by international and European trade unions, the investigation into the situation in the Republic of Belarus was launched by the Commission in 2003. It confirmed serious and systematic violations of workers' rights in the Republic of Belarus. These findings have also been confirmed by the ILO. The ILO and various stakeholders confirmed that during the four years of the withdrawal procedure, including the evaluation and monitoring period and consultations, Belarus did not remedy the situation.</p>
<p>Failing to react to the findings would not only violate the GSP scheme's requirements, but would also demonstrate a disregard for core labour rights in Belarus.</p>
<p>In this situation, the EU Member States decided on 21 December 2006 to adopt the decision on the temporary withdrawal of GSP preferences from the Republic of Belarus. However, the decision on withdrawal of preferences will enter into force only six months after its adoption by the Council, i.e. in June 2007.</p>
<p>The withdrawal of Belarus from the GSP is not an imposition of economic sanctions; it is the withdrawal of a positive unilateral trade advantage given to this country, which is linked to the respect of certain conditions.</p>
<p>The GSP preferential treatment for products originating in Belarus can be re-established, if Belarus aligns itself with internationally agreed standards, which would assure basic workers' rights and to which genuine application the EU attaches a great importance. The economic consequences of the GSP removal should not be overstated. Only 12% of Belarus exports to the EU benefit from the GSP tariff reduction. Removal of the GSP does not halt Belarus’ exports to the EU but simply reinstates the standard tariffs of the Most Favoured Nation regime.</p>
<p>The EU, while cooperating with the ILO, is keeping the process of internal reform in Belarus under review. Should the violations of workers' rights cease, the EU would certainly reconsider its position.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0073"></a>

<p>On 12 October 2006, among other things as a result of strong pressure from Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the Commission imposed anti-dumping duties on imports of frozen strawberries from China, initially for a six-month period. The decision was taken in response to the catastrophic situation on the EU soft-fruit market which was borne out by the comprehensive report submitted by the Commission special mission.</p>
<p>The sound decision taken by the Commission can improve the situation on the soft-fruit market, but only if the Commission extends the period of period of application of the anti-dumping duties and does not withdraw them at the end of the initial six-month period. If the duties were to be withdrawn, dumping would resume on the European market with redoubled force, resulting in the discontinuation of strawberry production in Europe, particularly in the new Member States.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission is fully aware of the situation of the Polish producers of frozen strawberries and of the importance of this question to Poland.</p>
<p>This anti-dumping proceeding on frozen strawberries from China was initiated in January 2006 and the Commission concluded provisionally that the requisite conditions were met, justifying the adoption of provisional anti dumping measures in October 2006.</p>
<p>Anti-dumping measures are taken after a rigorous and constraining legal process which aims precisely at shielding the Commission from undue pressure or lobbying and to defend the Community interest. The Commission as always bases its proposals on the verified facts of the case. During the investigation, obviously all interested parties have a right to be heard and to present submissions.</p>
<p>Indeed, any competitive distortions by third countries should be dealt with appropriately. Nevertheless, Community law does require a careful analysis of whether measures are or are not in the overall Community interest.</p>
<p>The Commission received a number of comments after provisional measures were imposed, including from the users of frozen strawberries (jam and yoghurt producers). In its investigation of the Community interest the Commission has looked at whether the imposition of definitive measures would have a very strong negative impact on the jam and yoghurt producers.</p>
<p>The Commission has also noted that prices in 2006 have now risen by comparison to 2005.</p>
<p>The Polish freezing industry has been informed of the investigation and has been given the opportunity to comment. These comments are now being analysed.</p>

Besides, excluding producers of Basmas from the reduction of decoupled aid in 2010 would mean a differentiation of decoupling according to tobacco variety. This is however not feasible.

<p>(EN) It is correct that the draft Regulation outlines explicitly the principles on which the future organic production rules will have to be based. First of all organic production needs to be based on the appropriate design and management of biological processes and ecological systems, thereby restricting the use of external inputs. In some exceptional cases external inputs may be needed. In such cases the inputs should come from organic production, or be natural or naturally-derived, or, when the input is a fertiliser, have a low solubility. And finally, when none of this is available, there is a strictly limited possibility to use chemically synthesised inputs.</p>
<p>Regarding questions 1 and 2 on the fate of products and substances currently allowed in organic production, the Commission can inform the Honourable Member that they will not be prohibited, unless a later ulterior specific decision is taken to withdraw them from the list. As stated in Article 11(3) (c) of the draft Regulation, in the version discussed at the Agriculture Council of December 2006, fertilisers used “for purposes corresponding to those laid down in paragraph 1 of this Article” will continue to be allowed after the adoption of the draft Regulation. The Commission reads this as including the fertilisers currently listed in Annex II to the current organic farming regulation (Regulation 2092/91).</p>
<p>Regarding question 3 on 'exceptions': Yes, exceptions are possible. Article 16 of the draft Regulation sets out a mechanism on flexibility allowing for exceptional production rules in a number of well defined cases. However, any such exceptions would have to be compatible with the overall objectives of the Regulation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0025"></a>

<p>(EN) The central aims of the proposed reform of the Common Market Organisation (CMO) in fruit and vegetables are: to increase competitiveness, to protect producers from crises, to increase consumption, to improve environmental protection and to simplify rules.</p>
<p>As regards the World Trade Organisation (WTO) aspects of the proposal, the Commission proposes to end export refunds for fruit and vegetables, as the role played by refunds for this sector has considerably fallen over the year, and to reinforce the green box character of the aids while maintaining elements of the import system such as the safeguard clause and the entry prices system.</p>
<p>Regarding non-tariff measures, WTO country members are bound by Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) and Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) agreements which aim to ensure that technical, sanitary and phytosanitary measures are not used as disguised and unjustified barriers to trade. EU legislation provides that products imported into the EU are covered by the same or equivalent requirements. In the same way that they apply to Community products, these laws ensure imported products are safe, marketable and don't pose a plant health risk.</p>
<p>The fruit and vegetables CMO regulation covers only the requirements related to the marketing standards which include, inter alia, minimum quality requirements, classification rules and specific labelling requirements. These rules are identical to the international ones set by the United Nations' Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and they apply on all products within the EU as well as at import and export stages. Checks are carried out by the Member States and the proposal allows the Commission assisted by the Member States to modify the existing rules on controls when necessary. The Member States report to the Commission on the third countries' fruits and vegetables which are not in conformity with EU marketing standards. At present, there is no concern which would necessitate specific action.</p>
<p>On the export side, the EU system has established an internal plant health status which enables guarantees to be given for many but certainly not all plant diseases for plant products intended to be exported to third countries. However, third countries can and often do require guarantees for pests not covered by EU legislation. In such cases, Member States still have to fulfil third country import requirements.</p>
<p>Third country SPS measures may have a substantial effect on EU exports. The Commission analyses these SPS measures with Member States to see whether or not they are scientifically justified, and if not, takes appropriate action to address them.</p>
<p>In this sense, the principle of reciprocity can be applied in a strictly administrative way, but the EU cannot trade with health standards. The different plant health status in the exporting and the importing country means that the same phytosanitary measures often cannot be applied in both directions.</p>
<p>Precisely in this context, the Commission is currently developing a new initiative aimed at improving market access in the fruit and vegetable sector towards China. In a nutshell, it consists in identifying issues where Member States have offensive interests and to strengthen the negotiation position by speaking with one voice.</p>
<p>This initiative has been discussed with Member States; it will involve creating specific Working Groups with Commission and Member States' experts, which will meet in Brussels to provide the technical input to facilitate negotiations in Beijing.</p>
<p>The initiative could be extended to other third countries where the EU has an export interest.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0042"></a>

<p>In practice, insufficient use is being made of the restructuring aid introduced by the reform of the common market organisation in sugar, which is resulting in ever greater sugar surpluses in the EU.

This would be disastrous even for competitive sugar beet production in the EU.</p>
<p>I believe there are better of ways of reining in the amount of sugar produced in the EU. I therefore call on the Commission to make use of the full WTO export budget of 1.4 million tonnes of sugar.</p>
<p>There is also the possibility of temporary quota reduction, of which use was made in March 2006. I further ask the Commissioner for Agriculture to take urgent steps to stop the announced additional duty-free sugar imports.</p>

<p>(EN) As the Honourable Member is well aware, the Commission is not fully satisfied with the progress of restructuring of the European sugar industry. In the absence of restructuring, the market situation will deteriorate during the next three marketing years due to oversupply and downward pressure on prices.</p>
<p>This leads the Commission to draw two conclusions:</p>
<p>First of all, it is planned to operate a withdrawal in two steps: The first step consists of a so-called preventive withdrawal of production under the quota. In this context all sugar produced above 88% of the quota will be withdrawn in order to prevent a huge sugar surplus building up over the marketing year 2007/2008. This means that producers who produce up to 88 % of their quota will note be subject to withdrawal. If necessary, this preventive reduction of the production would be followed up by a classical withdrawal as foreseen in Article 19 in the basic Regulation 318/2006, i.e., if needed, a separate percentage of all sugar produced under quota would be withdrawn. In February 2007 the Commission will submit the draft of a Commission Regulation fixing the preventive withdrawal to the Management Committee. The further withdrawal would be defined later in October 2007, when the Commission has a clearer picture of the harvest and production of sugar.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Commission has to analyse the situation with regard to the restructuring fund. It has to make it more efficient and ensure that sufficient quota is renounced by the industry in the coming years. Its objective must be to avoid a simple linear cut at the end of the restructuring period to the detriment of the sustainability of the whole sector.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0045"></a>

<p>2013 is an important landmark in the future of the Common Agricultural Policy, which will have to take into account developments in agricultural practices and adapt to the needs of an enlarged Europe. However, questioning the future of the farming profession in this way is unacceptable.</p>

<p>(EN) The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is an integral part of the European agenda. The objectives of the CAP today were formulated mainly in the light of the Agenda 2000 and 2003 reforms and it is those objectives and European agriculture that the Commission is defending today.</p>
<p>The 2003 reform comprised a series of "rendez-vous clauses" constituting a "Health Check" designed to ensure that the CAP operates as it should and meets the expectations and needs of European society. Where appropriate, this "Health Check" could also provide an opportunity for simplification, but certainly not, and the Commission has already expressed its views on this, an in-depth reform which could call into question the objectives to which we all subscribed in 2003.</p>
<p>Since October 2002 and the Brussels agreement, the European Union has a clear Financial Framework until 2013, as confirmed by the agreement on the Financial Perspectives for 2007-2013, on which, as the Commission clearly indicated, there is no question of going back.</p>
<p>However, the financial framework post 2013 is another matter. The mid-term budgetary review scheduled for 2008/09 will lay the foundations for what lies in store for European agriculture after 2013 from a budgetary point of view. It is clear that the overall budget for the CAP will come under close scrutiny. Indeed, some Member States have already gone so far as to express publicly their desire to reduce CAP expenditure, particularly under the first pillar, for the period 2013. So we shall certainly have to be realistic in our expectations of the resources available to agriculture post 2013.</p>
<p>For many years, the gradual changes in the agricultural markets and the world context have prompted farmers to look for sources of income other than that deriving solely from the sale of raw materials produced on their farms. The steady development of on-farm processing plants is a good example of this: producers no longer derive their income solely from the trade of commodities but also from the value-added as a result of processing these commodities. This is only one example of the possible diversification of economic activities in rural areas, which also includes the development of non-farming activities on or off farms.</p>
<p>The diversification of economic activities in rural areas is a key element of our rural development policy, which has been reinforced in the Regulation on rural development for the period 2007/2013 adopted by the Council in June 2005. This policy will play a vital role in maintaining high-quality agriculture and the vitality of our rural areas.</p>
<p>The EU as a whole has therefore a duty to assess and anticipate changes so as to assist European farmers in their process of adjustment by placing at their disposal the necessary stable regulatory framework and the long-term policy orientation beyond 2013.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0060"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission presented its assessment of the link between the immigration policy, the social situation and demographic trends in the Policy Plan on Legal Migration<a href="#defann_51_1" name="refann_51_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> adopted on 21 December 2005. Section 1.2. of the Policy Plan summarised this link as follows:</p>
<p>With regard to economic immigration, the current situation and prospects of EU labour markets can be broadly described as a “need” scenario. Some Member States already experience substantial labour and skills shortages in certain sectors of the economy, which cannot be filled within the national labour markets. This phenomenon concerns the full range of qualifications - from unskilled workers to top academic professionals.</p>
<p>Eurostat projections indicate that in the EU “population growth until 2025 will be mainly due to net migration, since total deaths will outnumber total births from 2010. The effect of net migration will no longer outweigh the natural decrease after 2025”. This will have serious repercussions on the number of employed people in the EU25, as “ the share of population of working age […] in the total population is expected to decrease strongly, from 67.2% in 2004 to 56.7% in 2050, a fall of 52 million […]”. The decline in the total population is expected by 2025 and in the working age population by 2011. Some Member States (Germany, Hungary, Italy, Latvia) are already experiencing a decline in the working age population, while in others it will happen later (i.e. Ireland from 2035). These demographic trends will not affect all Member States to the same degree, but they are trends that should be addressed in a coordinated and effective way.</p>
<p>Immigration does not provide in itself a long-term solution to falling birth rates and an ageing population, but it is one of the available tools within a broader policy mix. In consideration of the low employment and high unemployment rates in many EU countries, priority must be given to actions toward attracting more EU citizens and legally resident migrants to employment, with the aim of fulfilling the objectives of the New Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs, in particular the employment guidelines. In the short to mid-term, labour immigration can – as part of Lisbon Strategy’s comprehensive package of measures aimed at increasing the competitiveness of the EU economy – positively contribute to tackling the effects of this demographic evolution, and will prove crucial to satisfying current and future labour market needs and thus ensure economic sustainability and growth.</p>
<p>On the basis of the above assessment, the Commission has recognised the need to develop an EU policy for the admission of labour immigrants and has put forward what it deems to be realistic proposals for a comprehensive common policy, covering admission rules for certain categories of immigrants needed by all Member States, information and integration initiatives aimed specifically at labour immigrants and their dependents, as well as measures intended to encourage brain circulation and foster professional and linguistic training in the countries of origin. The orientations contained in the policy plan will be implemented over the coming years (2006-2009), according to a precise roadmap.</p>
<p>As concerns in particular common rules for the admission of economic immigrants, the public consultation that followed the publication of the Green Paper on an EU approach to economic migration<a href="#defann_51_2" name="refann_51_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> highlighted, on the one hand, the lack of support from the Member States for a common framework covering the admission of all economic immigrants and, on the other hand, a common interest for attracting certain categories of third-country workers. The Policy Plan announced therefore the presentation of four specific directives on the conditions of admission of, respectively, highly skilled (foreseen for September 2007) and seasonal workers (2008), remunerated trainees (2008) and intra-corporate transferees (2009). In September 2007, the Commission intends also to present a framework directive addressing, among other things, the social-economic rights which should be recognised to all immigrants in employment irrespective of the Member State of residence.</p>
<p>In respect of these future proposals, it should be stressed that the Commission acknowledges that volumes of admission of third-country nationals in the EU for employment purposes remain to be decided at national level.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Over the past few years, there has been a significant decrease in the number of positive cases of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) detected in the EU, due to the strict implementation of the stringent risk reducing measures at EU-level.</p>
<p>In 2006, the Parliament and the Council adopted a revision of Regulation (EC) No 999/2001. According to these new rules, Member States which can demonstrate the improvement of their epidemiological situation and the effectiveness of the measures in place, may submit to the Commission a request for a revision of their annual monitoring programmes in their entirety, which may include a revision of the 30 month age limit for BSE testing.</p>
<p>Looking at the monitoring results, positive BSE cases were reported in cattle aged less than 36 months in Poland, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom and Germany. However, the young cases seem to be rare events in Members States as the overall prevalence in young animals shows a decreasing trend. All details concerning these cases can be found in annual reports on Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE) monitoring and testing that the Commission publishes each year and which are available on the Directorate General Health and Consumer Protection (DG SANCO) web-site<a href="#defann_56_1" name="refann_56_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Coming to the Honourable Member's last point linked to future amendments, let the Commission be very clear. Any adaptations made to the BSE measures in the future will not in any way affect the Commission's fundamental objectives of BSE eradication and the protection of the EU citizen. These have always been, and will continue to be, the first consideration. The main purposes of the current cattle testing programme are to follow the evolution of BSE prevalence and to monitor the effectiveness of the control measures in place such as the feed ban. However, the removal of specified risk material is the main measure to protect the consumer. An increase of the age limit for testing in the framework of a general review of the cattle testing programme will only be accepted for Member states where positive trends are observed and after an appropriate scientific assessment of the possible risks.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The EU should therefore encourage partner countries in Africa that have not already done so to ratify the Protocol.</p>
<p>In addition, the provisions of the Protocol – and those of the Action Plan – need to be properly implemented if the scourge of trafficking is to be seriously addressed.

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the difficulties which are currently being encountered by national authorities when they seek to execute fines involving vehicles registered in an EU Member State other than the one where the fine has been imposed.</p>
<p>In that regard, the Commission would like to draw the attention of the Honourable Member to the Council Framework Decision 2005/214/JHA<a href="#defann_59_1" name="refann_59_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> of 24 February 2005 on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to financial penalties. This instrument aims to facilitate the cross-border recognition and enforcement in the EU of decisions, within the scope of Article 1 of the Framework Decision, which imposes a financial penalty upon conviction for an offence. In this respect, "conduct which infringes road traffic regulations" is specifically mentioned in Article 5, § 1, as one of the categories of criminality where the executing authority is not allowed to verify the double criminality of the act. However, the obligation to execute a financial penalty which falls within the scope of the Framework Decision is not an absolute one, as it contains optional grounds of non-execution or non-recognition for the executing Member States.</p>
<p>According to Article 20, the Member States have to transpose the obligations of the Framework Decision in their internal legal order by 22 March 2007. Therefore, the Commission is not yet in a position to assess whether this instrument would be sufficient to eliminate the current obstacles to the enforcement of fines against foreign registered vehicles.</p>
<p>The Commission is also preparing a legal instrument to improve cross-border enforcement in the field of road safety. The necessary proposal will be made in summer 2007.

<p>(FR) Banning children from certain hotels in the EU could constitute a breach of the principle of non-discrimination on the grounds of age laid down in Article 21 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. This article states that ‘any discrimination based on any ground such as… age… shall be prohibited.’ The Member States must ensure full compliance with this principle in situations falling within the scope of Union law.</p>
<p>It should be noted that, in accordance with Article 52(1) of the Charter, subject to the principle of proportionality, limitations to this principle may only be made if they are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others.</p>
<p>Accordingly, it must be examined on a case by case basis, depending on the type of measure in question and the actual circumstances involved, whether such bans fall within the scope of Union law and whether they can be objectively justified in terms of the protection of the rights and freedoms of others and the principle of proportionality.</p>
<p>As regards the need for legislation in this area, on the basis of Article 13 of the EC Treaty, it should be noted that Directive 2000/78/EC prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of age does not apply to access to hotel services.</p>

<p>(EN) The EU processing industry is increasingly seeking to reduce production costs by importing tuna loins instead of whole frozen tuna.

<p>(EN) The Commission would like to inform the Honourable Member that following the concerns raised by different Institutions, it analysed the compliance of the Polish Law on the Principles of Development Policy ("the Law") adopted by the Polish Parliament on 6 December 2006 with Council Regulation 1083/2006 ("General Regulation") laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund<a href="#defann_65_1" name="refann_65_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, and with Article 249 of EC Treaty, which defines the legal character of regulations as the sources of Community law.</p>
<p>According to Article 249 of EC Treaty, regulations are characterised by their general and direct application in the legal orders of the Member States. Where there is a conflict between a provision of national law and provisions of a regulation, the regulation enjoys primacy. A Member State is not entitled to adopt provisions that could violate a regulation's provisions.</p>
<p>This analysis was transmitted to the Polish authorities by letter of 22 December 2006 from the Director General of Directorate General (DG) Regional Policy to Minister Gesicka responsible for Regional Development.</p>
<p>Article 28.3 in the Law gives the right to the Voivode to supervise project selection (chosen in open competition procedures), along with a veto right in the case of documented irregularities in the selection procedure. The Commission regarded the Voivodes' supervisory power and the veto right as not complying with the General Regulation (i.c. Articles 58, 59(1) (a) and 60). The veto right violates the rights granted to the managing authorities, the regions in the case of Regional Operational Programmes, by the General Regulation. The definition of documented irregularities also needs careful interpretation and explanation in comparison to irregularities as defined in Article 2(7) of the General Regulation.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that the Voivode in Article 28.3 of the Law is situated outside the system of authorities (managing, audit, and certifying authority) laid down by the General Regulation. Supervisory rights should in principle be executed by the certifying and audit authorities (Articles 61 and 62), as well as by the monitoring committee (Articles 63 to 65). In consequence, the managing authority is supervised by these three authorities, which are independent from one other.</p>
<p>The fact that the Polish Prime Minister has decided, according to his competences, to suspend the veto right of Voivodes and apply it only if his consent is given, does not take away the fact that the veto right is not compliant with EC legislation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In its 2006 progress report on Turkey, the Commission expressed grave doubts about the compensation commissions whose task it is to compensate families in south-eastern Turkey for war damage. Payments are made far too slowly, and the amounts paid are far too small. Many potential claimants are excluded by the law because of the numerous conditions which apply, and victims are also required to adduce huge amounts of evidence. This is confirmed by the human rights organisation Human Rights Watch, which has called on the Turkish Government to suspend the commissions until their operating methods have been thoroughly reviewed. On 14 December 2006, Human Rights Watch examined the existing method of compensation and informed the Turkish Government about it.</p>

<p>In its report, the Commission stated that progress has been made, in particular with regard to the compensation Law for losses resulting from terrorist acts. In 2006 the European Court of Human Rights ruled that this law allows for adequate redress for persons who were denied access to their possessions in their place of residence. However, the progress report also raised concerns with regard to the implementation of the law, in particular as regards the methods used by the compensation commissions and their large discretionary powers.</p>
<p>Since the Progress report, the Commission has been informed of further progress on this issue. On 13 December 2006 the Compensation Law was amended. The amendments extend for another year the deadline given for the conclusion of application. This is a welcome development given that a large number of applications are yet to be reviewed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, administrative measures were taken to improve the implementation of the law. A co-ordination body was set up by the Ministry of Interior, with a view to ensure more uniform decisions by the local compensation Commissions.</p>

The first interim report<a href="#defann_68_2" name="refann_68_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> on payment cards was published on 12 April 2006. A second interim report<a href="#defann_68_3" name="refann_68_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> was published on 17 July 2006, discussing inter alia competition in current accounts and related services. After taking into account the findings of the two interim reports and comments from all stakeholders, on 31 January 2007 the Commission published a final report and assessed in a Communication<a href="#defann_68_4" name="refann_68_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> the appropriate actions that could be taken on the basis of the report’s findings.</p>
<p>The second interim report includes an analysis on interest rate dispersion in the euro area, and the difference between interest rates on deposits and on loans, known as intermediation margins. The results of this study confirm that banks in Greece have the highest intermediation margins in the euro area. However, higher intermediation margins do not in themselves constitute sufficient evidence of collusion in the Greek banking market. A range of factors could explain this situation, including the business cycle and demand-side determinants (including possible risk-premiums), institutional factors such as regulation and taxation, the degree of market integration and competition within the banking sector concerned.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Despite this, only 15% of adult Europeans are satisfied with the standard of science teaching in schools.

<p>(EN) The Commission shares the concern of the Honourable Member at the relative decline in interest in following science and technology at schools and universities. Further, this is happening while Europe faces a growing demand for qualified human resources in science and technology and skills shortages in areas, such as information and communication technology (as highlighted in the recent report<a href="#defann_69_1" name="refann_69_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) Task Force). This is all the more critical given the importance of science and technology for European competitiveness. Basic knowledge of science and technology is necessary for citizens to participate effectively in the discussion of many of the key ethical and societal issues facing Europe, while e-skills are becoming a key to inclusion and to access to better jobs.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, increased recruitment and improved gender balance in science and technology studies is a priority objective in the Work Programme ‘Education &amp; Training 2010’ and constitutes one of five European education benchmarks agreed by the Council as part of this Work Programme. Maths, science and technology are also among the eight key competences for lifelong learning, set out in the recent Recommendation from the Parliament and the Council<a href="#defann_69_2" name="refann_69_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. In the benchmark, the Council has set two objectives: to bring about an increase of at least 15% in the number of graduates in these fields by 2010 and at the same time to redress the imbalance between women and men. Currently the first objective is already achieved ahead of schedule, while the second has seen only slow progress. Slovakia, Poland and Italy are the EU countries with the strongest growth in Maths, Science and Technology (MTS) graduates. Best performing countries are: Ireland, France, and the United Kingdom<a href="#defann_69_3" name="refann_69_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, while Portugal, Estonia, and Cyprus have the best gender balance. Nonetheless, it would appear that in certain subjects, such as physics, the number of graduates has declined in the period 2000-2003.</p>
<p>Recent research suggests that disenchantment with school science, even from very bright pupils, may be influenced by poor perceptions of the image of science, of scientists and of their career paths and of how science relates to their values and interests. Educational content and teaching quality can affect such perceptions. That is why the Commission is working to boost co-operation between industry and formal education and to help education stakeholders to improve the content and practice of learning and teaching methods in science and technology, from school to university. To this end, it has carried out a survey on ‘Science Teaching in Schools in Europe’<a href="#defann_69_4" name="refann_69_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> in the 30 countries of the Eurydice network and is promoting mutual learning and exchange of good practice. This aims to identify success factors for the improvement of policy-making and for the implementation of reforms in science learning and teaching. In addition, the Commission is preparing a Communication on a long term e-skills strategy. This will follow up on the recommendations of the ICT Task Force, in particular as regards the awareness and information of parents, teachers and pupils as to job opportunities arising from science, technology and ICT education.</p>
<p>The 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme of Research, Technological Development and Demonstration provides support for research on science education, on the links between formal and informal science education, and on the links between science education and careers. The team of experts to which the Honourable Member refers will look at the lessons to be drawn from existing European initiatives to promote more effective science teaching, starting from primary level.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Also, bearing in mind Eurostar's hasty decision, coupled with a failure to consult all concerned parties, would the Commission agree that there is a need for an investigation into a lack of transparency in Eurostar's decisions, as well as a failure to recognise its monopolistic position as the sole service operating a transport link for foot passengers between southern Kent and Brussels?</p>
<p>This decision will mean the residents of a catchment area of roughly 5 million people being reduced to travelling by plane, or facing an inconvenient journey by car to Ebbsfleet International station.

Their conclusions should lead to a reaction of the responsible German supervisory authority.</p>
<p>In the absence of binding Community legislation on the safety of nuclear installations, the Commission can only access information based on the good will of the national safety authorities and the operators.</p>
<p>In spite of the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities on 10 December 2002 in the C-29/99 case recognizing the competence of the European Atomic Energy Community to legislate in the field of the safety of nuclear installations, the lack of a qualified majority in the Council made it impossible to proceed with the so called "nuclear package"<a href="#defann_71_1" name="refann_71_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>However, the Commission adopted on 10 January 2007 a package of measures in the field of energy, comprising a Strategic Energy Review and a Commission communication on a Nuclear Illustrative Programme presented under Article 40 of the Euratom Treaty. This Nuclear Illustrative Programme describes the current status and potential future scenarios for the nuclear sector in the EU. It provides a basis for discussing the nuclear option in the context of the ongoing EU energy policy debate. This document shall facilitate a transparent and objective debate on the future role of nuclear energy in the EU energy mix for the Member States concerned.</p>
<p>The new Nuclear Illustrative Programme focuses on recognising common reference levels for implementation in the EU. It foresees the setting up of a High Level Group on Nuclear Safety and Security with the mandate of progressively developing common understanding and, possibly, common European rules on nuclear security and safety. This proposal will be assessed by the European Council in March 2007.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in the event of an eventual accident or incident, the concerned Member State is required to notify the Commission through the Community mechanism for early exchange of radiological information (ECURIE).

<p>(EN) The Commission is actively pursuing a policy for the promotion of the use of biofuels as an alternative to petrol and diesel in the transport sector. Directive 2003/30/EC<a href="#defann_72_1" name="refann_72_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on the promotion of the use of biofuels or other renewable fuels for transport sets reference values for a minimum proportion of biofuels that Member States shall place on their markets. Those reference values are 2% for 2005 and 5.75% for 2010.</p>
<p>The Commission has just adopted a Renewable Energy Road Map<a href="#defann_72_2" name="refann_72_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> on 10 January 2007, which proposes a binding target for renewable energy in the European energy mix of 20% by 2020, and a minimum target for biofuels of 10% by 2020.</p>
<p>On 31 January 2007, the Commission adopted a proposal to revise Directive 98/70/EC<a href="#defann_72_3" name="refann_72_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, which among others places an obligation on suppliers of road transport fuels to report and progressively reduce the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from the fuels that they supply.</p>
<p>This revised Directive will play an important role in encouraging the development and market introduction of greenhouse gas saving fuels, such as biofuels. The biofuels policy is also supported by the Common Agricultural Policy, especially following its reform in 2003. While farmers cannot cultivate food crops on set-aside land, they can use this land for non-food crops including biofuels; a €45-per-hectare subsidy for energy crops is also available.</p>
<p>In addition, there is targeted support for research and development, especially in second generation biofuels, which have an even better environmental performance than the currently available biofuels. This is provided, among others, through the 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme for Research and Development<a href="#defann_72_4" name="refann_72_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> and the Intelligent Energy for Europe Programme<a href="#defann_72_5" name="refann_72_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The reconstruction of Iraq has thus far cost some 35 billion dollars, finance which has come both from the USA and from Iraqi oil money. It has been reported in the media that between 2003 and 2004, more than 80% of the reconstruction contracts went to American companies. These are also companies with close links to the Bush Administration. The remaining contracts have been awarded to companies from countries allied to the USA in the invasion of Iraq. Only a very small proportion of the contracts have been awarded to Iraqi companies. This situation means that, at the present time, foreign companies have very strong influence over the reconstruction of Iraq.</p>
<p>Does the Commission have information concerning how contracts for the reconstruction of Iraq have been allocated since 2004, which European companies are currently operating in Iraq and whether there are mechanisms in place to monitor and control those European companies which have operations in Iraq at the present time?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The issues raised are covered by the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications in two respects. First, in relation to the rights of subscribers, Article 20 of Directive 2002/22/EC (Universal Service Directive) provides that Member States must ensure that contracts signed by subscribers with service providers of public telephone access/connection specify, among others, the service quality level offered as well as any compensation and the refund arrangements which apply if those service quality levels are not met. Moreover, Article 22 of the Universal Service Directive provides for the possibility that national regulatory authorities request service providers to publish information on the quality of their services and specify the quality of service parameters that should be measured.</p>
<p>Second, in relation to the development of infrastructure, Article 11 and Article 12 of Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive) provide respectively that Member States must ensure that when considering applications for the granting of rights to install facilities, the relevant authority acts on the basis of transparent and publicly available procedures, applied without discrimination and without delay and that, where an undertaking is granted those rights to install facilities, national regulatory authorities must encourage the sharing of such facilities.</p>
<p>Although the Commission acknowledges the Honourable Member's concern regarding quality of mobile telephony infrastructure especially in tourist regions, there is no requirement for specific quality levels in the EU regulatory framework for communications services. However, Member States may request the publication of information on quality service as stated above.</p>

<p>(EN) According to the EC Treaty, the Community has to promote a high level of social protection. However, Member States have the main responsibility for social protection systems. The role of the Community is to support and organise policy exchange. The EC Treaty also provides for the free movement of workers. On that basis, the Community intervenes to co-ordinate the social security systems of Member States. In the field of statutory pension schemes, EC rules ensure that mobile workers can aggregate periods of work in different Member States. The Commission has also recently made a proposal for a Directive on portability of supplementary pension rights<a href="#defann_75_1" name="refann_75_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which, if adopted, will help mobile workers to build up supplementary pension rights.</p>
<p>The Commission has repeatedly highlighted the importance of building up additional pension rights for the sustainability of European pension systems as a result of the increase of life expectancy in Europe. The 2006 Commission's Working Paper on Adequate and Sustainable Pensions<a href="#defann_75_2" name="refann_75_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> analyses the link between demography change and pensions. It underlines that building up additional pension rights can be done first through the participation in statutory schemes through insured employment and secondly through increasing pension savings – either individually or as part of occupational pension schemes. Furthermore, the 2007 draft Joint Report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion<a href="#defann_75_3" name="refann_75_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, which is to be adopted by the Council in February 2007, indicates that ageing will result in pension adequacy increasingly depending on more people working and on giving people the possibility of working longer. The report also stresses the need for supplementary pension savings and for the extension of the coverage of supplementary pension schemes.</p>
<p>As part of the open Method of Coordination, the Commission will continue to encourage Member States to develop measures to encourage the accrual of pension rights in statutory schemes and increased pension savings, and to reinforce the overall sustainability of pension systems.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission has taken over the Chairmanship of the Kimberley Process for one year, as of 1 January 2007, and has made its plans for fighting against conflict diamonds known through an Action Programme for the Kimberley Process in 2007.</p>
<p>The Commission aims at ensuring ‘continuity through consolidation’, by strengthening core elements of the Kimberley Process such as monitoring or transparency, and also at improving the Kimberley Process’ capacity to mobilise international efforts and react swiftly and effectively to emerging crises and prevent the illegal trade of conflict diamonds, for ex. in the case of Côte d’Ivoire.</p>
<p>The Commission will in particular support transparency and accuracy of statistics, notably by ensuring, for the first time in 2007, the publication of statistical data, and by supporting efforts to enhance analytical expertise of statistics.</p>
<p>The Kimberley Process requires Participants to put in place a system of ‘internal controls’ designed to eliminate the presence of conflict diamonds from their diamond trade. The Commission will, as Kimberley Process Chair, and in line with the decision of the Gaborone Plenary in November 2006, step up efforts to strengthen internal controls. The Commission will also support further consideration of government oversight and industry (self-regulation) arrangements, with a view to ensuring that national implementation of Kimberley Process rules offer sufficient guarantees against illegal trade in conflict diamonds. The complementary relation between Kimberley Process requirements for rough diamonds and the industry’s system of warranties, applicable down to the retail level, will be addressed as part of this exercise.</p>
<p>Moreover raw diamonds together with other raw materials will be discussed at the 2007 G8 Summit in Heiligendamm (Germany), also in the context of economic and social development in Africa. Main focus is the control and certification of resources in countries, where they may finance military conflicts. The EU is actively involved in the preparations of this Summit and will defend solutions that guarantee sustainable trade of rough diamonds.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0040"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission notes that a 2006 Review of the Kimberley Process conducted by 71 governments, industry and Non-Governmental Organisations (ONGs) in liaison with the United Nations concluded that it has been remarkably successful in curbing the potential trade in conflict diamonds to, at most, between 0.1 and 0.2% of total trade.</p>
<p>The main objectives of the EC Chairmanship of the Kimberley Process in 2007 are to ensure ‘continuity through consolidation’ by strengthening core elements of the Kimberley Process such as monitoring and transparency, and also to improve the Kimberley Process’ capacity to mobilise international efforts and react swiftly and effectively to emerging crises and thus prevent illegal trade of conflict diamonds.</p>
<p>The Kimberley Process requires Participants to put in place a system of ‘internal controls’ designed at ‘tracking’ rough diamonds from mine to export. In addition, the Kimberley Process is stepping up efforts by researching the scientific feasibility for ensuring the ‘traceability’ of diamonds based on their chemical properties, as a possible complementary safeguard to internal controls. Moreover, industry has put in place a complementary system of warranties down to the retail sector.</p>
<p>The Commission is overseeing implementation arrangements in the European Union, through Regulation (EC) 2368/2002, which opens the possibility of industry self-regulation through membership of industry associations and codes of conducts as well as spot checks and independent audits. Other - non-EU - countries have their own national implementation arrangements.</p>
<p>The Commission will, as Kimberley Process Chair, step up efforts to strengthen internal controls and support further consideration of government oversight and industry (self)-regulation arrangements, with a view to ensuring that national implementation of Kimberley Process rules offer sufficient guarantees against illegal trade in conflict diamonds.</p>
<p>The Commission notes that the Kimberley Process is a unique arrangement financed by commitments and contributions of Participants, and that this flexible system of financing has ensured the Kimberley Process’ successful operation to date. The Commission has identified as a priority the further mobilisation of resources from Participants, industry and NGOs to ensure the financing of future KP-related actions.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Kimberley Process has stepped up efforts to support the mobilisation of diamond sector-related technical assistance to complement the Kimberley Process as a regulatory instrument.</p>
<p>The EC rough diamond trade statistics are subject to continual verification and improvement by a process of dialogue with our trading partners. The Kimberley Process undertakes an annual analysis of production and trade data provided by Participants to identify any possible anomalies for further investigations. The Commission will further support transparency and accuracy of statistics by ensuring, for the first time in 2007, the publication of statistical data.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0037"></a>

<p>(EN) The recognition of academic qualifications is essential for the free movement of citizens in Europe.</p>
<p>Entry to Irish universities and admission to particular university courses is determined by students' performance in school leaving examinations, and in this case the Irish Leaving Certificate examination. For this purpose, students must first satisfy certain minimum entry requirements, and then, in order to gain admission to a particular course of studies, attain a specified number of points, calculated on the basis of their Leaving Certificate results. The points' requirement varies from course to course: courses where there is high demand require higher points.</p>
<p>In the case of examinations other than the Leaving Certificate, such as the European Baccalaureate, universities determine the manner in which they correspond to the Leaving Certificate and the basis for the calculation of points for admission to particular courses. A number of parents have stated their concern that the manner in which Irish universities treat applications for admission from students with the European Baccalaureate is unfair. The main problem seems to relate to admissions to courses in high demand.</p>
<p>The Commission understands that the Irish authorities have not yet formed an opinion regarding the arguments set out by the parents' groups but they have taken a number of steps to bring the concerns articulated by parents and others to the attention of the universities. As a result of these actions, some changes were made by two of the universities to their admission requirements. More recently, at the request of the Department of Education and Science, the Irish Universities Association (a representative body of the seven Irish universities) agreed to conduct a thorough review of the matter. The Department arranged for all necessary statistical data and other information regarding the European Baccalaureate to be supplied to the Association. The results of the review are awaited.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Board of Governors of the European Schools decided in the course of its January 2007 meeting to launch a study to carry out an external evaluation of the European Baccalaureate. The results are expected in March 2008.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue to follow this matter carefully.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0047"></a>

<p>(EN) On 20 December 2006 the Commission concluded that restructuring aid to Fabryka Samochodów Osobowych S.A. ("FSO") was compatible with EC Treaty State aid rules, provided that certain conditions were respected<a href="#defann_82_1" name="refann_82_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>This decision was reached in line with the Community guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty<a href="#defann_82_2" name="refann_82_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, according to which aid can only be approved if three conditions are fulfilled:</p>
<p>There must be a credible restructuring plan allowing the firm to return to long term viability. Only under that condition will the aid contribute to maintaining jobs on a sustainable basis in the EU;</p>
<p>The aid must be limited to the minimum necessary; and</p>
<p>Measures must be taken to limit the damage to competitors and workers located in other Member States.</p>
<p>In the present case, the Commission found that the aid was limited to the minimum necessary, and that the restructuring plan of FSO was sufficient to restore the firm's long term viability. However, the Commission also considered that, without appropriate safeguards, the aid could have led to undue distortion of competition. The car manufacturing sector has excess capacity. The aid to FSO will avoid its exit from the market but hence risked shifting the difficulties and the burden of adjustment to other firms and workers in other Member States. In this context, a condition of the aid being approved is that FSO must limit its annual car production to 150 000 units until February 2011.</p>
<p>The production cap was set at a level which, on the basis of the information communicated by the Polish authorities, will allow FSO to make sufficient profits in order to regain viability in the long run. It thus strikes a balance between the interest of Poland to safeguard the jobs at FSO and the broader interest of the EU to preserve a level playing field for all competitors in this highly competitive market.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As regards sea borders, 6 – 8 joint operations are envisaged during the year, combined in five long-term joint operations as phases, carried out in different geographical areas on the basis of risk analysis. A combined land-sea border operation will likewise be carried out.</p>
<p>The Agency furthermore intends to launch a European Patrol Network by May 2007 encompassing the Member States along the southern maritime border, as well as carrying out 2 – 3 pilot projects. A total of €8 165 000, 00 is allocated for these activities in the FRONTEX Agency's budget.</p>
<p>For land borders, the Agency intends to carry out 8 – 10 joint operations during the year in a geograhical area identified by risk analysis on routes of illegal migration. In addition 3 – 4 pilot projects will be launched. A total of €2 200 000, 00 is allocated for these activities in the FRONTEX Agency's budget.</p>

This dataset is based on a survey of telecom operators in 25 countries plus Norway and Iceland. Results indicate that Dygital Subscriber Line (DSL), the most deployed broadband technology in Europe, is available to 84% of the population, with wide fragmentation across Member States. Coverage in rural areas is however lower, and reaches on average 66% of the population. The difference between national and rural coverage is what we call the "broadband gap".</p>
<p>These data should not be confused with those on broadband subscriptions, which are collected three times a year. In July 2006, 15% of the EU25 population subscribed to broadband, but only 7% in rural areas.</p>
<p>The Communication "Bridging the broadband Gap<a href="#defann_84_1" name="refann_84_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>" published in March 2006 proposes the use of various instruments:</p>
<p>Regulation: The effective implementation of the regulatory framework for electronic communications increases competition and stimulates broadband roll-out through market forces.</p>
<p>Funding: The use of public funding is encouraged in disadvantaged and rural areas in full respect of state aid rules. The start of the next programming period for Cohesion and Rural Development policies is a great opportunity for regions and rural areas to invest in broadband and stimulate growth and jobs.</p>
<p>On-Line public Services: Measures aimed at increasing the availability and access of on-line public services (eGovernment, eHealth, education) prevent depopulation and delocation of businesses from these areas and improve the quality of life.</p>
<p>Exchange of best practices: The Commission<a href="#defann_84_2" name="refann_84_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> is organising a conference on "Bridging the Broadband Gap" on 14<span class="sup">th</span>-15th of May 2007<a href="#defann_84_3" name="refann_84_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. The aim of the conference is to promote exchange of best practices as well as to increase the synergy among different policy domains.</p>
<p>Regular data collection on broadband availability illustrates gaps between countries and identifies laggards. The Communication "Bridging the broadband gap" and its follow-up encourage all Member States to revise their national broadband strategies by introducing clear targets and concrete actions. In parallel the Commission has also launched the ambitious initiative on "Regions of economic change" in the framework of the Structural Funds programming, which will set up regional and urban networks, including both convergence and competitiveness regions, on a number of themes such as Information and Communication Technologies (ICT).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Marine accidents are becoming commonplace. The collision of the high-speed passenger vessel the 'Segesta Jet' with a cargo ship outside the port of Messina, which claimed the lives of four passengers, the fact that the container ship the 'Napoli' was forced through cracking to run aground off the coast of Devon in the UK, and other marine accidents, attest to the serious structural defects, the makeshift maintenance and repairs to damage to ships, for which shipowners bear an enormous responsibility as they seek to maximise their profits. Moreover, the intensification of seafarers' work, the pressure exerted by shipowners, with the collusion of the public port authorities, to work 12-16 hour days with no leave for 4-12 months, in violation of seafarers' international labour conventions, is yet another cause giving rise to marine accidents. There is thus flagrant violation of international rules on safety of human life at sea and environmental protection in order to boost the profits of shipowners and corporate concerns operating in the maritime transport sector.</p>

<p>(FR) The Commission’s answer that follows below in no way prejudges the findings of the ongoing inquests into the two accidents mentioned by the honourable Member.</p>
<p>The Commission attaches the highest importance to enhancing the quality of merchant shipping, an objective that goes hand in hand with its policy on competitiveness in maritime transport.</p>
<p>The Commission is directly involved in, on the one hand, improving the content of the rules on vessel safety and on the working conditions of seafarers, and, on the other hand, following up the implementation of those rules. Its action is taking place in both the international context, via the International Maritime Organisation and International Labour Organisation conventions, and the Community context. The third package of maritime safety measures, on which Parliament will have its say in April 2007, should be mentioned.</p>
<p>These rules are aimed at all the links in the maritime transport chain, not only shipowners but others too, including shippers, classification societies, insurers, the state issuing the flag and the state hosting the vessels in its ports.</p>
<p>Following accidents such as those mentioned by the honourable Member, the shipowners may be held responsible. The rules applicable must help prevent damage and guarantee compensation. In this context, on the Commission’s initiative, the Community has a system of sanctions at its disposal, which in the case of maritime pollution can be criminal sanctions. At the same time, the Commission proposed to introduce, via the aforementioned third package, a Community-level system of responsibility guaranteeing compensation for the victims.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0072"></a>

<p>(EN) The EU-Russia visa facilitation agreement, which was signed on 25 May 2006, does not provide for the waiving of the visa fee for all Russian citizens residing in Kaliningrad and travelling to EU neighbouring countries. Therefore, as from its entry into force, neighbouring Member States will have to charge €35 for visas issued to Russian citizens, except for those for whom the visa fee is waived or reduced in accordance with the EC-Russia visa facilitation agreement or other Community rules. Indeed, a common regime, applicable by all Schengen Member States, on visa fees and exemptions is needed in order to avoid visa shopping.</p>
<p>In this respect, it has to be noted that the EU-Russia visa facilitation agreement provides for the waiving of the visa fee for broad categories of Russian citizens who have legitimate reasons for travelling frequently, such as close relatives, students, disabled persons, persons travelling on humanitarian grounds or persons travelling to participate in sport, cultural and artistic activities. Moreover, the Schengen acquis provides for the possibility for Member States to waive or reduce the visa fee in individual cases, when this measure serves the promotion of cultural interests, foreign policy, development policy or other areas of vital public interest or for humanitarian reasons.</p>
<p>Additionally, since 1 January 2007, the visa fee is fully waived for children under six years, students and accompanying teachers travelling for educational purposes and researchers fulfilling certain conditions.</p>
<p>There are also other flexibilities in the EC-Russia visa facilitation agreement that will temper the application of the €35 visa fee, in particular the more frequent issuance of multiple entry visas, valid for one year and even for a maximum of five years in justified cases.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Regulation laying down rules on local border traffic allows Member States to conclude bilateral agreements providing the issuance of a “border traffic permit” free of charge for travel within the “border area”, which can extend up to 50 kilometres from the border.</p>
<p>In the view of the Commission, the combination of this wide range of measures will contribute to maintain the status quo for most Russian citizens residing in Kaliningrad regarding people-to-people contacts with the citizens of the neighbouring Member States, taking into account that once Lithuania and Poland are fully part of Schengen, the visas issued by them shall be valid for travelling in the whole Schengen area. However, the Commission is willing to examine any further possibilities, which are in line with the Community rules in this field.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0074"></a>

<p>(FR) The honourable Member referred to a letter from a Polish national condemning a situation of which he was the victim. The complainant indicated that he had been working in France between December 2003 and June 2005 for an uninterrupted period of 18 months on the basis of three consecutive work experience contracts. When the last contract expired, he obtained another job in a French company. In his letter, the Polish national maintains that he is entitled to free access to the French labour market pursuant to Point 2.2 of Annex XII to the Treaty of Accession, which states that ‘Polish nationals legally working in a present Member State at the date of accession and admitted to the labour market of that Member State for an uninterrupted period of 12 months or longer will enjoy access to the labour market of that Member State’.</p>
<p>The French authorities refused him access to the labour market, however, and did not issue him with a work permit. The situation of this Polish national was passed on to SOLVIT<a href="#defann_87_1" name="refann_87_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, which was unable to resolve the case. The Polish national therefore approached the Commission in December 2005.</p>
<p>The Commission carried out a thorough analysis of the case. On the basis of information provided in December 2005, the Commission held that the condition referred to in Point 2 of Annex XII to the Accession Treaty had been met. The Commission gave notice of this position in the letter to which the honourable Member refers. The Polish national then forwarded supplementary information on the basis of which the Commission discovered that three work experience contracts had been concluded within the framework of a bilateral agreement between France and Poland. It would appear that, under the terms of that agreement, prior to beginning his work experience in France, the complainant was required to agree not to take a job other than that provided for under the conditions of his entry into France. In breach of that undertaking, he looked for another job in France on the basis of Annex XII of the Accession Treaty, In the light of this new information, the Commission concluded that the Polish national in question could not be deemed to have been admitted to the French labour market for an uninterrupted period of 12 months or longer pursuant to Annex XII to the Accession Treaty.</p>
<p>Under the discretionary powers invested in the Commission by the Treaty<a href="#defann_87_2" name="refann_87_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, the Commission decided that it had no obligation to follow up the case because it had not been demonstrated that there had been a general and ongoing administrative practice that was in breach of Community law.</p>
<p>The Commission nevertheless forwarded useful information to the Polish national in its last letter in case he wished to initiate proceedings at national level.</p>
<p>As regards the second phase of the transitional periods, France has decided to maintain national measures or those arising from bilateral agreements until the end of the five-year period after accession, that is to say, until the end of April 2009. This means in practice that the application of Community law as regards access to the French labour market for Polish nationals will be delayed by three extra years and that France has the right to apply national law when it comes to access to the labour market. In this context, France has also indicated that it plans to liberalise access to the labour market in some sectors for which work permit procedures would be simplified. According to the Accession Treaty, France must, however, comply with the standstill clause and principle of Community preference.</p>
<p>The Commission remains prepared to examine any further information that the honourable Member may have so as to establish whether there has been a violation of Community law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
