<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamantopoulou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, today, the Commission has adopted a comprehensive analysis of the Member States' strategies for ensuring adequate and sustainable pensions.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is the fruit of a new form of cooperation between the Member States, given the consensus that pension systems should remain a responsibility of the Member States, and so the role of the European Union will be limited to supporting the Member States in their reform efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">This is, of course, without prejudice to the Community policies in a number of areas which have an impact on national policy-makers, including internal market policy and the sustainability of public finances, which is examined in the framework of the broad economic policy guidelines. Moreover, the financial sustainability of pensions depends very much on the success of the European employment strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased that the European Parliament supports this approach, even though we have yet to find a satisfactory way of involving Parliament more in the open method of coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement on applying the open method of coordination to the issue of pensions was reached at the Laeken European Council one year ago. On that occasion, 11 common objectives were set covering the adequacy of pensions, their financial sustainability and the modernisation of pension systems to adapt them to changes on the labour market and in society, notably to ensure that they cater well for the needs of women.</p>
<p class="contents">An important concept of the whole report is that there are three different dimensions: sustainability, modernisation and adequacy of pensions. It is not just the one dimension that we had until now in our European policies, which was within the framework of public finances.</p>
<p class="contents">It was also agreed that the Member States would submit national strategy reports in which they explain how they achieve those common objectives. The national reports were submitted in September, and the document that has been adopted by the Commission today is an analysis of the national strategies, objective by objective.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's aim was not to establish a ranking of Member States or to lecture them. The open method of coordination on pensions is not a beauty contest. Member States have to decide for themselves what type of pension systems they want. But our report tried to highlight certain and concrete strengths and weaknesses of national systems and policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The common objectives can be achieved through a wide range of pension systems. Member States have either flat-rate public pension schemes covering all residents, or earnings-related schemes where benefits are based on employment. They rely to varying degrees on private-funded provision to complement these public schemes. The social partners play a more or less important role in national pension systems.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that, in spite of this diversity of systems, we could agree on a set of common objectives proves that it makes sense to speak of a European social model. The diversity of pension systems does not prevent us from having shared goals in this important policy area.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, the national strategy reports described the current state of play rather than presenting new policy initiatives. The Member States involved not just different government departments in their preparation, but also social partners and other interested parties and, in some cases, there has been approval by the national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">One important conclusion that we can draw from this exercise is that Member States can cope with ageing societies and avoid a financial or social disaster in their pension systems.</p>
<p class="contents">The report tries to be neither unduly alarmist, nor too complacent about the situation of pension systems. Indeed, there are a lot of positive developments highlighted in the report, but there are also considerable weaknesses. In many countries, the sound financing of future pension benefits has not been secured. One very effective way of achieving this would be to raise the effective retirement age. In fact, achieving the Barcelona target of raising the labour market withdrawal age by five years would almost solve our financing problems as identified in the public pension expenditure projections by the Economic Policy Committee. However, we will only get there if Member States make much more determined efforts not only to encourage older people to stay longer in the labour market but also to enable them to do so. The European Parliament rightly insisted on the importance of health and safety in this regard and on the need to adapt the working environment to the special needs of older workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Many Member States also have to do more to improve access to occupational pension schemes, particularly for atypical workers, among whom women tend to be over-represented. The portability of occupational pension rights also requires further improvements, and we will be discussing with the social partners at European level how this could be promoted.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament insisted particularly on the situation of older women. Women tend to live longer than men; so a majority of pensioners are women: some 60% of people over 65 and nearly two thirds of people over 75. The gender dimension therefore receives much attention in this report. We can expect individual pension rights for women to increase, thanks to increased labour force participation and smaller pay gaps between men and women. However, career breaks still tend to be taken more often by women than by men. So it will remain important to award pension rights for child-care periods and to maintain derived rights, without which many older women would be exposed to the risk of poverty. However, our priority should be to increase individual pension rights by offering better employment opportunities to women.</p>
<p class="contents">What is going to happen next with this report? The European Council requested a joint report by the Commission and the Council. So the next step will be to examine the Commission's text in the Council so as to finalise a report in time for the European Council meeting in March.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no commitment to a second round of national strategy reports and their assessment at European level. However, we are committed to reviewing the common objectives and working methods before 2005 as a basis for deciding on the future of this cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">We intend to cooperate with the applicant countries and to carry out the same exercise for their systems. We are also working on common indicators which would allow us to measure the achievements of Member States. However, agreement on common indicators is quite a difficult issue and could not be arrived at in time for this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are two objective factors here. The first is the problem of the ageing population and the second is the rise in the entitlement age. Bearing both these in mind, the Member States have introduced specific policies in which raising the age limit on the labour market appears to be the basic option – in fact most countries now consider it prerequisite – alongside policies to help older people stay in the labour market. I think that we can avoid smaller pensions if we keep to the philosophy I referred to earlier. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My question really is: what is the Commission, rather than Member States, doing, and in particular what are the EU institutions doing, not just to allow people to stay longer but also to employ older people in the first place? My specific question is: is it true that there are still some EU institutions that have age barriers so that if you are over a certain age, you cannot be employed by them?

<p class="contents">As far as the report’s orientation is concerned, I made it quite clear that pension reform policies are national policies. Of course there are European dimensions to these national policies and a country cannot exercise a pension reform policy without taking account of the stability pact, the laws of the internal market or the employment strategy.

As I pointed out in my introduction, the problem is not just one of raising the retirement age; we also need flanking policies to help older people stay in or, in many cases, enter the labour market, which is why I referred to both the stability pact and the employment strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">May I remind you that one of the basic objectives of the employment strategy is to integrate older people. We can achieve this through specific training proposals and measures and special incentives. May I also remind you that Commissioner Monti and I recently decided that support for older people during the first stage of their integration into the labour market does not qualify as state aid. This therefore is our approach. We cannot raise the age limit unless we introduce policies at the same time to support the integration of older people.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to Mr Fatuzzo’s question about the internal redistribution of pensions, we must remember that this is a purely national model and that it is in fact up to each government to decide what type of pension it is going to grant and where, depending on the model and principles it has decided on. However, to come back to one of the basic lines of approach of the strategy, the adequacy of pensions, again specific action is being taken to define present policies and future indicators for sections of the population which are at risk of exclusion or have particular problems, such as single-parent families, which I mentioned, or the question of women. The Member States must therefore say what they have done under each of these lines of approach in the reports they submit. So if there are specific sectors which guarantee adequacy, each Member State must highlight and state what measures it has taken in its reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to Mr Pronk’s question on the age of 60 or 65, there is no directive which sets the retirement age in the Member States. Each Member State sets it on the basis of its economic analysis and capabilities. At present, all the Member States have a lower limit of 65. France is an exception, but sets other requirements, and the Scandinavian countries are trying out a new approach and tending to abolish the age limit, which might go up to 67 or down to 60, with pensions being adjusted in line with the retirement age.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as far as the question of the management of financial organisations and funds is concerned, I am not sure if I fully understood the question, but what I would say is that public pension funds are obviously subject to the general financial stability framework of each country, as far as private pension funds are concerned. I would remind you that a recent Commission directive introduced important safety valves for the safe management of these funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today the Commission has adopted a financial reform package that marks a crucial stage in this Commission’s reform efforts. Firstly, the legislative framework for the new Financial Regulation is completed; the Commission has adopted the Financial Regulation's implementing regulation, along with procedural rules for the collection of receivables. It has taken a great effort by all concerned, the European Parliament in particular, to reach the goal of the European Union having a new, modern budgetary law by 1 January 2003. This new budgetary law will provide better protection for the Community’s financial interests – I might mention, for example, the securities to be lodged by the recipients of advance payments, the obligation on contractors to provide auditor’s certificates or the Commission’s ability to bar contractors from tendering procedures if irregularities have been found in the past. This new budgetary law will also make budget execution more transparent and more coherent.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission has made an overall assessment of the preparedness of its services for the implementation of this new budgetary law. This shows that considerable progress has been made in bringing the old <span class="italic">ex ante</span> controls into the services’ internal control procedures. Any remaining problems will receive continued attention and the concerted efforts of all concerned. Horizontal services will provide targeted support.</p>
<p class="contents">This creates the conditions for ending central financial control at the end of this financial year and also for winding up the remaining parts of the Directorate-General for Financial Control by early 2003. Most of the staff released in that way will be made available to the services to complete the human resources for financial reform that they have built up in the last three years. The sections of the Commission managing funds will then be fully responsible for budget implementation including the necessary control measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission has today also adopted the communication on the modernisation of the Communities’ accounting system. This communication is divided into three parts. First, reform of the bookkeeping rules; second, adaptation of the supporting information and technology system; and third, the architecture of project management. The Commission had promised the European Parliament and the Court of Auditors to present these measures and the timetable by the end of this year. In so doing, the Commission is taking another important step in the long-term strategy for the modernisation of its accounting system that was begun in the year 2000. In 2000, the Commission presented a study that led to the Commission proposing that the Financial Regulation should incorporate new bookkeeping rules using accrual accounting. This communication now sets out step by step the action that must be taken to make the modern system available by 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">In future, bookkeeping will be done by the double entry system. The budget account will use traditional cash accounting for budget revenue and expenditure, which is what the budgetary authority requires for checking the execution and implementation of the Budget; this means that the actual expenditures and actual receipts will be compared with the estimated amounts decided in the budget. The accrual accounting, however, will also have to incorporate the capital account for the European Budget’s cash flow statement, and new standards will be introduced for this part of the budget account corresponding to the international standards that were recently adopted; I shall come back to that in a moment.</p>
<p class="contents">For the purpose of introducing the new standards required by the Financial Regulation from 2005 the Commission’s chief accountant will be working out the specific details of how these international standards are to be implemented for the various measures financed out of the European Union’s budget. A new Accounting Standards Committee will be created for the purpose. Various experts from the services as well as from outside will be represented on this committee. Another important point is that the new system will apply not only to the Commission’s bookkeeping and accounting, but also to all European institutions, that means also to Parliament and to the budgets of the Council, the Court of Auditors and the agencies. The standards in question are in fact very new. This international body adopted its first standard for the public sector in 2000, the last standard in October 2002. They are therefore quite new rules and we will be using them as a benchmark for our accounting system. When this project is introduced, the European budget will be in the vanguard of accountancy rules.</p>
<p class="contents">For the new standards to be introduced, the technical support provided by the underlying computer system, that is the information technology, will also have to be modernised. The system currently used for accounting is Sincom 2. It was introduced in 1997 and extended to all fund-managing departments in 1999. The SAP system – which all the experts call A3 for short – is crucial for the Commission’s bookkeeping, and the closure of the books and presentation of the annual statement depend entirely on this system. At the same time, the SI II system was developed for departments managing resources and data on all relevant measures, that is, all data relevant for accounting have to be input into it. Experience shows, however, that the future system must be a fully integrated system for bookkeeping purposes. So far as complete integration allows, however, account should also be taken of the services’ different requirements and respective management tasks, which are also subject to different requirements for the various sections of the European budget.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three options for modernising the IT system in question, namely continuing with the present system as before, introducing a completely new system or developing an integrated system from what is already in place. As you will have inferred from what I have said, the Commission rejects the first option. A feasibility study will be made of the second and third options, which will be ready in the first half of 2003. A decision will then be taken on the steps that can be taken to develop an integrated system.</p>
<p class="contents">How will this project be organised, given that it is a large-scale project covering the Commission and all the European Institutions? The project organisation puts the chief accountant at the centre of the project. The Commission has today decided to appoint Mr Brian Gray, the new deputy director-general of the Directorate-General for the Budget, as chief accountant to see through this ambitious reform. This means the Commission has decided to give this project the highest grade, A1, in order to make clear that the necessary authority is also necessary in the grade if we are to take all the institutions and all the services here with us. There will be a Project Oversight<span class="italic"> </span>Board with representatives of the most important services and also of the European Court of Auditors to assist with the implementation of this ambitious and expensive project.</p>
<p class="contents">With Mr Gray as chief accountant and Mr Oostens as director of the accountancy division, we shall have two qualified and experienced accountants and qualified managers at the head of this ambitious project which, if it is successful – and I am confident that it will be – will put the EU administration at the forefront of modern public administration in accountancy as it is in other areas.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, today’s package of decisions that the Commission has now adopted underlines that the Commission and the administrative reform package have long since passed the planning stage and have entered implementation, and I am pleased to have been able today to present these steps forward in financial management to the European Parliament, which is supporting us with its constructive criticism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every year since 1994 and again, too, for the 2001 Budget, the European Court of Auditors has found that the books and financial statement are a true record of the European Union’s revenue and expenditure and also accurately show the financial position at the end of the year. At the same time, the European Court of Auditors has repeatedly urged us, as regards the capital account, to go over to a new system that does not wait until a payment or receipt has been made before recording financial transactions, but records them when a claim is raised or a commitment entered into. That is an important step, which is now enacted in the Financial Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past few years – and this brings me to Mr Heaton-Harris’s question – we have already taken steps towards this capital account. Then, of course, a lot of information about our claims and commitments came from outside the bookkeeping system. For example, we asked ourselves what the Commission’s future obligations were with regard to pensions for its officials. That was information that was obtained and processed by the Directorate-General for Administration and then fed into the accounting system. This information was not derived from the annual budget. Take another example, which also applies to the Parliament’s budget. Take the fixed assets, this building for example. The budget account contained only the expenditure made in a given year. If you like, the assets were then no longer contained in the accounts, or they had to be brought into them again at an appropriate valuation. For the future we plan – and this is how it is being introduced – that the information will go from the annual budget directly into the capital budget. Then we will know what the European Union’s assets are and we will not have to introduce them separately.</p>
<p class="contents">I must point out that unfortunately we cannot simply draw on best practices in the Member States. Some Member States – and we discussed this repeatedly in the Committee on Budgetary Control – have taken steps in this direction, but at the same time the Member States also have different problems. Municipalities, for example, own infrastructure, and you might therefore say that they have different assets than we do and have to value them differently. If – and this is new – for example securities that contractors have to lodge when they take part in a tendering procedure or the tender has been accepted now have to be shown in books, then we have to take new decisions. The international standards are, if you like, principles, but they must, as it were, be tailored to the specific budget, to the specific tasks that we have in the budget, if they are to be made to work. That will also be decided by this Standards<span class="italic"> </span>Committee. If that produces good results, I think that might in future be something that the Member States or third countries will be able to take over from us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately I have been around for quite some time and so I know that the possible advance that might be manifested in the European Union from 2005 onwards is being preceded by a period that has not yet been concluded in which a system operated that definitely does not meet those standards or even earlier standards. Let us be honest: there were standards before that time too.

I only wonder why it is only now that you are admitting to this scandalous situation – I only mention the fact that nothing was obviously done to prevent multiple entries – even though the Court of Auditors has drawn attention to it repeatedly since 1994, why you apparently need a few more years, until 2005, to put a stop to them, why you dismissed a chief accountant who was the first to draw attention to these errors early this year and why you subjected her to disciplinary proceedings. I seriously wonder how you think you can sell us your new Financial Regulation as a great success when it is not based on an operational bookkeeping system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Regarding Mr van Dam’s question, I must again point out that it is not correct to say that the European Union’s and the European Commission’s accounts did not meet international standards. There are, however, different international standards, there are standards that are based solely on the cash accounting principle and there is a further development with a view to more managerial categories.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past, the Financial Regulation, that is the law that applies to us and also to the other institutions, had only prescribed the cash accounting principle. This met the standard and it was followed. I have pointed out that the further development is a relatively recent development, even for the public sector. I repeat, the corresponding IPSA standards of the International<span class="italic"> </span>Federation<span class="italic"> </span>of<span class="italic"> </span>Accountants are the first standards for the public sector and were adopted in the year 2000, the most recent one not until October 2002, that is, two months ago. These standards do not yet cover every issue; in other words, it is in fact an ongoing development, and in that respect we can truly say that we are in the vanguard if we decide to go in that direction – and that is what we have done with the Financial Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Mrs Stauner’s question, you have again assumed, Mrs Stauner, that the Court of Auditors would not give a statement of assurance for the accounts. That is not correct. I would stress once again that this year the Court of Auditors again found, for the year 2001, that the financial statement, the budget account gives a true picture of the revenue and expenditure. You were the rapporteur, the general rapporteur, Mrs Stauner, and you also confirmed this in your statement. I will explain once again that the financial statement is of course submitted not only to the European Court of Auditors but also to the Council and Parliament, in other words the books are open on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Mr Kuhne’s question about the development of the necessary computer system, here too, I will say again that when I look at the situation in some Member States, where many different financial statements are produced because they do not yet have a uniform system, I can only say that the previous Commission took an important step here in 1999 when it required all entries in the books to be made using the same system.</p>
<p class="contents">That was a tremendous step for the European Commission, too, since there were previously five or seven different financial statements – I do not remember the exact number – that then had to be integrated or could not be completely integrated. That was therefore essential, and we all know that software and computer systems, too, continue to develop. Regarding the SAP system, for example, on which our bookkeeping is based or which does our bookkeeping, SAP is running the software in question only until 2004; a new system is now being introduced all over the world and we are faced with the task of having to adopt it and introduce it over that period of time.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn now to Mrs Theato’s question. What will happen in the meantime? Work is of course being done all the time. For example, work is now being done to create a central register of accounts and a central register for contracts, which will then be available to all services. We now have the SI-II System for sections managing funds. The data it produces are input into the SAP accounting system, after having been checked by financial control.</p>
<p class="contents">The managers of resources cannot consult the accounting system direct. They have no access, that is correct, but they cannot consult it either. The aim is that the chief accountant will make the data available to everyone so that there will be no more inconsistencies but at the same time, of course, that safeguards are maintained, so that the person managing the funds cannot, as it were, get past the front-line security and through to the transaction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
