I say that because many of the borders involved in these great island kingdoms – the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia – are purely and simply colonial borders that we drew artificially to suit our own political and economic interests and which destroyed historical structures. To that extent, we are responsible for many of the conflicts in this region. That does not mean that it is not up to us Europeans to ensure that these structures do not disintegrate, with all the dangers that would imply. We should not put ourselves on a pedestal. We have to recognise that we bear a lot of the responsibility for these developments.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, it is, of course, our task to create peace and stability in this area, and in particular to take action against all those criminals who, on a political pretext, have, in the most appalling way, kidnapped and maltreated innocent tourists who are citizens of the European Union. There can be no political justification for ill-treating people as is happening there. We therefore appeal to these criminals to release these citizens of the European Union and all the hostages immediately, and we give our full support to Mr Solana and everyone else trying to help to bring this hostage crisis to an end. We should also take this hostage crisis as a warning to us to stop ignoring these parts of the world or simply pursuing our own economic interests there. Instead, we should be helping to create stable and peaceful conditions there, because these areas of conflict are like open wounds that we ourselves have often inflicted in the past in these regions.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not clear whether this is a case of organised crime or political demands but the island of Jolo is now at the centre of the hostilities with this awful hostage taking.</p>
<p class="contents">In these islands, which are characterised by tropical luxuriance and unspeakable poverty, the machine gunning of villages, kidnappings, ransom demands and torture are common currency. This hostage taking and the many violations of human rights show how these armed opposition movements have sunk into criminal excess.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we cannot tolerate these constant violations of human rights, we also deplore the failure of the peace talks with the Philippine Government. We also know that the violence has its roots in poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we strongly support the appeal made by the Archbishop of Manila to President Estrada that socio-economic reforms should be implemented. Without the political will to end the situation, the violence can only continue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the case of Equatorial Guinea, one of so many African countries which have undergone a very poor transition from the colonial era, during which former colonial relationships, on the one hand, and the ambitions of other Member States of the Union to extend their area of influence, on the other, have prevented the support necessary and conducive to the establishment of a genuine democratic system.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1999 there were general elections to the Guinean Parliament, during which the international observers noted that human rights, democratic guarantees and freedom of information had been violated. The same situation may now reoccur during the elections on 28 May, which is why, as this resolution states, we demand the appropriate intervention of the European Union, in order to guarantee that democratic elections take place on this occasion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, no steps have been taken to establish a constitutional state based on a multi-party democracy which fully respects human rights. Secondly, the population endures harsh conditions of poverty. The government of President Teodoro Obiang has failed to comply with each and every promise of democratisation which it made to the international community. The leaders and activists of the opposition parties face constant persecution, in the form of arbitrary arrest and sometimes torture. Of course, they have no access to the media and they have to face corrupt electoral processes, in which transparency and fair play are totally absent.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the municipal elections of 28 May, there are grounds for concern, because to date there has been no guarantee of any democratic conditions for these elections. We are therefore concerned and we ask that efforts be made to observe how the elections are carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">Guinea is sinking further and further into under-development. Paradoxically, its income, which comes from oil, is increasing, but none of it reaches the inhabitants, being entirely purloined by the ruling classes.</p>
<p class="contents">Given this situation, as the resolution we have presented indicates, we demand that the government of Equatorial Guinea initiate a genuine transition to democracy, which we believe could begin by making these municipal elections free elections. The Union must exert pressure in this respect, and not lower its guard or accept any more false promises from President Obiang.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, if the municipal elections take place in the current circumstances, with no form of guarantee, we must not resume any cooperation with Guinea, apart from purely humanitarian cooperation. Article 5 of the Lomé Convention obliges the Union and the Member States to demand democracy and human rights in Equatorial Guinea. We therefore believe that this House should follow that line. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Even more so if we bear in mind that the President of Guinea is one of the signatories of the Cairo declaration and the action plan which accompanies it, which recognises the need to consolidate democratic principles, based on the right of all citizens to choose their leaders freely by means of free elections and, consequently, also the need to ensure that elections are transparent and free, and to adopt the necessary means for their effective observation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the experience of previous elections, during which serious irregularities and a total lack of transparency were noted, as well the continuing lack of democratic guarantees in Guinea, requires not only that we observe very carefully how the coming elections are held, but also that we demand, forcefully, that President Obiang adopts the necessary measures to guarantee fair play in these elections.</p>
<p class="contents">We especially have to ensure that the process is open to all political forces – which involves the liberation of the political prisoners – and that the opposition is guaranteed the full expression of its democratic freedoms. We should also demand the presence of observers who can monitor, in total freedom, the handling of these elections, and verify that democratic rights have been respected.</p>
<p class="contents">These elections may offer Guinea the opportunity to start along the path to democracy. They could also lead to a rapprochement with the European Union and the granting of the aid which the European Union was prepared to give in the event that democracy was respected.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, as a Parliament, we have the obligation to exert pressure on President Obiang and demand that he allows these elections to be held in accordance with democratic principles. This is the only way that freedom may be fully restored to the people of Guinea.</p>

There have been considerable reasons for optimism in the election of President Khatami and the overwhelming vote for reformist candidates in the February elections but, as Human Rights Watch notes, the struggle to control the press is, in many ways, the struggle to control the future direction of the Islamic Republic as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">The very success of the reformist agenda seems to have provoked a backlash by the conservative reactionary forces and an attempt to punish the majority who voted in February for reform. They are targeting the independent press because it is a major channel for reformists. These attempts surely cannot succeed in the long run because the youthful population is impatient for change showing that Islam and guarantees of rights and freedoms are perfectly compatible.</p>
<p class="contents">We must do all in our power to encourage and support reform, including especially basic legal safeguards for freedom of expression as required by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Iran is a signatory.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, we call on Iran to cease the persecution and prosecution of journalists and writers for views which do not threaten public order, or national security, but only the vested interests of conservatives.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The name ‘Bahar’ clearly refers to a political programme and undeniably supports President Khatami’s reform policy. This course probably coincides rather well with the pursuit of a civil society. </p>
<p class="contents">Iranian conservative circles saw this trend as a deliberate attempt to secularise their own state – and with good reason. To their growing dismay, these fervent defenders of the political status-quo within the Islamic Republic have been pushed onto the defensive since President Khatami took office in 1998. This was underlined by a painful defeat in the parliamentary elections only a few months ago. </p>
<p class="contents">In order to turn the political tide, the hard liners in Tehran have not shrunk from using any means available to them. Just cast your mind back to some eighteen months ago, when a number of independent clergy were killed in macabre circumstances, or to last year, when the student protest was ruthlessly repressed. Incidentally, the followers of the revolution leader, Khamenei, attempted to systematically silence the independent and critical press by issuing publication bans. This hit the ultra-conservatives during the parliamentary elections particularly hard. Hence, their furious reaction last month when they closed all but a paltry three of the reform-minded daily newspapers. </p>
<p class="contents">The present joint resolution supports the persecuted and the journalists in Iran who are doomed to unemployment. The latter knew and know that they can count on the support of the large majority of the population. Why? Because they were not afraid to publicly turn against a far-reaching lack of freedom in society, which is perpetuated by undisguised terrorist tactics generated by the state machinery. With this resolution, the European Parliament aims to encourage Persian editors in their fight for freedom of the press and to banish all fears at the writing desks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reform process in Iran is at risk. Even before the newly elected reform parliament has been able to meet, there has been a menacing intensification of the power struggle in Iran.

<p class="contents">We are also concerned about the ban on all pro-reform newspapers and magazines published in Iran. We call on the Iranian authorities to immediately release the conference participants and journalists who have been arrested, and to cancel all warrants of arrest issued in this connection, to lift the ban on the prohibited newspapers and magazines and, last but by no means least, to respect the political will of the Iranian people, which was so remarkably expressed in the election results. We call on the Council, the Member States and the Commission to support these demands on Iran and to make respect for human rights a prerequisite for further cooperation with Iran. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Last week, Mr Putin’s troops occupied the largest opposition publishing house in Russia. Yesterday, the same thing happened in Belgrade to the independent radio station there. In Iran, we have a situation where newspapers are being banned for simply acting as a voice for those forces and individuals who were so successful in the last election, and who embodied – and continue to embody – hopes of pluralism in Iran. I therefore fully support everything Mrs Rühle has said. We must take advantage of this phase to offer our firm support to democratic forces and forces for reform in Iran, because what we are witnessing at present is a fresh start and yet simultaneously a setback. What is very much at issue here is that we should not allow those forces to be isolated, which is what the regime is working towards. That is why it has also been so devastating that the developments at the conference in Berlin occurred, thus giving the regime a pretext for taking measures against the opposition in Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that a dialogue with Iran is, in fact, the only way to influence developments in that country. We must not leave the opposition unsupported by adopting measures that encourage isolation. Instead, we should press, through intensive contacts not only with the government but also with the opposition, and by the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission bringing all their considerable influence to bear, for an end to these developments, and to ensure that the reform process in Iran, which is fragile but promising, is not once again choked at birth!</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Awkward because the Burmese junta was successful in obtaining international recognition. I refer, naturally, to Burma joining the ASEAN. It is quite possible that the other ASEAN Member States decided in favour of this with the best of intentions and in the hope that this would kick-start the democratisation process in Burma. We have to ascertain, however, that this is not how it worked, that this attempt failed and may well have brought about the opposite effect, judging from the smirks on the faces of the Burmese rulers when they hosted the ASEAN meeting of Ministers for Economic Affairs earlier this month. </p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, relations between the European Union and ASEAN should not suffer because of the problems within Burma. These relations are too important for this. It does mean, however, that, if this situation continues, we will need to discuss the situation in Burma in our contacts with ASEAN. </p>
<p class="contents">However, we have to ascertain at the same time that our own sanctions were not that effective either.

After a period of uncertainty and conflict, open and fair elections were held in 1990 and Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi was voted President with an overwhelming majority. In the parliamentary elections, the NLD won most of the parliamentary seats. </p>
<p class="contents">Shortly after this, the military once again seized power. Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi was imprisoned. Parliament was dissolved and many MPs were murdered, imprisoned or driven out of the country. Since then, Burma has been the scene of unprecedented repression. Thousands of people have been killed and hundreds of thousands of people have fled the country and are living in camps in Thailand, Malaysia and India. In the country itself, entire population groups have been displaced in order to break up the minority groups. There is talk of forced labour. According to the Financial Times this week, Burma has more child soldiers than anywhere else in the world. </p>
<p class="contents">Burma can be compared with South Africa and Chile in the Eighties. What action would we like the Commission and Council to take? First of all, we would ask you not to accept that the military regime in Burma should represent the Burmese people at the Euro-Asian Summit. We also ask you to take a hard economic line against Burma. We advocate economic isolation and an absolute investment ban by all EU Member States, as proposed several times already by the United States. </p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, EU citizens should be dissuaded by their governments from travelling to Burma for their holidays. Many of these new facilities have been built using forced labour. This is the core of our request. </p>
<p class="contents">Burma should not receive any better treatment from the international community than South Africa and Chile did back in the Eighties. If it does, then we are using double standards. Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi should at long last receive an effective response to her peaceful protest. What would she otherwise gain from a Nobel Prize and Sakharov Prize if she does not actually receive support in order to free herself and her country from this terrible plight? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This resolution looks at the security and safety arrangements ahead of Euro 2000 so that decent football-loving supporters from across Europe can go to, watch and come away from football games this summer without fear or concern for their safety: a fairly apt thing to call for considering the recent events in Copenhagen.</p>
<p class="contents">Most Members will find this motion uncontentious. However, I do understand that there are some queries about the question of the suitability of the Charleroi stadium and its ability to safely host the England versus Germany game on 17 June. These I will tackle now because I believe these points are what people want to hear about.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank the BBC Watchdog Programme for providing me with details of the findings of a renowned British sports stadia expert, Dr Jim Dickey. He found, after just a brief examination of the temporary structure above the north stand in Charleroi, that there were too many seats in the rows, the stand is too steep, the safety barriers are too low, the exits from the stand are too narrow and the stairways at the back of the stand are too wide. This stand, like all the others, will be full to capacity on 17 June. Meanwhile, a few miles up the road, the King Baudouin stadium, Belgium's national stadium, and now probably one of the safest stadia in all of Europe, will lie empty that day.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand the regional pride of many members from Belgium and I do not question that much time is being spent by the organisers of Euro 2000 looking into the safety and security aspects of the competition. But surely, common sense should prevail and the future of this particular fixture at its current venue should be actively re-examined.</p>
<p class="contents">I do hope that Members will support this motion, because this is something we can actually change for the better. Why not look at an event beforehand and not worry about the consequences of the bad actions of a few violent people after such a football event.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Most people are looking forward to a good match and hope that it will be safe. But, unfortunately, that is not the view of everybody. The German police anti-hooligan task force has said that it is pretty confident there will be hooligans there. I cannot say anything about German hooligans but I can talk about English football hooligans – I cannot say ‘fans’ and even the word ‘hooligan’ is not strong enough for them. There is a group of people who very definitely are planning to be there. If you doubt me, just look at the press photographs of the problems that occurred in Copenhagen last night.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as the problems my colleague referred to that could occur inside the stadium at Charleroi, there is a serious problem that may occur in the streets around that stadium. The head of the Belgian Police Federation has said that he is concerned. We are saying now to the Belgian authorities and the European football authorities that they should choose the option of a safer ground that is available elsewhere in Belgium, and the stadium in Brussels has been cited.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I do not believe, however, that the motion before us deals with the problem correctly. For example, paragraph 2 of the motion is wrong. In this paragraph Parliament expresses its concern about the fact that the Charleroi stadium, which is to host several games, in particular the England versus Germany match, does not meet the relevant Belgian safety standards.</p>
<p class="contents">This is wrong for several reasons. The first is that the organisers of any game in Belgium and the promoters of any stadium must sign a public-law agreement with the municipality in which the stadium is situated. This agreement engages the personal responsibility of the burgomaster.</p>
<p class="contents">Our fellow Member has spoken of regional pride. Belgians are aware of the good and bad sides of regional pride and, as a result, the use of a stadium requires not only the signature of the burgomaster but also that of the Minister of the Interior. It is therefore completely wrong to talk of regional rivalries. Furthermore, everyone knows or should know that it is not the inhabitants of Charleroi who chose this game any more than the others.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in the context of Euro 2000, there is an additional requirement that the stadium must be approved by the European Union and UEFA. For all the stadiums which have been converted to accommodate an adequate number of visitors, UEFA has not only given its final authorisation to the process but has also been involved in the practical organisation of the stadium reviews. I know something about this as I have worked, in my capacity as burgomaster of the town of Liege, on the preparation of a similar stadium.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I regret to say that our colleagues are using arguments which are inaccurate and which can therefore only lead to wrong conclusions. I am not the only one to think this as Mr Desama would have said the same if he had been able to speak. Our Dutch colleague, Mr van den Berg, also agrees as he asked me to say that in this case he has witnessed, in addition to a responsible attitude from the Belgians,…</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, it gives us the opportunity to reiterate that we all condemn hooliganism and that we all obviously want to fight this phenomenon to the best of our ability.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also point out, however, that, for two years now, in both the Netherlands and Belgium, the sporting, political and police authorities have been preparing in a professional manner for Euro 2000 and, in practical terms, huge investments have been made.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite that, is there still a risk? Of course, but then there is always a risk. When faced with such a phenomenon, you can never say that nothing will happen. However, I must say very sportingly to our British colleague that this does not justify an event of this type being used from the outset to incite prejudice. It does not justify the attempt to spread incorrect information in official European Parliament documents either.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 2, as indicated by Mr Dehousse, is incorrect. The Belgian authorities have given authorisation for the Charleroi stadium to be used. Paragraph 3, which indicates that the King Baudouin stadium in Brussels might be used, is wrong. No authority and no official has indicated this. We must therefore be reasonable and certainly not adopt texts like this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, our fellow member has cited information which he was delighted to indicate was given to him by the BBC. I should like to mention something which was said on the BBC by someone who is not a football referee like you but who is the coach of the England team. What did Mr Keegan say – I am nearly finished, Mr President – during his visit to Charleroi? He said that it is a suitable stadium for a high-level match. He even said that this stadium differs very little from a large number of stadia in England.</p>
<p class="contents">So, be sporting! As a referee, Mr Heaton-Harris, you have one viewpoint but I prefer that of Mr Kevin Keegan who seems to me to be better qualified. Therefore, please withdraw your motion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we must be careful not to do so in a manner that would restrict the enjoyment of the real supporters.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue must, therefore, be discussed at a European level, and we should guard against becoming embroiled in local discussions on the capacity and safety of specific stadiums, wherever they might be.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ask ourselves why measures taken in the past have repeatedly failed to create a culture of enjoyment in football for everybody. I welcome the dialogue under way now between the Commission and sports and football clubs on how matters could improve. The people who run the game are the people who, through constructive dialogue, will eventually be able to find answers to the blight of hooliganism and, it must be said, racism affecting this most popular of all sports.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know now that there are tens of millions of people who are passionate about this sport and that, since the World Cup was won by France, they have been impatiently awaiting Euro 2000. Football has become a sport of the masses and we must think about the safety of our children, our little brothers and the youngsters who frequent the stadiums.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot therefore just say that there are risks and there will always be risks. We must try to counter this phenomenon of hooliganism to the best of our ability. I say this because we cannot allow the good image of genuine supporters to be tarnished by the actions of a few violent extremists who use these major gatherings as a pretext for carrying out unacceptable acts.</p>
<p class="contents">The motion is good in that it indicates that adequate safety measures must be taken. During the last World Cup you will remember that hooligans committed very serious acts of violence. One in particular involved an attack on a police officer who was in a coma for a long time and who is now paralysed for life. All this is not inevitable and we must find the means, for example, of punishing hooligans in the countries of the European Union in which they commit their offences.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect I believe there to have been a recent example in France which is very important. For years, under the Nazi banner, French hooligans monopolised a stand at the Parc des Princes in Paris. They took advantage of matches to vent their hatred, chant Nazi slogans and chase blacks and Arabs on leaving the ground. The Paris St. Germain club allowed this to happen and even ended up blocking access to the stand in question for any dark skinned person on the pretext of safety. Following a complaint from the French association, SOS-Racisme, and faced with the threat of prosecution, the club undertook to end this behaviour and to no longer allow the hooligans into the stadium by strictly screening people as they enter. Before every match, right to the end of the season, Paris St. Germain now shows an anti-racist video clip which celebrates the values of friendship and brotherhood and the pleasures of the sport.</p>
<p class="contents">This proves that action can be taken and that violence is not inevitable. I truly believe that, when you think about what football has become, with tens of thousands of youngsters in these stadia, this shows that we really must try to be careful and not take these matters lightly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Surely it is not up to us to get involved in the politics of one specific match at a specific venue and make technical statements about the suitability of one football stadium for one Euro 2000 match? It would have been much better to point out – and I would like to do so on behalf of many PPE-DE colleagues – that, first of all, safety is an essential good over which extreme care is to be taken and for which many efforts are being made with regard to Euro 2000. Secondly, all those responsible for safety at Euro 2000 are called on to operate in an extremely preventive manner. Thirdly, the police forces of all participating countries must be encouraged to negotiate obstacles which would hinder extensive collaboration. Fourthly, we would like to call on all those involved – organisers, players and supporters – to observe fair play. </p>

This Parliament should not be discussing safety during one particular Euro 2000 match under pressure from what I assume is a portion of British public opinion. It is also an insult to – in this case – the Belgian organisers of this game and the international authorities involved. This is a great pity because extensive discussions can be held about the fight against hooliganism itself. In addition, we continue to learn important lessons, such as for example, how we should really guide the fans? How can we better educate club managers and organisers of games? Attention should also be given to the so-called ‘second opinion’ which is now being applied, by means of which a group outside the organisation analyses the measures taken and suggests improvements. </p>

<p class="contents">The Commission shares the honourable Members’ concern for the health and safety of the hostages in Jolo and Basilan. We strongly condemn such terrorist actions. We were, of course, fully associated with the decision to send the EU High Representative, Javier Solana, to the Philippines.

<p class="contents">I should wish to add one final point about the 21 hostages – seven of them are European Union citizens. Obviously, we all hope for their early release. Our thoughts are, I am sure, with their families. I hope, too, that we will receive early news about the welfare of the journalists who went to cover the story and have subsequently gone missing. I hope that their whereabouts will soon be discovered.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to Equatorial Guinea. We have been closely monitoring the human rights situation there for several years. We share the concerns of the European Parliament about the local elections there. Those concerns were reflected in the presidency declaration at the beginning of May. During a recent mission by the Commission services, the issues that Parliament is addressing were raised directly with the President.</p>
<p class="contents">An official request for an electoral monitoring mission was sent on 2 May by the Equatorial Guinea government to Commissioner Nielson. An answer containing detailed reasons for the refusal is being sent by the Commission to President Obiang. The request from the government of Guinea-Bissau arrived very late and, in keeping with our guidelines, electoral observation missions should be prepared at an early stage in the electoral process so that we can ensure that the process is accurate and fair. It is relevant that the opposition parties in Equatorial Guinea have contested the electoral lists and have already decided to boycott the ballot.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore consider that, at this stage, the presence of international observers would not only fail to improve the quality and the transparency of the local elections, there is also a very real risk that this mission could be misused by local authorities as a way to legitimise an unsatisfactory process. However, we intend to involve ourselves in promoting the process of democratisation in Equatorial Guinea.</p>
<p class="contents">On Iran, the Commission fully shares Parliament’s concern over the lack of freedom of expression there. In the comprehensive dialogue between the European Union and Iran, questions regarding human rights, including press freedom, are regularly raised by the Commission. The Iranian authorities are well aware of the importance we attach to these issues. Clearly the present position is a very delicate one: the opponents of reform have used their control of the judiciary and of the security forces to intimidate intellectuals and to ban reformist papers. The current trial of the 13 Jews on charges of espionage is also very disturbing. The reformists have remained calm, and so should we, hoping that the convening of parliament will shortly help improve the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn to Burma. We deplore the continued violation of human rights by the Burmese military regime. In particular, we deplore the continued extra-judicial killings, the widespread imposition of forced labour and the forced displacement of local populations, as well as the repression of political opponents and the prevention of the free functioning of legitimate political parties. This includes the restrictions on the freedom of movement of Aung San Suu Kyi and other members of the National League for Democracy and the routine practice of arbitrary arrests. We have strongly supported the EU common position on Burma and the decision of the April 2000 General Affairs Council to strengthen that common position.</p>
<p class="contents">We use every opportunity to press our Asian partners to urge, what is called – with a touch of George Orwell – the “State Peace and Development Council” to enter into a substantial dialogue with the democratically elected representatives and the ethnic minorities with a view to arriving at a mutually agreed internal solution to the problems of Burma and to respect for international human rights standards there.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, on football hooliganism: the responsibility for ensuring adequate safety for spectators and players during the Euro 2000 matches lies with the relevant national authorities and the relevant football associations. I just wish to make two additional points. Firstly, we want Parliament to recall that, last June, the Justice and Home Affairs Council requested Member States to step up cooperation in order to prevent and control violence and disturbances in connection with international football matches. At the same time a handbook was made available with examples of working methods to police forces.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Community’s programme for police and customs cooperation finances a project prepared between the police authorities of the Netherlands and Belgium in which police forces from other Member States participate. This aims at drawing lessons from the organisation of Euro 2000 in order to improve, when necessary, the organisations of future similar events.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to add one point. I very much hope that Euro 2000 is a great success. However, I hope with equal fervour that the games during Euro 2000 are a great deal better than the one I watched on television last night.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will be very brief but I rise on a matter which is dear to the hearts of most Members here. On a number of occasions this week the Members bar has had in it visitors from outside Parliament and, actually, just members of the public. I know a number of Members during the week have been unable to get any food. Could we have some clarification from the Quaestors so that we can have a <span class="italic">Members</span> bar? We have a Members bar in Brussels. I am not against taking one or two members of staff or whoever it might be into the bar, but to bring visiting groups of 20 or more into it is wrong. I hope we can have some clarification.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
