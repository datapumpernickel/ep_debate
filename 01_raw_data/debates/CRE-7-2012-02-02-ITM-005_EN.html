<p class="contents">Mr President, it is almost over a year since the Committee on Petitions decided to draw up a report on waste management in the EU. The decision was taken after it was established that large numbers of repeat petitions were being put forward, condemning the poor waste management carried out by the authorities, the location of certain rubbish dumps, the destruction of some natural areas, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Petitions was sensitive to these claims, and sent several fact-finding missions to the areas concerned in order to verify <span class="italic">in situ</span> the truth of the complaints made by the petitioners. All of this has led us here today, to the plenary session of the European Parliament, in order to make it clear that the proper application of current legislation by Member States is an unresolved issue that requires particular attention and on which we should remain vigilant.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said at the beginning of my speech, most European citizens expect public authorities to provide efficient and effective public services in terms of health, education, transport and security. However, the issue that provokes a growing number of petitions is the apparent inability of public authorities in many countries to deal satisfactorily with the problem of waste management.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has adopted a broad raft of legislation, applicable in all Member States, in order to ensure that the legal framework exists to deal with the inevitable result of our modern lifestyle in terms of all the things we discard as waste from our household, from our place of work, from our hospitals, from our industries and so on. It is obvious to all that failure to manage such issues, and failure to prioritise efforts in this respect, produces not only negative effects on human health and well-being, but also on the viability of the planet and its environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Judging by the petitions received, the concern of many local communities is growing, and this indicates that waste management is becoming a major political and social problem and people expect the European Union to deal with it somehow. An analysis of the waste management policies implemented in the Member States provides very contrasting information and serious breaches of EU legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission reported in January 2011 that 177 infringement cases concerning landfills had been launched since the deadline for implementing the Landfill Directive in 2001. They had furthermore calculated that there were at the very least 619 illegal landfills still being used in the EU. In its strategic report on the prevention and recycling of waste, the Commission clearly demonstrates that it is using its best efforts to address the issue of waste management, and it also outlines its medium-term proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be recalled in this context, Mr President, that the large number of infringement cases mentioned aim at ensuring legal compliance, yet from the petitioners’ perspective, more effort needs to be made to ensure proper follow-up actions in the actual implementation of the law.</p>
<p class="contents">Closely linked to the waste management process, although upstream of the process, are the EU directives dealing with environmental impact assessments and the access of citizens to information concerning the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission very much welcomes the report, which presents important facts linked to the state of implementation of waste legislation in Member States. As we have already stressed on many occasions, full implementation of waste legislation is crucial for securing a safe and healthy environment, as well as a resource base for European industry. However, we face a persistent implementation gap in waste legislation and the resulting wide disparity between Member States in terms of performance in waste management not only puts our environment and health at risk, but also prevents the EU economy as a whole, and its recycling and waste management industry in particular, from reaping the benefits of proper implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me quote some facts. First, we have missed opportunities due to poor implementation. Those missed opportunities are estimated to amount to a loss of EUR 72 billion per year. Secondly, if the material going for disposal today was treated in accordance with the existing legislation, we could have avoided between 146 and 244 million tonnes of CO<span class="sub">2 </span>emissions. That is the equivalent of taking 47 million cars off the road each year and corresponds to somewhere between 19 and 31 percent of the EU climate reduction targets. Last, but not least, full implementation of waste legislation could create over 400 000 jobs – jobs which we need very badly in the current economic environment.</p>
<p class="contents">These are important figures, and for this reason the Commission fully concurs with the conclusion of the report that effort needs to be stepped up to fully implement existing waste legislation. We also subscribe to Parliament’s call on Member States to transpose the Waste Framework Directive without further delay and to ensure full compliance with all its requirements, and, in particular, to establish and implement comprehensive waste management plans so that the goal of European waste laws is put into practice quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue to monitor compliance with European waste legislation. We will continue to provide guidance to Member States on practical aspects of implementation, and we intend to streamline resources by identifying and focusing on the most problematic Member States and to address existing deficiencies together with those Member States. We are also looking into the possibility of strengthening cooperation with the European Environment Agency in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by saying that we have efforts under way to address Parliament’s concerns raised in the report and, at the same time, we are grateful that Parliament is bringing much-needed added energy to those efforts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to express my considerable thanks to Mr Iturgaiz Angulo, who has made a very good job of putting this report back on an objective footing.</p>
<p class="contents">In some regions of Europe, there remain serious problems with waste management. In particular, there is a lack of realisable plans for the avoidance, reuse and processing of waste. This gives rise to mountains of waste that overflow into other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Petitions has been able to get a very accurate picture of the situation in the regions through its many visits to the locations concerned. In view of the potential environmental damage and harm to public health that could be caused by waste, we need to get to grips with this problem quickly and consistently. The important thing is for all the regions to implement the existing EU legislation in this area promptly and to draw up comprehensive waste management plans. These regulations do, after all, exist; and therefore they must be complied with by the various countries. The responsibility for this lies primarily with the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I also am looking to the Commission here. It should intervene at an early stage if it becomes clear that plans are not being properly produced in the regions or regulations are not being correctly implemented, or if the regions are unable or unwilling to draw up and implement such plans. As part of this, sanctions must be imposed quickly and consistently if regions do not comply. Naturally, consumers also have a crucial role to play. Without an awareness among the public of waste avoidance and separation, it will be difficult to establish a positive and functioning recycling system – in other words, a genuinely circular flow of materials.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, of all the current waste recycling options, the best waste is that which never arises in the first place and can be avoided at the outset. That is good for people, good for the environment and saves resources that can usefully be used elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to sum up what I have said. Firstly, we need the regions to draw up a plan for waste recycling and avoidance. I emphatically agree with the Commission when it says that there can be no money from Brussels unless a clear plan is in place. That is only right. Secondly, and this issue is just as important, we must hold the Member States to account if those responsible in the regions are unable or unwilling to establish such a plan. The Member States must help them to develop such a plan. If there is still a delay – and this is my only criticism of the Commission – then the Commission must help the Member States to produce such a plan quickly, so that our beautiful continent is not spoilt by mountains of waste. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Merkies, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her positive words and for agreeing with us that it is absolutely essential to give consideration to an effective waste policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last few years, we have come across many citizens from various Member States in the Committee on Petitions. Some countries, such as Italy, Bulgaria and Romania, still send a great deal of waste to landfill, although, if I am honest, the petitions did not come from those countries alone. It would seem that waste really is a problem that needs to be taken seriously, a problem that has an impact on a large number of citizens. We can see that there is a lack of transparency. Citizens want to know what is happening, how the authorities are dealing with something that is currently seen as a problem but is actually an opportunity. Waste must become an opportunity, rather than a problem, because an opportunity is what it actually is.</p>
<p class="contents">You told us that everything is under control and that more attention is going to be paid to this area. Quite honestly, though, we have already asked the Commission on various occasions in Plenary – this is therefore not the first time that we have asked – not just to tell us what needs to happen, but to actually do something.</p>
<p class="contents">We have rules, and they are good in the European Union. We make it very clear that there needs to be a plan, that there is a hierarchy and how waste must be handled. Obviously, it is also important for all the planning to be implemented, however – in other words, for there to actually be some action. That is why we are calling for real action, and my colleagues endorse this, for the introduction of a zero tolerance policy, and for subsidy streams to be turned off so that pressure is also brought to bear to take action. Ultimately, we are calling for a Member State to be called to account before the Court of Justice as soon as possible for why nothing has happened, for fines to be imposed whenever applicable.</p>
<p class="contents">I am thus asking very clearly for three things. These are also in the report, but I will just recap here in any case.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I am calling for a zero tolerance policy.</p>
<p class="contents">My second request is for set-up assistance wherever a Member State cannot manage alone. In times of crisis, it is clearly difficult to constantly have to find the people, the resources and the ideas to ultimately handle waste well.</p>
<p class="contents">The third thing we need – and this is the most important of all – is real transparency, as that is what the citizens are demanding. Without it, the citizens feel excluded. We need transparency about how waste is handled; in other words, is it toxic, what happens to it, where does it go and is it dealt with lawfully? What do we need to do to ensure that this problem becomes an opportunity, since we need these materials? For goodness’ sake, let us take precisely those regions of Europe that are still having difficulties at this point in time and make them the most modern regions and deal with waste in an entirely new and creative way since, in future, we really will need every bit of plastic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very happy that today, we are debating in plenary a resolution that stems from the many petitions that reach the European Parliament, and that refers specifically to the question of waste. These petitions demonstrate the concern of European citizens about the harm done to the environment, human health and the economy by waste management practices prevalent in various areas in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though I agree with the overall structure of the resolution, I am rather dissatisfied with how some of its passages address the issue of incinerators. At times, it seems that thanks to technology, any problem related to public health and the environment has been completely overcome. Until last year, right here, we were hearing the same words about nuclear power plants. Today, however, in this same Chamber, it is difficult to find anyone willing to defend the nuclear industry. Is it possible that politics is simply unable to take a long-term view? Do we really have to wait for more epidemiological studies confirming the increased cancer rates already found throughout populations living near incinerators?</p>
<p class="contents">This is not the NIMBY syndrome, but simply the citizens defending their right to health. There are alternatives that are virtuous and create employment. We must implement the spirit of the Waste Management Directive strictly, with a waste cycle based on the concepts of reduction, reuse and recycling. Landfill and incineration are residual, hierarchically inferior options, resorted to only after everything else possible has been done. If there was a political will to that effect, incinerators would be a nice memory.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that Parliament should take a more advanced stance and better protect its citizens in this area. I hope that the European Commission will propose stricter criteria and procedures for building incinerators and opening landfill sites, and encourage serious ‘zero waste’ policies in all Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Far too many members of our committee are uneasy, not to say unwilling, when it comes to criticising members of their own party in their own Member States and have therefore succeeded in ensuring that it is not as specific as it should have been in view of the many complaints. It has become far too general a report, which would probably not have been out of place in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. This is something that we ought to change quickly. Our committee cannot operate if we do not all rise above party politics.</p>
<p class="contents">Having got that out of the way, I would like to express my wholehearted praise for Mr Iturgaiz Angulo for his almost perfect cooperation on this report. We listened to one another. I believe that, despite the one-sided conditions, this report is a very good one, and I would like to express my thanks for that.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I have the same two points of criticism to make that have already been mentioned. Firstly, we have the deficient implementation – the fact that the problems are not taken seriously, there is a lack of adequate cooperation with the Commission and with other regions, town and cities that have solutions in place and citizens are not sufficiently involved. We cannot solve these problems unless we work much more closely with our citizens. In far too many places – in Italy in particular – we have seen that citizens are almost regarded as the enemy when it comes to solving these problems. This has been a horrible experience. We saw something similar but to a slightly less worrying extent in both Bulgaria and Spain, but Italy really is a dismal example in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point of criticism concerns the question of resources. We are currently facing not just one, but two crises. We are currently in the midst of a resource crisis, and clearly the most stupid thing we can do in relation to our scarce resources is to discharge them into the water or place them in a remote landfill site. The second most stupid thing we can do, however, is to burn them. We now have to put a stop to the pyromania. Not even the best incineration plants should be permitted to incinerate our scant resources. We must work at meeting all the requirements of the Waste Management Directive, but also invest intelligently in plants that are able to recover resources so as to develop our waste strategy in a modern way. That is what we need, first and foremost. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am involved in Parliament with waste management via my membership of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and I have to say how interesting and refreshing it was to read this report from a slightly different perspective, because it does take out a lot of what I might call the vested interests (and I mean that in the nicest possible way) – people who have their views and have had them for a long time and have worked very hard to get what they want through. Sometimes, it is difficult to lift your head up and look at the big picture, so a report such as this, I think, is really very useful.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course it is about a subject which very clearly and very closely concerns all of the people that we represent. There are very few subjects for me as a constituency MEP that I get quite so much passion from my voters about as waste management. I feel that it is an area in which we, the European Parliament, stand to be judged. If we do not get it right and if we do not make sure that we enforce, then all of the talking that we do here comes to nothing. All of that is encompassed in this very interesting and useful report.</p>
<p class="contents">There are huge differences in the way that Member States deal with the problem of rubbish, and I actually welcome the fact that we have those differences. I welcome the fact that this report recognises very strongly the issue of subsidiarity. It is about a Waste Framework Directive. Many of you will remember my predecessor, the lady that I replaced in this Parliament – Caroline Jackson – who was the rapporteur on the Waste Framework Directive. One of the principles that she was very keen on espousing was that Member States should be allowed as much subsidiarity as possible within the framework of tight and challenging targets. I know from recent conversations with her that she is extremely disappointed that, having been given that freedom, Member States are not delivering, because we are not making those targets.</p>
<p class="contents">Where we need to really tighten up – and this is in the report – is not on a whole raft of new regulations but on making those that we currently have work better and more effectively. A framework is just that. We need to get our Member States working towards that framework. I was really shocked here to see how many infringements there are in my own Member State – I thought we were doing OK. So in that sense, this is a great report for bringing that home.</p>
<p class="contents">Just on one point: I am happy to defend nuclear energy. But it has to be done with good technology, tightly controlled. The same is the case for incineration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One point on which I would like to comment, which the report also underlines, is that, although landfill is the last resort under EU legislation, there are countries, mine included, which are lagging behind in recycling and prevention and are therefore under pressure to extend existing landfills or create new ones, in breach of Community legislation and common sense, thereby causing serious problems in local communities and resulting in conflicts and solutions that are dangerous to the environment and public health. The second comment on the report that I wish to address to the Commissioner has to do with various cases in which the Commission washes its hands and is indifferent to the fact that it needs to intervene, such as where there are obvious errors in the waste management plans and environmental impact studies being processed. In such cases, Commissioner, the Commission needs to intervene. I think that the report, generally speaking, concerns a useful directive that will assist us in waste management. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

European citizens expect government authorities to provide adequate and effective services, especially in the waste sector, because they have a massive impact and harmful repercussions on public health and the environment. According to the UN, mankind’s problems up to 2030 will be as follows, in the following order: combating social exclusion, immigration and environmental issues. I do not know if they are in the right order, but this is an issue which deserves serious attention. The petitions received on the subject by the Committee on Petitions are now a regular occurrence. I therefore recommend, as the report emphasises, that the 2008 directive should apply to waste, as it lays down rules to protect the environment and human health, with the aim of preventing or reducing adverse repercussions from the production and management of waste. We need to pay attention to resources, to sites and to the public and, when I say the public, I mean that we need to educate the public. We need transparency in waste management procedures because waste management is a huge economic event. We need to pay particular attention to all this throughout Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On a <span class="italic">per capita</span> basis, it puts the role of India and China as waste producers into perspective. Although North America, Western Europe, Japan and Korea are known to lead the field when it comes to recycling, they still generate more waste than the rest of the world put together. The developments that go hand-in-hand with rising disposal costs should not be underestimated. In the US, electronics manufacturers save on disposal costs by shipping electronic waste to Africa or other areas of the developing world and calling it development aid, not to mention the innumerable tonnes of German PET bottles that are processed into stuffing for soft toys in China, where expensive environmental legislation and rules on worker protection do not apply, or which eventually end up in items of clothing destined for the West.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, many materials can only undergo the recycling process a limited number of times. In other cases, only a small proportion can be recycled. Downcycling is just as much of a problem as transporting waste all the way across Europe and the black sheep that dump waste illegally. What might be helpful, therefore, is the combination of an increase in recycling rates together with strict controls on exports of electronic waste and a shifting of the cost burden onto those who cause the waste. Waste avoidance measures are even more important, however. In ordering everyone to use toxic energy-saving bulbs, the EU has hardly covered itself in glory in this respect. Moreover, we must not forget that the issue of the storage of nuclear waste has still not been resolved. That is yet another reason to refrain from building more nuclear power stations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This own-initiative report from the Committee on Petitions stems from the strong need, felt by most, to respond more fully to the citizens who have submitted to the Committee on Petitions countless petitions, which are, in point of fact, complaints, regarding serious misapplication of EU law in the environmental sector, but particularly in the field of waste management.</p>
<p class="contents">One hundred and fourteen petitions, over a period of time that we can describe as short, from 16 different countries with the highest numbers from countries such as Spain, Ireland, Italy and Greece. The most common complaint relates to the improper activation of incineration and waste-treatment plants. This indicates that citizens are badly informed with regard to the effectiveness of the advanced technologies used for these types of plants.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this sector is extremely important, especially at such a sensitive time as this, with a global financial crisis that is also devastating the European Union. As the Commission has often repeated, following numerous detailed studies on the issue, a different use of waste resources would save the EU more than EUR 72 billion and would create more than 40 million jobs. I think these figures are important, in particular, when combined with the benefits for the environment and health, which are really the primary concern for us all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I consider that the Member States have a basic obligation to inform their citizens, without confining themselves merely to comments, and to restore confidence in connection with a problem that concerns us all. I think that it goes without saying that we need more objective data to measure environmental infringements.

In the period 2004-2010, the Committee on Petitions actually received and declared admissible a total of 114 petitions, alleging breaches of European Union legislation on waste alone. This indicates all too clearly that the issue is a topical one, and one that is also rightly worrying the public.</p>
<p class="contents">There are enormous differences among the Member States of the European Union as regards their waste management policies, and this is something that we ought to be able to address more closely. The deadline for the implementation of the Waste Framework Directive expired in 2010, and only six Member States have managed to implement it. In other words, public concern regarding the matter needs to be taken very seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">It also needs to be remembered that waste is an opportunity. As has been said, waste is a resource, and improvements in waste management are also bound to create new jobs and improve resource efficiency in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, your party has not always taken this line, even when in power. One example is my region, Galicia, where waste management does not prioritise prevention, reuse and recycling, as set out in item 12 of your report. At present, Galicia incinerates 42% of its waste, and the Galician Government is planning a new incinerator in O Irixo, which will consolidate the predominance of investment in this system for its waste treatment. Furthermore, although the plan is to incinerate half of the waste produced by 3 million people, it does not comply with the environmental impact assessment referred to in items 18 to 25, but has opted for a shortened procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The project also fails to comply with items 16 to 18 on the necessary dialogue and information for the people affected, who are against the incinerator. I would therefore urge compliance with European legislation on waste management, and would ask you to please send your report to the Galician Government. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Instead of proposing measures to combat the pollution caused with impunity by big business, the report openly advertises the catastrophic action by monopolies in the sector. It welcomes Directive 2000/98/EC, which promotes the incineration of waste for energy, which is destroying the environment and putting public health in danger, in order to increase capitalist profits. That same directive legalises pollution with impunity by industrial capital, because it allows hazardous waste to be mixed with non-hazardous waste. The report refers to the role of organised crime in creating environmental dangers, in order to conceal the real class-based crime against the environment being committed by the monopolies, the bodies of the European Union and the governments of the Member States. In Greece, in Argolida, Crete and numerous other areas, the health of the workers is at permanent risk from the landfills containing toxic sludge that are operating next door to their homes. The solution, as far as we in the Greek Communist Party are concerned, is to reverse the anti-environmental policy of the European Union, in order to safeguard the health of the workers and protect the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, there are certain cities and regions – for example, Naples and Campania – that are a source of shame for those of us who, for the moment, have identity cards issued by the Italian State, a great source of shame that we continue to denounce. On the other hand, there are the virtuous towns of Padania where we have hundreds of mayors, for example, those of the Northern League, who may be ‘barbarian dreamers’, but who are also civilised people who teach citizens and ensure that they sort their rubbish and who organise the collection and incineration of waste. This civilised part of our country is an example for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">So let us move forward in this direction. I welcome the petitions which also inform the European authorities of these situations which, as I have said before, in Campania also pose a threat to European tourists who risk setting foot in those areas.</p>

<p class="contents">We have finally arrived at the vote on this report, which is extremely important because it allows us to raise our fellow citizens’ difficulties and fears in this Chamber before the Commission and the Council. Here is further proof of the effectiveness of the right of petition in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority of petitions are related to the environment and waste represents a major concern for our fellow citizens. This issue must reflect a problem in society. We are consuming left, right and centre. We are only now realising that what we do not consume we throw away. This awareness must absolutely be reinforced among the citizens; this much is clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet this report is also a timely reminder for the Member States. It is nevertheless worrying to see that the States do not seem to be in control of the situation. Only six Member States transposed the framework directive on waste on time. The number of complaints received regarding the issue sometimes shows the lack of transparency in the choice of location for landfill sites.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and this is the most worrying aspect, members of organised crime seem to do as they please. A EUR 75 billion market is very attractive to the greedy. The Member States must send out a strong signal. There must be greater penalties for companies that use public contracts to enhance their own wealth.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is a warning to the Member States, but the European Commission must also play its part and ensure that the directives on waste are properly implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">This dossier needs to be made visible but also credible. If no one plays the game, we will continue to waste time and money on verification and counter-verification procedures which could go on for years. Let us listen to the message from the petitioners and put a stop to this mess as soon as possible.</p>

In my region, as a delegation from the European Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety was able to ascertain, high levels of caesium-137 have been detected. This is typical nuclear waste even though there are no nuclear power plants in Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that this is a Europe-wide problem. There is illegal trafficking of waste that must be monitored and curbed, but which has so far been ignored by the European Commission.

Instead, given that illegal trafficking of waste extends beyond national borders, we need to think about how to deal with this at a European level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we all know that there are far more cases of this type, even if they have not all been brought to the attention of the Committee on Petitions. I personally know of at least one case in Romania which is being investigated at regional level. This situation is a serious indication of the failure by many national governments to enforce this vital legislation for protecting the environment and our citizens’ health. However, the situation regarding waste from mining activities is also just as worrying. I have reiterated my concern on this matter, both within Parliament and directly to the European Commission. The Commission assures us that the Mining Waste Directive contains sufficient provisions to protect the environment, including in connection with mining using cyanide technologies. However, I call on the Commission to answer the following question: what will happen if the Mining Waste Directive is enforced to the same degree as the Waste Management Directive? It does not require too much imagination to realise that the consequences of such a situation would be really disastrous. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If people were obliged to visit landfills that were not working properly, they might think twice about dumping waste and putting it into refuse sacks.

The European Commission should therefore monitor compliance with the waste management directives in the individual countries. The conclusions of the Commission report from the beginning of the previous year showed that several EU countries are not paying proper attention to the protection of the environment and waste management. Dozens of proceedings for breaches of legal regulations and information on hundreds of illegal and thousands of non-compliant landfills are alarming findings and draw our attention to the fact that the Commission is also failing in this area in the enforcement of EU legislation.</p>

They also mean lost jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Much remains to be done in the field of raising the citizens’ awareness about responsible waste management and its resultant benefits. It is important to have greater coordination of waste management at regional and local level, as well as for residents to have easy access to transparent information, not just about how waste should be sorted, but also about what happens to it later.</p>
<p class="contents">In many countries, modernising the waste management system is going to require significant investment. Funding this work should also be one of the Union’s priorities.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kristalina Georgieva, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, I would like to give my most sincere gratitude to the honourable Members for this substantive debate, which reflected the attitudes of our citizens. Let me make the following points.</p>
<p class="contents">First, for the Commission, the number one priority is to put in place the right sequencing of action, namely, first reuse, recycle, recover and, only if that is not possible, go for landfills based on stringent environmental impact assessments. During this process, we naturally look very seriously at the transportation of waste.</p>
<p class="contents">So how do we help the Member States? Through guidance and best practice, but also by scrutinising national management plans to make sure that they are adequate in helping with the problems. For the ten countries with more serious problems, we intend to carry out individual meetings to accelerate action. Obviously, when action falls short, we do not hesitate to start infringement procedures – out of 19 which have been started, nine are still ongoing – and also, as a last resort, to take Member States to the European Court of Justice for breaches of EU waste legislation. May I just stress that one third of the environmental cases concern failure to deal properly with waste management.</p>
<p class="contents">I completely agree that not only should we do the right thing at home, but we should also set the right example for developing countries, because a mountain of waste somewhere else would actually have implications for the status of our planet. I could not agree more with the point that has been made by Members that in these tough economic times, waste reuse, recycling and recovery is an economic opportunity and we should not miss out on a good crisis to grab it.</p>
<p class="contents">There was a specific question on mining waste. After the Baia Mare accident and an international Commission report, we have come up – to the best of my knowledge – with the most stringent directive in the world. We are working very closely with countries, including Romania, to make sure that the directive is respected and implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a point on public awareness. We certainly need to work on that. May I just add that I spent most of my professional career working on the environment. I started because a member of my family got sick – irrevocable damage was caused to his health – because of groundwater pollution. Therefore, I fully share the emotional attitude of our citizens and our Members of Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To some of the latter, I would like to say that comments have been made about the appropriateness or otherwise of holding this debate in the Committee on Petitions, and of referring the matter on from that Committee to this House.</p>
<p class="contents">With your permission, Mr President, I would like to commend and defend the Committee on Petitions as an appropriate setting in which to debate these issues. I say this given that those who submitted petitions, the citizens of the European Union, have addressed the Committee on Petitions. Apart from the fact that citizens can address other committees, such as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and bearing in mind that opinions may be developed and reports drawn up in other committees, I think that when citizens approach the Committee on Petitions, they want us to respond and provide a solution to their problems. Clearly, we cannot look the other way or divert attention. Were we to do so, there would be no point to the work and actions of the Committee on Petitions within the European Parliament or, indeed, to the very existence of that Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I would like to say to certain colleagues that the petitions have referred systematically to the constant deficiencies that occur with waste management and to the real, habitual inability of the Member States to fulfil their legal obligations. This really is the way things are at present. These thoughts and problems have also been included in the report, however, hence the request for the Member States to transpose the Waste Management Directive without further delay, and to guarantee that all its provisions are fully complied with, especially through the establishment and application of comprehensive waste management plans.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr President, I believe that through this report and Ms Georgieva’s own words, a very direct course has been set to try to resolve all the problems that have been outlined by the groups, many problems that are related to this issue, but I also believe that it needs to be emphasised that delaying is not an option, nor can a blind eye be turned, when it comes to resolving the many, many issues and petitions that are being received from countries throughout the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">An analysis of the waste management policies implemented by EU Member States provides very contrasting information. Some Member States, including Romania, are lagging behind in their implementation of waste management strategies and, in this context, the legacy of the past and the excessive dependence on landfills, along with the attitude towards waste disposal, which should be changed, have caused numerous serious breaches of EU legislation to occur. Article 4 of the new Waste Framework Directive specifies a mandatory waste hierarchy: prevention, preparation for reuse, recycling or other forms of reuse, including energy recovery and disposal by means of safe incineration, with landfills as the very last resort.</p>

<p class="contents">The Slovak Republic has long since achieved the objective set out in Directive 2002/96/EC and, since 2010, we have been encountering the problem of an excess over the minimum limit of recycling four kilograms of electrical waste per capita per year, and this is going to rise. During the transition period that Slovakia is in, we will therefore cover the deficiencies that remain among producers and importers or from anonymous electronic sales and, likewise, we will restrict the selection of those who still do not contribute to the funding of waste collection and subsequent treatment.</p>

The Union is moving towards a situation in which waste will stop being a danger to the environment but will instead become an effectively used resource. I think the effort being made in this direction is clearly worthy of praise and support. However, it should be admitted that even the most sincere desire and the most determined action of the EU cannot produce results if the Member States do not express a desire for effective cooperation in this area. Despite the deadline of December 2010 set for transposition of the directive into national law, only six Member States have managed to do this. We in the European Parliament should pay particular attention to the opinion of the Union’s citizens. An expression of this is the number of petitions submitted to the Committee on Petitions – 114 – which call attention to various aspects of waste management which do not comply with EU law. This shows that it is in the interest of the people who live in the EU for the Member States to bring about implementation of the contents of the directive into national legal systems as quickly as possible. Taking into account the interest of the European Union as a whole and of individual citizens, I call upon the Member States to adapt their national legal systems to the contents of the directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, the European Union and, in particular, the European Parliament, must also set standards for environment protection which will be appropriate in a changing economic reality. A definite step forward on this matter was the implementation by the Member States of the Waste Management Directive, the objective of which was to improve and raise the standard of the management, processing and storage of waste. This was imperative in view of the huge amount – over 2 million tonnes – of rubbish processed in the Union every year. However, as is evident from the numerous petitions which are received by the Committee on Petitions and from the fact-finding visits which have been made and which are discussed exhaustively by Mr Iturgaiz Angulo in his report, we can conclude beyond doubt that the objective of the directive has only been achieved in part. For this reason, it is essential that further effort be made by the entire Union to eliminate cases of non-compliance with, or incorrect performance of, the provisions of the directive. In addition, we cannot forget that the ultimate effect of this work in large measure needs the cooperation and commitment of society and requires that those who violate our common good bear responsibility for their actions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
