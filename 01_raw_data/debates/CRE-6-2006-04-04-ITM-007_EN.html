<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vladimír Špidla, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(CS)</span> Ladies and gentlemen, thank you, but I am accustomed to report presentations where the rapporteur speaks first and only then does the Commissioner provide a response. If you have decided to change this practice, however, then I am of course ready to begin.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to begin, ladies and gentlemen, by thanking Mr Őry for an excellent report on a topic that constitutes one of the pillars of European integration. The aim of the transitional measures set out in the Accession Treaty is to enable Member States to work gradually towards achieving, as quickly as possible, the one irrevocable aim of providing all migrant workers from Member States that joined the European Union in 2004 with open access to employment in all Member States. This is one of the basic freedoms enshrined in the Treaty of Rome. As stated in the Accession Treaty, the Commission has assessed the operation of these transitional measures in respect of the initial two-year stage, in order to assist Member States in deciding either to retain the transitional measures or to abandon them. On the basis of the statistical data for 2004 and in some cases also for 2005, and also following consultations with the individual participants, the Commission has produced some specific conclusions relating to the first stage of the transitional period.</p>
<p class="contents">The number of workers registered since accession is generally very low, seldom reaching 1% of the active population of the host country. In addition, it seems that the influx of workers from the new Member States has had a basically positive effect. This is because enlargement has contributed to bringing black economy workers from EU-8 states out of the area of illegality. Accession has also led to a reduction in labour shortages and to improved economic results in Europe. The countries that did not introduce restrictions after May 2004 have recorded stronger economic growth, lower levels of unemployment and higher levels of employment. The workers who have been granted legal access to a labour market have experienced little difficulty in joining the market. It is, of course, only the Member States that can decide whether or not to apply the transitional measures, but the Commission may challenge the Member States to evaluate objectively the advantages and disadvantages of the measures. In reality, it is the second stage that is the actual transitional stage, which will bring us, wholly or at least in part, to the objective of freedom of movement for workers. In this spirit, the Member States implementing restrictions on the basis of the Accession Treaty must not treat nationals from EU-8 states who are already legally residing on their territory in a more restrictive way than nationals from third countries who are long-term residents, as reported in the previous plenary session. A letter explaining this has been sent to interior ministers in order to clarify the legal situation. Some moments ago the rapporteur mentioned this problem of citizens of third countries, so I hope you will allow me to emphasise once again that in the context of the directives and treaties on accession, it is not permissible to treat citizens of third countries who are long-term residents of an EU Member State in a more favourable way than citizens of EU Member States, that is, if there are restrictions applying to EU citizens, these shall logically apply also to citizens of third countries who are long-term residents of the EU Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">For the same reasons the Commission is also monitoring adherence to the provisions that forbid Member States from restricting access to their labour markets for workers from EU-8 states to a greater extent than was the case prior to the signing of the Accession Treaty, that is, prior to 16 April 2003. The Commission is at the same time backing calls for the Member States to apply the Community’s legal regulations scrupulously, especially in the area of posted workers. I acknowledge that we must greatly strengthen statistical monitoring of movements of workers within an EU framework, since there are many hypotheses meriting discussion that are impossible to verify using the existing statistical and analytical resources. The Commission supports proposals from Parliament for reinforcing social dialogue on both a European and a national level, with the aim of upholding the rights of workers from the new Member States. The Commission takes an equally favourable view of raising public awareness of freedom of movement for workers and the associated legislation. The declaration of 2006 as European Year of Workers’ Mobility should contribute to this aim.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the fears expressed over gradual enlargement, freedom of movement for workers has not undermined intrastate labour markets. The free movement of persons is a basic principle applying to all citizens, and any limitation on it whatsoever can only be temporary and must be expressed strictly within the spirit of the treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, in my speech I have once or twice used the term ‘new Member States’<span class="italic">.</span> It must be said that the new states of Central Europe have a history almost as long as the states of other parts of Europe, and with the enlargement of the European Union they are now Member States. Therefore I would like to state that I will not be using the term ‘new Member States’ again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As stipulated in the Accession Treaties, Member States – based on their own experiences with the labour market – will lift these restrictions gradually between 2004 and 2011, and the European Commission and European Parliament will also evaluate the situation, in the light of the experiences of the Member States. The position of the European institutions carries a political message, and it is primarily meant to clarify, for the over 450 million citizens of the European Union, the pan-European interest in the extremely important issue of the movement of workers. In other words: what is the interest of the European Union as an important player in world politics and world economy? This logic of keeping European interests in mind was decisive in the course of the preparation of the report. The only possible starting point for the evaluation of the current situation was the analysis of the global challenges faced by the European Union at the beginning of the 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect it is sufficient to refer to the fact that our economic competitors in South-East Asia are speeding up both in the area of industrial production and in that of research, development and innovation. If we want to increase our competitiveness to keep up with both America and Asia, we must find a solution to the structural tensions in European economies.</p>
<p class="contents">The solution is unequivocal: we must increase mobility within the European Union, and we must encourage, with all available means, the creation of a single European labour market, which should be as flexible as possible. There are, of course, alternative solutions to increasing mobility (we can also talk about speeding up immigration and other similar measures), but the common denominator of such alternatives is that their social cost is immeasurably higher, while their efficiency is much lower. The road to economic development – in line with the Lisbon Strategy – leads primarily through the increase of mobility and the utilisation of the occupational reserves represented by the inactive population. This is the only way of preserving the social achievements that are so dear to European citizens, and of which we talk so often.</p>
<p class="contents">An important step within the process of increasing mobility is to lift the transitional restrictions affecting new Member States, as soon as possible. Several Member States already agreed to do this in May 2006, and we can only hope that in the course of the following years – perhaps even before May 2009 – other Member States will follow them, because it is important to emphasise that the legal possibility for the other Member States to make a similar decision is always available.</p>
<p class="contents">The fears concerning mass migration have proved to be groundless. Experiences have unequivocally shown that the presence of workers from new Member States in the old Member States who decided to open their markets fully in 2004 has not caused labour market or economic tensions. On the contrary! The assessment of both the European Commission and one of the affected governments – the British Government – has proved that the migration of a restricted extent from new Member States has brought economic advantages to the recipient countries. Therefore, the conclusion is clear: the most advantageous course of action for the European Union and its Member States is for the affected governments to lift the system of transitional measures restricting free employment within the Union, as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We also submitted proposals for compromises with the report. These were prepared taking into account the special sensitivities of a few Member States concerning this important issue, because, as our experiences have shown, in some Member States the speedy implementation of the free movement of work force is not only hindered by economic difficulties, but often by political, sociopsychological or communication difficulties, too. The compromise proposals are also examining the issue in view of the pan-European interest, trying to take into account the aspirations and sensitivities of both old and new Member States. Therefore, we hope that the report, in this form, will receive the widest support during the vote of the Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for your attention, and I would like to thank all my colleagues, the political groups and the European Commission for their cooperation. It is not a coincidence that the content of the introduction given by Mr Špidla has significantly relieved me of having to present the report in detail. We mostly think along the same lines, and our experiences are similar. I trust that this will remain so in the future, too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We, in Europe, owe the prosperity that we enjoy to the four freedoms that we have entrenched in the European Union. The free movement of workers forms an integral part of this. It now seems to me that fear has dominated the enlargement process in the old Member States and that fear of being elbowed out from the labour market, which is, or was, already under pressure, has led to restrictions in the free movement. I have always taken the view that decisions should not be taken on the basis of fear and that we would have served our own interests much better had we opened up this labour market from the word go. This is also evident from the results of the studies carried out in the United Kingdom and Sweden, although it should be noted that, in the United Kingdom, social security is not implemented in the way we would like it to be.</p>
<p class="contents">What is this fear about? People fear being pushed out of the labour market, and in order to prevent this from happening, borders are closed, yet nothing could be further from the truth. Many arrive in our Member States and graft many hours for little pay. They are badly housed, set up their own one-man bands and compete with our small and medium-size enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">What should the answer be? Rather than resort to fear, the answer should be to open up the borders and make sure that proper checks are in place to monitor, not whether minimum wages are paid, but rather whether wages and working conditions as they have been laid down in the collective bargaining agreements are adhered to, and the conditions of safety at work as well. That is a welcome development in new and old Member States alike. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the initiative of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, a draft Parliamentary resolution was drawn up, which the Committee approved on 21 March by an overwhelming majority. For the preparation of the report thanks are due especially to Mr Őry. The central feature of the resolution is the call to scrap the current transitional measures. Immediately after approval the amendment proposals began to come in, aimed at removing this prospective message from Parliament. It is remarkable how every one of the proposals begins with the words ‘I support the free movement of workers, but …’. I therefore take the view that Parliament should approve the same version that has been approved by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you that both employers’ groups and the European Trade Union Confederation are requesting that the transitional measures be scrapped immediately. I am aware that some governments have not done so, and those that have done deserve our thanks. In response to the complaints we have heard today in speeches on the poor state of the European Union, I would like to say that neither the American nor the Chinese way should be models for us and that following the major crisis in Asia some years ago many states over there are thinking of developing the sort of structures that some persons here today are seeking to demolish. It would therefore be a very good thing for us to realise that the path to prosperity leads neither through Chinese-style wage levels nor through the sort of industrial relations that prevail in the United States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, the free movement of persons is one of the four fundamental freedoms of the single market and every European Union citizen’s right. Recognition of that right requires transitional periods to be lifted at the earliest opportunity. This does not imply promoting mass movements across the European Union. A distinction should be made between movements triggered by the need to seek employment and the free movement of persons which is a citizen’s right.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the report rightly points out the benefits gained by countries that did not impose transitional periods and opened up their labour markets immediately. This is in line with the European Commission’s view. It would, however, also be appropriate to consider how the free movement of people can either threaten or benefit the countries of origin of the citizens involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it is important that Member State citizens should not be discriminated against in favour of third-country nationals on the European Union’s labour markets. Of course, this does not imply that we are indifferent to the interests of third-country nationals or that we do not wish to express solidarity with them too.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the free movement of persons should be deemed a key feature of the European social model. Bearing in mind that Mr Őry’s report and the position of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs comply with the aforementioned criteria, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will vote in favour of the report. We would also like to thank Mr Őry for his work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">According to the German newspapers, the government had decided against allowing cheap workers into the country on the grounds that it wanted to protect its own labour market from an influx of cheap migrant labour from the neighbouring countries, but that is a load of nonsense; the transitional periods do not keep the migrant workers out. They come all the same and work either on the black market or making themselves out to be self-employed. The transitional rules are forcing people to work outside the law and thereby to become even cheaper labour and the object of brutal exploitation without the protection of labour law, without social security and without the certainty of actually being paid.</p>
<p class="contents">Outside the law’s protection, people have no rights. There is even greater pressure on wages in vulnerable areas and in the labour markets affected, for wages agreements have no effect on the black market, which operates according to its own rules and cannot be monitored. Those governments that still hold to transitional periods are encouraging people to work outside of the law and on its fringes, thereby doing much more damage to social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">If workers are to be enabled to avail themselves of their rights, then their employment needs to be put on a legal footing. Greater transparency brings with it better monitoring of labour markets. We must organise the European market in its <span class="italic">de facto</span> existing form on the basis of ‘equal pay for the same work under the same conditions in the same place’, thereby giving national and regional wage negotiations added weight and the same social rights to all. What that means, for the German Government for example, is that it must, without further ado, extend the Posting of Workers Directive to all vulnerable areas, for we know that, in Germany and Austria, the transitional periods for the services sector are dependent on those applicable to freedom of movement. The only really effective protection against things going wrong on the labour market is pro-active measures to bring it into order.</p>

It also constitutes discrimination, since the free movement of persons is a fundamental right guaranteed under Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">As is well known, this is a freedom that has existed for workers since the foundation of the European Community in 1957. That millions of people within the European Union should, in 2006, have ceased to enjoy that right is intolerable. In the course of the enlargement process, socially committed people of the Left – such as the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, for example – in the European Parliament insisted over and over again on the conditions being created that would enable, on the accession of new Member States, workers to be allowed freedom of movement without detrimental effects on society.</p>
<p class="contents">People in both the old and new Member States are meant to benefit from enlargement, but instead we keep coming back to the issue of global competition. Whilst it was demonstrated, in the Scandinavian countries, that free movement does much to protect existing social standards, the federal government in Germany has extended the transitional periods without giving any indication whatever of what it intends to do with it by way of actually giving workers freedom of movement.</p>
<p class="contents">Fundamentally, my group agrees with Mr Őry that we do not actually need any transitional periods at all, but this report is scarcely likely to promote awareness of the need for greater social responsibility on the European labour market. Our group’s amendments to this end have so far been largely ineffective.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to argue in favour of the freedom of movement being given to all workers living in the EU with immediate effect and of the introduction of social standards and minimum wages that keep people out of poverty. Combating poverty must become an absolute political priority in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The majority of governments, in continuing to restrict the number of workers from the new Member States, are in fact struggling with more serious problems concerning immigration from non-EU countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The partial opening of the labour market, for example, to construction workers, doormen and waiters, as France has proposed, does not testify to a readiness for the European fundamental freedoms. It is, instead, testimony to the low prestige of these professions, since unemployment among French youth is very high. This selective opening of the professional market, however, to a labour force with low qualifications means that this will be an incentive for many qualified workers to leave the new Member States, to change profession and immediately earn a higher salary. In the long term, however, this will weaken Europe’s competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I call on those young French people who are protesting, disappointed in their government because of its discriminatory legislation against them, to come to the new Member States and to launch careers there.

I thought the EU was all about the free movement of goods, services and labour. What do we find? When the ten new Member States joined in 2004, they did not get parity. Only three Member States of the previous EU of 15 admitted their workers without restriction: Ireland, Sweden and the United Kingdom. This becomes very odd when you consider that these are three of the most reluctant EU Member States. Ireland rejected the Nice Treaty the first time and only accepted it later due to impressive gerrymandering in a second referendum. Sweden only joined the EU after a bare 1% majority in its referendum. As for the United Kingdom, you know all about us. None of you exactly welcomed Prime Minister Blair last December, at the end of what you all considered to have been a rotten United Kingdom Presidency. You were right. You even threw out his seven-year budget – his precious rescue attempt – with an overwhelming vote on the Böge report. So I am now in the very happy position of saying to you: do as the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden have done. Never mind transitional arrangements; obey your own rules; open your borders; take your share of, say, Polish workers – in the United Kingdom we have 250 000 of them, and they are not all plumbers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Public acceptance was dependent on the Member States having the right to limit the free movement of labour in line with the conditions prevailing on their own labour markets. It was asserted in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs that the failure of massive migratory flows to manifest themselves meant that the transitional arrangements guaranteed by treaty had to be abolished forthwith.</p>
<p class="contents">To that I say that the situation as experienced in such Member States as Germany, Austria or France is quite different. Wherever markedly higher rates of pay per hour apply, and wherever social security is guaranteed, there you will find migrants, and they need to be controlled, with illicit working and fictive self-employment being prevented. The effect of continued flows of migrants to countries with high unemployment is neither to create new jobs nor to make businesses more competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though this report is only an appeal rather than being legally binding, it could be misused to put certain countries in the dock, to whip up sentiment against them and to mount campaigns calling on consumers to boycott goods from them. That has indeed, already happened. Those who try to drive a wedge between the old Member States and the new ones imperil the concept of the EU being more than just a free trade area.</p>
<p class="contents">I have helped to put forward some compromise amendments and am grateful to Mr Őry, our rapporteur. Let there, then, be consideration of the curtailment of the transitional regulations, but let it be done on the basis of detailed analyses of the national labour markets. Regulations should also be drafted to ensure that workers from the new Member States are not put at a disadvantage vis-à-vis those from third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need is for decisions to be properly thought out. Global competition demands of all the EU’s Member States that they create the conditions for it, by, for example, reforming their social security systems.

The restrictions on the free movement of workers have some harmful effects, including the expansion of illegal work. Just in the last few months, Polish workers have been discovered in France, living in hovels, malnourished, unpaid and with no care – they had been brought to the country by a German sub-contracting company. Ironically, these workers were involved in building a law court. Where is the justice in that? Such cases are quite unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The free movement of workers must form one of the factors for promoting social progress, one of the tools for creating a barrier to social dumping. The end of the transitional arrangements will force employers to provide their employees with decent living conditions in accordance with social legislation in the host country. Social protection, decent housing, a decent salary, fair working hours – those are the basic rights that this freedom of movement should provide, and we will ensure that it does so. We cannot accept a situation where some employers exploit the different nationalities of their employees to reduce their operating costs, in the same way as others play the stock market. Let us remember that the founding European project aims to unite populations, not to divide them. If we continue to restrict the free movement of workers, we will only feed the fears of citizens in certain Member States, who are terrified at the idea of being treated as second-class European citizens. And you are right, Commissioner, we now need to talk in terms of European citizens. These restrictions must be fully lifted. It can be done, but the checks need to be strengthened so that the first beneficiaries of this measure do not become its first victims. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I congratulate the rapporteur for preparing a very balanced report. The free movement of labour is not just one of the fundamental rights of the European Union, but is an expression of the solidarity between the old and new countries. Therefore, I am pleased to see that all of my colleagues show unanimous support for the abolition of the restrictions. As we react to the challenges of today's global economy, I believe that the abolition of obstacles to the movement of citizens and labour in the European Union's market is one of the main goals of the Lisbon Strategy and one of the factors stimulating economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">With their accumulated human capital, the active workers from the new European Union Member States have the ability to stimulate long-term economic growth. Moreover, the market may become more effective, as foreign workers usually react more actively to the regional differences of economic opportunities. Having admitted workers from the new states, Ireland, the United Kingdom and Sweden only benefited. The aforementioned Member States are noted for rapid economic growth, reduced unemployment and increased employment compared to other states. In addition, it can be concluded that citizens of the new Member States have complemented, but not replaced citizens of the old Member States in the labour markets of the latter. Statistical data from European Union Member States indicates that immigration from third countries exceeds the flow of immigration in the heart of the European Union. We should congratulate and rejoice in the decision of those countries which have decided to open their labour markets to the new European Union countries from May this year. I would say: shame on the governments of Austria, which is holding the EU Presidency, and Germany, for their phobias, for their inability to discuss this matter with their own citizens. But of course, the opening of labour markets is the sovereign right of every state. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As many have said, equality of treatment is a key principle for European citizens, which should apply to employment conditions and access to services within our Member States across the Union. However, in a debate where we are talking about third-country nationals, it is crucial that we are also very clear – as the rapporteur has been – that we are not talking about rolling back the hard-won rights of those individuals, but extending the rights to which our new Member States are entitled.</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard a number of arguments over the past few months in favour of maintaining transitional periods. Many of us here do not find them convincing. We believe that what we are seeing is – as has already been mentioned – evidence of irregular employment and false claims about self-employment. I am willing to bet that in all our countries we have a number of Member States’ citizens in unclear situations.</p>
<p class="contents">When the UK introduced its worker registration scheme for nationals of the A8 countries, it found that 40% of the Polish people who registered were already in the UK. I believe that is evidence that people want to work legally. We need to encourage them to do that. We need better information in advance, more effort on inspection and supporting whistle-blowers, and greater clarity about people’s rights, so we do not see the exploitation that Mr Cottigny has referred to, which threatens to undercut working conditions and exploits individuals. It is much easier to demand equality of treatment when you have clear rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The UK – as has been said – has opened access, with certain shifts on social security. We have had a range of workers, of all skill levels. We found no discernible statistical evidence of an increase in social benefit claims. The economic impact is seen to be modest, and the numbers started slowing towards the end of last year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In its initial version this document already rightly indicated that the impossibility of being legally employed in the majority of the so-called old Member States fosters irregular employment and the exploitation of workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Őry also appropriately highlights the fact that in certain European Union Member States more restrictions are currently imposed on the movement of workers from the new Member States than was the case when the Treaty on Accession was signed. He also points out that there are issues concerning preferential treatment for so-called long-term resident third-country nationals to the detriment of Union citizens from the 10 new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the report’s author clearly states that there have been no negative social or economic consequences for the countries that have already opened up their labour markets. On the contrary, the reduction of the irregular employment of foreigners has resulted in additional income for national budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Őry’s initial draft was also presented to Parliament’s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for discussion and a subsequent vote, and the draft was improved considerably by this process. This is particularly true of paragraph 1. In the version tabled by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Parliament comes out clearly in support of the citizens and their right to the fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly believe that this is the stance the European Parliament must adopt. The House should make a clear and unequivocal statement defending fundamental rights and freedoms. It should stand up for the Community’s interests and for the interests of all European Union citizens, over and above specific national concerns. That is why I am of the opinion that we should support the text that arose as a result of the debate and vote within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I greatly respect Mr Őry, and will say to him quite frankly that I well understand why he, and many other Members of this House, endorses the Commission’s line, but perhaps I might also say that it was the Czech minister of labour, among others, who announced, as long ago as the end of last year, that even his own country was giving thought to the possibility of making transitional periods for worker mobility applicable to Romania and Bulgaria.</p>
<p class="contents">In contrast to the United Kingdom, Sweden and Ireland, Germany’s unemployment rate is running at 12% rather than a mere 5%. We have a country with 18% unemployment right on our own doorstep. I am sure it is understandable that that fact cannot do other than cause many workers to worry about their own jobs, and it is surely only right that a government should try to take that into account, particularly when one bears in mind the fact that Germany has already, in percentage terms, given the most work permits to citizens of the new Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It would appear, though, that protection from social dumping is intended to benefit only the select few in Europe, for how else is one to understand the restrictions on the free movement of workers? Those who bar certain people from the market must know that they can expect, as a quite natural response to their action, the coming into being of illegal markets. People who live near to a border between states will not be prevented from offering their labour on either side of it, and so, over recent years, whole new categories of workers are putting themselves on the streets, with artisans and building workers offering their services, and this is proving to be a successful game for them; they are much in demand. People are working under the pretence of being self-employed or, quite simply, illegally, without social security and for less than the minimum wages laid down by law.</p>
<p class="contents">How mendacious, then, of people such as the representatives of the German building trade, to demand – or so we read – that the transitional periods be extended! Why is it that some employers’ representatives want these discriminatory restrictions imposed on the citizens of other Member States? Is it not, perhaps, that they are thereby enabled to make money from cheap seasonal labour, from the putative self-employed, and from those working in the black market? Why, too, I wonder, do the national employers’ representatives not campaign with more energy against this sort of exploitation? Why do they make social security dependent on nationality? Might it not be that they do so out of the simple desire for mass appeal, since it is only the citizens of their own country who cast votes, so that what matters to them is not the principle itself but their own success on election day?</p>
<p class="contents">Three countries so far have opened up their labour markets to the EU’s new Member States, and their experiences of it have been positive. I call, in this Year of Mobility, on all the others to do likewise by 2007 at the latest.

The rapporteur, Mr Őry, has handled this topic skilfully, without causing division among the Member States. In his report, he focuses on the real effects of citizens from the new Member States entering the labour markets of the fifteen old Member States. He supports the premise that it is not the Member States and their interactions that pose the real problem to European competitiveness, but rather external competitors such as India and China.</p>
<p class="contents">The report considers the following facts: firstly, workers from the new Member States nowhere exceed 2% of the host country population; secondly, internal migration within the old Member States is four times greater than internal migration from the new Member States and, thirdly, migration from third countries significantly exceeds total internal migration within the EU. There is no doubt that, in addition to the German, Austrian and French attitudes to the transitional period, divergent opinions also exist among the new Member States, as the transitional period has gradually become a sensitive political issue there as well.</p>
<p class="contents">We adopted the transitional measures during the accession talks, as part of the deal. As time goes by, however, this has become a sensitive issue in the politics of the old Member States, which are increasingly perceived as discriminatory. Discussions over the Services Directive have already revealed absurd situations in connection with transitional periods and now, with regard to Directive 109, it also appears that a legal conflict has arisen with the preferential rules clause. The fears generated by job insecurity and prejudice undoubtedly represent political capital that can be readily used. Instead of propagating this myth, however, which in fact leads to a political impasse, it should be the responsibility of politicians to tell the truth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Colleagues from certain states are criticising the report, but the majority are finding this objective report very helpful indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">When new Member States are fighting for equal rights, this is more than just a simple fight for equal treatment: it protects the interests of the entire European Union.

That was shown to be absurd. But the same fear nevertheless arose once again with the accession of the new Member States and, unfortunately, despite the fact that in that case, at that time, some of us in the Spanish Parliament opposed it, even the Spanish Government of that time — at the time of accession — agreed to those transitional periods, partly due to pressure from other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We have now seen that that makes no sense, that that fear is entirely irrational and that we cannot allow one of the fundamental freedoms in the European Union to be pushed to one side for a period of time, for purely populist reasons or through fear of how certain societies may react. We cannot have first-class and second-class States within the European Union and we must therefore put an end to these transitional periods and open up the borders of the European labour market entirely, turning it into a genuine internal labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore entirely support the Öry report, which draws attention to this issue and to the situation being faced by the citizens of those States, who in some cases are in an even worse situation than citizens of third countries who are legally resident in the Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate the Spanish Government on having finally decided to agree to the lifting of that transitional period and I hope that, as soon as possible, other States will accept this initiative, in order to create equal conditions for all of the citizens of the European Union, and this House must therefore apply pressure in that direction.</p>

Of course, the efficient operation of the internal market is based upon the free movement of capital, goods, services and workers. The free movement of capital and goods has been implemented relatively successfully. We have, however, encountered great difficulties with regard to the free movement of services and workers.</p>
<p class="contents">We have planned that the European economy should flourish with the Lisbon Strategy. We are constantly hearing about the importance of competition and adopting measures against protectionism – but how well is this working in practice? As far as capital and goods are concerned, some countries are particularly consistent in their advocacy of competition and are even opening their markets to cheap goods from Asia. But those who constantly lecture us on the importance of competition and the drawbacks of protectionism as regards goods and capital are at the same time closing their service and labour markets. Is that not protectionism?</p>
<p class="contents">2006 has been designated the European Year for Workers’ Mobility and, yet, it is in this very year that some Member States are planning to extend their transitional periods. So, I ask you, how are we supposed to explain that to the citizens of the European Union? With a great deal of difficulty. On the other hand, it is plain to see that all those who have opened up their markets are making progress and their economic development is noteworthy.</p>
<p class="contents">Any country which decides to further close its labour market must do so, in my view, on a rational basis and acting as an individual, rather than as part of a bloc of countries. If we want the European Union to be able to compete successfully with other states, it must fully implement in its internal market the free movement of capital, goods and services as well as the free movement of workers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To be sure, their abolition could make unregistered work within the labour market more difficult, but it certainly will not cause the regulatory pressure on wages and in the social sphere to disappear. That would, indeed, become an even bigger problem. If, then, it proves impossible to enact accompanying measures to protect workers, such as, for example, a substantially improved Posting of Workers Directive along with the machinery to monitor and implement it, the only result will be even greater pressure on the labour markets in Germany and Austria. I can still find no evidence of usable accompanying measures from the Commission, and it is all very well for you to laugh, Commissioner!</p>
<p class="contents">It may well be that the majority in this House will accept the Commission’s and Mr Őry’s reports, thereby indicating a complete lack of concern about Germany’s and Austria’s positions and interests, so: away with the transitional periods! As a parliamentarian, I have to accept what the majority says – that much is abundantly clear – but, while it may well be all the same to you, the Commissioner for social affairs, that you are thereby further fuelling anti-European sentiment in our countries, it is certainly not a matter of indifference to me! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that some 30 speakers from many different parties want to contribute to this debate is confirmation of that.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people have already referred to the basic four freedoms of the EU. Amongst those freedoms, the freedom of movement of people is perhaps the most important. Half a century ago Jean Monnet said of one of the key missions of the EU: <span class="italic">‘Nous ne coalisons pas les États, nous unissons les hommes’</span>. That was absolutely right then, it is absolutely right now. That is what we should be doing: uniting the people.</p>
<p class="contents">Mention has been made of the fears of some Member States. I do not think we should criticise Member States for having those fears: it is understandable. However, alongside those fears are facts and the facts should put the fears into context. The fact is that such immigrants who have come from central and eastern Europe into the UK, Sweden and Ireland have not been a drain on the economy, but a benefit to it. The problem has not been the legal immigration into our countries, but the illegal immigration to other countries that has propelled the growth of the black economy. The people who are afraid of the problem should be mindful of the fact that this is a much bigger problem than opening up borders at this stage.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that there are already three further countries – Spain, Portugal and Finland – which have said that they will be removing the barriers. I should like to ask the Commissioner to use his great personal authority as well as that of the Commission to encourage Finland to maintain this issue as a very high point on its agenda in its forthcoming Presidency and to report back at the end of its Presidency on the progress it has made so that it can inspire others to follow its example.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, I hope that we will all inspire others with a strong vote later this week. I hope we can say to new Member States ‘there are no second-class citizens in Europe’ and to old Member States ‘it is time to open your borders and open your minds’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The temporary transitional arrangements that a number of countries – including my own, Denmark – have chosen to introduce in relation to Eastern European workers must be cancelled as quickly as is reasonably possible. </p>
<p class="contents">The transitional arrangements must not unnecessarily hamper freedom of movement, and we must demonstrate solidarity and openness towards all Europeans. The rules must therefore be made flexible so that all unnecessary barriers are removed. However, the transitional rules must only be abolished once we have made sure that people travelling here from Eastern Europe are not being exploited. The transitional rules in Denmark serve as protection against exploitation and ensure that workers receive the wages provided for by collective agreements. Eastern European labour is too often exploited by employers who pay wages significantly below the norm and allow their employees to work under miserable conditions. </p>
<p class="contents">We have a responsibility to defend workers’ freedom of movement, which is a fundamental right in the EU. However, it is also our responsibility to defend employees’ conditions and to guarantee that everyone receives proper wages and enjoys proper working conditions. The transitional conditions were, and are, an attempt to attend simultaneously to both considerations. </p>
<p class="contents">We have no minimum wage in Denmark. The transitional rules have therefore made it possible to monitor the influx of workers from Eastern Europe so that efforts could be concentrated on those employers who have tried to circumvent the rules governing wages and working conditions. </p>

We now need to complete the implementation of the four freedoms that form the basis of the internal market. The free movement of workers still needs to be implemented and, to that end, it is vital to lift the restrictions imposed when the new Member States acceded as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">This distrust is misplaced, because we can see that, in the 15 countries where the restrictions have been lifted, there have been no massive influxes. Surprisingly, only 2% of European citizens work outside their country, whereas a third of Americans live in a state other than the one in which they were born. The invasion is nothing but a fantasy, and the mobility of workers is a challenge. Mr Őry's report sets the objective of lifting the restrictions by 2009, and I support this objective. The French Prime Minister has also indicated that France would anticipate this movement by lifting these restrictions in a gradual and controlled manner.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution adopted by the European Trade Union Confederation in December 2005 opens up paths that reconcile the opening up of borders with appropriate protection. The amendments adopted by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs go down this route, in order to ensure that employment law is applied in the Member States, specifically to ensure that Community standards are implemented, in particular those in the posting of workers directive, and in order to look into the creation of a European centre to coordinate the inspection services of the Member States. By producing standardised statistics on Community migration, we will be able to set up the toolkit for a social Europe within the Union, which will confirm that the free movement of workers must not be synonymous with dumping or the lowest common social denominator, but must be a factor in the economic dynamism that will enable us to iron out pockets of under-employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stephen Hughes (PSE). –</span></span>   Mr President, I congratulate Mr Őry on producing an excellent report. I should like to make three brief points, the first of which concerns paragraph 1. As it came out of committee, it now calls on Member States to abolish the transitional measures in force. For many that has become the main focus of the report. I know that the rapporteur has felt pressured to table a compromise saying that Member States should consider abolishing those measures and specifically mentioning the three Member States that did not introduce them in the first place. Many in my group support the text as it now stands, feeling that we should be against any continuation of transitional measures. However, in saying that, they are reading it alongside paragraph 14, which says that Member States that continue to use such measures should take all steps to ensure that they do not continue beyond 2009.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns equal treatment. The rapporteur and others here today have made the point forcefully that it is not just a question of making sure that A8 workers have the right to freedom of movement of labour, we have to ensure inspection and enforcement regimes grant them full equal treatment and prevent exploitation in the 15. There have been serious breaches in both the UK and the Republic of Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point relates to Directive 2003/109/EC, referred to by the Commissioner. It grants full access to the Member States’ labour markets for long-term resident third-country nationals. Parliament’s Legal Service has said this poses no danger of creating a situation where third-country nationals have greater access than A8 citizens. The Legal Service points out that Article 11 of the Directive says that Member States ‘may’ restrict equal treatment for third-country nationals in certain cases. Saying that Member States ‘may’ is not the same as saying they ‘must’ or that they ‘will’. The only way to guarantee equal treatment is to end transitional measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If a country, with an eye to its own labour market and its economy, thinks it needs to continue to regulate access to the labour market, then it is perfectly entitled to do so. Here too, the ‘<span class="italic">pacta sunt servanda</span>’ rule applies, and neither the Commission nor this House – perhaps not even a majority in the latter – should venture to exert pressure by making appeals to one country or another. To do so would be, as I see it, to misuse a highly volatile issue to whip up sentiment.</p>
<p class="contents">Where this issue is concerned, I find myself unable to put Germany and Austria in the same bracket as Spain and Portugal. Germany is on the dividing line, and the conditions prevailing in it are quite different from those in the countries of Southern Europe. There is in this House so much talk of subsidiarity, yet suddenly, where the free movement of workers is concerned, Brussels and Strasbourg claim to know better than those on the ground in Germany or Austria. A few months ago, in its coalition agreement, the German Government reiterated its commitment to the transitional periods, and it did so not in jest, but on the basis of facts that have to be treated with respect. My country must continue to regulate access to the labour market for at least the next three years. What arrangements are to apply to the following two, must then be discussed on the basis of the new situation, and action then taken.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, let me point out that it was with this very problem in mind that there were great popular misgivings about the eastward enlargement, and yet we were always able to say: ‘There is nothing to fear; these issues have been regulated by treaty for five or seven years.’ </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On that day, I stood, together with Dr Otto von Habsburg, on the border between Slovenia and Austria and took part in a solemn ceremony. What was being celebrated was the fact that, as Slovenia became a member of the EU, a town that had undergone a post-war division into two parts – one of which came to belong to Austria and the other to Slovenia – was now being reunited.</p>
<p class="contents">The symbolism was clear and, standing there, I felt strongly that people did not feel that they were entering something new but felt that they were being reunited with something of which they had always been a part. That, moreover, is the way things are. The EU’s ten new Member States are ten old countries of Europe. It is just that Communism had kidnapped them for 50 years, and now they are finally reunited with us.</p>
<p class="contents">In the run-up to this reunification, Sweden’s Social Democrats had painted horrific pictures of how our country would be invaded by foreign workers who would dump our wages and exploit our social benefits. I and my party fought in the Swedish Parliament to prevent our country from introducing transitional rules. We wanted the new countries, which had for so long suffered under Communism, now to enjoy the freedoms brought about by EU membership.</p>
<p class="contents">We refused to accept the Social Democrats’ propaganda and demonstrated the nature of real solidarity. We won the battle, and Sweden never introduced any transitional rules. Evaluations carried out now show unambiguously that Sweden has not in the least been exposed to the social dumping invoked by the Social Democrats as a scare tactic. Instead, freedom of movement has only had positive effects on the Swedish economy. The other countries that did not introduce transitional rules have also had the same experience.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say, moreover, that it was with great disappointment that I learned of several countries’ decision to extend their transitional rules. To do so when the scenarios invoked did not materialise is unreasonable. The only correct thing to do is to refrain from introducing transitional rules, and I hope that, in future, Europe will be influenced more by reason than by fear.</p>

However, we also know that this freedom is only valid and fully established only for citizens of the fifteen old Member States, while citizens of the eight new Member States, which became members on 1 May 2004, are subject to the provisions of the transition period and this transition period may last as long as seven years in accordance with the 2+3+2 year formula. As if this were not enough, according to certain EU directives, in some cases, long-term residents from third countries enjoy rights, which give them a more privileged status than citizens of the eight new Member States, to live and enter the labour market in fifteen EU Member States. And this means that by demonstrating solidarity with workers from third countries, we are discriminating against workers from the new EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As the first transition period ends on 30 April, we have a perfect opportunity to evaluate its consequences and effects on the economies of both the fifteen old Member States and the eight new Member States and to make appropriate decisions. True, we lack statistical data on immigration in the heart of the Community. It is difficult to come to objective conclusions, but today, it is already obvious that immigration from third countries greatly exceeds the flow of immigration at the heart of the EU, that is in the fifteen old Member States and the whole of the enlarged EU. It is also obvious that the countries which opened their labour markets to citizens of the new countries have really only benefited, while the transition periods encourage illegal work, unfair working conditions, discrimination against and exploitation of migrant workers. I am convinced that the European Parliament must encourage Member States to abolish the provisions of the transition period currently in force, as there are more than enough reasons to do this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is appropriate to pose a key question, namely should labour markets be opened when there are job vacancies and a shortage of indigenous workers, in other words a shortage of people willing to work? Allow me to reiterate. I referred to a lack of people willing to work, not to the unemployed. Alternatively, should labour markets be opened up so as to generate economic growth, which will lead to the creation of new jobs? My convictions and experience to date indicate that opening up the labour market of a given country will generate economic growth and new jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">We should bear in mind that increased employment and job creation will only be possible if we introduce genuine economic reforms, not just cosmetic changes. Entrepreneurs need to be convinced of the need for such reforms, but above all we must win over the trade union sector. Although these changes tend to be painful in the short term, they have a positive effect in the medium and long term.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now move on to a very opportune question, as we are involved in negotiations at WTO level. To what extent and at what pace should world trade be liberalised so as to achieve economic growth within the EU and create new jobs? We would then avoid becoming simply an area where imported goods are consumed, with limited capacity for production.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is important to prepare for flexibility and mobility of the labour force. I believe that resources from the national and Union budgets must be devoted to reskilling and training for new occupations. At present it seems that despite high unemployment, we lack skilled workers …</p>

Allow me to add to the debate one further strand that has not received mention. A transitional period has formed part of every enlargement of the EU, and every enlargement has been dominated by major fears, and these fears have, in every instance, failed to materialise.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the current Accession Treaty therefore provides for a gradual system made up of several stages, designed so that the final stage, in 2011, will be as short as possible. I am therefore delighted to be able to say now that, from 1 May this year, Europe will be making significant progress towards complete freedom of movement for workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like once again to thank you for a debate that has been very serious, very far-reaching and often very sharp – just as befits this serious topic.</p>

The free movement of workforce is one of the most important fundamental principles of the European Union, and therefore we must reject any restrictions imposed on it, not only from economic, but also from political considerations.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the statements of the report to the effect that workers coming from third countries should not be granted a more favourable situation than those arriving from EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The discriminating regulations in force contradict the political requirement for the strengthening of the European identity. The knowledge and feeling of belonging to the European Community can only be strengthened in citizens of new Member States if Member States provide equal rights in the area of employment and access to social benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the proposal calling on the Commission, the Member States, the social partners and the competent bodies of the private and public sector to develop a fair and transparent procedure to ensure that citizens of new Member States can work in all Member States of the European Union without discrimination, for appropriate wages, and with the provision of acceptable health and safety conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Since statistical data clearly show that employing workers arriving from new Member States is not disadvantageous for old Member States, and on the contrary, it actually contributes to their economic development, the antagonism felt by citizens of the fifteen Member States must be reduced by all available means, and the European requirement of the free movement of labour must be laid down in national laws, in accordance with the transitional regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The deadline for the tabling of amendments was yesterday evening at 19.00. In this House we have very strict rules that we must have original signatures for amendments to be tabled, but a whole bunch of my colleagues were held up in transit yesterday, did not arrive until after 19.00 and were therefore unable to sign amendments that had been circulated by the Campaign for Parliamentary Reform, amongst others.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that you will not be able to change the Rule concerned at this particular point in time, but could you please look at it, because in just about every report we have a decent period of time to table amendments, but on the calendar of our sittings we have no time at all.</p>
