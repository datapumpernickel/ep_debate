<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Trafficking in children in Africa</span></p>
<p class="contents">European public opinion has been shaken by the recent news concerning a vessel flying a Nigerian flag carrying 250 child slaves off the coast of Africa and the shocking findings revealed in this connection by UNICEF concerning the alarming increase in the trade in children from Africa and the arduous work performed by children.</p>
<p class="contents">What action does the Commission intend to take in view of these phenomena which bring shame on our civilisation? How does it assess the impact of its policy so far to protect the rights of children in today's world?</p>
<p class="contents">Does it intend to ask for more ample and substantive information on the living conditions of children from the African countries with which it cooperates and to which it grants development and humanitarian aid? What measures does it intend to take in order to protect the rights of children in these countries effectively?</p>
<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 94 by Claude Moraes (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0393_EN.html">H-0393/01</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Child slavery and child labour</span></p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the recent exposure of child slavery in West Africa, particularly within the cocoa industry, can the Commission ensure that it is doing all it can to end this cruelty? How far have the plans developed to introduce voluntary labelling for products not produced by child labour? And what further steps will the Commission take if these voluntary agreements are not enough in the fight to end child labour?</p>
<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 95 by Myrsini Zorba (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0424_EN.html">H-0424/01</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Slave-trade in children in cocoa plantations and the chocolate industry</span></p>
<p class="contents">UNICEF's latest report on the situation of children throughout the world contains appalling information about the trade in and exploitation of children between five and fourteen years of age. It estimates that some 250 million children are sold and exploited throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to draw attention to one particular aspect which concerns European industry: leaving aside prostitution networks, the overwhelming majority of children sold into slavery in Africa end up in cocoa plantations which produce the raw material for the European and international chocolate industry.</p>
<p class="contents">What does the Commission intend to do within the framework of the relevant international agreements and trade with the poor countries of the Third World to put an end to the unacceptable phenomenon of the exploitation of children and the slave trade in minors, a phenomenon which was officially abolished in 1880 but which continues to exist in the third millennium with the connivance of the developed Western countries? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Union has repeatedly condemned such policies and ensures that promoting children's rights is a priority in our relations with the countries concerned. The Cotonou Agreement reaffirms the parties' commitment to internationally-recognised core labour standards as defined by the International Labour Organisation, including child labour.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as trade agreements are concerned, the European Union seeks to raise support among trading partners for respective core labour standards, including child labour. The Commission considers that additional tariff preferences under the scheme of generalised preferences should be considered for countries which effectively apply those standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also finances actions which directly address the issue. Over EUR 1.2 million was allocated to promote children's rights and to protect them from violence and exploitation in Gabon, Benin, Togo and Nigeria. The Commission is also financing a project in Benin that aims to strengthen a brigade for the protection of minors to foster more effective implementation of legislation and to raise public awareness on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Many other activities are undertaken by the relevant international organisations, in particular UNICEF and the International Labour Organisation. A recent positive signal is the likely ratification of the ILO Convention on the prohibition of child trafficking. Several west African countries, including Cote d'Ivoire, should have ratified it by the end of the month. The Commission strongly supports these initiatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to ask you, firstly, how does the European Commission assess this policy? Have you made any fundamental assessments? Do you intend to conduct more in-depth controls, rather than the superficial controls which appear to have been the case in the past?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, will you join with the European Parliament, which has called repeatedly for a political commitment, to be funded from the European Union budget, on an in-depth policy to protect the rights of children in both the European Union and the rest of the world?</p>
<p class="contents">Will the European Union be tabling its own independent proposal in the run up to the summit on children’s rights to be held in September? The cross-party group in Parliament is preparing an event on 29 May with this objective in mind and it would be a good opportunity to formulate a binding proposal on the protection of children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As for an oversight of practice in individual countries, we do, of course, have the possibility of applying the essential elements clauses in our agreements under the Cotonou Agreement in order to try to keep a check on what is happening.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to recognise the multiplicity of reasons for the problem and to recognise the complexity of some of the solutions which are required, which in my judgement go right to the heart of what we often talk about in relation to poverty alleviation as the central part of our development assistance programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">I draw attention, for example, to the UNICEF strategy based on the Convention on Rights of the Child, which in my judgement goes to the centre of this debate. UNICEF strategy focuses on four main areas. First of all, raising awareness about the problem, which we are trying to do. Secondly, providing economic support to families at risk and appropriate social welfare. Again, that is part of our global strategy for poverty alleviation. Next, improving access to and quality of education and finally putting the case for children's rights and training law enforcement officials and judicial authorities. UNICEF offers an extremely convincing analysis and a convincing way forward and I hope along with the contributions made by Members of this Parliament, it will provide us with an intellectual framework for our preparations for the conference later this year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I read in <span class="italic">Le Monde </span>that representatives of the chocolate industry met on 2 May to discuss the question of forced child labour because they are worried about this problem. I think that we should look at the question of ethics and the operating standards of the industry, which is located on European territory and manufactures products based on this unacceptable form of work. Did you follow the debate organised by the International Cocoa Council, the European Cocoa Council, the British trades union in the chocolate industry and the Belgian organisation Caobisco, Commissioner?

It has to be said that if you look at the problem globally there are other industries as well as cocoa and chocolate which one should take account of. I am sure the honourable Member would agree that it would not be sensible for us to try to boycott some products. To boycott particular commodities or products would simply increase problems in some developing countries, which depend very largely on the export of primary products, and would damage a lot of people who are already appallingly impoverished.</p>
<p class="contents">But what I do very much welcome are private and voluntary labelling initiatives, which can help to create premium market access opportunities for developing country producers on a basis of respect for the EC's international obligations and are aimed at the specific promotion of core labour standards. Labelling schemes which are objective, which are transparent and which are non-discriminatory can promote exactly the sort of higher labour standards that the honourable Member supports and that I support as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Those sort of labelling schemes, augmented by technical assistance from the European Union, are an extremely effective way of dealing with the issue of labour standards, not just in relation to the commodities which we are discussing today, but in relation to other commodities as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Dark clouds are nonetheless visible on UNICEF’s horizon because of the decision not to elect the United States to the Commission for Human Rights.

We also know that the issue of sanctions against certain other countries in this region, for example against Liberia, is highly topical. Can the Commissioner assure us that this will not mean reduced support for UNICEF and for work aimed at children? We must have intelligent sanctions.

The potential impact on the situation of women is examined before a decision is taken on the financing of each programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Women are among the primary target groups of the assistance project for the development of NGOs. They had received about EUR 5 million under MEDA by the end of 1999. An important Social Fund programme is in the final stages of preparation. It will finance activities for poor women in rural areas through training and micro-credit schemes. For 2001 we are preparing an education and health infrastructure rehabilitation project and a vocational training reform programme. These projects will have a direct and positive effect on the living conditions and on the employment situation of women.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights has funded several seminars and projects concerning human and economic rights of women in Algeria since 1996. In the year 2000 for example a EUR 1.4 million regional programme was launched in the three Maghreb countries.

<p class="contents">Of course, we condemn any violence, and there have been all too many acts of violence in Algeria, and we also argue strongly for the promotion of women's rights and of individuals' rights in general in Algeria. We have followed developments in this sensitive field with considerable attention. I note that President Bouteflika has himself recently criticised the existing Algerian family law, for example. The European Union within certain limits can certainly aim to act as a catalyst for change through the financing of projects and positive actions as well as through its regular political dialogue with the authorities. The conclusion of an association agreement will make this process easier through the institutionalisation of our bilateral political dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps I can repeat one other thing. We have just had the annual discussions in the Human Rights commission in Geneva. It is a matter of some regret that we found ourselves so often on the opposite side of the argument to Algeria in our espousal of the universal validity of human rights. I hope the association agreement and the dialogue which that will promote will mean that we will have fewer of those disagreements in the future, because we support the development of people's human rights and the protection of their civil liberties everywhere in the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 48 by Mihail Papayannakis (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0322_EN.html">H-0322/01</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Combating poverty in Greece</span></p>
<p class="contents">According to the Commission's Communication (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2000&amp;nu_doc=0594">COM(2000) 0594</a> final), there is a wide gulf between the rich and the poor in Greece, and Greece is also the EU country with the second highest 'persistence of poverty' rate, a fact borne out by the recent Commission report on social cohesion. In section 2.2 on poverty the Commission points out that in Portugal and Greece 21-22% of the population have incomes below the poverty threshold, while in Greece 10% of the population suffer from persistent poverty. Can the Commission say whether the Greek government has notified it – and, if so, when – of specific programmes and action plans to combat the phenomenon of poverty, given that the take-up rate for the previous Greek operational programme in this field was extremely low? Given that Greece also has a very high level of unemployment, almost non-existent provision for training and the lowest education spending in the EU, factors which are directly linked to poverty, does the Commission consider that it is possible meaningfully to address the basic causes of poverty merely by giving social assistance to the poor? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This clearly highlights one very evident fact, that the Greek situation is worse than that of the rest of the countries of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we should highlight one very important fact, and that is that we are only referring to the data for 1995. When we have data on other characteristics and other time periods, we may see a different situation.</p>
<p class="contents">To try to relate the problems of employment and poverty to one single factor is perhaps a mistake. In our opinion, in tackling the problem of poverty, various dimensions should be considered: the general economy, the structural reforms necessary to improve the level of growth and the standard of living, and also the correct use of structural funds and the implementation of specific policies to improve employment. In this respect, employment strategies may help in combating poverty. So can social assistance policies or specific actions aimed at the problem of poverty, such as those stressed at the European Council in Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the Greek government has committed itself to presenting its national action plan against poverty and social exclusion before 1 July 2001, and that plan will be in force for a period of two years. The plan should include information on the concrete policy measures for combating poverty, including those announced recently by the Greek government.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also remember that, with regard to the use of structural funds and in particular in relation to the European Social Fund, there are also certain specific measures for combating poverty and social exclusion, and in this respect some of the operative programmes for Greece and also some of the regional programmes include measures on employment, education, health and welfare. All of this should have a positive effect and change this situation which has been referred to and which of course is the situation as demonstrated by the indicators for 1995. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I more or less agree with what you said, except for your comment that if the rate of growth increases, poverty can be reduced. In Greece, as in other countries, I think, we have seen that it is precisely when there is growth that the gap between the incomes of 20% of the population and the other 80% widens and that is where the problem lies. It is perhaps a good thing that you, rather than the Commissioner for social affairs replied, because this is indeed a question of growth.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that this is where the Commission needs a more joined-up position. Of course, as the Greek government has not sent you its plan, we cannot comment on it. But I would remind you, Commissioner, that its previous plan to combat poverty had a very low take-up rate and very little impact. I therefore hope that we shall discuss this again on the basis of the plan because you too have an important role to play. I imagine that, over and above what you said, the question of taxation and the question of social security also play a very important part in reducing the gap between poverty and wealth, to put it one way.</p>

Your comment is correct and I do not believe that this argument will take us very far. It is true that in Greece the differences between the richest 20% and the poorest 20% of the population are very high in relation to the average.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the Commission’s position? I believe that the Commission has been very clear. Firstly, I believe that growth is important. Within growth, it is essential to increase employment. In order to increase employment, it is not enough to implement measures of a structural nature, such as reducing tax and social costs.</p>

And if we apply the traditional monetary theory, it is clear that those countries with a higher level of inflation, with greater growth, require more restrictive monetary policies in order to prevent processes of overheating. The conclusion can clearly be deduced from the comments I have just made.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem of the exchange rate has given rise to much discussion and debate, given that the exchange rate cannot be modified, being irrevocable, and given that the problem in Ireland would be resolved by a modification of the exchange rate. Higher inflation and, to a certain extent, a re-evaluation of the exchange rate, will not go any way towards resolving its problems. Nor will these approaches help us achieve greater equilibrium in terms of the current account balance.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate is clearly related to the fundamental debate on whether budgetary policy should be expansive or non-expansive, but there is no doubt that, if the argument used by some economic theorists is true, it is also the case that an expansive budgetary policy would force this adjustment by means of a real re-evaluation of the exchange rate to be even more dramatic than it would be in other circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, I will just add that, according to our information, growth is now clearly going to be lower. Inflation is still high, although it is lower than last November, and the budgetary measures of most interest to us in terms of assessing what is happening in Ireland in the future are, without doubt, going to be the saving plan laid down by the Irish Government, the impact of foot-and-mouth disease in Ireland, which is very significant, and, of course, increases in incomes and expenditure, which so far do not correspond with the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as I said before, to draw conclusions in April on the figures for the end of the year seems to me to be far too risky. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that amongst all of us we have established some ground rules. I believe that the fundamental rule is that we must comply with what is agreed. The Commission has the not always pleasant task of pointing out cases of non-compliance with what is agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">In this specific case, the Commission has highlighted that fact, which has also been supported unanimously by the ECOFIN Council. I therefore believe that interference of this type does take place, but we cannot become hostages in this type of situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, does the Commission intend to take the Irish hostage in relation to their decisions? No, the ground rules are very clearly defined in the Treaty. There are general guidelines which have to be respected and those general guidelines include a series of elements of coherence in relation to the general policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Ireland, like other countries, is part of the Monetary Union and the development of interest rates and exchange rates is a problem of interest to all the Member States. We must all therefore behave coherently in terms of the national economic policy we adopt in accordance with the Treaty, but it must also coordinated in accordance with the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Ireland’s relative weight has been debated in this House on previous occasions. I stressed at the time that, from the Commission’s point of view, the rights and duties of all the Member States are the same and, therefore, the economic concept – the economically significant concept – of the different weight of one or other Member State does not have so much importance from a legal or regulatory point or view.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, the Irish government has full room for manoeuvre with regard to making the increases it considers necessary in terms of public investment and improving its services. The problem is that this must respect the broad guidelines of economic policy and the Stability Pact.</p>

<p class="contents">An agreement was reached in Vienna at the end of 1998, on the basis for a Commission proposal which, however, the Member States did not take up. The Commission’s proposal was that, in accordance with Article 111(4) of the EC Treaty, the decision would be taken that the Community would in principle be represented by the Presidency of the euro zone, the European Commission and the European Central Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Member States reached an agreement of a different nature, reducing the validity of this proposal, particularly with regard to the role of the Commission, which was reduced to a kind of support for the Presidency of the euro zone. But these already limited proposals are not being applied in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">In practice, what has so far been achieved is something of an improvement in the coordination of economic policies and, through the Economic and Financial Committee, an exchange of points of view in relation to the positions adopted in the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">This coordination is taking place both in Brussels and in Washington and I believe that it has brought some progress in the process of coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, if you ask me if the Commission is satisfied with this process, I must reply that we are not and nor are we satisfied with the degree of coordination achieved, although we are aware of two limitations: firstly, the International Monetary Fund is made up of States. The Union is not a member of the Fund as such – a factor which causes us some interesting difficulties. Secondly, the Fund itself is currently subject to a review of its statutes, a factor which must also be taken into account in order to make progress on the process of external representation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A representative of the Commission is also present in Washington at the meetings of the Executive Directors of the regions of the European Union or of the constituencies which affect the European Union within the Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commissioner, each time he attends meetings of the International Monetary Fund, which is usually every six months, has bilateral contacts with the Executive Director of the Fund, with whom, furthermore, we enjoy an extremely high degree of cooperation, not only for the euro zone but also for the various regions of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In the euro zone, we have currently accepted the application of the analysis laid down in Article 4 of the Fund, which is produced each year with the International Monetary Fund. For the area outside the euro zone, we have great cooperation with the Fund, not only in the candidate countries, but also in all of those countries where we are implementing systems of macroeconomic aid, since we always do this in cooperation with the Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it is true that the President of the eurogroup represents the euro zone in the Monetary and Financial Committee of the Fund, in the former interim committee. The speeches of the President of the eurogroup are agreed speeches, which include elements of common agreement between all the countries of the euro zone and we would like this to be the seed for something which may have more content and precision in the future.

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 51 by Josu Ortuondo Larrea (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0326_EN.html">H-0326/01</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Trawling for hake</span></p>
<p class="contents">The rules on trawling for hake in the Bay of Biscay allow a minimum mesh size of 70 mm. Given the state of the stock and with a view to improving the pattern of production, it is proposed that the mesh size be increased to 100 mm. This would cut the amount of fish landed by the fleet by 50% for the same level of effort, and would increase the vessels' operating costs owing to the greater effort needed for the same level of catches and the cost of new nets.</p>
<p class="contents">Has the Commission quantified the hypothetical gains in production in the long term? Has it taken account of the phenomenon of post-escape mortality which is common for other species of gadidae and also affects hake? Has it taken into account that increasing mesh size entails a greater degree of effort to land the same level of catches, giving rise to a parallel increase in post-escape mortality and in the operating costs of the fleet? Has it considered the likely cost of the new nets and what measures might be put in place to aid the fleet's transition to new mesh sizes? Would it not be more appropriate to start by guaranteeing strict compliance with the current rules before making any changes to the rules on technical measures? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are a number of academic reports, especially those by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea from last November, that were confirmed at the beginning of this year by the Commission's Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries. All of these reports indicate that stocks of hake in the Bay of Biscay and southwest of the Irish coast are on the brink of collapse. The main problem for the stocks here is the large number of juvenile fish caught. The number of mature fish is declining constantly and it is to be feared that they are no longer producing sufficient young for stocks to be able to recover.</p>
<p class="contents">One possible way of reducing catches of juveniles is to use nets with a larger mesh size. Using nets with 70 mm mesh, hake of around 25 cm and upwards in length are caught. 100 mm mesh nets, on the other hand, catch hake measuring 40 cm or more. The planned regulation does not demand that all hake must be caught using nets with a mesh size of 100 mm or more. We have deliberately made exceptional provisions in clearly designated areas for vessels of less than 12 metres in length fishing on a day-trip basis and for vessels that catch crayfish. This exception applies to around 1500, or in other words a total of two-thirds of all vessels for which hake is the primary catch or a by-catch.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware that increasing the size of the mesh entails short-term losses as regards catch weight. However, unless such a measure is introduced stocks will not be able to recover to an extent that permits sustained fishing. Scientific research has proved moreover that by increasing mesh size to 100 mm, while maintaining current fishing effort, yields will increase in the long term by at least 70%. Of course fishermen will need a certain amount of time to re-equip their vessels with the new nets, and we will give them until August 1 of this year to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">Those fishermen who want to continue operating with a mesh size of less than 100 mm – and this is also possible – then any by-catch of hake may not exceed 20% of the total catch. This is intended to create an incentive to fish with larger-mesh, more selective nets.</p>
<p class="contents">Now let me answer your question regarding whether it is possible to obtain aid for purchasing new nets. Later in the year we want to present a long-term recovery plan to the European Parliament and the Council. As soon as this proposal has been approved by the Council, the Member States will be able to grant retrospective compensation to their fishing vessel owners in accordance with the provisions of Article 16(2) of the structural regulation. Such a possibility is unfortunately not provided in the framework of the emergency regulation. I too view this as a major flaw and have ordered steps to be taken so that the structural regulation can be adjusted in this regard as rapidly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">And now, let us turn to the argument that hake is very sensitive and that some of the juvenile fish escaping from the nets ultimately die anyway. I will be quite frank with you here. Our experience has shown that over a longer period a larger mesh size means more adult fish. This is what it is primarily at issue here, namely to enable stocks to recover for reproduction. And this, ultimately, will be the best proof that this measure is a sensible one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now, the information I receive from fishermen confirms that these vessels, although small, fish with very long nets, and that, furthermore, catches of langoustine also include a great number of young hake, because the areas of distribution of langoustine and of young hake, which are the fishing areas in question, overlap very considerably.</p>

Let me make it quite clear: what I said was first of all that there is to be an exception for vessels of less than 12 m in length – and not those longer than 12 m – with regard to the 100 millimetre nets. There is an additional condition that these should be small vessels fishing on a day-trip basis. Second, an exception is to be made for vessels that fish for crayfish.</p>
<p class="contents">As to your question concerning the very long nets, I would like to say that in my opinion it is not these smaller vessels that use very long nets. I believe that we can live with this compromise – and I must concede that it is a compromise – that we have entered into.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our opinion that absolute priority must be given on the one hand to ensuring that hake stocks recover. However, we cannot turn a blind eye to all the social implications that this certainly very stringent measure that we are proposing entails. We feel that we can respond to this best by making an exception especially for owners of very small vessels, as they depend directly on this economic activity and have no other alternative. We cannot, however, go further than this as otherwise the measure would end up in practice being ineffective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore reject it, as I do your insinuation that the Commission regards the southern Member States as intruders – to use your term.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission does not allow itself to be led by motives of that sort where it is a question of ensuring optimal management of the Directorate-General for Fisheries, but concerns itself rather with optimising its work. It is not a question of south or north here, but of bringing together under one department those bilateral agreements that are based on a financial payment in return for access to fishing grounds. In this way we will be able to ensure that these are managed in a uniform and coherent manner. In doing so we are complying with the conclusions of the Council in 1997, with the position of the Court of Auditors, which was set out in a Special Report, and with the aims of the Green Paper on the future of the Common Fisheries Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As for agreements with third countries, where it is principally a question of exchange of fishing rights, it makes sense to locate these in the department that also deals with TACs and quotas, because the fishing rights in these agreements are already a part of the TACs and quotas. The case of Norway in particular makes the advantages of this new structure clear as we engage in negotiations on long-term technical measures for the recovery of cod stocks in the North Sea.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Fires and reafforestation in Greece</span></p>
<p class="contents">Greece is a country severely and continually affected by major fires which devastate its forests. Reafforestation is limited and the fires therefore result in permanent alteration of the natural environment, desertification and the loss of vital 'green lungs', mainly around Greek towns and cities. Land-grabbing after forest fires is endemic in Greece, facilitated by the lack of a Land Registry, a project which is financed by the European Union but which the Greek Government has not even completed by as much as 25% despite receiving Community funding for years.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the rate of reafforestation in Greece and the other Member States of the Union? Which Member States have the highest number of fires and largest areas of forest destroyed by fire? What is the Commission's view of the rate at which forest destroyed by fire in Greece is restored? </p>

In connection with this I would like to inform the honourable Member that in the next few weeks, within the framework of Regulation No 2158/92, the Commission will be approving a programme of protection against forest fires in Greece with funding to the tune of EUR 1.7 million earmarked for the year 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">To turn to your other questions, first: the average area reafforested annually in Greece in the period 1994 to 1999 totals 2 750 hectares. This is equivalent to 15% of the area of forest destroyed by fire in this Member State. The information available to the Commission only permits comparison with Portugal, where forest areas were restored at a rate of approximately 5 000 hectares per year in the same period; this equates to 14% of the area destroyed by forest fires.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the area of forest destroyed each year by fire in the various Member States totals 73 500 hectares in Spain, approximately 50 000 hectares in Italy, 36 500 hectares in Portugal and 19 000 hectares in Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it is very difficult for the Commission to assess efforts in Greece to restore areas of woodland destroyed by fire as of course there are numerous factors at play here. Reafforestation of the affected areas is – as you know – an integral part of national forestry policy and the success of restoration efforts depends especially on a number of key factors, namely the annual capability of Greece to undertake reafforestation, the chance of natural forest rejuvenation in the areas affected by fire damage and, lastly, the afforestation of new areas, for example areas used for agriculture. In certain cases this can create a substitute for the forest areas destroyed by fire. In the end, of course, success depends especially on the quality of forest fire prevention measures and on how well fire-fighting systems perform. These can help to reduce the extent of destruction caused by forest fires in years to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, Article 13 cannot be used as a basis for obtaining direct results or creating individual rights. The facility to take recourse to the Court and full application of the policy against discrimination depend on application at national level of Directive 2000/78, i.e. the directive against discrimination adopted by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive introduced a general framework for any indirect discrimination, including on the grounds of religion or belief. Ιn particular, Article 4(2) deals specifically with churches and other public or private organisations based on religion or belief. This provision allows religious employers to substantiate difference of treatment on the grounds of religion or belief but always looks at any such ban within the context of the type of work and general circumstances. These exceptions generally refer to employees whose work is such that it affects the ethics or ethos of the organisation in question. Under no circumstances, however, can they constitute the rule. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am concerned over the practice in some Member States. As she may be aware, in the United Kingdom there is a clergyman – the Reverend Raymond Owen – who has been refused permission to go to an industrial tribunal to resolve outstanding issues relating to his dismissal by the church authorities. This would not have been the case in various other Member States, or had he been a religious minister from a non-Christian organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">This case seems to exemplify the discrimination that exists against Christian ministers of religion in certain Member States of the Union when they are in dispute with their ecclesiastical authorities. United Kingdom law fails to incorporate properly the Council Directive of 14 October 1991 – most notably Article 8 which notes that Member States are allowed to exclude certain limited cases of employment. However, the UK Employment Rights Act of 1996, in part 13, chapter 1, specifies particular types of employment that are excluded from the Act but makes no reference to the clergy, therefore implying that the clergy is covered by legislation, which is not in fact the case.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope the Commissioner will agree to look in detail at this case and receive the Reverend Owen and representatives from his trade union so we can make a formal complaint. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The viability of social security funds has been a subject of consideration by the European Union's institutions recently. Similar deliberations are also taking place in the Member States. In Greece, a significant discrepancy has been revealed between the data provided for analysis of the viability of the Greek social security funds and the reality of the situation as the funds have not brought their records up to date and are, therefore, unable to determine the exact number of people insured. What is the Commission's view of this situation? Do the data which the Commission receives from Greece for processing undergo statistical correction? Why was the computerisation of the Greek social security funds not completed under the Kleisthenis programme as part of the 2nd Community Support Framework?

<p class="contents">According to the Commission’s information, the purpose of this study was to broaden the fiscal prospects of the insurance funds and, eventually, to identify the changes needed in order to safeguard their fiscal viability. There were huge problems in carrying out the study due to the large number of funds in Greece, and there were problems due to the auxiliary insurance funds and, more importantly, as the result of shortcomings in the computer system. Naturally, the Member States are responsible for drafting this study. The Commission is not, therefore, in a position to check if the data used by this firm is correct or to check the methodology used in order to conduct the study.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the second question regarding statistics on social security funds, Greece has been obliged to provide the Commission with these data since 1994, within the framework of the procedures relating to the European Union. There are difficulties with the flow of data on the part of the Greek authorities when it comes to collating and updating detailed data. Progress has been made in this sector since 1996, now that primary expenditure in the wider public sector has been legalised and rationalised and is better controlled, but I have to say that there are problems with the information received by the European Union, due mainly to the lack of detailed information, particularly from certain funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Your third question concerns the modernisation of the public administration, especially the insurance funds, under the Kleisthenis programme. There was a commitment under the Kleisthenis programme to computerise the ΙΚΑ, which is the main social security fund, and to computerise the policy for a standard social security number for all persons insured in Greece. Under the second Community Support Framework and the Kleisthenis programme, certain projects in these two sectors should have been completed by now. IKA has started restructuring and modernising but there have been delays due mainly to legal differences regarding the results of the invitation to tender, unfortunately for the most important action plan, i.e. the integrated computer system. This programme was due to be completed in 2001 but has been extended to 2002. I have to say that the modernisation of both the IKA and some of the other funds will need to be completed by reorganising them under the third Community Support Framework and information society programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, let me say quite clearly that the principle on which the Green Paper is based is that any action relating to corporate social responsibility, any corporate social action, has nothing to do with compliance with current legislation, which is taken for granted. When we talk of corporate social responsibility and of new action, we are talking about greater investment in human resources, in the environment, in the social environment and in the immediate vicinity by which, of course, we mean over and above their obligations under the law. I should like to make it clear that, as far as the legislation is concerned, it sets out the minimum standards with which companies must comply. As far as the logic of corporate social responsibility is concerned, it refers to higher standards which form the basis on which corporate operations are developed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sadly in recent years we have all too often seen some companies – not the majority – responsible for abuses in third countries, including the problem of child labour on which she was so eloquent when we spoke together at the EU Committee of the US Chamber of Commerce, to which I refer in the question.</p>
<p class="contents">I am asking her for an assurance that Parliament's call for a legal base for monitoring European companies' actions in third countries will be included as one of the options in the Green Paper. I share her view that voluntary action is important. However, I put to her that she has to include the option of regulation. When we look at the actions against bribery and sex tourism, and when we look at the recent very interesting draft report of the International Council on Human Rights on the legal accountability of businesses, we see that world institutions are considering legal actions and legal responsibilities. I want an assurance that this will be discussed and therefore form the basis for consultations through her Green Paper. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At European level, failure to comply with the law is a matter for the Member States and we have the facility, both through the European Parliament and through the Commission, to impose sanctions on Member States who fail to ensure that the law is applied. As regards the international dimension and the issues such as child labour to which you referred, proposals have been tabled either on a Community label or on corporate codes of conduct, which we want to link with an independent assessment of how these companies operate at global level. One of the questions which will be raised in the public debate triggered by the Green Paper in June will be how we can mobilise international monitors, independent international bodies, in conjunction with government organisations and with what specifications, so that we have an objective assessment at international level to which to refer. Only then will there be any real point to the Community label, codes of conduct and lists of companies with a positive impact at global level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This accounts for two-thirds of all employees and affects more than 60 million workers. Most of these enterprises are family businesses. Many businesses also have a life cycle.

I think, and here I agree with you, that the Green Paper and the new role played by companies may offer a great deal of support, especially for small companies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Equal treatment on pay</span></p>
<p class="contents">I gather that the Commission is launching a campaign next year on the principle of equal treatment in respect of pay, which I welcome as it is the Commission’s task to monitor the implementation of the equal pay directive.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of the fact that the Directive has been in force since 1975, its results have been conspicuous by their absence. Pay differentials are still at their 1980 levels – in the EU, men working full time earns on average 27% more than women working full time. In some countries the difference is as much as 30%. It is important to clarify the background to the Member States’ difficulties in combatting pay discrimination and the extent to which a review of the Directive is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission prepared to look into how the Directive and the case law of the Court of Justice have been applied in the Member States, and whether it is necessary to update the Directive? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is one of the first principles contained in the Treaty of Rome, it was one of the first laws passed in 1975 and we reiterated and strengthened it in the Treaty of Amsterdam. And yet, the situation is the same as it was at the beginning of the 1980s.</p>
<p class="contents">What the Commission has done so far, over and above legislation, the application of which is causing serious problems, with governments failing to set up mechanisms to ensure that existing legislation is applied correctly; so over and above the fundamental question of application, the Commission has drafted proposals and, in the guidelines for 2001, this issue is examined very seriously, it is one of the guidelines and we shall have a fuller picture when we assess national action plans not only of the situation in the Member States but also of the action and initiatives taken to deal with this issue. May I remind you that, at the Stockholm Council this year, the Commission undertook to develop indicators so as to ensure that there would be no difference between men and women due to unequal treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the fifth programme for women contains action which calls for proposals, initiatives, innovative ideas and transnational collaboration in order to bring about a better understanding of this phenomenon, together with proposals addressed to governments and companies, so that we can achieve faster, more substantial results than we did during the previous decade. On the basis of the results and initiatives which I have mentioned, the Commission, with Parliament's help of course, will assess whether the directive on equal pay for men and women needs to be updated again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In Sweden and Finland, we already have legislation requiring all employers to prepare annual equality plans, including plans for securing equal pay for work of equal value. Yesterday evening, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities voted through a proposal to implement this throughout the European Union.
