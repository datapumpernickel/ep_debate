<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Aaltonen (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(FI) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, dear guests, on the last plenary day of the European Year of People with Disabilities, I am very grateful to be able to present to you, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, the report I have drawn up concerning the effects of discriminatory treatment afforded to persons with multiple sclerosis in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The background to this report is a petition by a young English woman two years ago and I am happy to be able to say that Louise McVay is at this moment sitting in the visitor’s gallery, observing what her determination and courage led to. Louise found out she had MS and was bitterly disappointed to learn that she simply had not been allowed to benefit from life enhancing medication. In her country, as elsewhere in Europe, people are accorded unequal status regarding the availability of medication and rehabilitation just because of where they live. Louise wrote to the President of the European Parliament, who redirected her letter to the Committee on Petitions.</p>
<p class="contents">There are more than 400 000 MS sufferers in the European Union, and as one of them I myself started work in Parliament and the Committee on Petitions in the spring of this year, just at the time Louise’s petition came up for discussion. I was given the task of drafting this report, whose objective it is to shed further light on concrete ways of improving the lives of MS sufferers throughout the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">MS affects young people at a time in their lives when study, the pursuit of a career and starting a family are important issues. Two out of three sufferers are women. The report shows just how much obtaining a diagnosis and treatment vary within the European Union. This disparity in acquiring the best possible medication and therapy violates people’s fundamental right to healthcare.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that with better levels of cooperation and the full support of all the Union’s institutions, above all and most obviously Parliament, health ministers will be able to concentrate resources more effectively on support for people with this disease. I believe that the disease’s erratic and unpredictable nature should be taken into account in such a way that sufferers are not so vulnerable with regard to keeping their jobs as well as their social environment.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment MS is an incurable illness and anyone diagnosed with it cannot just psychologically adapt to a change in their life. This disease puts a great strain on both the sufferer and his or her family, also financially. In connection with this I have tabled Amendment No 3 at Louise McVay’s request. Because her symptoms varied so much it was thought she did not meet the requirements which would entitle her to medical services.</p>
<p class="contents">The report proposes a number of measures for international cooperation and research and it is hoped that the Commission will contribute to the realisation of these. The report urges the next meeting of health ministers of the Member States to include a debate on these requests in its agenda, and I hope that Parliament will be informed about the decisions taken and proposals for action.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also tabled two amendments on the need to adhere to the precautionary principle, especially in the handling of toxic chemicals. The matter arose when in Scotland they suspected there was a link between TBT and MS. It is in any case known that this substance affects the central nervous system.</p>
<p class="contents">Although my report specifically focuses on MS and its particular features, there are also a number of other similar illnesses, and, having discussed the matter with my colleague, I have decided to put forward another oral amendment to include a mention of these.</p>
<p class="contents">In my country, Finland, there are just 6 000 MS sufferers, but each of us have many associates among the hundreds of thousands in the EU that share the same fate. Those of us the new precious drugs agree with feel a sense of solidarity with all those whose illness has progressed to the stage where they have become disabled. We could strive more to improve conditions for everyone. I hope that this, the first of my reports, will be read carefully by those at the level of responsibility for healthcare in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">After all the political and constitutional controversies this week Parliament can show that we also listen to the citizen here, and not just the President-in-Office of the Council. It is good that people believe that Parliament exists for human expectations and requests for help and that it is not just a lot of buildings in an asphalt jungle in some country in central Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It would appear that the request by the public and which is mentioned in my report is now to be implemented, as Commissioner Diamantopoulou mentioned at the beginning of December that the Commission intends to propose a special directive to guarantee the rights of the disabled.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Commission, I warmly welcome your report. It provides an extensive survey of the complex and complicated issue of multiple sclerosis and sheds light on a broad spectrum of related issues on which further action is needed, and I welcome those affected by them who are present with us today. I can understand the frustration of those who have to live with this illness. The health care available can vary widely, as can the way in which they are treated by their neighbours from day to day. It is bad enough to have to face being diagnosed with an illness as serious as this one, but it is even worse to realise that, although there is help to which you are entitled, you cannot access it, or that an employer is not prepared to take reasonable steps to enable you to carry on an active working life.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to thank the petitioner, Mrs McVay, for raising these issues and, likewise, the rapporteur, Mrs Aaltonen, for drafting such a comprehensive report in order to deal with them.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it lies within the competence of the Member States to ensure that health care is provided and to organise it, this does not mean that we at the European level have no contribution to make to dealing with the problems that this report raises. Many of the differences in provision in Europe could be adjusted simply by exchanging information and best practice. In order to make it easier to cooperate in this general area, the Commission has brought together health ministers, patients, staff from the health services and providers of services to them, as well as insurers, to join in a high-level process of reflection on patient mobility and developments in health provision in the European Union. At the concluding session at the beginning of last week, agreement was reached on a report containing 19 recommendations for action on a variety of issues, including the exchange of information and best practice. This would facilitate the promotion of ideas such as the development of European reference centres, which could in their turn develop professional excellence and training that would benefit both patients and those who work in the health field. The Commission is planning to issue a communication in March 2004, which will submit proposals for responses to these recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Aaltonen also discusses the problem of discrimination against people with multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis is regarded as a disability under Directive 2000/78 prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of age, a disability, religion or belief, or of sexual orientation. Sufferers from multiple sclerosis are thereby protected from discrimination in the workplace on the grounds of this illness. Employers must take reasonable steps to enable disabled employees to do their jobs. The Commission has mounted a wide information campaign in all the Member States to accompany this legislation and to inform employers and workers of these rights. Furthermore, the Commission intends to hold, in early 2004, a public consultation on its future strategy to combat discrimination, which may also include the adoption of anti-discrimination legislation outside the spheres of work and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The report lays stress, moreover, on the need for greater scientific knowledge about multiple sclerosis. At the European level, the Research Framework Programmes are making a contribution to this. Projects in these areas are already being promoted under the Fifth Research Framework Programme, and the topic of neuro-immune dysfunction can also be included in future invitations to tender under the current Sixth Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">We may note, in conclusion, that the report calls on individual states and the European level to raise awareness of multiple sclerosis. As has already been said, the problem of inequality in health provision is primarily a matter for which the Member States must accept responsibility, but I very much hope that they will take note of this report and of today’s debate. As far as the Commission is concerned, I have named a number of areas in which action at the European level can help to raise the issues we have mentioned. Let me close by again praising the outstanding work that the rapporteur has done in drafting this wide-ranging and useful report, which will itself help to make society more aware of multiple sclerosis and of the problems associated with it.</p>

Indeed, I pay credit to Louise's local constituency MEPs, Mrs Read and Mr Whitehead, who have followed this through the parliamentary process. This debate, resolution and report is a historic landmark for 400 000 people with multiple sclerosis in Europe. It will lead to concrete action. Just as resolutions of this Parliament on the rights of people with autism and on the recognition of sign language for deaf people have meant real achievements, I believe that will be true from today onwards for people with multiple sclerosis.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has produced an opinion to contribute its authorship to this report, because within seven years, 50% of people with multiple sclerosis lose their jobs, even though they want to work and are capable of working. This is not just about access to appropriate health care, it is the fact that getting access to that health care could make a huge difference to people's working, social and personal lives.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the Multiple Sclerosis Society of the United Kingdom. Sarah Philips, its chair, is also with us in the public gallery. Because of their campaigning, a new scheme was introduced in 2002, which means that 3 000 more people with multiple sclerosis now benefit from the latest and most effective treatments in the United Kingdom, my own Member State. It is truly an achievement of disabled people working and campaigning together, and one that we, in common with our colleagues in the European Multiple Sclerosis Platform, want to see spread throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We talk about people suffering from MS. I understand why we use that language. But we do not want disabled people to be seen as victims, we want them to be seen as achievers like Louise McVay, whose achievements we celebrate in this European Year of Disabled People. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am sure many of us know somebody who has suffered from, or has, multiple sclerosis, and I take Mr Howitt's last point. But let us start by remembering, as the Commissioner said, that health is not an EU issue. It is something we can help with, but we must not be deluded into thinking that it is a power of ours. Indeed it is not even a Member State issue. The British Government in its devolution has devolved health to Scotland, because often the best remedies are found close to home. Indeed, if we are going to apply the precautionary principle anywhere it should be applied to the extension of EU legislation into areas that are best dealt with locally.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I welcome this report which has many positive things in it. Firstly the code of best practice, and secondly closer international scientific collaboration. Having said that things are often best done at local level, many things can also be done at a European, or even a wider level. We should not forget the centres of research excellence, particularly in the United States, and we should seek as wide a collaboration as we can. Insofar as the EU can assist in that, through the research programmes etc., we certainly should. Clearly, as the report says, we should involve service users in the research. Things need to be done with the cooperation of people, not for them.</p>
<p class="contents">As such, we in this Group also support strongly the call for a Europe-wide study to be undertaken, clearly in cooperation with the WHO, because we want to spread the knowledge and gather the knowledge as widely as possible. We welcome, as the report says, the comparative evaluation being undertaken by the European Multiple Sclerosis Centre. All of these are good and positive things.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the problem of drugs – and this is a problem because, in British terms, where you live can affect what you get – we can produce the information but we cannot direct people how to spend their medical resources, and I am pleased to say that this report does not say that. But people who have MS clearly must be encouraged to play a full part in the community and such discrimination as exists within the community cannot be allowed to stand. One of the things we have to be constantly on the lookout for is giving people a fair deal and making it possible for them to play a full part in the community, as full a part as any of us.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to talk about two of the amendments on introducing this precautionary principle. They are unnecessary and divisive. The chemicals directive and chemicals policy is the subject of a separate effort within this House. If you are going to apply the precautionary principle to toxic chemicals, let us look at it in the context of the chemicals directive. Maybe we should also consider that some people might talk about applying the precautionary principle to new treatments. The precautionary principle is a separate subject and accordingly our Group cannot support Amendments 1 or 2. This has nothing to do with us not wanting the best treatment for sufferers from MS, it has to do with sheer common sense and dealing with things in the appropriate place.</p>
<p class="contents">I close by saying that I welcome this report. I commend all the people who have contributed to it and we look forward to supporting it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even though the Commission’s initial response has nothing encouraging to say about this petition, I am very glad that the Committee on Petitions has taken the initiative in producing this report and, yet again, taken very seriously something that is of concern to the European public; I am convinced that Mrs Aaltonen’s report will prompt changes that will improve the quality of life for MS sufferers in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Just how urgently needed that is is demonstrated by the considerable qualitative differences between the responses by the health ministries of the Member States to treatments and therapies for people suffering from MS, which also show that sufferers from MS are not yet treated with the consideration that they urgently need. This report is an initial assessment, and the conclusions to which it comes are important ones, reflecting, among other things, the demands made by the German MS Association, which celebrated its 50th anniversary in November.</p>
<p class="contents">I see it as being of the utmost importance that the needs of young people with MS should be considered and taken into account, as well as that those affected by it should be enabled, as far as possible and for as long as possible, to work and enjoy equal rights in the sphere of employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Our rapporteur, Mrs Aaltonen, herself demonstrates that, with the right therapy and treatment, people with MS can lead active lives in the world of work and in society at large. The Group of the Party of European Socialists, to which I belong, endorses all the amendments tabled by the rapporteur and the report as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">The various tragic effects of the disease, which affect the lives of sufferers and their families, compel people with MS to engage in a lifelong struggle against a disease that is still incurable and whose progress is unpredictable. The EU must play a strategic role in improving equal access to therapies and treatments, by calling on the Member States to coordinate their actions, including in research, and by facilitating access to the best practice in treatment and rehabilitation. Sufferers from MS in the future Member States will benefit from this.</p>

It demonstrates what tenacity can achieve. I am also pleased that it is on the agenda during the European Year of People with Disabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">I join others in congratulating the rapporteur for such a wide-ranging report. It talks about equal access to health care. There are differences within Member States and across the whole of the European Union. Some drugs like beta interferon, which can help some MS sufferers, are not widely available. Multiple sclerosis research should also be covered in the seventh framework directive. I am very disappointed – a lot of people are – that the sixth framework directive is not living up to the commitment that was made to mainstream disability issues. We must also ensure that young disabled people – that includes people with MS – do not end up being cared for alongside elderly people. That is why we must work towards independent living and why it is so important that the employment directive is fully implemented in all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry to say that the deadline of 3 December this year has been missed by many Member States. We must take this opportunity now to ensure that does not continue, and we must get a specific disability directive. I was very pleased that the Commissioner mentioned that in her speech in Rome closing the European Year. Let us hope that we now get that timetable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope it will also be approved unanimously in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that we deal with these health problems, in response to this citizen’s petition, relating to the discriminatory treatment of patients with multiple sclerosis. We are aware that many chronic long-term illnesses do not receive satisfactory attention, and the treatment offered to these people is currently insufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">This report contains proposals for resolving the situation of people suffering from multiple sclerosis in all the member countries, not only therapeutically, but also by proposing effective services to deal with the other needs suffered by these patients, as well as their integration into society, applying effective therapies and treatments which modify their illness. It provides these patients with useful information and support, things which are very important to them.</p>
<p class="contents">I will illustrate what I have said by means of an example. In the Spanish State there are 40 000 people suffering from multiple sclerosis. Some are as courageous and constant as Mrs Louise McVay, and I would give the example of Martí i Pol, a Catalan writer who died recently and managed to overcome and live with his illness thanks to the solidarity and help of everybody around him, not just family, but the whole of society in general, his people and his region.</p>
<p class="contents">It is an absolute priority to dedicate funds to research programmes aimed at finding a solution to this disease, in all the Member States. The GUE/NGL Group supports the report in its entirety, as well as those amendments which we believe will provide solutions for alleviating this disease.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I would like to stress the importance of the Committee on Petitions, which maintains relations with the citizens and makes it possible, by means of their petitions, in some cases to produce reports like this one aimed at improving aspects of their daily lives.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like once again to express my gratitude for this valuable report, which we hope will have effective results in the Member States, by means of the proposals which the Commission will undoubtedly make.</p>

It takes resolve to get a matter on the floor of the European Parliament, and for someone suffering from the ravages of this disease, it shows outstanding strength of will. I am also pleased that it is the European Parliament's petitions procedure that has enabled that to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to tell a personal story. About ten years ago, my sister-in-law, married to my twin brother, invited me to their home for the weekend. She asked me to look at my twin brother. He did not appear to be standing quite correctly – something was wrong with his balance. She said that it was my job to convince him to go to a doctor. I did that job and the early stages of MS were first of all diagnosed. That subsequently was proven not to be the case: he had a related disease, called ataxia nervosa. Like MS, it attacks the mobility of the patient, not the thinking part of the brain at all. In two horrible years he was confined to a wheelchair and finally the disease killed him. In one respect he was very fortunate: he had a great employer. I will name them: Shell UK. They paid for treatment, a chauffeur to drive him to and from work and for a personal assistant to operate his computer and to push his wheelchair. They had the sense, the decency and the foresight and, I suppose, the resources to treat a disabled person as a real person. That is all that anybody asks and that is what this report asks.</p>
<p class="contents">I have told this story for two reasons. Firstly, to remind all of us who are fit and active today that tomorrow we could find ourselves in a wheelchair. If that happens as a result of an accident, often compensation is paid. If it happens as a result of disease, there is no insurance or compensation and you are in the hands of society – people like you and me. Secondly, for some diseases there is no treatment – or it is only patchily available – and there is very limited research. Further research is needed and we must be prepared to encourage and support that research as requested in this report. Louise is right: if there is therapy that helps, for example beta interferons, then it must be made available to all sufferers.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly grateful to the rapporteur for putting forward the oral amendments that would allow the pressure from this petition to be used to help not just the hundreds of thousands of sufferers from multiple sclerosis, but also sufferers from other similar mobility-impairment and neuro-degenerative diseases, who need help too. We must learn from each other and we must learn to help Louise and the hundreds of thousands like her. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is a clear need, based on the information that has been provided to us, for the European Union to become engaged in seeking to develop best practice across the European Union to ensure that the people of Europe have adequate access to services, therapies, drugs and indeed aftercare, and that they are not discriminated against in relation to employment.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a need for a Europe-wide epidemiological study which should be financed by the European Union, and that should be done as a matter of urgency. There is also a need for a new directive on disability rights which would guarantee that people who suffer from conditions of this kind are not discriminated against in accessing jobs. It is one thing to be in a job and have this condition, but if you have the condition it is virtually impossible to access a job subsequently.</p>
<p class="contents">These are matters strictly speaking within the competence of the Member States but it is clear that as a Union and as a Parliament we have an obligation to seek to ensure that European citizens are treated properly. It is estimated that something like 400 000 people in Europe have this condition. In Ireland, for instance, there are around 500 000 people with neurological conditions of various kinds. I do not at know offhand how many of those are MS patients, but a recent study has shown that there is a 2:1 gap in terms of the number of consultants necessary to provide treatment, care and appointments for people with conditions of this kind. There is a two-year waiting list and something like double the number of clinics are required in order to cope with the numbers involved.</p>
<p class="contents">There are clearly large gaps in our services and we have an obligation to try and close those gaps. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a special pleasure for me, who have had the privilege of knowing Mrs Aaltonen for a long time, to congratulate her on her first report here in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">She is a positive person who has fought many important political battles for young people, women and, now, the handicapped. It is a privilege for the European Parliament to have access to her knowledge, energy and experience. These qualities have really been of value in the preparation of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also grateful for the fact that Mrs Aaaltonen has taken account of my proposal concerning the issues of genetics. Pentti Tienari, a senior lecturer in experimental neurology in Finland, has researched into these matters, and the fact is, unfortunately, that there is a background of genetic factors. The Vikings are suspected of having spread the disease because it mainly occurs in Orkney and Shetland and also in the area around the River Kyro in Finland. The disease also exists where Germanic peoples have been on the move. I hope that continuing research will also take account of this genetic factor.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to say that the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, which is usually scrupulous about the issue of subsidiarity, will for the most part approve all these amendments. It is said that the Member States must cooperate, and I believe it is important for the Member States to cooperate in order to arrive at binding standards. It may be possible for this to happen outside the structure of the EU, for example through cooperation between ministers in the framework of the Council of Europe. It is there that we should produce binding recommendations on health care. We ought to have a precise division between the EU’s and the Member States’ respective areas of competence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This inflammatory disease of the central nervous system and nerve fibres gradually develops lesions that prevent the nerves from functioning, causing generalised and unpredictable disability. I congratulate the rapporteur on the work she has done and hope that the Commission and the Member States will commit themselves more to solving the countless problems that people affected by this disease have to face – taking account of this report and the work done by organisations representing multiple sclerosis sufferers – in their fight for equality of access to treatment and services and in defence of their dignity. It is calculated that there are more than 400 000 such citizens in the various countries of the European Union, as has already been mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">A greater commitment to research into this disease is required, specifically within the next research framework programme since, unfortunately, it has not been included in the current one, as has also been mentioned here. We also need effective measures against discrimination in health care and the elimination of all barriers and obstacles that hinder equality of access to goods and services, as well as greater attention to employment and respect for personal dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">While I support this report and its proposals on this concrete issue, however, I feel I must underline the need to situate these measures within the more global context of the fight to eliminate discrimination against people with disabilities. As this year, which has brought disability problems to the forefront, comes to an end, it is necessary to make the commitment that all European Union institutions will stand firm in their fight against discrimination. I point especially to the need for a Community policy on disability and for giving top priority in the various Community policies to matters relating to discrimination against and the human rights of people with disabilities. Only in this way will there be effective social inclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">What is required is a proposal for a directive based on Article 13 of the Treaty to fight discrimination based on disability. This new directive must prevent new barriers from being raised and stipulate that the existing barriers that people with disabilities have to face must be eliminated throughout the European Union. It would be good if this could happen in the short term, but we know that that will only be possible if the Member States make a great effort to adopt the necessary concrete, particularly financial measures, which have been affected by the irrational criteria of the Stability Pact and the resulting budget cuts, as has happened in Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">Promoting the integration of people with disabilities also requires the proper transposal of the Council directive setting out a legal framework for equality of treatment in matters of employment and work. I also affirm my support for the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities. I therefore hope, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, that this report and this debate will be an important contribution in the fight against discrimination towards people with disabilities and that the Commission and the Member States will take it into due consideration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this case, and in those like it, we see again and again how much cold-heartedness there is in this European Union of ours – of the need for which I am thoroughly convinced, and for which we are all working together.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, it takes a certain optimism not to resort to the criticism, which is to some extent stereotypical, that Europe is only for those who are fast, big, rich, healthy and strong, but instead to believe that this Europe is there also for the vulnerable members of society, for those who are slow and cannot keep up the pace – and here I am not talking about ‘core Europe’, but about individuals who are slower and cannot keep up – for the sick, for the little people.</p>
<p class="contents">We have no problems with travel. We move money, goods and cars from one Member State to another. We use them; we have a single drivers’ licence and a single set of road traffic regulations. Where common action in social matters is concerned, though, or common action in the cultural sphere, it is unfortunate that this Europe cannot demonstrate the rhythm and speed that it already possesses in other spheres, and for which we are grateful. It would surely make sense for us to be as quick about things in the social and cultural spheres as we are elsewhere. Members – among whom I particularly want to thank Mrs Aaltonen, the rapporteur – have already spoken at length about the need for, and importance of, measures to deal with multiple sclerosis.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore want to draw particular attention to the incongruousness of our having such a need to catch up in the social sphere. There is no single entitlement card for the disabled, Commissioner; a disabled person who lives in Germany cannot go to France, nor a disabled person from Italy to Germany and have his status, which is a disadvantage, recognised, not even when it comes to getting a parking space, let alone a seat on public transport and other similar things beside. This is where we urgently need to make up for lost time. I believe – indeed, I am convinced – that it is not enough to do no more than say ‘we have no responsibility for this’. We must do far more here, and be more consistent in doing it. I hope that this debate will make us more aware of these matters too.</p>

With current scientific resources, diagnosis is made at an early stage and, with suitable treatment, the advance of the disease can be controlled or slowed down and the quality of life of sufferers improved substantially.</p>
<p class="contents">We know on the basis of the Union Treaty, that the Community applies policies and actions with the aim of safeguarding a high level of health protection. However, in order for this sort of thing to be feasible, one of the preconditions is equal access for citizens to health services and equal provision of all efficient means. Hence, the argument that dealing with the consequences of this particular disease comes under the jurisdiction of the Member States does not stand up and should not exist. What is needed, as quickly as possible, is a new epidemiological study, at European level and in collaboration with the WHO, so that the extent of the problem can be seen from the data collected and the need for intensive research and international cooperation can be highlighted.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by the Committee on Petitions is revelatory and enlightening and, of course, it is clear that I totally agree with the proposal to establish a code of best practices, because this will result in our defining uniform methods of treatment and rehabilitation activities. Similarly, I absolutely agree with the view that the health authorities in the Member States must promote self-help programmes among patients with multiple sclerosis which, together with the application of special working conditions, will constitute two important factors in maintaining good mental health which, as we know, is significantly impaired by the very nature of the illness.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur and Mrs Louise McVayn, who has demonstrated to us that one person who fights can obtain results for many people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has been a tireless campaigner for MS sufferers and I commend her courage and her hard work. I would also like to thank Mrs Aaltonen for her excellent work on this report. MS is the most common form of disability affecting young adults in the EU, and two-thirds of sufferers are women. Of the 400 000 sufferers in the EU, 85 000 are in my own country, the United Kingdom. MS demands our attention.</p>
<p class="contents">This report proposes the very best kind of European cooperation. It recognises that the EU has no competence to determine the health policies of Member States, still less to set their budgets or spending priorities for Member States' health services. That is as it should be. What the EU can and should do is to offer the exchange of best practice, to benchmark performance, to encourage uniformly high standards of care. It has another vital role and that is in the area of medical research. As spokesman for my Conservative delegation on research, I share the view of Ms Lynne that we should like to see chronic diseases more strongly prioritised in the EU's framework research programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">While it is fashionable to concentrate on newly emerging diseases, we cannot afford to lose sight of familiar problems which affect huge numbers of patients. We still do not have a full understanding of the causes of MS and we should not rest until this problem is solved.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly we have much to do in my own country, the UK. Our Labour Government has failed to address the problem of the postcode lottery, which means that the levels of care and availability of drugs can vary from street to street. I was first alerted to this problem for MS sufferers in the UK during our 2001 general election campaign when one of our Conservative candidates was approached by a young lady in Nottingham, Mrs Peel, who had just been diagnosed with the disease. Mrs Peel, who was pregnant at the time, was alarmed to find that she was being denied therapies and treatment by the local health authority simply because of where she lived. I was very pleased that the Conservative spokesman on health at that time, Dr Liam Fox, was able to visit Mrs Peel personally to listen to her case.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to commend the European MS Platform for their campaigning work. I was glad to support their European MS Awareness Day in the European Parliament in Brussels in June of last year. Such events are invaluable in briefing Members on the issues surrounding the disease and the problems faced by sufferers.</p>
<p class="contents">As we come to the end of the European Year of People with Disabilities, we must focus on the needs of MS patients and the research-based opportunities to accelerate the development of more effective treatments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Whitehead, one of Louise's East Midlands MEPs, has had to leave to take part in a vote on another vital health matter, and he sends his apologies.</p>
<p class="contents">MS affects people in different ways: some days can be good, some days can be bad. However, it is a deteriorating condition with no cause and no cure. I became involved in working on the issue after meeting an active group of Scottish MS patients. They contacted me, told me of the impact the disease has on their daily lives, and made me aware that Scotland has the highest rate of MS in the world. I have since sponsored the first European MS Awareness Seminar, held in the European Parliament, and set up Parliament's MS interest group.</p>
<p class="contents">Primarily the petition before us tries to raise awareness of access to not only medicines but also to the treatment of patients with MS. It is quite fitting that, as we end the 2003 European Year for People with Disabilities, we reflect on what we can positively do to help people with MS.</p>
<p class="contents">No discrimination at the workplace would be a good start. A number of people I have spoken with have lost their jobs because their employer was not flexible or understanding about MS. That is why implementing an EU directive on equal treatment in employment is so important. Access to medicines and new treatments is essential. It is timely that just yesterday this Parliament voted in a new pharmaceutical package that hopefully will lead not only to more innovation but also to better access to cheaper medicines.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that some British hospitals have now introduced MS nurses. Many people working in the medical field do not know how to treat patients with MS. I had no idea that a needle in the skin could perhaps inflict unbearable pain on someone with MS. Better recognition and understanding of MS is needed. MS patients deserve better. I thank Louise again for bringing this before us today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
