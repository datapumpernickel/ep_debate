I am the Chair of the committee, not the author of this resolution, and you can see that we had sponsors from all political parties. We are in agreement in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety that we have a ticking time bomb here, a major problem for the health of our citizens, and that there is an urgent need for action. We need an action plan, because the health authorities in Europe are alarmed. During visits this year to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in London and also to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in Stockholm, our attention was once again drawn by these specialist agencies of the European Union to this problem in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">In the EU, around 25 000 people a year are now dying of infections caused by resistant bacteria. If we look at the situation, up to the end of the 1970s there was a great deal of activity in the pharmaceuticals industry aimed at developing new molecules and new agents. Since the end of the 1970s, the activity has diminished and come to a standstill. So, if you like, we stopped focusing on this problem 40 years ago. We are simply lacking new agents to fight this resistance. Commissioner Dalli, at this point the first demand that I am going to make is directed at you as the Commissioner responsible, and it is a call on the Commission to draw up a road map with the industry concerned in order to show more commitment to the search for and development of new molecules and new agents. Together with the actors involved in research and industry, you should draw up this road map so that we can obtain a new protection mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">We have mentioned a second issue, with regard to which we would ask you – as well as the Member States – to be actively engaged. Antibiotics help to reduce diseases, but if they are not used properly they can also cause damage. We have discovered that antibiotics are used entirely differently in the 27 Member States of the European Union. The Eurobarometer survey has shown how much ignorance there is. Of the people questioned, 53% believe that antibiotics kill viruses and 43% believe that antibiotics are effective against colds and flu. We can imagine how great the misuse of these substances must be, which then contributes to the resistance and puts other people at risk. We are therefore calling on the Commission to define general principles and best practices for the prudent use of antibiotics for 500 million people, for all 27 Member States, and also to ensure that these guidelines are actually implemented and put into practice everywhere in the European Union. We need a major awareness campaign in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that we also need a well-functioning monitoring and surveillance system in this sector. The ECDC in Stockholm is our sectoral authority. We need good data, sound surveys and, of course, also analyses of trends and early warnings of the spread of such resistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, there is one final issue that we have addressed in a serious way: the cross-transmission of resistance from animals to humans. Antibiotics are used in veterinary medicine as well as human medicine. There are strong indications that crossovers exist. That means that we need cooperation with veterinary medicine in this regard, above all in order to reduce and prohibit the prophylactic use of antibiotics in intensive livestock farming.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, Commissioner, I hope that our resolution will also serve as a mandate for you as well as for the Polish Presidency to take action so that we can protect our citizens against this new threat to health.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Adam Fronczak, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(PL)</span> Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, one of the greatest challenges facing modern medicine and public health is the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant strains of key pathogenic bacteria. Since the end of the 1990s, the problem of drug-resistant microorganisms has been growing at an alarming pace and giving rise to yet more clinical, epidemiological, socio-economic and political problems. A rise is being observed in the number of patients with increased susceptibility to infections with bacteria which are normally non-pathogenic for healthy people and in the number of people in care institutions, who constitute a significant reservoir of resistance.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation is exacerbated by a fall in the interest of pharmaceutical firms in antibiotics which would be effective against multidrug-resistant bacteria. The effective treatment and control of commonly-occurring bacterial infections may be increasingly difficult in the future. The most urgent action which needs to be taken to combat the phenomenon of increasing drug resistance is to invest in scientific programmes aimed at developing new antibiotics and new strategies. The very strict registration requirements, the huge costs of conducting clinical studies and what the pharmaceutical industry considers to be insufficient profits have caused pharmaceutical firms to abandon work on new drugs over the last 20 years, and this has been extremely negligent. I would like to add that only two new molecules have been approved for therapeutic use in that period. Antimicrobial resistance is far from being a new phenomenon. The increasingly frequent occurrence of antimicrobial resistance and the emergence of new resistant strains represent a serious threat to public health. This situation was recognised by the Council as long ago as 1999, when it adopted a resolution entitled ‘A strategy against the microbial threat’ and conclusions on future actions in the framework of the strategy against antimicrobial resistance.</p>
<p class="contents">In many of the European Union’s Member States, strains of bacteria have emerged which are resistant to all available drugs. The list of these pathogens is constantly getting longer. We should not expect to see the approval of new and effective drugs against these bacteria in the near future. At least 10 years will be needed to achieve this. Infection with a drug-resistant microorganism significantly reduces the options for proven and safe therapy and requires the use of what are called ‘last-chance’ drugs, which have been failing with increasing frequency recently. Treatment with these antibiotics often has no scientific basis and leads to an increase in the number of adverse reactions and treatment failures. The increase in the costs of the health care needed by patients with multidrug-resistant microbial infections has many aspects. As well as the costs associated with the antibiotic therapy itself, there are also the costs of other drugs which are used in conjunction with these antibiotics, the costs of treating patients in intensive care units and the costs of infection control measures such as microbiological diagnosis, patient isolation and assigning personnel to care for individual patients. When hospital stays need to be extended it is not just the costs of health care which rise, because there are also greater costs associated with people being unfit for work for longer periods.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 2001, a huge amount of work has been done in the field of combating antibiotic resistance. I would like to mention several examples. Firstly, the second report from the Commission to the Council on the implementation of the Council recommendation on the prudent use of antimicrobial agents in human medicine, published in April 2010. This report contained an account of the progress made by the Member States under the many different initiatives undertaken since publication of the first report.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, specialised agencies of the European Union, and in particular the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the European Medicines Agency and the European Food Safety Authority are working closely together in this area. For example, two Europe-wide surveillance networks are currently in existence: EARS-NET, the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network, and ESAC, European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption, which monitors consumption in human and to a small extent in veterinary medicine.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, a series of measures has been put in place to fight antimicrobial resistance related to the food chain. For example, European Union law on feeding animals has prohibited the use of growth-stimulating antibiotics in animal feed since January 2006. Also being monitored are trends in antimicrobial resistance in animal disease and in infections transmitted from animals to humans and other factors which might pose a threat to public health.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, at international level the European Union supported the adoption of a European strategic action plan on antibiotic resistance at the meeting of the Regional Committee for Europe of the World Health Organisation which was held in September this year. Together with the United States we have also set up the Transatlantic Taskforce on Antimicrobial Resistance.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of the prudent use of antibiotics, the Council has invited the Member States several times to take action intended to ensure the prudent use of authorised antimicrobial agents in human and veterinary medicine, in particular in the conclusions on antimicrobial resistance adopted in June 2008. In these conclusions, the Council called on the Member States to strengthen surveillance systems and improve the quality of data on antimicrobial resistance and the use of antimicrobial agents, and also to promote the prudent use of antibiotics in both the human and veterinary sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Development of new antimicrobial agents and the significant role played by systems which encourage investment in research are questions which are being considered by the Council. In its conclusions on innovative incentives for effective antibiotics adopted in December 2009, the Council called upon the Member States to strengthen incentives to conduct research and development of new effective antibiotics. It also called upon the Member States and the Commission to facilitate the development of new antibiotics for which a particular need exists in medicine and also to identify appropriate regulatory instruments to facilitate early approval for new antibiotics.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, what is being planned for the future? All legislative proposals will be based on initiatives from the Commission. I am sure that Mr Dalli will want to say more about his plans for the future in this area. Naturally, the Council will consider favourably all proposals submitted by the Commission. The question of antimicrobial resistance will continue to be a priority for the Council. As far back as 2009, the Council asked the Commission to submit, before the end of 2011, a comprehensive action plan containing specific proposals for incentives to develop new effective antibiotics. We are expecting publication of this document next month. In addition, the forthcoming United States-European Union summit has plans for agreements concerning future cooperation in this area too.</p>
<p class="contents">The subject of antibiotic resistance is particularly significant from the point of view of the Council, and so it has been included in the catalogue of priorities of the Danish Presidency, our partners in the Trio. The Danish Presidency has planned a conference on the use of antibiotics, which will be held on 14-15 March next year. The conference will discuss the challenges and threats associated with antibiotic use.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to note that this House, too, is planning to adopt a resolution on the public health threat of antimicrobial resistance. This will be a continuation of a previous resolution adopted in May, which focussed more on the use of antimicrobial agents in animals. These initiatives show clearly that the Council and the European Parliament are equally interested in this matter and that they also have the same objective: to halt the spread of microorganisms which are resistant to first-line antibiotics and to develop new antibiotics which are effective against resistant strains. In closing my speech, I would like to express my appreciation and thanks to you, the Members of the European Parliament, for discussing this issue – one which is so important for the health of the European Union’s citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission plans to strengthen action in support of Member States in this area and will present, next month, a five-year action plan on antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The promotion of the prudent use of antimicrobial agents in human and veterinary medicines will be a cornerstone of our policy and actions for the years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">The broad aims will be to mitigate the risk of developing AMR in humans through promotion of the prudent use of antimicrobials, to help Member States address the issue of sales of antibiotics without prescription, to support Member States’ enforcement of the prescription-only requirements for antibiotics and to address the identified shortfalls through new activities, such as guidelines, exchange of best practices, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">For the veterinary sector in particular the issue of AMR will be addressed in the context of the review of the legal framework for veterinary medicines and medicated feeding stuffs.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the development of new effective antimicrobials, the Commission is committed to exploring with all relevant stakeholders how to ensure the availability of new, effective antimicrobials and treatments against infectious diseases, along with the promotion of the prudent use of such antimicrobials.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of the current economic difficulties, our joint efforts at local, national and EU level for the prevention and control of antimicrobial resistance across all sectors will also contribute towards mitigating the important economic impact resulting from healthcare costs and productivity losses related to AMR. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore we now need a comprehensive solution, and I fully agree with our Chair, Jo Leinen, who is calling for further research and development in the pharmaceutical industry in order to find new antibiotics. We have been waiting several decades for the discovery of new molecules and new active ingredients.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel it is particularly important for us to control how these antibiotics are used, within human medicine and veterinary medicine alike. We urgently need to set daily consumption levels in the various sectors of livestock farming. Indeed we are starting to find antibiotic residue in meat and in milk, and this has been confirmed by various experts. How can we conceive of giving such food to our children?</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly this residue will find its way onto consumers’ plates and will encourage the emergence of resistance. Consequently we need to raise awareness among livestock farmers and technicians of the effects that excessive use of these antibiotics can have, especially since we are aware of the risk of cross-transmission from animals to humans. In this respect we have a responsibility towards our fellow citizens. I say that on behalf of my fellow Members in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development who are worried and who certainly share the same concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, Commissioner, we await your plan with a great deal of interest, for we are dealing here with a real public health problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have someone very close to me who had a little boy who was ill for many months with something which would have been routinely treated with antibiotics just a few years ago. So we know it is a problem.</p>
<p class="contents">We know the main cause is overuse of antibiotics and misuse of antibiotics by humans – people not taking their antibiotics to the end of their course. But I just want to say one thing. We have had a lot of lobbying over the last few days – and Ms Grossetête has mentioned this – from companies which make veterinary medicines. They are saying that the science suggesting a link between veterinary medicines and human health is not proved. That is not what the European Medicines Agency says; that is not what the ECDC tells us; that is not what the World Health Organisation tells us. So, Commissioner, I am very pleased that you are going to bring forward a plan which looks at human health, how doctors prescribe and where we can exchange best practice between our doctors and our health services, but which will also look at animal feed and veterinary practices and veterinary medicines. We do need to get this right. We are also revising the common agricultural policy, and we need to look at more sustainable methods of farming as well.</p>
<p class="contents">We look forward to your plan. I think we will need some incentives for pharmaceutical companies, to help them bring forward the right kind of antibiotics. This is an urgent issue, and that is why we wanted to make sure this was on the agenda today in this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Hardly anyone foresaw the economic crisis in 2008. Our societies are not well-prepared for outlier events. This applies above all to antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, given that, in the Darwinian sense, the development of a superbug resistant to modern antibiotics was only a matter of time.</p>
<p class="contents">Antimicrobial resistance is a problem which clearly has cross-border dimensions. That is why the Treaty of Lisbon makes provision for the European Union to have competence and an obligation to act in this sector. Our defence in this instance is as strong as its weakest link. We must therefore focus on the countries with high levels of antimicrobial resistance and address the question of excessive use with interventions along the entire chain of citizens, doctors, chemists and the pharmaceutical industry. This will have very important economic and financial implications, because antibiotics are expensive.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why Parliament’s vote in favour of a special action – which I proposed – within the framework of the 2012 budget, to extend research into the social and economic causes of indiscriminate use and to help plan an action programme in the most vulnerable countries, is a positive move.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also acknowledge that there has been market failure, especially in terms of research and development of new antibiotics. As antibiotics are the last line of defence and must be used very economically, there is quite logically no incentive to develop them. That is why we must step up the debate and find such incentives.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the key to the endeavour is to limit the widespread use of so-called broad spectrum antibiotics. It is absurd to use weapons of mass destruction where we can use smart bombs. That is why we are calling for more investment here.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, we need to understand that, in practical terms, antimicrobial resistance wastes global resources that are non-renewable. That is why the Commission needs to table proposals and move ahead with the Council recommendation of November 2001 and ensure that it is applied more effectively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every year, 25,000 people die in the EU of conditions which are untreatable because bacteria in their bodies have become resistant to antimicrobial agents.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not weighing up the medicine correctly and are dispensing it for the wrong purposes. You ought only to be able to get antibiotics on prescription from a qualified physician for a specific problem. But this is not working the way it should. Half of the population already wrongly knocks back antibiotics for a touch of flu or a cold. It is not just ill people that are prescribed antibiotics by doctors; we also have healthy people ingesting them with their food, when they eat meat which has been intentionally laced with them, because antibiotics are added to animal feed for preventive purposes. Now, what is perverse about this situation is that our cattle breeders risk facing major health risks, such as the aggressive MRSA bacterium.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been turning a blind eye to the side effects for too long, as well as to the long-term side effects and the impact on the environment. We have increasingly been focusing on the current impact and on the impact on the individual but, at the same time, we have been burdening the community as a whole and our future generations with deadly consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">I have often expressed deep-rooted criticism of the EU’s meddlesomeness, but we are talking here about a health problem which really justifies international intervention. Cross-border action is the only formula that will help contain this serious, health-threatening problem. I hope that the Council and the Commission will not show themselves immune to the action points which we, as Parliament, have drawn up, and I hope that the Council and the Commission will complete the whole course of treatment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Humanity found a weapon against an enemy that had formerly destroyed human lives with impunity, often in terrible epidemics. Today, however, the number of micro-organisms that are resistant to these treatments is beginning to increase dangerously. The efforts of micro-organisms to save and preserve themselves force them to adapt to the treatments in use, and if they cannot do this, they perish. Those bacteria that learn to survive in the presence of antibiotics, grow more, mutate, multiply and complicate treatment, often even causing death. They then spread to other people, particularly from hospitals. We have unfortunately not found effective new substances. Only 1.6% of treatments currently being developed are antibiotic. From this perspective, we can therefore reasonably state that we are in a stage of total antibacterial disarmament. The World Health Organisation has therefore proposed a set of measures to halt the spread of resistance to medicines. In addition to the incorrect prescribing of antimicrobial substances, specialists have also defined other factors which encourage the emergence of resistance. They draw attention in particular to incomplete national rules on the use of these medicines, and lack of compliance with these rules. The Council recommendations of 2001 on careful use of antimicrobial substances in human medicine also look deficient today in terms of practical application. I would therefore like to quote the slogan of the WHO for this year’s World Health Day, concerning the fight against antimicrobial resistance, which goes: no action today, no cure tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have seen people’s life expectancy increase by 10 years. Now we are seeing this development as a result of the emergence of resistant bacteria. We need to address this threat to health in a serious and thorough manner, in respect of both people and animals. We therefore need to do everything we can to make sure that we still have effective antimicrobial treatment options for the future. That will primarily be achieved – as has already been said today – through research.</p>
<p class="contents">We need new agents. We would have needed these new agents even if this resistance had not developed, because, of course, a certain amount of tolerance develops in any case. However, a significant part of our efforts to address this problem must be to demand the responsible and careful use of antibiotics, both in human medicine and in veterinary medicine. That includes providing specific diagnoses in human and veterinary medicine. It requires the use of one agent to deal with one particular pathogen and not, as is currently customary in human medicine, the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which is what has encouraged the developments that we are talking about. If we consider hospitals, the pathogens are constantly in contact with antibiotics, and that is exactly how this resistance that we are talking about today arises.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention the subject of hygiene. Everywhere I go I hear that hygiene in hospitals has deteriorated. The number of pathogens is rising here, and the development of MRSA pathogens is also increasing. Obviously it is right to carry out public relations work. However, it will not help anyone if we now, prematurely and out of fear, prohibit the use of antibiotics in certain areas without being certain of the consequences. Just like human medicine, veterinary medicine also depends on the use of these agents. That is something we need to take into consideration, as well as the consequences: if we do not use them in this area, what will happen then?</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the constant criticism of intensive livestock farming, I would like to say that I am a practitioner and veterinary surgeon myself. In my experience the animals in large housing units are healthier than those in small, uncomfortable units. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Far too little, I replied, but I also said that it is probably due to the fact that health care is an issue that does not primarily fall within the EU’s sphere of competence, but rather within that of the Member States. He then merely shook his head and said that if the EU does not do something about one of the biggest threats to our lives, with regard to which we are completely dependent on one another, then what is the purpose of the EU?</p>
<p class="contents">I actually quite understand this reaction, and I am very pleased that we will have this resolution tomorrow and that the Commission will present a proposal. I am quite convinced that the Commission will have practical proposals for how we are to produce new antibiotics.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to focus on something else and present a proposal that I hope you will be able to accept. One of the most important things to do, of course, is to produce comparable statistics that compare how antibiotics are used within the health-care sector in different Member States and in different regions, but also within animal husbandry in different countries, as well as how they are used for different animal species.</p>
<p class="contents">Based on these statistics, we would need to establish reduction targets, because there really is no reason why one country should have very high use of antibiotics and other countries should have low use. We would also have a good opportunity to analyse and learn from good examples and to see what it is that is driving up antibiotics use in certain countries compared with others.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously it should be the case, as many speakers have said, that people should only be able to receive antibiotics after a doctor has issued a diagnosis and written a prescription. However, it is equally clear that it must not be possible for animals to receive antibiotics without having been examined by a veterinary surgeon who has determined what disease the animal has, and who then prescribes antibiotics for that disease. It must not be the case that antibiotics are given to animals more casually than to children who are sick. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sometimes, you can draw from your own experiences and that is exactly what I am going to do here. I know from experience, from visits to doctors in Belgium and France, for example, that it seems as if those doctors do not want to disappoint you as a patient, and so you come back from the doctor with a big bag full of drugs, very often including antibiotics. To say nothing of a continent like Africa, where I was once advised to go up to a large sweet jar and take out a large handful of antibiotic pills!</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in my own country, the Netherlands, could not be more different. There, we are very careful about using antibiotics in humans. You almost have to go down on your knees and beg your doctor just to get some medicine for your illness, for heaven’s sake. On the other hand, farm animals in the Netherlands do not need to go down on their knees to beg for drugs: oh no, drugs are being pressed on them. They are given large amounts of unsolicited antibiotics without anybody asking their permission first. Unfortunately, the Netherlands has championed the use of antibiotics in animals.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms McAvan has just talked about the strong lobby of people who are raising questions about the link between the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry and resistance, which is now also affecting people. In the Netherlands, pig farmers and their families and people working on pig farms are treated in isolation wards in hospitals. Simply because of the risk of bacterial resistance. The risk is that high. The risks are so high that we should not allow this to run its course. I am therefore really pleased that Mr Dalli from the Commission is planning to come up with a very ambitious proposal. I hope that, after 18 November, this will be followed with firm legislation because, unfortunately, we cannot just leave this to Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is clearly a very broad consensus of opinion here about the problem and, I think, a very broad welcome for the Commissioner’s announcement of the timetable for his report.

<p class="contents">I would like to address a few remarks to the issue of veterinary use. We have heard about how difficult it is to get funding for research for new products for humans. It is doubly difficult in the case of animals. I totally agree that we should be promoting high standards of animal husbandry, but this is not just about high-intensity farming. The logic of a phase-out programme for prophylactics is absolutely clear, but may I please urge caution against a complete prohibition of such use. As a livestock farmer sometimes surrounded by infection, you do need to have that particular weapon in your armoury, albeit to be used sparingly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Resistance to antimicrobials and antibiotics, in particular, is a growing problem. The 25 000 deaths that occur annually in the EU cannot be justified by any means, and it is just as critical that many people end up trying to treat their health problems and die due to the cure, because they are affected by resistant bacteria. This is why health care, not being a business, cannot be dependent on interest or lack thereof from the pharmaceutical industry when developing new medicines.</p>
<p class="contents">This is merely a symptom, and a symptom of two things in particular: firstly, it is a symptom of the lack of public investment in this area and of the abuse of antibiotics; and secondly, and I would like to highlight this in particular, it is a symptom of the food industry and the way it has been using antibiotics. Therefore, as this is a public health problem, an economic problem, a social problem and a clinical problem, we have to go much further than producing new medicines.</p>
<p class="contents">What is at stake here is new research and new innovation. I apologise for repeating myself, but we should also be able to work better in terms of preventing and moderating our use of antibiotics. All initiatives are therefore welcome; although it is late in the day, they may still be effective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I also stand here as a farmer, I would just like to make that clear. However, I would also like to say that I am not your enemy. We understand and respect the fact that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which is also responsible for health, obviously has people’s health in mind first and foremost. I would also say to you that we in the agricultural sector also have questions. On 12 May this year, the farmers among us also tabled a resolution, which received broad agreement and discussed the same issues. However, it should not just be about the health and well-being of people. We also need to consider the health and well-being of animals. Commissioner, you are also presenting a strategic plan for animals, as that is part of your job, too. That is also something that we need to consider. It is important – and we agree in many respects: we must limit the use of antibiotics, but we must not prohibit them.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say one thing: I come from Germany. No farmer can use antibiotics in Germany without it first being approved by a veterinary surgeon and also documented. The documentation has to be retained and it has to be submitted. We will continue to need prophylactic antibiotics. Mastitis, an inflammation of the mammary tissue, is extremely painful for an animal. I am now speaking to the women here, one or two of whom may perhaps understand what I am talking about.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you have important tasks to do. I would urge you first to reveal what is happening in hospitals, how medicines are prescribed to people and for animals, how this is controlled and what is happening with regard to plants – because antibiotics are also relevant to plants, of course.

This means that approximately twice the amount of antibiotics is used in veterinary medicine. We have very clear indications that where more antibiotics are used, those strains also develop resistance. The Commissioner knows very well that he needs to consider these things together. However, I am convinced that today’s resolution is not intended to be a criticism of anybody in particular, but rather to signify an area of cooperation for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">In the individual Member States, we now have very good programmes for monitoring how medicines are used and dispensed. However, we need coordination and monitoring of the effects. We have already mentioned broad-spectrum antibiotics today. This is a case of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. In 1928, we had the wonderful discovery of penicillin and we regarded it as the super weapon to fight all infectious diseases. We now know that this weapon is no longer effective in many areas, because we – animals and people – are resistant.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider it to be an important task of the European Union not to leave the individual Member States to deal with this alone; instead we should combine our strength, knowledge and interests and work on the problem together, because – as has already been said today – if we do not succeed in finding a coordinated approach, the result will be a superbug. We do not want to arouse fear and we do not want to blame anyone; we simply want to find ways out of this crisis. We want there to be a super agent to fight infectious diseases in future, too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now, you might conclude from that that we all consider this a very urgent issue, and that would be a fine conclusion. However, what you might also read into that is that we are, perhaps, far too split on this issue. That is precisely where, in my opinion, we could put a finger on the sore spot. Our approach to this problem has been far too fragmented. This has become a livestock farming-versus-public health kind of debate, but both are inextricably linked and only an integral approach will provide us with a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, let us give credit where credit is due. This resolution does look at all the aspects but, in my view, it could have been more robust on certain points. I will first discuss livestock farming. It has rightly been pointed out that, despite some small steps forward, the use of antibiotics in livestock farming is still too high. In my native country, in the Netherlands, we have got all the stakeholders together round the table, from farmers to supermarkets, and together agreed to reduce the amount of antibiotics by 20% this year and by 50% in 2013. That is an ambitious target, Commissioner, and perhaps also an inspiration for the plans you are going to propose.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving next to antibiotic use in humans. In my opinion, the text is still far too soft on that issue. We have to monitor, we have to provide information, yes, that is all well and good, but it is a simple fact that selling antibiotics without a prescription is prohibited, pure and simple. Research has shown that, in some Member States, that prohibition is still being massively circumvented by pharmacies which are offering these products directly to consumers, including in cases where they do not have a prescription. We are rightly demanding considerable efforts from livestock farmers, but we are not going to resolve the problem of antibiotic resistance as long as people in Europe, in some Member States, continue to run to the pharmacy at the very first sign of a cold – and that is where I actually agree with the speaker from the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left – straight to the pharmacy for our next dose.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore pleased, Commissioner. We have often been at loggerheads in this Chamber, but on this occasion I am pleased with your proposal and, indeed, we could work to give it even more bite. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Merkies (S&amp;D). - </span></span>  <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, we are all firmly of the belief that resistance to antibiotics is a life-threatening risk: pneumonias that can no longer be treated, hospitals struggling with MRSA cases, outbreaks of the EHEC virus. On that we agree. You have said that it will be difficult for us to develop an approach, which is why I have come up with six rules for you on how to fight the development of resistance.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, let us stop prescribing antibiotics for preventive purposes. Instead, let us only prescribe them for curative purposes and, therefore, only administer antibiotics if the animal is ill, and then only the animal concerned and not, in the first instance, the whole barn. Treat a sick animal like a sick human. Just because one person in the European Parliament has an ear infection, it does not mean that the whole plenary sitting needs a course of antibiotics.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, prohibit the sale of antibiotics by veterinary surgeons directly to farmers. Make sure pharmacies, the middlemen, are properly informed that they should only dispense antibiotics on prescription. In Denmark, this has led to a direct and immediate decline in use.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, that will lead to greater supervision, which brings me to my third point: proper statistics for the use and prescription of antibiotics. We need statistics for individual diseases, individual animals and individual regions. That will enable us to draw comparisons, including when it comes to human diseases, and then we will have a greater insight into the possible transmission of diseases from animals to people and into the development of resistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, introduce a leader system. A reduction to minimum health and safety standards. That will enable us to find out what a safe minimum standard is. We need all Member States to comply with that health and safety minimum standard.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, be fully committed to research. It appears that only five of the fifteen leading global pharmaceutical companies are involved in antibiotics research. We have an ambition to become a Union of Innovation and that means that we have to prevent fragmentation and duplication. Let us fully commit to research and explore the possible alternatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, put an end to intensive livestock farming, change our meat-eating habits, because that is where it all starts. That is the long and short of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ms Grossetête has already said many times that we need to take very clear action now so that we do not at some point move into a post-antibiotics era. I very much welcome the fact that the Commission is also going to submit plans for combating antibiotics resistance this year.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the Commission’s plans should take into account four particularly important issues. Firstly, the rather casual use of antibiotics in human medicine. Veterinary medicine is certainly important, but the fact that we have antibiotics resistance in humans is primarily down to the casual use of antibiotics in humans. Therefore, we really need to be more sensible in this regard, for example provide more accurate diagnoses before we treat people. We need to know which pathogen is involved so that we can treat the person in a targeted way.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is that multi-resistant bacteria need to be identified, for example in patients who have been taken to hospital, so that these pathogens do not spread there with dangerous consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue is livestock breeding and veterinary medicine. There is a connection here. We have been assured of this once again by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. It is not the main problem and it does not involve all pathogens. It exists, however, and therefore we need to monitor it very carefully.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth issue is that we need to encourage the industry and in so doing also consider new, innovative rules for how we can place new antibiotics on the market, because the industry is faced with a dilemma in that it might invests half a billion euros in the development of a new antibiotic, and then we say: ‘because it is a reserve antibiotic, it has to be placed in a safe and you must not actually use it’. It is not a particularly good business model to pay out a lot of money for something that later is not permitted to be sold.</p>
<p class="contents">We need new solutions for this. We are confident that the Commission will include all of these solutions in the action plan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

People are dying from nosocomial infections and MRA – and nothing can stop these killer bugs. In the past, useless over-prescribing by doctors (and I happen to be one of them) of antibiotics for viral infections was blamed, but in recent years the issue of massive doses being given in animal feeds as growth promoters was also blamed and investigated and the practice was eventually banned.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we need to look again at the routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis in animal husbandry. Sometimes it is used to mask poor animal welfare and hygiene, which is clearly unacceptable. However, it is logical that overuse of antibiotics by farmers and vets will eventually lead to microbial resistance in human pathogens. We therefore need more scientific research to settle this controversial issue, but in the meantime I urge farmers and vets to be very cautious. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What can I say? I am greatly invigorated by the comments that I have heard from all sides of this Chamber and I can say that at present we are finalising the communication that will be presented to the European Parliament and to the Council – unless we find unexpected hitches – on 17 November. I hope that will lead to a creative debate and a concrete plan of action that will see us fight and reduce antimicrobial resistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Basically – and I am not going to repeat the various comments that have been made in this House – the issue is prudent use and research. Prudent use in the human health sphere, both through the discipline of practitioners in prescribing (and I totally agree that we have to move to prescription-only antibiotics) and in the case of patients, who have to be educated in how to use antibiotic medicines. The misuse of antibiotics, even if prescribed, can lead to a continuation of this hazard.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning animal husbandry, I believe that we are realising that this is a key issue and that the abuse of antibiotics in veterinary medicinal products and medicated feed is one cause of the problems that we are facing today. Therefore I believe that concrete action in this regard is also going to be called for.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning research, what I can say is that the Commission is fully committed to exploring, with all relevant stakeholders, how to ensure the development of new effective antimicrobials, stimulate antimicrobial development and promote and support research and innovation in this area. We are already in preliminary discussions on this issue, and I hope that we can pull together all European resources to really concentrate and focus on fighting this and creating new medicines as new antibiotics. But I have to remind this House – and I have to remind everybody – that creating new molecules, new medicine, is not the solution. It is the appropriate use of antibiotics that is the solution to this problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Resistance to antibiotics concerns all microorganisms and all antibiotics, but the greatest threat is posed by the group of what are known as ‘alert pathogens’. Therefore, all possible measures should be put in place to enable the activity of currently-available antibiotics to be maintained for as long as possible. I agree with Ms Grossetête of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), who thinks that controlling the use of antibiotics in veterinary and human medicine is one of the most important measures which can be used with regard to reducing the problem of drug resistance. I agree, too, with the statements made by Ms McAvan of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and Mr Skylakakis of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, and also with what was said by Mr Wojciechowski of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group, who drew attention to the poor conditions of production on large industrial farms. The contributions of the other speakers are also helpful in building a strategy and showing the way forward, and can certainly be used as a foundation for further action by the Council and also, I think, by the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, the Member States need to strengthen the intersectoral system for coordinating implementation of national strategy on preventing the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria and for exchanging information and coordinating work in this area with the European Commission, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and other Member States. It is also essential to ensure greater coordination of the work of laboratories which monitor drug-resistant bacterial infections and to facilitate the creation of a platform for the exchange and processing of data obtained from monitoring. To this end, it is necessary to set up a European network of reference laboratories which monitor resistance to antibiotics and carry out molecular typing for epidemiological purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, it is extremely important to intensify basic research on drug resistance, cooperation between primary and reference laboratories, and ongoing training in the area of rational antibiotic therapy and infection control for people working in the medical and related professions. In view of the importance of the current situation, European Union measures should be put in place in several different areas, such as intensification of the monitoring of drug-resistant bacterial infections and antibiotic consumption, research into reservoirs of resistance in man and in animals raised in the wild, development of basic research, and education of people working in the medical and related professions and of all of society.</p>
<p class="contents">In closing, I would like to say I am sure that the Danish Presidency will facilitate a thorough and in-depth discussion in this area, and the solutions it proposes will become Council Conclusions and be adopted at the meeting of ministers of health to be held in June 2012. We are waiting for the very important document which Mr Dalli has said will be presented next month and which will also provide a basis for further intensive work for the good of the whole of society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is illustrated clearly by the fact that each year at least 25 000 patients in the EU die from infections caused by bacteria which are resistant to many drugs, and that as a result of the infections these cause, the EU faces additional healthcare expenditure every year and losses amounting to approximately EUR 1.5 billion. Undoubtedly, there is a need for complex measures which would help address the issue of antimicrobial resistance and which would cover monitoring and strengthening control of the use of authorised antimicrobials for humans and animals, increase incentives to find new antimicrobials and reduce the chance of resistance spreading from animals to humans through the food chain or direct contact. This phenomenon clearly has cross-border implications, and therefore I share this concern over the use of antimicrobials and wish to draw attention to a series of shortfalls and gaps in the promotion of the prudent use of antimicrobials which were identified by the latest Eurobarometer survey and encourage the European Commission to investigate trends relating to inappropriate antimicrobial use and to present as soon as possible a legislative package for combating antimicrobial resistance which would promote initiatives for responsible use and appropriate information for consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
