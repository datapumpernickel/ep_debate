<p>(FR) A conventional cooperation agreement between the Community and Syria has been in force since 1978. On the basis of the 1995 Barcelona Declaration, new-generation agreements, known as Euro-Mediterranean association agreements, which encompass not only economic but also political, social and cultural cooperation, have been concluded with most of the countries involved in the Barcelona Process. Syria was the final such country with which negotiations had not been concluded. In October 2004, an agreement was initialled by the Commission at chief-negotiator level. The agreement still has to be signed and, subsequently, ratified by both parties thereto. Since this is a shared-competences agreement, it requires, from the Union’s point of view, ratification by both the Community and the Member States. The European Parliament will be asked to give its assent thereto.</p>
<p>The agreement as negotiated reflects the progress made by the European Union’s external policy. The substance thereof is ambitious and modern. It includes the foundations required to commit Syria along the path towards economic and political reforms and regional cooperation. The provisions relating to political dialogue and cooperation are also extremely ambitious. The agreement is based on respect for human rights, which constitutes a key clause. Cooperation is envisaged in the fight against terrorism and, for the first time in a Euro-Mediterranean agreement, with regard to the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Furthermore, the parties to the agreement have declared their determination to contribute towards the prosperity, stability and security of the Mediterranean region and to create a climate of understanding and tolerance among cultures.</p>
<p>In December 2004, the Commission submitted a proposal to the Council with a view to the agreement being signed. The Council is currently waiting for the Commission to forward to it the annexes and protocols to the said agreement, together with the translations thereof into the official languages of the EU, so that it may act on the proposal for a decision submitted by the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0199"></a>

<p>(FR) Cooperation between the EU and the Caribbean region is covered by the partnership between the EU and the ACP (African, Caribbean and Pacific) States under the Cotonou Agreement. The regional cooperation provided for in that agreement covers a wide spectrum of mutual concerns, ranging from infrastructure to the environment and health via education, research and development, and the fight against drugs, organised crime, money-laundering, fraud and corruption. A regional political dialogue is also provided for in the field of conflict-prevention and conflict-settlement, human rights and democratisation, trade, the networking of civil society, etc. Following the recent revision of the Cotonou Agreement, new topics, such as the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the International Criminal Court, will enable that dialogue to be widened.</p>
<p>The meeting between the Heads of State or Government of the Caribbean ACP States (CARIFORUM) and the EU Troika, held on 29 May 2004, constitutes the most recent embodiment of the dialogue. At that meeting, the EU emphasised the importance that it attaches to common values such as respect for the rule of law, democracy, human rights and people-centred development. Similarly, the EU reaffirmed its determination to contribute to the worldwide campaign against all forms of terrorism and to promote international peace and security, in due compliance with the UN Charter and international law. Other topics, such as the enlargement of the EU, the fight against HIV/AIDS and the negotiations under way for a regional Economic Partnership Agreement were also addressed.</p>
<p>In this respect, the Council would recall that the development of this political dialogue is closely connected with these other, equally crucial, negotiations. The Caribbean region is one of the six ACP regions with which negotiations for a regional Economic Partnership Agreement are under way. As you are, no doubt, aware, the objective is to strengthen regional integration and facilitate development by taking measures designed to strengthen the competitiveness of local industries and promote diversification. The Council receives regular updates about the progress of the negotiations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0201"></a>

<p>(EN) From the beginning of the Darfur conflict, the EU has put substantial pressure on the parties to guarantee free and unconditional access for humanitarian aid, to protect and ensure the security of the civil population, and for a negotiated solution to the conflict. In particular, the EU has been exerting pressure on the Sudanese Government to deliver on its commitments and live up to the demands expressed by the international community as reflected in the UN Security Council Resolutions 1556, 1564 and 1574 and in the various set of conclusions adopted by the Council (General Affairs and External Relations) in recent months.</p>
<p>The Council has been closely monitoring the fulfilment of these demands and has given its full support to three further Security Council Resolutions passed in March. UNSCR 1591 imposes targeted sanctions against those responsible for prolonging the ongoing conflict and humanitarian conflict in Darfur. This will be closely implemented with the existing EU arms embargo. UNSCR 1590 mandates the deployment of a UN Peace Support Operation of up to 10,000 troops and UNSCR 1593 refers the situation to the International Criminal Court. The Council welcomes these developments which demonstrate the strong stance the UN is prepared to take in Darfur and the wider Sudan. Referral to the ICC is a very encouraging development for both Sudan and for the wider international community. It sends a strong message that impunity for crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide will end. The EU will continue to press all the parties to abide by their commitments and to fully implement the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0203"></a>

<p>At the end of a meeting of the Ministerial Quartet held on 1 March 2005, on the sidelines of the London Conference to support the Palestinian Authority, a declaration was made setting out the concrete actions for the forthcoming stages:</p>
<p>Reinforced activity in the field of security, involving General Ward from the USA, who had recently been appointed security coordinator, and the EU team of police advisers;</p>
<p>In connection with the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and a northern section of the West Bank, there was additional need for financial support to the Palestinians. This support should be rapidly mobilised through a conference of donors grouped within the AHLC that should be convened as early as possible and focus on 'pledging'.</p>

<p>(FR) The European Union is ready to do everything in its power to ensure that the United States is once more involved in the multilateral process to deal with climate change.</p>
<p>The Kyoto Protocol’s entry into force on 16 February 2005 provides a further legal basis for international efforts to combat climate change and should offer an example of effective worldwide cooperation for all countries that have not yet ratified the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p>The fact that 144 Parties have ratified the Protocol to date sends a clear signal that this legally binding instrument setting out commitments in figures to limit or reduce emissions is an essential multilateral instrument in combating climate change.</p>
<p>The Conference of Parties acting as a meeting of Parties will begin examination of the commitments for the period after 2012 at least seven years before the end of the initial commitment period (2008-2012), that is, in November 2005. It is important that all Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, including the United States, are involved in the negotiations to achieve a post-2012 climate regime for the whole world.</p>
<p>During the EU-US Summit of 22 February 2005, President Bush recognised the existence of the serious problem of climate change and expressed the hope of working with the EU to find solutions, especially in the area of research and technology, and of developing clean technologies, also with the involvement of emerging powers such as India and China.</p>
<p>The recent Spring European Council has sent out a strong message on this subject, stressing that it attaches the highest importance to the widest possible national cooperation and participation and that the EU is firmly committed to giving new impetus to international negotiations. On that basis, the Luxembourg Presidency will have bilateral meetings with some key countries in the climate change process.</p>

<p>The work of employees of the EU's fishing and maritime industry deserves greater social recognition.</p>
<p>Owing to my links with the Balearic Isles, I would like to draw attention to the work carried out by the fishing community of Palma de Mallorca. Over the last few years, these people have become involved in cleaning up the waters for purely altruistic reasons by placing themselves and their vessels at the disposal of Palma de Mallorca City Council. Their help has prevented an average of 250 tonnes of waste being washed up onto local beaches.</p>
<p>In view of the great many tourists that visit the islands, the region's fishing community would like to launch what is known as 'fishing tourism' in order to show visitors what working in the fishing industry entails. This is a new form of tourism that already exists in other Member States, such as Italy, and enables fishermen to acquaint people with the work they do while earning a living by occupying themselves with something other than the arduous work of fishing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this work is unknown to the vast majority of the population. This being the case, what is the Council's view on this kind of initiative, which should help to improve the sector's image by familiarising people with the work of fishermen and boosting the fishing community's recognition among other sections of the population?

<p>(FR) As the honourable Member is no doubt aware, in the field of tourism, competence lies largely with the Member States at the present time.

Against this backdrop, it has always supported attempts, including those of the UN Secretary General, at a comprehensive settlement of the problem and has, moreover, recognised that this aim can only be achieved if there is a gradual rapprochement between the two communities. The proposal made by the government of the Republic of Cyprus, to which the honourable Member refers, could be considered within this context, but it is not for the Council to express its opinion at this stage. Mr Tassos Papadopoulos, the President of the Republic of Cyprus, recently discussed this proposal with the Luxembourg Presidency and with a number of EU leaders and Commission representatives. The Cyprus question remains on the agenda of the UN Security Council.</p>
<p>At the same time, the EU is involved in looking into potential ways of ending the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots, and in facilitating the reunification of Cyprus by fostering economic development in the Turkish Cypriot community. Some measures have been taken to this end, such as the ‘green line’ regulation, adopted in 2004 and recently amended in order to widen its scope of application and to enhance its effectiveness. A considerable amount of work has also been done on other measures, such as Commission proposals on financial aid (release of EUR 259 million already earmarked for Northern Cyprus in the event of a settlement) and direct trade between Northern Cyprus and the rest of the European Union. It is not yet possible to adopt these two proposals because some difficulties must be overcome, not least with regard to the direct trade.</p>

<p>(EN) The European Council held on 16 and 17 December 2004 discussed the arms embargo on China and invited the Luxembourg Presidency to finalise the well-advanced work in order to allow for a decision on this matter. The European Council recalled ‘the importance of the criteria of the Code of conduct on arms exports, in particular criteria regarding human rights, stability and security in the region and the national security of friendly and allied countries’. These conclusions are still valid.</p>
<p>The Council has always followed very closely the developments in North East Asia. The Council therefore reacted on the anti-secession law on the day of its adoption, asking all parties to avoid any unilateral action which might rekindle cross-Straits tensions. The EU would be concerned if this law were to invalidate some recent signs of reconciliation between the two shores.</p>
<p>The Council is not in a position to indicate whether or when the arms embargo on China would be lifted. Work on the Code of Conduct on arms sales and its ‘toolbox’ is still going on in the Council’s instances.

<p>Property belonging to St Afrem's church in Botes (Bardakci), consisting mainly of land, was confiscated in 1984 under procedures which violated a convention. Since then, the land has been used by people loyal to the Turkish State - armed village guards, to be precise. The area of land confiscated is 101 ha.</p>

<p>In 2000, the Turkish State destroyed a whole district of the same village, comprising some 50 historic buildings, which belonged to the Assyrians/Syrians. Previously, likewise in the same village, the Turkish State had converted the Syrian Catholic St Mary's Church into a mosque.</p>
<p>The Turkish State has also confiscated large areas of real estate belonging to Assyrians/Syrians, Armenians and Greeks in other villages in the region. In addition, on 1 March 2005 the Turkish State sold off real estate in Istanbul belonging to Armenian church foundations.</p>

<p>(FR) The events to which the honourable Member refers form part of the overall question of religious freedom in Turkey. The Council has already underlined several times, in response to questions of a similar nature in this House (<a href="#defann_17_1" name="refann_17_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>), that despite the fact that the Turkish Constitution safeguards freedom of religious observance, certain conditions necessary to the functioning of non-Muslim religious communities, in line with practices in force in EU Member States, have yet to be established. In its 2004 regular report, the Commission acknowledged that Turkey had made some progress in this regard, but that numerous gaps remained to be plugged, such as the legal personality and the property rights of non-Muslim communities, along with the training of clergy. Against this backdrop, an important draft Law on Foundations is still being analysed by Turkish ministers. The Commission – on the invitation of the Turkish authorities – has provided comments on this draft, which is now at the revision stage.</p>
<p>The European Council of 16 and 17 December 2004 clearly indicated that full and effective implementation of political reform in Turkey should continue to be monitored closely. The Commission was called upon to look into all matters of concern detailed in its regular report and its recommendation – including, of course, religious freedom – and to report regularly on such matters to the Council.</p>
<p>The Council can therefore reaffirm that it will continue to follow closely Turkey’s progress in this area, via the mechanism of a partnership for accession setting out the priorities for the reform process, of which a draft revised text will be forwarded to the Council by the Commission in autumn. Furthermore, as in the past, the Union will ensure that any outstanding questions are raised in the various political fora and in the bodies set up as part of the Association Agreement.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) With regard to GSP Plus, the Council wishes to inform the honourable Member that, once the new GSP has entered into force, the special regime aimed at fostering sustainable development and good governance (GSP+) should apply to developing countries that are deemed vulnerable, provided that they comply with international standards on fundamental rights, workers’ rights, the environment and good governance. The countries in question would benefit from zero rates of duty (ad valorem and specific rates), which would be granted on the basis of objective criteria to a small group of countries.</p>
<p>GSP+ will enter into force along with the remainder of the regulation. As things stand, the talks on the new scheme have yet to reach a conclusion and the Council is doing all it can in order to find a quick solution.</p>
<p>With regard to graduation, the Council stresses that preferential tariffs granted under the banner of GSP+ (as under the general regime) should of course only be provisional. As soon as the average over three consecutive years of Community imports of a product from a beneficiary country exceeds 15% of total EU imports of the same product from countries under the GSP, that product will be withdrawn from the list of products eligible for preferential tariffs. This is what is known as graduation. The Council is continuing to work towards setting a graduation threshold for textiles.</p>
<p>With regard to the general regime, the other countries affected by the tsunami should benefit from a general GSP regime, which is much more advantageous than the current regime, given the increased number of products covered under the new scheme (300 extra tariff lines) and the accession to the EU of ten new Member States. Graduation by section would also have the effect of reducing the number of graduated products for Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan and Thailand. It is not possible to apply an alternative tariff to those countries, as the GSP must be non-discriminatory.</p>
<p>The Council is aware of the interest, among the countries in question, in benefiting as quickly as possible from the introduction of GSP+. The Presidency will therefore continue to make determined efforts to conclude its talks in the Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0254"></a>

<p>(FR) The Council wishes to inform the honourable Member that the question of extending the trans-European transport networks to the Mediterranean, and to other neighbouring countries of the Union, was, following the Van Miert report, the subject of a ministerial seminar ‘A Wider Europe for Transport’ which was jointly organised by Mrs Loyola de Palacio, Vice-President of the Commission, and Mr Costa, chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, in Santiago de Compostela on 7 and 8 June 2004.</p>
<p>Following the seminar, a new high-level group was set up by the Commission, the aim of which is to draw up proposals for better links between the EU and its neighbours by means of an efficient transport network that is properly up and running by the year 2020. This high-level group, entitled ‘Extension of the major trans-European transport axes to the neighbouring countries and regions’, which is made up of representatives from the 24 third countries that border the Union, met for the first time on 18 and 19 October 2004 and is still carrying out its work, both in plenary and in regional groups divided into an eastern Mediterranean group and a western Mediterranean group. It is due to submit a report during the second half of 2005.

<p>(FR) The Council wishes to remind the honourable Member that he received an answer to an identical question during the July 2003 part-session. On that occasion, the Council was able to detail the actions and the information rights that it had at the time put in place in order to facilitate lobbyists’ access to information and documents. The Council has continued along this path, but points out that, on the one hand, it is incumbent upon all Member States to establish the mechanisms whereby their representatives in the Council set out their positions, and, on the other hand, that it can only act on the basis of a Commission proposal in the direction that the honourable Member wishes to see. At present no such proposal exists. It also wishes to stress the different nature of relations between the lobbyists and Parliament, the Commission and the Council, bearing in mind their respective institutional roles.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Council wishes to point out that a practice has developed in the area of transparency and access to documents, the real beneficiaries of which are professional associations. Provisions have in fact been laid down to provide representatives of these associations with access, under certain conditions, to the Council’s press centre during ministerial meetings. Furthermore, Members of the Council’s General Secretariat, in particular the press service, are at the disposal of representatives from interest groups to keep them abreast of the outcome of ministerial meetings.

<p>(EN) In response to the honourable Member’s question about the validity of animal testing, the Commission would like first to express its strong conviction that animal testing should be minimised as far as possible, and that all efforts should be put into development of alternative methods.</p>
<p>Now, to address the question put forward by the honourable Member, it is often argued that results of animal tests are not valid in order to predict effects on humans. For that reason – and to try to give an answer to these concerns –, the Commission requested its Scientific Committee for Toxicity, Eco-toxicity and Environment (CSTEE) to assess the validity of animal testing.</p>
<p>In its opinion of 8 January 2004, the Scientific Committee for Toxicity, Eco-toxicity and Environment stated that scientific literature is full of examples demonstrating that animal models are good predictors for chemically-induced disorders in humans.</p>
<p>Certainly, there may be differences in responses between animals and humans, but they are most often of a quantitative, rather than a qualitative, nature.</p>
<p>Finally, the Scientific Committee for Toxicity, Eco-toxicity and Environment notes that there are exceptions to this rule: there are some chemicals that induce toxic effects in humans that are not seen in animals, and vice versa: some chemically-induced diseases in humans have not been modelled in animals. However, according to the Scientific Committee, these are the exceptions rather than the rule.</p>
<p>Development of alternative methods and assessment of the validity of test methods fall within the competence of my colleague Commissioner Potocnik, and I will respond to this part of the question on his behalf.</p>
<p>Before new test guidelines can be accepted into Community legislation, their scientific validity has to be established. This is done by national co-ordinators from the Member States through meetings steered by the European Chemicals Bureau (ECB), as part of the Commission’s Joint Research Centre.</p>
<p>The development, validation and use of alternative methods have been a priority for the Commission for quite some time. Specifically, there have been four main strands of activity.</p>
<p>Firstly, the development of in vitro tests as alternatives to animal experiments has been a priority for the various European Community research programmes since 1985.</p>
<p>The Commission is funding development of novel alternative, non-animal testing methods through two specific parts of the current ‘Sixth Framework Programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities, contributing to the creation of the European Research Area and to innovation (2002 to 2006)’<a href="#defann_26_1" name="refann_26_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></p>
<p>So far, € 39 million has been allocated for projects in this area, and additional calls for proposals will be published in the forthcoming months. In the 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme, the development of alternative test methods will be further pursued under two priorities, Priority 1, ‘Health’, and Priority 6, ‘Environment’.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Commission supports validation of alternative methods through Directorate General JR<a href="#defann_26_2" name="refann_26_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM). ECVAM ensures the necessary information flow on supported projects and transfer of results obtained.</p>
<p>Thirdly, to speed up the use of alternative methods, the Commission proposes their inclusion as a matter of priority in the relevant Community legislation as appropriate.</p>
<p>Finally, to promote alternative methods to animal tests on the international level, the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods is working closely with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in the validation, acceptance and promotion of alternative methods. It is a major success that, in 2004, the OECD adopted, for the first time, alternative methods that are aiming at replacing animal tests (they are in particular used for skin absorption, skin corrosion, photo-toxicity).</p>
<p>The Commission takes also a leading role in the international regulatory dialogues with authorities in the United States and Japan. This is very important to facilitate mutual recognition, acceptance and implementation of scientifically validated testing methods.</p>
<p>In addition, in order to speed up the use of alternative methods, the 7th Amendment of the Cosmetics Directive 76/768/EEC established in 2003 new provisions related to non-animal testing of cosmetic finished products and ingredients. The amendments will gradually introduce an animal testing ban for cosmetics, and a marketing ban for cosmetic products which were tested on animals.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission has set up an Ad Hoc Group with representatives from industry, academia, animal welfare groups and governmental bodies to monitor the progress in this field.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission would not agree that the assessed national allocation plans have been too generous. The 22 national allocation plans adopted so far allocate a total of 1786 million tonnes per year. This is 63 million tonnes less than the amount initially proposed by these Member States.</p>
<p>The Commission is satisfied with the allocation amounts it has approved. The current price of EU carbon dioxide allowances, which is at present above 10 €, indicates that financial markets believe that the allocation process has succeeded in generating the scarcity of allowances that is necessary to enable trading.</p>
<p>If there are differences between the levels of scarcity imposed by different Member States, that is due to their varying distance from their respective emission reduction targets under the Kyoto Protocol. This distance is determined by the Member State’s target, its past efforts to reduce emissions and the growth of its economy. It is not the purpose of national allocation plans to eliminate such differences.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is for the Member States to decide in which sectors they intend to achieve any required emission reductions. Some choose to concentrate on emission reductions outside the scope of the emissions trading Directive, while some choose to resort to buying emission reductions from abroad by using the Kyoto Protocol’s flexible mechanisms. These differences in approach are allowed by the Directive, although the Commission will always ensure that the Treaty’s provisions on State aid and fair competition are fully respected by Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0223"></a>

<p>(EN) While the object addresses a particular issue – bushmeat -which has already been dealt with in a letter to the honourable Member by the Commissioner in charge of Development and Humanitarian Aid dated 22 March 2005, the question is much wider and addresses the extinction of species and the loss of biodiversity. The Commission’s reply will therefore focus on the latter.</p>
<p>The Commission is fully aware of the fact that the world is losing biodiversity at land and sea at an unprecedented rate. Biodiversity is fundamental for human livelihoods and halting its loss is key to achieve Millennium Development Goals on, for example, poverty, sanitation, health and environment. Heads of States have agreed at the World Summit on Sustainable Development to significantly reduce the rate of biodiversity loss globally by 2010 – and, at the EU Göteborg Summit, to halt biodiversity loss in the EU by 2010. The European Community is a party to the Convention on Biological Diversity and fully committed to achieve these 2010 targets, which also implies reducing the rate of species extinction. The Commission has repeatedly said that biodiversity is one of its top priorities. The Commission is currently preparing a Communication to the Council and Parliament on Biodiversity scheduled for adoption in November 2005. It will address both the EU and the global dimension (including for example development cooperation and trade in endangered species). Preparations are already well advanced. This Communication will be the Commission’s response to the ‘Message from Malahide’ which resulted from an important stakeholder conference- which the Commission organised with the Irish Presidency in May 2004 in Malahide, Ireland, and which achieved a broad degree of stakeholder consensus on priority objectives and targets towards meeting the 2010 commitments. The Communication will provide a road map specifying priority actions – for both the Commission and Member States - towards meeting the 2010 targets.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0232"></a>

<p>(EN) This important proposal will put in place a legislative framework that will contribute to the reduction of emissions of the fluorinated greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol and thereby help to meet the European Union's and Member States’ Kyoto targets and beyond.</p>
<p>In the Political Agreement on the Commission’s proposal, reached at Luxembourg on the 14.10.2004, the Council took a decision to change its form. The ‘package’ now consists of two elements, a proposal for a Directive dealing specifically with the issue of hydrofluorocarbons in mobile air conditioning systems in motor vehicles which will become one element of the EC type approval system for cars, and a proposal for a Regulation to cover the remainder of the original Commission proposal.</p>
<p>The Commission agreed to this change of form on the basis that the two elements are considered as an overall integrated package, notably with a view to fully guarantee the environmental ambition of the overall proposal. The Council agreed to this and it is reflected in the recitals to the Political Agreement.</p>
<p>As regards the legal base, the Commission accepts, as suggested by the Council, that the Directive should be based on Article 95 alone, and that the Regulation should have a dual legal basis of Article 175 and Article 95 in relation to Articles 7, 8 and 9 of the Regulation. This was reflected in the Political Agreement reached in October last year.</p>
<p>The three articles based on Article 95 concern labelling requirements, and marketing and use restrictions. This legal base is the appropriate one considering the clear implications of these articles in terms of single market and free circulation of goods.</p>
<p>The Commission does not believe that there is a sound case for splitting the Regulation into two separate instruments. The Regulation and indeed the whole proposal must be seen as an overall package that aims to reduce emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases. This proposal is only a first step, the review clause in the Regulation provides a platform for further evaluation and where appropriate additional measures which need to be handled in a coherent and integrated manner.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0251"></a>

<p>(EN) The climate change impact of aviation has grown a lot in recent years and will grow further if nothing is done. The Commission is currently considering what possible EU action to recommend, and expects to present a Communication later this year. This will focus on the use of economic instruments to cut emissions. The options being considered include fuel taxation, emissions charges and inclusion of aviation in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. The feasibility of the last option is currently being studied, and it is too early to say if this option could be implemented and if so how and when.</p>
<p>One of the problems of international aviation emissions is that they are not allocated to national inventories under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Consequently, these emissions do not count against the Kyoto targets and what share of them each State is accountable for is unclear. Furthermore, although covered in the UNFCCC, the obligation to take specific action is only mentioned in the Kyoto Protocol, which some Parties to the Convention have not ratified. In addition to EU action, the Commission believes this situation should be remedied in any international post-2012 climate regime.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0252"></a>

<p>(EN) The question refers to the environmental controls carried out in Greece but also in some other Member States regarding the implementation of the European environmental legislation. According to the question most of these inspections and controls take place only during the phase of granting an environmental permit and therefore are inadequate for an effective implementation of the environmental legislation.</p>
<p>The Recommendation 2001/331/EC of the Parliament and the Council providing the Minimum Criteria for Environmental Inspections in the Member States<a href="#defann_31_1" name="refann_31_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Recommendation’) seeks to improve the enforcement of environmental law in the Member States by establishing plans for environmental inspections, performing site visits and by investigating serious accidents, incidents and occurrences of non-compliance.</p>
<p>The Recommendation applies to all industrial installations and other enterprises and facilities, whose air emissions and/or water discharges and/or waste disposal or recovery activities are subject to authorisation, permit or licensing requirements under Community law, without prejudice to specific inspection provisions in existing Community legislation.</p>
<p>Although it is a formal legal act, the provisions of the Recommendation are not binding for the Member States. However, all Member States have submitted reports based on point VIII of the Recommendation, which invites them to report to the Commission on their experience of the operation of this recommendation using, to the extent possible, any data available from regional and local inspecting authorities.</p>
<p>As far as the Seveso-II-Directive 96/82/EC of the Council, for the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances<a href="#defann_31_2" name="refann_31_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, is concerned, on-site inspections should in principle be carried out at least every 12 months unless the competent authority has established a programme of inspections based upon a systematic appraisal of major-accident hazards. However, this obligation only applies to establishments where dangerous substances are present in quantities equal to or in excess of the thresholds in Annex I, parts 1 and 2.</p>
<p>The Commission has launched a technical assessment of the Member State reports to analyse the completeness and plausibility of the reported data, and to technically assess whether the entire scope of application of the Recommendation is covered, including an assessment of the adequacy of inspections and inspection systems in each Member State vis-à-vis requirements of the Directives in the four sectors covered by the Recommendation (water, air, waste, integrated pollution prevention and control).</p>
<p>In the light of the findings of the technical assessment and taking into account any further information about the inspection systems in the Member States, the Commission will assess their effectiveness and will possibly consider reviewing the Recommendation with a view to address any shortcomings and gaps in its implementation in the Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the issues raised by this question and has already expressed its view in its replies to previous written questions (<a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2005-0506_EN.html">E-506/05</a> and <a href="/doceo/document/P-6-2005-0916_EN.html">P-916/05</a>). After clarifying the situation regarding the current and future treatment of the sludge, the Commission will refer to the measures it has taken.</p>
<p>The construction of the Psytallia waste water treatment station was co-financed by the Cohesion Fund. The whole scheme has now been fully operational since December 2004 and ensures a tertiary treatment of the waste water discharged into the Gulf of Saronikos. Before the operation of the tertiary treatment, 300 tons of sludge were produced per day; this quantity will almost triple (to 800 tons per day). Until now, the sludge has been transported untreated by boat and lorry to the Ano Liosia landfill site on the mainland.</p>
<p>With respect to the treatment of the sludge produced, the Commission approved in December 2004 a Cohesion Fund project for 48.55 Mio € (75% co-financing). On the basis of the solution approved by the Greek authorities, the drying of the sludge is endorsed. A plant will be constructed on the island of Psytallia and will convert the sludge through drying into solid material, which can be disposed of in appropriate installations. No residues are expected to be produced by this process. The project is expected to be completed by the end of 2007 and to definitely resolve the current treatment sludge problem.</p>
<p>The question refers to the transitional proposal for the treatment of the sludge, which aims to provide a temporary solution to the current sludge problem. This proposal concerns the treatment of the sludge already stored on the island as well as the sludge which will be produced on a daily basis until the proposed drying plant becomes operational at the end of 2007. The Commission has not been involved in the selection of this project for a temporary solution, which is being undertaken by the Greek authorities without any Community co-funding. According to the information available, a specific tender has been completed with regard to the method to be used for the temporary treatment of the sludge to be produced until the completion of the proposed drying plant. However, the commencement of the works is still pending. The Commission understands from its contacts with the Greek authorities that all relevant environmental legislation will be respected with regard to this temporary solution, which is expected to receive all the necessary authorisations in the coming months, after the detailed plans and operational aspects are fully elaborated.</p>
<p>The Commission is not satisfied with the current treatment of sludge and, in accordance with Article 226 EC Treaty, it initiated infringement procedure against Greece. In July 2003, the Commission issued a Reasoned Opinion on the basis that Greece had failed to comply with the requirements of Directive 91/271/EEC concerning urban waste-water treatment<a href="#defann_33_1" name="refann_33_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and Directive 75/442/EEC on waste<a href="#defann_33_2" name="refann_33_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. The reply of the Greek authorities and the recent developments are being analysed and the Commission will not hesitate to take all necessary measures to ensure that Greece complies with Community environmental legislation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission can assure the honourable Member that it remains ready to support any compromise which would finally allow the adoption of the long-awaited regulations (aid and trade).</p>
<p>More generally, the Commission remains ready to support any initiative to solve the Cyprus issue. The decision of the European Council to open accession negotiations with Turkey, the EU membership of the Republic of Cyprus and the likely success of the pro-European forces in the northern part of the island in the next elections could create sufficient momentum for a new initiative with a successful perspective. While it is clear that the talks have to take place under the aegis of the United Nations, the Commission is ready to play a more active and a more prominent role in future talks, as the Cyprus issue is more and more becoming a European Union issue very much related to the EU acquis communautaire.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0227"></a>

Even the proposed or adopted reforms regarding the recognition of Kurdish identity appear to have been stopped or have not been implemented on the ground. Our assessments show, among other things, that the authorities are currently exerting enormous pressure on Kurds who stand up for their rights. For example, action is being taken against the use of the Kurdish language in public, people are being strongly discouraged from giving their children Kurdish names, and education in their mother tongue is available to Kurdish children only at private institutions. The logical consequence of the European Council’s conclusions should be that, in the event of a serious and persistent breach of the principles of freedom, democracy and human rights, negotiations may not be opened.

<p>(EN) It is still too early to make a detailed assessment of the replies given to the Commission’s questionnaire. This is a complex process, involving all the Commission’s services, and our pre-assessment work is still going on.</p>
<p>It requires in particular looking at any significant divergences between the legislation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the acquis communautaire, as well as at analysing the country’s administrative capacity in all sectors. It also includes obtaining further clarifications and updates from the authorities of the country.</p>
<p>At the same time the Commission reviews the implementation of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement in the sub-committees it has set up with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The Commission is also engaged in a dialogue with the authorities of the country on a number of areas of particular sensitive nature since they mostly deal with what are called the political criteria for membership.</p>
<p>It is on this basis that the Commission will make its assessment whether and to what extent the country is meeting the criteria defined at the European Council of Copenhagen in 1993 and the Stabilisation and Association Process conditionalities established by the Council in 1997.</p>
<p>The Commission’s intention is to finalise its opinion before the European Council in December so that it could be discussed by the Heads of State and Government.</p>
<p>However, as the Commission signalled to Prime Minister Bučkovski when he came to Brussels in February, this would depend not only on the quality of the dialogue with the local authorities but also on the progress achieved in the reforms and political stability in the country.</p>
<p>As regards the way forward, the purpose of the Commission’s Opinion is to recommend to the Council whether negotiations for accession should be opened or not, and then the Council will decide. The further procedure, including the possible adoption of a ‘pre-accession strategy’, will depend on that decision.</p>
<p>Finally, under the current Treaty provisions as well as under the provisions of the Constitution, the decision to open negotiations is taken by the Member States by unanimity.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0166"></a>

<p>Since the ageing of the EU's population will in future threaten the sustainability of pension schemes, has the Commission a clear picture of the action which has been taken by each Member State as regards early-retirement schemes?</p>

<p>(FR) Social protection systems in the Member States offer different opportunities for leaving the job market prior to the legal retirement age. Early retirement schemes are therefore merely one device among many and are typically geared towards workers with long careers. Not every Member State has an early retirement scheme, and there are other social protection schemes that can help people leave the job market. In some countries, unemployment insurance schemes have been adjusted to enable early retirement to be taken, whereby older unemployed people can enjoy higher benefits and are not required to look for and accept work. Invalidity insurance schemes are another way of leaving the job market and can sometimes encourage people to take full retirement, although giving people more suitable work, involving better working conditions and shorter hours, would be a possible solution.</p>
<p>The elements of social protection systems encouraging early retirement – or, at the other end of the scale, encouraging longer careers – were analysed in a report by the Social Protection Committee adopted in March 2004. The report is available – only in English – on the Committee’s website, albeit covering only the 15 old Member States<a href="#defann_41_1" name="refann_41_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Commission will examine the situation in all Member States on the back of fresh national strategy reports, which should be forwarded in July 2005 within the framework of the open method of coordination applied to retirement. The Member States will be asked to look into early retirement schemes, in light of the above-mentioned Social Protection Committee report. The Member States are also invited to table appropriate measures for updating these schemes enabling people to take early retirement, with the aim of encouraging older workers to remain active.</p>
<p>The Commission is of the opinion that extending working lives and higher take-up among older workers does not undermine young people’s chances in the job market. The retirement of older, 55 to 64-year-old, workers and the entry into the job market of younger, 15 to 24-year-old, workers, do not necessarily take place in the same sectors. It is also the case that, on the whole, trends in employment – be they positive or negative – are the same for younger and older workers; in other words, there is no discrepancy between employment trends among older and younger workers.</p>

<p>(EN) The dramatic changes in the imaging industry worldwide, driven by technological shifts, stress the need for better anticipation and management of change at sectoral and company level, in dialogue with the different stakeholders, especially the workers. The Community framework already provides for financial and legislative instruments with this aim.</p>
<p>The Commission is further committed to promoting an industrial policy aimed at fostering innovation, supporting the necessary changes and fully realising the European industrial potential in the different branches. It invites the honourable Member to refer to its Communication ‘Fostering structural change: an industrial policy for an enlarged Europe’ adopted in April 2004.<a href="#defann_42_1" name="refann_42_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></p>
<p>This Communication highlights the need to improve the framework conditions in which industry operates in Europe to ensure that Europe is seen as a ‘business-friendly’ location for investments and industrial activities. In particular, this Commission is committed to improving the regulatory framework in which industry operates through all the actions carried out under the framework of ‘better regulation’.</p>
<p>Having said that, the Commission would point out that many of the framework conditions which determine investment decisions (including those to relocate activities) do not exclusively depend on the EU; others (such as taxation and training/education) are exclusively of national competence. The Commission has frequently invited Member States to ponder on their responsibilities in such matters, and has requested that Member States complement the Commission’s drive to improve the regulatory framework in which business operates through their own, national, ‘better regulation’ programmes.</p>
<p>Moreover, as the social consequences of corporate restructuring are a serious concern, the Commission has adopted on 31 March 2005 a Communication on ‘Restructuring and Employment - Anticipating and accompanying restructuring in order to develop employment: the role of the European Union’<a href="#defann_42_2" name="refann_42_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> outlining an EU global approach to these phenomena.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

However, in many Member States. including Italy, fuller information starting from the initial decision would have avoided counter-productive oversimplifications as regards means of payment. In some Member States, such as France, dual pricing is still being practised, with prices being indicated in both euros and the former national currency.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission agrees with the honourable Member that the euro is not only a currency but also a symbol of a common identity and shared values. The Commission moreover shares the view that a comprehensive information campaign for citizens on the implications and benefits of the euro should form an integral part of the preparations for the introduction of the single currency in each country. While the responsibility for such information campaigns lies with the different national authorities, the Commission has actively co-operated in the past, in particular by organising regular meetings of the national administrations’ communication directors in order to discuss information activities. The Union has also made financial support available through the PRINCE budget line, which aims at increasing public knowledge within and outside the Union of the working of EMU and to contribute to a smooth changeover in those Member States which adopt the euro, in the form of a partnership agreement.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member rightly points out, dual display of prices and other amounts plays an essential role in helping consumers in their mental changeover process. It moreover helps preventing potential abusive price increases or the erroneous perception thereof by consumers. In order to encourage the use of dual display and to establish a number of good practices in this field, the Commission adopted Commission Recommendation (98/287/EC) 23 April 1998 concerning dual display of prices and other monetary amounts. This recommendation notably provides that dual displays should fully respect the legal provisions on conversion and rounding. It is essential that only the official conversion rate is applied and that the amounts displayed after conversion should neither be rounded off for convenience nor be transformed into ‘psychological’ prices.</p>
<p>As regards the possibility to adopt binding legal provisions in this area, the Commission considered at the time that no legislative measures were necessary at Community level, although Member States were obviously entitled to enact appropriate regulatory provisions at national level (as some Member States did during the previous changeover to the euro).</p>
<p>Finally, it should be stressed that the use of dual price display should be restricted to a reasonable period of time. If dual displays are kept in place for too long they risk becoming counterproductive by prolonging the reference to the national currency beyond what is necessary and thereby delay the mental changeover to the euro. The Commission therefore recommended on 19 December 2002 (02/747/EC) that dual displays in the first-wave euro- area countries should be gradually phased out with a view to being discontinued by 30 June 2003 at the latest.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0181"></a>

<p>(EN) 1. Medical Protection and protection for families of the victims</p>
<p>The role of the Commission in the negotiations currently held in Council of Europe was already the subject of the reply to oral questions <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2004-0570_EN.html">H-0570/04</a><a href="#defann_45_1" name="refann_45_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2005-0067_EN.html">H-0067/05</a><a href="#defann_45_2" name="refann_45_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. As pointed out in these responses, the Commission has negotiated on behalf of the European Community further to a Council Decision of 28 June 2004 authorizing the Commission to negotiate the Draft European Convention on combating trafficking in human beings along precise negotiating directives. This Council Decision covers those provisions of the Draft Convention that concern Community law (first pillar). It was adopted on the basis of existing EC legislation, in particular on Council Directive 2004/81/EC of 29 April 2004 ‘on the residence permit issued to third-country nationals who are victims of trafficking in human beings or who have been the subject of an action to facilitate illegal immigration, who cooperate with the competent authorities’. Consequently, in the negotiations in Strasbourg the Commission was bound to respect the negotiating directives included in the above mentioned Council Decision. It must be underlined that the Commission can deviate from the negotiating directives received only if there is an amended Council Decision or, in a less formal way, if the Council decides at unanimity (this sector is still covered by unanimity) to endorse a text going beyond the said negotiating directives. Concerning the two amendments proposed by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe the honourable Member is referring to (necessary medical assistance during the reflection period and protection of the families), the Commission would have been in favour of including them in the draft Convention, but lacked the necessary support by the Member States. In a similar, but not identical, case<a href="#defann_45_3" name="refann_45_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> – fixation of a recovery and reflection period of a minimum of 30 days granted to victims of trafficking – a consensus was reached in the Council and the Commission could negotiate the inclusion of such a minimum delay in the draft Convention. It must be recalled that Member States will anyway be free to grant more favourable provisions to third-country nationals victims of trafficking when transposing the Convention in their national legislation.</p>
<p>As to the psychological assistance, this is already provided for in the draft Convention in article 12(1) (a) and article 12(3).</p>
<p>2. Non punishment clause; using the services of a victim of trafficking</p>
<p>The negotiating Parties in Strasbourg agreed to include into the draft European Convention on action against trafficking in human beings a provision concerning the criminalisation of the use of services of a victim and a so-called non punishment provision.</p>
<p>The provision concerning the criminalisation of the use of services of a victim is not binding as some negotiating Parties, including EU Member States, strongly opposed a binding provision. According to the agreed draft, Parties shall consider adopting the relevant measures. From a legal point of view and taking into consideration the relevant Common Position adopted by the Council in October 2004 Member States were not obliged to actively support a binding provision. However, the Commission is aware of an ongoing debate about the issue in a number of Member States. A discussion of the question in the Union will be necessary and should take place further to the Communication on trafficking in human beings the Commission will issue in 2005.</p>
<p>According to the non-punishment provision agreed within the Council of Europe each Party shall, in accordance with the basic principles of its legal system, provide for the possibility of not imposing penalties on victims for their involvement in unlawful activities, to the extent that they have been compelled to do so. This formulation remains behind the expectations of some negotiating Parties and a number stakeholders. On the other hand, it has to be taken into consideration that the positions of the negotiating Parties in Strasbourg were very divergent and that there was a real risk of having no non punishment provision at all in the European Convention on action against trafficking in human beings.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) For the future programming period, Leader will no longer exist as a separate community initiative as this is currently the case. Building on the experience of three programming periods, the Commission believes that the Leader Initiative has reached sufficient maturity enabling the rural areas to implement the Leader approach more widely in mainstream rural development programming. Given the importance of Leader the Commission has opted to have a separate axis for the implementation of the Leader approach including all characteristics of the current initiative such as partnership capacity, the implementation of local strategies, cooperation, networking and acquisition of skills. Within each programme, at least 7% should be earmarked for the Leader axis. This is the minimum necessary for a credible integration of the Leader approach into rural development programming. Concerning the financing of the Leader axis, a co-financing percentage of maximum 55% (80 % in Convergence regions) has been proposed.</p>
<p>Moreover, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) can contribute to the diversification of the activities in rural areas according to the three priorities defined for the future programming period (convergence, competitiveness and employment, territorial co-operation), in particular to improve access to transport, telecommunications and other services of general interest, to stimulate eco-innovation in SMEs, to support networks and clusters of rural and urban SMEs and to promote green tourism.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0194"></a>

<p>(EN) The EU and the Andean Community are not yet negotiating a Free Trade Agreement. However, the EU and Andean Community’s Heads of State and Government declared in Guadalajara in May 2004 that the conclusion of an Association Agreement between the Andean Community and the EU has become their ‘common strategic objective’.</p>
<p>While stressing the need to build upon the outcome of the Doha negotiations, it was decided at this Summit to start preparing the way for future negotiations through launching a ‘joint assessment’ exercise focusing on the level of regional economic integration existing within the Andean Community.</p>
<p>The EU attaches a lot of importance to regional integration, for political motives (or the idea that regional integration will enhance political stability), for economic reasons (or the idea that the market should be big enough to attract European economic operators) as well as from a purely practical point of view (or not wanting to have very long and difficult negotiations such as with Mercosur and the Gulf Cooperation Council).</p>
<p>The joint assessment exercise has been launched officially on the occasion of an EU-Andean Community Joint Committee meeting which took place on 21 January 2005. At that moment, it was decided to set up an ‘Ad Hoc Joint Working Group’ that will meet three times this year and report to the following EU-Andean Community Joint Committee to be organised before the end of this year. The first meeting of the Ad hoc Joint Working Group took place during the first week of April.</p>
<p>While the subjects of the joint assessment exercise are very much Free Trade related, the EU’s ambition is larger than the conclusion of a Free Trade Agreement. The ‘Association Agreement’ which the EU has in mind also covers its region to region political dialogue and its cooperation activities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0196"></a>

<p>(EN) The staff of the European institutions having their place of work in one of the Member states does not benefit from diplomatic immunity.</p>
<p>However, the statutory personnel, meaning the officials as well as the other servants, of all Community institutions benefits from legal immunity under the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Communities,<a href="#defann_48_1" name="refann_48_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and the Staff Regulations, including the EU agencies, to which these Staff Regulations also apply.</p>
<p>According to article 12 of the ‘Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Communities’ ‘officials and other servants of the Communities shall be immune from legal proceedings in respect to acts performed by them in their official capacity […]’.</p>
<p>At the same time shall ‘each institution … be required to waive the immunity accorded to an official or other servant wherever that institution considers that the waiver of such immunity is not contrary to the interests of the Communities.’ (article 18 of the protocol)</p>
<p>Article 23 of the ‘Staff Regulations’ further specifies that: ‘The privileges and immunities enjoyed by officials are accorded solely in the interest of the Communities. Subject to the protocol on privileges and immunities, officials shall not be exempt from fulfilling their private obligations, or from complying with the laws and the police regulations in force’.</p>
<p>It is clear from the wording of these provisions that such legal immunity applies to acts performed in an official capacity, and only to those.</p>
<p>The situation is however different for personnel attached to a delegation in a Third country. These persons (and the members of their families) generally enjoy the rights, privileges and immunities and are subject to the obligations as laid down in the Vienna Convention of 18 April 1961 on Diplomatic Relations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission's analysis and studies, reported in the Explanatory Memorandum to the Commission proposal<a href="#defann_50_1" name="refann_50_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, took into account patents granted by the European Patent Office as well as those granted by national patent offices of the EU Member States.</p>
<p>One of the studies conducted in the context of the Commission’s analysis, taking account of the situation in the United States, found that ‘the patentability of computer program related inventions has helped the growth of computer program related industries in the United States, in particular the growth of SMEs and independent software developers into sizable indeed major companies’.</p>
<p>The study also concluded that in Europe there is increasing, even though still relatively low, use by independent software developers of patents in raising finance or in licensing. The authors of the study considered that harmonisation on the basis of the status quo would have no consequence save for the important one that SMEs and independent software developers will be less likely to consider computer program related inventions unpatentable.</p>
<p>The Commission proposal seeks to clarify the legal rules on patentability for software-related inventions. This does not include computer programmes or other software as such. It means inventions which make a technical contribution and which are truly novel.</p>
<p>Such inventions are present in a number of everyday consumer goods such as cars, mobile telephones and domestic appliances. The Commission’s intention in making its proposal was to avoid patenting of pure software and clearly differentiate the EU from the US. Nothing that is not patentable now will be made patentable by the directive and its impact on innovation and competition, as well as on European businesses, will anyhow be monitored by the Commission (draft Article 7).</p>
<p>With regard to the second question of the honourable member of the Parliament, as stated earlier, the Commission found that patentability of software related inventions contributed to the growth of SME’s and independent developers. Exclusions of fields of technology from patentability are undesirable as a matter of policy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is currently working on a number of measures in the fight against terrorism, beyond those already taken over the last years.</p>
<p>Work is underway for a central system (ARGUS) that links all existing specialised rapid alert systems at EU level that aim at ensuring safety and security.. It will provide a new central entry point for all alerts, including those resulting from terrorist acts, while respecting the specific characteristics, competence and expertise of the individual and specialised alert systems which will continue to carry out their current functions. In connection with ARGUS, the Commission is now preparing to set up a central Commission Crisis Centre that would, during an emergency, bring together representatives from the different services of the Commission. This Centre will coordinate efforts so as to evaluate the best practicable options for action and to decide on the appropriate response measures. Work is underway for preparation of a Commission decision.</p>
<p>The Commission is working on the creation and implementation of a Critical Infrastructure Warning Information Network (CIWIN) - an EU network to assist Member States, EU Institutions, owners and operators of critical infrastructure to exchange information on shared threats, vulnerabilities and appropriate measures and strategies to mitigate risk in support of critical infrastructure protection. Work is underway for preparation of a Council decision. This is an element of a wider programme for the protection of critical infrastructure protection (EPCIP).</p>
<p>The Commission is now preparing the ground (impact assessment) for the creation of a rapid alert system at EU level that allows law enforcement authorities of different Member States to be in contact with one another in an emergency situation or a Law Enforcement Network (LEN). This will be proposed for decision by the Council.</p>
<p>The Commission will produce a Communication on Radicalisation and Terrorism Recruitment before the end of the first half of the year as its contribution to the Council elaboration of a long-term strategy on the subject by the end of 2005.</p>
<p>The Commission will also be tabling a Communication on ensuring greater security in explosives, bomb-making equipment and firearms.</p>
<p>A Communication on Sky Marshals as part of an in-flight security legislative package can also be expected this year. A draft legal act is under development establishing common rules on the use of In Flight Security Officers (Sky Marshals) in the EU. The main objective of this legal act is to establish and implement appropriate Union measures, in order to prevent acts of unlawful interference against civil aviation by means of the introduction of In Flight Security Officers. Member States will be free to implement additional or alternative security measures if they so wish. States not wishing to deploy in flight security officers would be able to address a specific threat by alternative security measures.</p>
<p>A harmonised Community position on in-flight security officers is essential in light of the impact such measures have on the aviation security and confidence in the transport industry. The Community approach addressing this critical issue is aligned with international standards and has greatly benefited from the recommendations and work by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). These arrangements do not remove the obligation imposed on states by the ICAO to consider a request by another state to authorise its sky marshals to board an aircraft of the requesting state.</p>
<p>The Commission is mainstreaming counter-terrorism into all EU external actions with third countries. Many countries need assistance to set up the basic capacities to counter terrorism. The United Nations (UN) has developed a framework of conventions, resolutions and instruments which set the international norms for counter terrorism action. Commission assistance programmes support, amongst other things, these UN objectives. Our programmes are building government capacities and spreading the rule of law worldwide to around 80 countries. We coordinate with the various international donors and actors in the field so as to avoid any duplication of effort. Development assistance is also one way of addressing the underlying causes of terrorism assistance to erode the support base for terrorist networks, through a focus on poverty reduction, good governance, and the promotion of participatory development processes</p>
<p>Further to the Hague Programme and, in addition, recent discussions in the EU Council, the Commission intends to put forward before the end of 2005 a proposal for a Council Framework Decision ensuring adequate safeguards for the transfer of personal data for the purpose of police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters. This proposal on data protection in the so-called third pillar shall strike a balance between the necessary investigative tools of law enforcement in the fight against serious crime on the one hand and the necessary protection of the private sphere of EU citizens on the other hand.</p>
<p>The Commission will submit a proposal for a Council Decision on the establishment of a principle of equivalent access to law enforcement relevant information. This proposal should present an innovative legal concept, as requested by the Hague Programme, to speed up information exchange between the law enforcement authorities of the Member States. This legal concept should establish a right of equivalent access to information held by another Member State. That concept was already outlined in the Communication on enhancing access to information by law enforcement agencies<a href="#defann_51_1" name="refann_51_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The right of equivalent access denotes that the conditions under which a law enforcement authority of a given Member State can have to certain information should be the same as those under which a colleague of another Member State could have access to the same information.</p>
<p>The Commission will present a proposal for a Council decision on the improvement of police cooperation between the Member States of the European Union, especially at the internal borders and amending the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement.</p>
<p>This Decision aims at improving police cooperation especially at the internal borders of the European Union by multilateral means in order to bring about an improved exchange of information, better coordination, and operational cooperation. This Decision should aim at standardisation, simplification and acceleration of procedures, emphasise operational aspects based on common strategic considerations, and increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the deployment of human and material.</p>
<p>Taking into consideration the very high potential of forensic evidence in the fight against organised crime and terrorism, the Commission is working on a Proposal for a Council Decision on mutual consultation of DNA databases. The idea behind this proposal is to enable police officers to compare the DNA extracted from stains collected on a scene of crime to DNA data contained in the other EU Member States database, in order to enhance and to accelerate the possibilities of identifying the authors of serious crimes such as terrorism attacks. This proposal should be discussed in the Council before the end of this year.</p>
<p>The Commission is also working on a proposal for a Council Framework Decision on the use of Passenger Name Records for law enforcement purposes.</p>
<p>Commission activity in the Fight against the Financing of Terrorism</p>
<p>As recognised by the European Council’s Declaration on Combating Terrorism<a href="#defann_51_2" name="refann_51_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> reducing the access of terrorists to financial and other economic resources is a vital component in the prevention of and fight against terrorism. The Commission Communication<a href="#defann_51_3" name="refann_51_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> of October 2004 sets out the key aspects of the fight against financing of terrorism. These are (i) improve exchange of information and cooperation structures between intelligence services / law enforcement / Financial Intelligence Units / private sector; (ii) strengthen transparency in particular in connection with non-profit and charitable organisations and (iii) enhance traceability of financial transactions. Following and based on the Communication, the Counter Terrorism Coordinator and Commission produced an Overall EU Strategy Paper on the Fight against Terrorism Financing. This was endorsed by the December 2004 meeting of the European Council. The Overall EU Strategy Paper and the Conclusions of the European Council set out the core objectives for the Commission’s work in the fight against terrorist financing:</p>
<p>Propose EU level implementation of international standards (namely standards adopted by the financial action task force established by the G7 in 1989 to address global money laundering concerns) to address vulnerability of the non-profit and charitable sector to misuse by terrorism financiers. By way of example we are looking into the possibility of a (non-mandatory) European Statute of Associations that would include heightened levels of transparency and accountability.</p>
<p>We are looking at possible measures to strengthen the legal framework regarding the freezing of terrorist assets to ensure that Member States can freeze assets of designated persons effectively and without delay. Accordingly the Commission is exploring the possibilities for third pillar legislation (i) whereby Member States would apply freezing measures in the case of ‘internal’ terrorists; (ii) addressing the question of ‘preventive’ freezing in Member States, (iii) putting in place a fair and transparent system for removal of persons from the EU list in appropriate circumstances.</p>
<p>Together with Europol we are looking at improvements to the sharing of information to facilitate sharing of financial information between law enforcement/intelligence services and the private sector, including real time access to financial information within the private sector. A report will be prepared by end 2005.</p>
<p>Since identifying customers is a core element of financial institutions’ work to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing, we are looking at ways to give financial institutions access to image archiving databases of sample identity documentation from around the world.</p>
<p>The Commission is undertaking an assessment of national information exchange and coordination structures as between law enforcement services, intelligence community, Financial Intelligence Units and other governmental bodies and the private sector. The Commission has sent a questionnaire to the Member States and will use replies to identify best practice. In light of this work the Commission will prepare a report on possible improvements to coordination structures.</p>
<p>A number of proposed legislative measures should also be referred to in this context, namely:</p>
<p>In 2002 the Commission adopted a proposal for a Regulation on harmonised border controls for cash movements. This requires any person entering or leaving the European Union with a cash sum or equivalent instruments of € 10.000 or more to declare that fact to the appropriate authorities.</p>
<p>The proposal was adopted by the Economical and Financial Council as a common position in February 2005 and is now in its second reading.</p>

<p>Coordination with the Governments of the Member States</p>
<p>As a matter of general practice, the actions undertaken by the Commission, the Council and Member States in the fight against terrorism are part of the European Union Revised Action Plan on fighting terrorism attacks, based on the priorities established by the European Council on 25 March 2004, assigns specific objectives and tasks to the different European Union actors. Coordination with Member States takes place within the Council and as far as community measures are concerned in various coordination and consultation meeting organised by the Commission.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Critical Infrastructure Warning Internal Network and Law Enforcement Network will clearly be intensely coordinated with the Member States. Indeed, their success is dependent on such coordination. The same applies for the network bringing together the bomb disposal units of all the Member States that would allow States to draw on each other’s best practices regarding response strategies in explosives, firearms or bomb related situations. It will serve as an important forum in which the experts of the Member States can keep each other abreast with new risks and threats (gathering and real) and techniques for neutralising them. The Communication on ensuring greater security of explosives, bomb-making equipment and firearms may contain a proposal to make specific recommendations to Member States as well as proposals to create other networks like for instance, a forensic network, which could be the starting point of a common strategy for forensic and investigation techniques.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The work of employees of the EU's fishing and maritime industry deserves greater social recognition.</p>
<p>Owing to my links with the Balearic Isles, I would like to draw attention to the work carried out by the fishing community of Palma de Mallorca. Over the last few years, these people have become involved in cleaning up the waters for purely altruistic reasons by placing themselves and their vessels at the disposal of Palma de Mallorca City Council. Their help has prevented an average of 250 tonnes of waste being washed up onto local beaches.</p>
<p>In view of the great many tourists that visit the islands, the region's fishing community would like to launch what is known as 'fishing tourism' in order to show visitors what working in the fishing industry entails. This is a new form of tourism that already exists in other Member States, such as Italy, and enables fishermen to acquaint people with the work they do while earning a living by occupying themselves with something other than the arduous work of fishing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this work is unknown to the vast majority of the population. This being the case, what is the Commission's view on this kind of initiative, which should help to improve the sector's image by familiarising people with the work of fishermen and boosting the fishing community's recognition among other sections of the population? Does the Commission intend to implement a project of this kind?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The position of the Commission to date has been to demand that new candidates to the EMU, including Poland, adhere absolutely to the requirements for a budget deficit under 3% of GDP and public debt under 60% of GDP for two years prior to joining the euro zone. The restrictive nature of this position is particularly evident when it is considered that Germany and France have escaped any kind of financial penalty, despite not complying with the 3% of GDP criterion for the fourth year in a row.</p>
<p>In this situation, it is understandable that I welcome the decision taken at the Council meeting on 22 March indicating a certain relaxation of the Stability and Growth Pact. Nevertheless, the doubt remains as to whether the current agreement is also to be applied to the situation of France and Germany for 2002 to 2004.</p>

<p>(EN) Germany and France were placed in excessive deficit in 2003. When later that year it became apparent that neither of the two countries would be able to correct their deficit by 2004, the Commission recommended to the Council to move to the next step foreseen by the excessive deficit procedure, a notice under article 104(9), accompanied by an extension of the deadline for correcting the deficit to 2005. The move was resisted by the Council, which opted instead for political conclusions. The ensuing case brought by the Commission before the Court of Justice has created an exceptional and unprecedented situation. The excessive deficit procedures for Germany and France therefore do not set a specific precedent for future applications of the excessive deficit procedures.</p>
<p>On 14 December 2004 the Commission adopted a Communication, outlining its position on how to ensure a satisfactory resolution of the budgetary problems in Germany and France within the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). It explained that in the light of the unique circumstances of the case – specifically the fact that until the Council conclusions were annulled by the Court on 13 July 2004 Germany and France were entitled to consider them as valid and therefore to act in accordance with the 2005 deadline – the assessment of the actions taken by the two countries to correct the excessive deficit should refer to 2005 as the relevant deadline. The Communication highlighted the risks to the budgetary plans of each of the two countries and explicitly referred to the possibility of recommending to the Council to take further steps under the excessive deficit procedure, should failures in implementation emerge at a later stage.</p>
<p>Both in Germany and France, on current information, the correction of the excessive deficit in 2005 remains within reach conditional on a full and effective implementation of all the measures envisaged and possibly the adoption of additional measures. For both countries, in view of the uncertainties attached to the 2005 outcome, continuous monitoring of the budgetary situation, which remains vulnerable, is required. In the coming months, uncertainty about the outcome for 2005 will lessen.</p>
<p>This monitoring will take place against the background of the consensus on the reform of the EU fiscal policy rules reflected in the ECOFIN Council report endorsed by the European Council, ‘Improving the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact’. If a Member State fails to comply with the recommendations addressed to it under the excessive deficit procedure, the Council has the power to apply the available sanctions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0243"></a>

<p>(EN) First, the Commission would like to emphasize that the establishment in 2003 of an EU preferential quota on imports of Moroccan tomatoes should be seen as being part of an overall strategy, the so-called Barcelona process, aiming at the creation of an Euro-Mediterranean Free Trade Area by 2010.</p>
<p>Now some facts related to the honourable Member’s questions:</p>
<p>The recent decision to increase the EU preferential quotas on imports of Moroccan tomatoes by 13000 tons has been taken as a direct consequence of the EU enlargement, in the context of the exercise under article XXIV.6 of the GATT rules. The cited amount corresponds to the average flow of new Member States imports of Moroccan tomatoes from 2001 to 2003. The 13000-ton increase raises the EU initial quota from 200000 to a total of 213 000 tons, in other words 6.5% more than the level set out for EU15.</p>
<p>Preferential imports of tomatoes from Morocco are based on a system of reduced entry prices combined with monthly quotas that have their lowest level at the height of the ‘EU season’. This gives a guarantee to EU producers in terms of market outlets, as demonstrated by the fact that imports from Morocco have increased overall by 30% from 1990/92 to 2002/04 (2% on an annual basis from 1990), while intra-EU trade has increased by 62% over the same period (3.8% on a yearly basis).</p>
<p>The Commission will continue to monitor very attentively the state of the tomato market as well as the management of the preferential quota in reference. Thus, the Commission considers that no specific impact evaluation is needed on that respect.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0249"></a>

<p>(FR) In common with the honourable Member, the Commission feels it is crucial that measures announced to help the countries affected by the tsunami enter into force as soon as possible, so as not to diminish the credibility of the EU’s political message.</p>
<p>On 10 February 2005, the Commission decided to amend the proposal for a regulation that it had presented to the Council in October 2004, in order that the countries in question should benefit as quickly as possible from the new Generalised System of Preferences (GSP). Ten countries have since objected to the proposal as it stands, for reasons that have nothing to do with the action to help the tsunami victims that the EU decided unanimously to take.</p>
<p>The Commission is appalled by this state of affairs and, like the honourable Member, feels that the EU’s credibility has been severely damaged in the eyes of those countries affected. Ten Member States believe that India should pay full duty on textiles and clothing (in other words, 12% customs duty, instead of 9.6%), and for this reason have blocked the reform of the GSP, affecting dozens of countries, in particular Thailand, Indonesia, the Maldives and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>That undermining of credibility particularly affects Sri Lanka, which is a potential beneficiary of the new GSP Plus, the special scheme to foster sustainable development and good governance. Until the new GSP is adopted, Sri Lanka cannot enjoy the zero rate of duty for textiles and clothing, which accounts for a large proportion of its exports.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Community market share above which beneficiary countries cannot benefit from GSP for certain products has risen to 15%. In comparison with the GSP that is set to be replaced, this new criterion is more generously weighted in favour of the benefiting countries, especially those affected by the tsunami, for which some EUR 3 billion in additional exports can thus benefit from preferential tariffs.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Commission intends to look into adopting a compromise solution with the Member States in the next few weeks in order not to stray too far from the original target of 1 April, which was unanimously accepted in principle by the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Commission does not intend to grant zero rates solely to the countries affected by the tsunami. It can only grant such concessions on the basis of objective criteria, such as GSP+, which Sri Lanka will benefit from. Any other criteria would be incompatible with the international trade rules set by the World Trade Organisation (WTO).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0250"></a>

<p>(EN) The honourable Member refers to a decision of the Member States, in the framework of the European Council in December 2003 to extend the mandate of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia in order to transfer it into a Fundamental Rights Agency for the European Union.</p>
<p>The Commission supports this project. It will submit a legislative proposal on the Agency end of May 2005.</p>
<p>Before that, the Commission issued a Communication<a href="#defann_62_1" name="refann_62_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> of 25 October 2005 in the framework of public consultation for the purpose of an impact assessment of the Agency. The Commission refers to this Communication to clarify that the Agency would complement the Community system of protecting and promoting existing fundamental rights, characterised by different elements:</p>
<p>judicial review by the Court of Justice, which will be reinforced by external review by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) when the Union will accede to the ECHR;</p>
<p>monitoring by the European Ombudsman to ensure that EU institutions respect the right to sound administration;</p>
<p>monitoring by the European Data protection Supervisor of the protection of the freedoms and fundamental rights of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by a Community institution or body;</p>
<p>policy follow-up by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, both inside and outside the Union, through the adoption of annual reports with a broader remit than the Community powers relating to fundamental rights;</p>
<p>setting up in the Member States, as required by Community legislation, independent institutions responsible for enforcing compliance with fundamental rights in certain areas such as the fight against discrimination or the protection of personal data.</p>
<p>Preparatory work for the Agency is still ongoing and the Commission is therefore not yet able to take definitive firm position on the subject. However, the Commission considers that the Agency should become an important tool helping the EU institutions and the Member States when implementing EU legislation, to ensure the full respect and promotion of Fundamental Rights in the ambit of EU fields of competences. To that end it would provide the relevant institutions and authorities of the Union and of Member States with information, assistance and expertise on fundamental rights.</p>
<p>Limiting the scope of action of the Agency to EU fields of competence, would avoid any overlapping with the excellent work done by other organisations, e.g. the Council of Europe and the national institutions for promotion and protection of human rights. This means both avoiding double costs but also, and even more importantly, differentiating messages as regards fundamental rights. The Commission aims for dialogue and the development of synergies between all the parties.</p>
<p>Lastly, as regards the national human rights institutions, the honourable Member is invited to refer to a report ordered by the Commission and prepared by the Network of Independent Experts on the role of the national institutions for the protection of human rights in the Member States of the European Union.<a href="#defann_62_2" name="refann_62_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a></p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>Private operators of railway services in Denmark are subject to difficult conditions. This may partly be because the largest operator in the country, DSB (Danish National Railways) is state-subsidised and because 90% of DSB’s revenue derives from activities arranged directly with the state without any exposure to competition.</p>
<p>In 1998 EU legislation on de-regulation was implemented, opening bus and railway services to competition. DSB is still involved in activities where it faces competition, both in Denmark and abroad. This can cause problems, since the DSB’s competitive position may be strengthened by the fact that it is in state ownership. In the past, there were suspicions that money from state subsidies was being used in commercial tendering procedures to undercut private operators. The first tendering procedure which took place in respect of DSB’s rail traffic, the tender for the Mid- and West Jutland lines, is a case in point, in which it emerged that illegal cross-subsidy was taking place. DSB put in a bid far below its own cost of operating the same routes when not faced with competition. The bid was subsequently disallowed by the Ministry of Transport. This situation has become topical again, since a major new tendering procedure is in the offing in Denmark.</p>
<p>What is the Commission’s view of this, and how does the Commission propose to ensure that the risk of cross-subsidy and favouritism towards public-sector undertakings is eliminated, so that private bidders are not placed in an inferior position in free competition?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is not aware of any public funds that have been granted to DSB by Danish public authorities in breach of Community rules on State aid. Nor has the Commission received any information or indications that that would be the case. In this respect it should also be recalled that EC Treaty does in no way prejudice the rules in Member States governing the system of property ownership (Article 295 EC Treaty). Accordingly, the Commission is neutral as to the ownership of an undertaking carrying out commercial activities and applies the rules of competition, including State aid, to public and private companies equally.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Commission is aware of the potential risk of cross-subsidisation to fair competition. This is why the EU legislation for the railway sector, in particular, Directive 91/440, as amended by Directives 2001/12 and 2004/51, requires railway undertakings to keep separate accounts and prohibits in particular the transfer of funds between infrastructure management activities and transport service activities. The directive also requires that public funds for the provision of public passenger services must be shown separately and may not be transferred to any other transport service or other business activity.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0257"></a>

As a result, numerous projects necessary to achieving the objectives of development policy are not being implemented because they are not receiving the necessary European funding. EuropeAid is favouring funding of very large-scale, long-term projects at the expense of more targeted projects that are more closely adapted to specific needs.

<p>(EN) The Commission wishes to reassure the honourable Member that the new legislative framework on GM food and feed that has been put in place by 2004 ensures both a high level of consumer safety and information to enable consumer choice.</p>
<p>GM food or feed is authorised to be placed on the market only once its safety has been established, in accordance with the highest standards set by the European Food Safety Authority.</p>
<p>At the same time, all GM food and feed placed on the market needs to be clearly labelled. This includes not only food and feed consisting of a GMO or containing a GMO, but also food and feed produced from a GMO, irrespective of the detectability of modified DNA or protein in the final product.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that the concern of the honourable Member according to which the consumer should know whether a food or feed has been produced from a GMO therefore is already addressed by Community legislation.</p>
<p>This legislation, which arose from close dialogue with Member States and stakeholders, was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council in co-decision, but so far only limited experience has been gained since its implementation.</p>
<p>The GM Food and Feed legislation foresees that a report on its implementation be submitted to the Parliament and the Council by the end of 2005, accompanied if necessary by a proposal for review of the legislation.</p>
<p>It is of course the Member States who are responsible for ensuring that inspection and control measures are carried out to ensure compliance with the Regulation. Member States should, therefore, have already gained some first-hand experience in terms of both the implementation and enforcement of the Regulation.</p>
<p>The Commission has therefore requested information from Member States on their experience to contribute to the preparation of the report. In addition, contact has been made and will continue to be made with the relevant industries regarding their experience with implementing the Regulation, and again this information will be included in the report.</p>
<p>Such information should allow the Commission to gain a clear picture as to the operability and effectiveness of the Regulation.</p>
<p>It is however important that the Member States assume clearer ownership of the decision-making process, both in terms of their legal responsibilities during the process and in terms of political accountability for the ensuring decisions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0263"></a>

<p>(EN) The Euro-Mediterranean Regional Transport project (main contract and infrastructure component) was launched under the framework of MEDA II in 2003. At the end of 2004, the project produced a diagnostic report on the situation of the transport system in the Mediterranean area and proposed a list of actions to be considered as priorities for the future transport development in the region. It also produced a first analysis of transport infrastructure axes as well as projects in the region and developed traffic forecasts and analysis for the horizon of 2010 (year of the establishment of the Free Trade area in Mediterranean) and 2020.</p>
<p>In 2005, work will be ongoing on transport sector reform issues and the planning of the regional transport infrastructure network in the framework of the Euromed Transport Project.

In the framework of this High Level Group, chaired by Ms Loyola de Palacio, which will submit its final report to the Commission in autumn 2005, political discussion will take place between the EC and the Mediterranean partners on the transport priorities for the interconnection between the EU and the region.

<p>(EN) The Commission carefully designed the scope of REACH taking into account existing specific legislation on Community level.</p>
<p>As a result substances used in medicinal products are exempted both from registration and authorisation in REACH. Substances used in cosmetic products have to be registered but the chemical safety report only has to examine the risks to the environment from the use of the substance in cosmetics as the relevant directive on cosmetics only covers the effects on human health. The same applies to the authorisation requirement for substances used in cosmetic products.</p>
<p>REACH does not change the current requirements on how to classify and label a substance or a mixture of substances, e.g. a cosmetic product. Directive 67/458/EEC on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances as well as Directive 1999/45/EC on the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous preparations exempt medicinal products and cosmetic products from the provisions for classification and labelling. The Commission is currently working on a proposal for the implementation of the UN agreed Globally Harmonised System of the Classification and Labelling of Chemicals. The scope of this internationally agreed systems also excludes the labelling of medicinal products and cosmetics at the stage where they reach the final user or the consumer.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0270"></a>

<p>Technological progress in mobile telephony has greatly facilitated communications between people. However, scientific views are occasionally published which have alarmed public opinion about the possible consequences for human health of using mobile phones.</p>
<p>Given these concerns and in order to ensure that the public is correctly and responsibly informed, will the Commission say:</p>
<p>Has it drawn up a scientific study investigating thoroughly whether and to what extent radiation from mobile phones affects human health?</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of a number of national and international research projects and scientific reviews on potential health impacts of mobile ‘phone usage. These range from the potential impact of electromagnetic fields (EMF) on the body (including possible carcinogenic effects) to mobile ‘phone use whilst driving; and, enhanced security of vulnerable groups through access to mobile ‘phones.</p>
<p>At Community level, various research projects have contributed to the development of knowledge in this field. The Commission has committed over 12 million Euros to financing such projects, primarily under the 5<span class="sup">th</span> Research Framework Programme. Many of these projects have recently come to a conclusion or will conclude in the coming months and the Commission will take action towards the end of the year to draw together these various results.</p>
<p>For further details on some of these projects, the honourable Member is kindly referred to the written questions put to the Commission by Mr Brie (<a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2004-1589_EN.html">E-1589/04</a>), Ms Breyer (E-2521/04) and Ms Gröner (<a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2004-3246_EN.html">E-3246/04</a>).</p>
<p>As regards the protection of public health, the Commission refers to the provisions of Council Recommendation 1999/519/EC of 12 July 1999 on the limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields (0 Hz to 300GHz), which fixes basic restrictions and reference levels for exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields. In addition, Community product legislation (Directives 1999/5/EC an 73/23/EC) uses these limits in setting safety standards for products.</p>
<p>The Commission sought the opinion on this matter from the Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment, which confirmed the validity of these limits on 30 October 2001. However, the Commission will shortly commence developing a report to the Council on the implementation of the Recommendation and approach Member States in this respect to ascertain the current state of implementation. In addition, the Commission will ask its’ Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks to re-examine the latest scientific evidence.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
