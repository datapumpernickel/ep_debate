The Prime Minister, Mr Simitis has made an appeal to us and your question, Mr Alavanos, supports this request for aid and solidarity from the European Union and passes it directly on to us. </p>
<p class="contents">Together with Mrs Diamantopoulou, we informed the Commission, this very afternoon, on what action is possible within the framework of the Structural Funds to provide support to Greece and to assist it in terms of reconstruction and repairs. I can confirm to the European Parliament that within the framework of the regulations of the Structural Funds, with the appropriations currently available, we are able to offer substantial support to those parts of the Greek population which have been affected. This is around 20,000 households, not to mention several hundred victims. I am now able to give the European Parliament the list of areas in which the regulations allow us to intervene as well as how the European Investment Bank envisages the way it will be done. The bank will make its decision on this at its board meeting on 7 December.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday evening in Tampere I met Mr Partas, the Greek Secretary of State for Regional Policy, in order to ask him to provide us as quickly as possible – and I know that it is difficult – with an assessment and the most accurate figures possible so that we can commit the appropriations which are available to us. This is the substance of the answer I wanted to give to Mr Alavanos.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving beyond compensation now, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Alavanos has asked a question which has always interested me – I am now thinking of the action that I took in my own country when I was Minister for the Environment, concerned with natural risks – the matter of prevention. Prevention is cheaper, always cheaper than having to repair things afterwards. My answer is yes, in a general way, without targeting any institution in particular, with the Structural Fund appropriations we can finance studies for the prevention of earthquake risk in Greece as well as other countries as long as the Greek Government asks us to.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as I have been talking about the lessons to be learnt from this natural disaster, I would also like to emphasise how seriously – and I have said this within the College – I take the idea of improving the coordination of different countries’ resources in terms of the civil defence of their people. Personally, I am in favour of the idea of a European civil defence force, which I believe will be extremely useful with regard to the citizens and the problems that still remain. The purpose of this force would be to work better together, more quickly and more visibly, in the event of a natural disaster, both within the territory of the European Union and elsewhere, and God knows, there is no shortage of disasters as current events show.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I would, of course, like to ask him if he could have been more analytical as regards the proposals which he himself and Mrs Diamantopoulou made for tackling the issues of the earthquakes. My second question, which is the main point of the question, is whether or not the Commission thinks – since we have the Seveso Directive which provides for the protection of workers and citizens around factories from accidents within industrial installations – that it should take some measures to protect all industrial installations from natural disasters such as earthquakes. Both in Greece and Turkey, and in the past in Naples, Taiwan and Mexico, we have seen a constant lack of control over industrial installations. In view of this, is the Commission proposing to examine such a possibility?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The office has on-going contact with the International Red Cross, the United Nations organisations, the NGOs which are present in the country and Echo’s own representative. The latter has carried out a mission in Kabul where streams of refugees were recorded in the northern districts. Echo’s representative is now in the Panshir valley in order to assess the situation. Difficult access to the Panshir valley, the extremely explosive situation and the marked political sensitivity which characterise the situation in the area demand intervention of a kind which will have to be organised between the various humanitarian organisations if errors of judgement and bad decisions are to be avoided. What is more, everything we do will have to respect Echo’s neutral mandate. </p>
<p class="contents">Echo has plans to provide aid amounting to EUR 1.5 million to all the displaced persons staying close to the various front lines, namely in the Panshir valley – where there is talk of displaced persons following the fighting in April and May – and in Kabul. The fact that this particular aid, details of which have already been submitted for approval, is being provided does not rule out the possibility of further aid being necessary before the end of the year. With the threat of difficulties created by the winter, the situation is really becoming acute. </p>
<p class="contents">As regards an agreement with the most representative humanitarian players in the area, the aid will be aimed in particular at consolidating the existing humanitarian structures in the area and at assisting the local population by supporting the displaced persons with medical help, food aid and shelter. The practical details of these forms of humanitarian action are being established in collaboration with our partners in the field. We are prepared continuously to alter our input, not least against the background of the highly volatile military situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My answer was not of a bureaucratic nature. There is just as much humanitarian concern in focusing on the victims of the conflict, irrespective of the character of the conflict. When we are confronted with suffering of this nature and with victims in the numbers we are seeing here, there are obviously factors on both sides of the conflict which may be characterised in the way the questioner has just done. Otherwise, the victims would not be in the position they are in fact in. And our mandate in connection with what Echo is doing in the field is a humanitarian mandate. I ask that this fact be respected. I am fully conscious of the fact that it is not always possible to be completely unpartisan, and one can always be taken advantage of by one or the other side in a conflict when one helps the victims. However, there is no value in representing the issue as the questioner has done. It is difficult enough as it is to be of use in providing humanitarian aid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Directly after the Dzurinda Government took office at the end of October 1998, the Commission, on the initiative of my predecessor, set up a bilateral high-level working party to once again give Slovakia’s preparations for accession the necessary momentum. This was seen as a significant sign of support for the democratic new beginning in Slovakia. You can see this from the fact that no such group had ever been set up before for any other country. After five sessions, this working party completed its activities in September with positive conclusions. The positive conclusions concern primarily the political Copenhagen criterion, but I must add that the conclusions of this working party do not prejudice the conclusions of the forthcoming regular report on Slovakia.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will now accordingly acknowledge this encouraging development in its forthcoming regular report. The Commission will adopt this report on the development of Slovakia on 13 October, i.e. as early as next week, together with the other progress reports.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is particularly strong in its support of the non-governmental organisations essential for the development of a mature civil society in Slovakia.</p>
<p class="contents">In the national PHARE programme for Slovakia 1999, EUR 2.5 million were made available for the Slovakian foundation for the development of a civil society, brought into being on the initiative of the Commission. This foundation will forward funds to approximately 100 non-governmental organisations for activities, among other things, in the fields of human rights, environmental protection, social work, etc. Mr Posselt, I would, incidentally, like to point out that PHARE resources for Slovakia in the year 1999 reached the level of the previously highest volume to date with almost EUR 70 million.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we have established a special fund for projects which are intended to benefit the national minorities, particularly the Romany. This special fund has been allocated EUR 2 million. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Slovakia, the package of economy measures has entailed some problems and privations for the population. It is therefore important to stabilise the economic situation. We know in Europe small and medium-sized businesses are the bedrock of the economy. What do you intend to do to expedite economic stability here and especially to establish contact between neighbouring States, located in direct proximity to the European Union? What programmes are envisaged here to get privatisation on the right road too? You know, there were considerable problems with the Meciar Government when privatisation went ahead. I believe that there is a great need for economic rehabilitation, and I believe it is extremely important for Slovakia. I would like to thank you expressly for the fact that you are going to propose that the appropriate negotiations begin in Helsinki.

In Slovakia, it is absolutely essential to quickly work off the deficits which have arisen in recent years. One of these deficits is the sluggish progress of the privatisation process, which was also connected with other problems, as you well know. The result is, of course, that we still do not have a satisfactory situation with regard to a self-supporting sector of the economy, capable of development, above all in the middle range. The Accession Partnership currently under discussion with Slovakia will include appropriate programmes in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The resources already envisaged for Slovakia will indeed serve, as you know, the development of infrastructure or “institution building”, but they can also be implemented as instruments for the regulation and further development of the economy. We shall do that through the programme. I cannot give any further details at the moment because, naturally, the basic prior political conditions for that must be achieved first. Obviously, I shall keep Parliament informed regarding the concrete programmes not just with Slovakia but with other States, for which Accession Partnerships are now being further developed.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With their economy and production in free fall, the people of Serbia are heading for a difficult winter. The reprehensible policies pursued by the regime are having severe effects on many innocent people. Popular discontent is directed at both the regime and the outside world which is regarded as compounding the suffering with indiscriminate sanctions. It is important that the EU does not inadvertently strengthen Milosevic’s position, but that it should make a contribution in the form of targeted, democratically-controlled humanitarian aid. In the light of this situation, is the Commission prepared to consider measures in essential areas to assist the Serbian civilian population? Consideration should be given primarily to the growing environmental threats posed by destroyed sewage plants, oil refineries and chemical factories in Novi Sad and Pancevo, for example, and to exempting young students from the academic embargo which is cutting them off from foreign educational institutions and other contacts, making their future bleak and encouraging a brain-drain so damaging to the country. Such measures would relieve the Serbian people’s suffering, make it more difficult for Milosevic to demonise the outside world and strengthen democratic forces.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Aid amounting to EUR 45.1 million has been provided so far. Against the background of the growing humanitarian needs which will arise in the coming winter, Echo is considering setting aside a further EUR 10 million for the purpose of implementing a comprehensive programme of humanitarian aid with the following six components.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly: aid in the form of food and sanitary measures for 770,000 recipients of support in Serbia. This figure, which includes 350,000 refugees from Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, 120,000 internally displaced Serbs and gypsies from Kosovo and 300,000 socially vulnerable people, has been calculated by the World Food Programme’s and UNHCR’s joint assessment team for emergency food aid which visited the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in July of this year. Support for the displaced persons is being provided via the International Red Cross, while the Red Cross Federation and the national Red Cross societies are in the process of extending their programme to provide food stations, to which Echo will continue to provide support. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: shelter to individuals who have been displaced recently. Echo provides support for the repair of private dwellings and the supply of goods other than food to make it possible to establish adequate shelter for new arrivals driven out of Kosovo. Through its contribution to UNHCR, Echo also provides support to families who are housing displaced persons from Kosovo. </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly: psychological and social support for displaced persons. With the help of projects of this kind, attempts will be made to alleviate the trauma caused by the experiences undergone by many displaced persons, especially children. </p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly: emergency improvement of the structures for providing water and sanitation. Even if larger rebuilding projects are not undertaken, Echo will make less extensive improvements to the installations concerned in order to prevent health problems from arising. </p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly: support for social institutions. The most vulnerable groups in Serbia are to be found in such institutions, and Echo will, to the extent that is necessary, provide help in the form of supplementary food aid (basic food aid being provided by the World Food Programme) and supplementary goods other than food and heating. </p>
<p class="contents">Sixthly: hygiene. In the course of the winter, special arrangements will have to be made at certain points to provide heating, among other things. Negotiations with the World Health Organisation concerning flu vaccinations and problems with tuberculosis are under way right now. </p>
<p class="contents">Students from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are not – as the honourable Member supposes – excluded from foreign universities or cut off from contacts abroad, because the sanctions in place do not extend to such matters. It is true that no EU aid is being provided under the Tempus programme, but that is due to the fact that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia does not fulfil the criteria established by the Council in connection with the PHARE programme to which Tempus is linked. In any case, resources have been set aside to support democratisation and promote the institutions of civil society. </p>

My question arose from a visit I made to Belgrade about three weeks ago and from renewed contacts I had last week with the democratic movement, all the opposition political parties, private and humanitarian organisations, etc., which had issued a message for help in combating the way in which Milosevic is now demonising other countries. Other countries, including the EU, are being regarded as enemies which have destroyed their lives and institutions and which are now even subjecting them to sanctions.

We naturally need to work together with other organisations, and I was therefore careful to report on what we are doing together with the Red Cross, the World Food Programme, UNHCR and others who are involved, including the World Health Organisation. This is precisely for the purpose of making it clear that this is a humanitarian operation, but I also think it is a good thing that the population and political circles in Serbia see that the world outside is also prepared to help in this way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, a clear distinction needs to be made between the 17 scientific studies and the opinion delivered by one of the Commission’s independent scientific advisory committees. In February 1998, following the criticism of the WTO appellate body, the Commission launched 17 studies with the aim of providing additional information concerning risks in areas such as toxicology, abusive use and environmental aspects. The studies will be continued as planned and the final results from a number of them are expected to be available by the end of the year. However, several studies will, as foreseen, not be completed before the summer of 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">In conformity with the principle of transparency the Commission intends to make the outcome of the studies public as soon as possible after their finalisation. The results of the studies concerning residue analysis of meat and meat products have already been made public and can be obtained from the Commission services.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also asked its Scientific Committee on Veterinary Measures relating to Public Health to deliver an opinion on the potential adverse effects to human health from the administration of the six animal growth promotion hormones. On 30 April this year the SCVPH adopted unanimously an opinion on the assessment of potential risks to human health from hormone residues in bovine meat and meat products. That report has been published.</p>
<p class="contents">This work has been carried out on the basis of the most recent data in the open scientific literature. On the basis of this scientific advice the Commission is of the opinion that it cannot propose lifting the ban. Any new information which may come to light from the studies or from other sources will be fully considered. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not feel convinced that there are scientific proofs to justify our maintaining the ban on imports of hormone-treated meat. Nor did I hear the Commissioner substantiate any possible scientific proof. I only heard that the Commissioner did not wish to propose that the ban be lifted. Can we be certain that there will in fact be scientific proof to justify continuing with the ban on hormone-treated meat? That is the first question.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question is this: how can one be certain that, in the forthcoming World Trade Organisation negotiations in Seattle, problems do not arise with the USA and, in general, with the negotiations concerning free trade if Europe continues to stand by what is, in my view, an unscientific ban on imports of hormone-treated meat? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That is not the situation here. The report that I referred to, that was published by the SCVPH in April this year, specifically identified that there were residues of one of the six particular hormones that were being checked for – that is, 17 beta-estradion. That particular hormone is found in 80% of the tests that have been carried out. This particular hormone is – as described by the committee – clearly a carcinogen.</p>
<p class="contents">Having regard to these circumstances it is believed that the lifting of the ban at this stage would be premature. Accordingly, having regard to what I said earlier about the application of the precautionary principle, it seems to me that it would be inappropriate to apply that principle because there is clear evidence available to us from the report from the SCVPH.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to our negotiations with the WTO, this issue will have to be addressed. There has been United States representation on the committee that conducted the examinations. That will be stressed to the US negotiators. This is an important issue. It is one that has to be addressed between the United States and the European Union. One would hope that it would be addressed in an amicable and non-confrontational manner. Hopefully that will be done during the WTO negotiation period. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased with one part of it, namely the positive attitude towards openness and having access to documents. However, I am less pleased about there not being cost-free access to these on the Internet. The European Union is actually financed by its citizens who should also be entitled to know what it decides. As far as I am concerned, it is transparently clear that there should be free access on the Internet to the whole of the OJEC.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself find it difficult to understand that part of the answer given in connection with the hearings, i.e. the view that certain citizens’ not having access to the Internet and, therefore, free access to the OJEC, could be regarded as discrimination. In fact, we live in a modern society where by far the majority of people can get access to the Internet. Most school children are on the way to having, or already have, their own e-mail address. Most people in employment have Internet access, and there are lots of Internet courses for pensioners. Every citizen should have the right to obtain relevant information. I hope that the Commissioner will take this to heart and that information will be available for free in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All the information that the Commission provides for the public via the Internet is absolutely free. There is no cost to the user. Of course, installing the Internet itself involves costs, but the Commission cannot supply every citizen with free Internet access so that they can then have free access to information. What counts and what is important is that all of the Commission’s official documents are accessible at no charge. Moreover, we also have the Europa site. Access to this site is also free on the Internet and it is consulted, by the way, by millions of citizens every month.</p>
<p class="contents">As you see, we have already set in place the opportunity to use modern forms of media. I would also like to tell you Mrs Cederschiöld, that the Commission obviously wants to expand access to the Internet across all strata of society. For example, as the person responsible for education within the Commission, I have already looked at the question, with the Ministers for Education, of how we can ensure that as many young people, as many schools as possible, have Internet access. I know that in Nordic countries, it is relatively easy to set up this access, but this is not true for other countries in the Union. We must also reach a balance within the Union where Internet access is concerned. So, I take what you say extremely seriously.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The widespread use of drugs is serious, both for sport as such but also because top sportsmen act as role models for many young people. The use of drugs among top sportsmen may entail greater tolerance of the use of drugs among young people.</p>

<p class="contents">Following President Prodi’s statements to the European Parliament, the Commission will be making an in-depth study of the situation brought about by the increase in cases of drug taking in sport, and it is considering concrete measures which it would be possible to take at a Community-wide level.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of this study, we have taken into account your Parliament’s resolution of December 1998, as well as the conclusions of the Council Presidency following two informal meetings of Ministers in charge of sport. We are also working, in this matter, in close collaboration with Member States and the Council of Europe within a working group which has already met several times. </p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to the creation of a world-wide drug-testing agency, I can tell you, Mr President, that today, the Commission is already working on this issue. We have already moved towards a first round table discussion on the initiative of the sports ministers. I met some of them yesterday and they told me that the Commission had to act very quickly in order that we should become, as the European Union, part of this world-wide agency. The Commission expects to announce its decision on this matter next week. So, as you see, we are making huge leaps forward in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">In parallel with the Union’s possible membership of a world-wide drug testing agency, we feel that a European plan is needed, a plan which will make us all responsible, with all fifteen Member States marching to the same rhythm in the fight against the plague of drug taking in sport. This will be the aim of the document that we are preparing at the moment so that Mr Prodi will be able to inform the Heads of State and Government at the Helsinki Summit about the measures which need to be taken in this area. We will then be able, from next year, to propose concrete measures to you to be put into practise in our Member States.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am grateful for your answer to the effect that this matter has now been placed on the Commission’s agenda or, more accurately, placed higher up on the agenda. Work which prevents young people from beginning to use drugs is a priority area in the fight against drug abuse. If we look at sport, we see that this is an activity which attracts a lot of young people. Sports stars are often role models for young people. It is therefore important that, in this area too, we should actively combat drug abuse. </p>
<p class="contents">Because I think that sport has a responsibility to help prevent drug taking within sport, I wonder if plans are being made for some type of collaboration with the sports bodies in Europe with a view to tackling the problem, which has become worse in recent years.

I would like to thank him for his intervention and I would like to discuss this matter with him, as he seems to have information which I would like to make use of.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us move on to the specific issue here. As you know, Mr Andersson, the Treaty of Amsterdam clearly specifies that there must be a European body competent in this area, but we must also take subsidiarity into account as well as the autonomy of the world of sport. The measures that I would like to present to the College and to Parliament will therefore be measures which have the assent of Member States and which will guarantee this autonomy.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also responsible for youth programmes. I have already discussed this with colleagues who are dealing with these matters in Parliament. I am very aware of the importance of prevention through the work of youth movements. Our studies have shown that in most cases, sporting organisations are the ones that young people value most. I think then that through these young people, and through sport, we can convey many ideas on cooperation, attitudes of fair play and the elimination of racism and xenophobia. Consequently, moving in these directions – fair play, sport and healthy young people – youth programmes will be taking the direction that you would like to see, Mr Andersson.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As has just been said, in February this year the World Conference on Drug Taking in Sport took place and it was decided that an international agency to combat drug taking in sport would be created. Eight months have passed and this agency has still not been established because one very important issue has not been decided, which is where the agency will be based. The European Union does not want the agency to be based in Lausanne, at the headquarters of the International Olympic Committee but, nevertheless, wants to have it in one of the Member States of the European Union. Possible locations such as Madrid, Bonn, Luxembourg, Lille, Vienna, Lisbon or London are under discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask the Commissioner whether, in order to achieve our aim, it would not be better to unite all our forces and, with the backing of all the Member States, present a single European candidate as a seat for this agency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is in fact a world-wide agency, and we Europeans cannot march out of step. I do not think, however, that the most important issue at this stage is where the agency should be located, because it has already been decided that it will be based provisionally in Lausanne, for two years, until a definitive decision is reached.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Finnish Presidency, which would like to see the agency based in Helsinki, is putting a great deal of effort into persuading the Ministers for Sport to reach agreement on a single site which the Europeans would then propose.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall be making a case for this too, but I do not think that it is a matter of priority. Our priority is rather to ensure our membership of this agency.

The Commission is aware of the scope and possibilities of different communication media and carries out twice – yearly public opinion surveys with two questions, on how citizens are informed about EU affairs and how they would prefer to be informed.</p>
<p class="contents">Now it is interesting to see that TV is used and preferred by over 90% of citizens, so improving and increasing audiovisual information has been a priority for several years. Free dissemination of our own production material via the Europe by Satellite service and cooperation with Euronews have proved effective measures, but we cannot go further than this free availability. It is up to the communication media whether or not to use this material.</p>
<p class="contents">Publications follow as the second choice of medium. For general information, print is still predominant as Eurobarometer shows that access to the Internet is not yet general in most Member States, especially not for the public at large.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the purchase of public air time, a wide variety of attitudes exist amongst Member States. In some of them, free institutional primetime is available.

I suggested advertising on prime time television and, indeed, I asked if the Commission would be prepared to choose the time between the general news bulletin and the sports section of peak-time news because the public at large tend not to change channels at these times.

<p class="contents">If we want to operate in the different Member States, we must respect the letter and also the spirit of national prerogatives. We have tried in the past, during election campaigns, to have the Commission and Parliament conduct these campaigns jointly. The Commission cannot, of course, take a political stance, but it can take a stance on the information available to the citizen. I think that in the future, in order to reach the wider public as efficiently as possible, the Commission and Parliament should join in their efforts to inform the public of what is happening in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I would not want this information to be mere propaganda, but I feel strongly that it should be balanced and that it provides answers to our citizens’ questions. I know that this is much more easily said than done. As you will see from the new flow chart of my Directorate-General, this a citizen’s service, which really puts itself at the service of the citizen, and which aims to answer all the questions and meet all the requests citizens may put to it. It does this by using, as Mrs Cederschiöld requested, the most up-to-date technology, but also falls back on the printed word when no other means can be used. If we can, in conjunction with the Member States and Parliament, make use of television, we will certainly do so, but we cannot set up access to that medium if it is not felt that there is a demand for access to it.</p><p class="contents" style="margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;text-align:center">⁂</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall certainly strive to ensure that the programmes, the cultural programmes and the youth programmes are applied not just to high schools and universities, but that cooperation between schools is promoted in primary schools too. For this, we do not actually need long journeys, as these cost a great deal of money and cannot be paid for. But different schoolrooms in different countries can be connected via the Internet.

We have a relationship based on shared values. In the last few days there has been a fair and free election taking place in India involving an electorate which is larger than the electorate of North America and the European Union put together. India is the largest democracy in the world and has coped with some horrendous problems precisely because it is a free society living under the rule of law, with a fully developed civil society.</p>

That is a role that the EU could usefully play – of bringing the Indians, Pakistanis or Bangladeshis, etc. together in that sub-continent to discuss their common problems and, in a sense, act as an external honest broker in dealings between the countries in that sub-region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As the House is aware, one of my top priorities is to build on recent improvements in the management of European Union external aid programmes. In this context I should mention the significant personal contribution of Philippe Soubestre Director-General of the SCR.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a huge responsibility to the developing countries to ensure effective and timely use of European Union aid. This is vital for the credibility of our policies and for the wider international image of the EU. The honourable Member will know that the Commission’s services have recently made significant progress in eliminating the backlog of late payments on external aid contracts. The vast majority of valid invoices are now being paid within the normal deadline of 6 000 days – I beg your pardon 60 days. This applies, in particular, to the some 5 000 current projects with NGOs, financed either from the budget or via our delegations from the EDF.</p>
<p class="contents">It is an unfortunate but inevitable fact of life that we never have as much money as we would like. This is particularly true in development aid where the available resources are never enough. This means, for example, that we have requests for additional support for existing co-financing projects with NGOs amounting to twice the available budget in 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">This may create an impression of delays, but in reality it is an unavoidable consequence of pressure on limited resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I draw the honourable Member’s attention to recent changes to the requirements for NGOs to provide bank guarantees, which should make it easier to obtain advance payments up to EUR 1 million. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For example there are landmine clearance NGOs and ‘Article 19’ – which the Commissioner will be aware of in the UK – who have had problems with lost documents, and with a whole litany of complete chaos.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commissioner aware of the huge tensions which exist between the external DGs and the SCR now because of the confusion about tasks, because of the staffing difficulties that DG VIII has, for instance, because of their staff being moved to the SCR?</p>
<p class="contents">There are underlying tensions which your answer does not address. The answer is somewhat complacent about a real crisis situation in the SCR. That is added to by the fact that the RELEX DGs are being reorganised. That causes even more chaos for the very essential work that we are engaged in with countries outside the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need to recognise as well the problem they inherited – a backlog of 19 billion of commitments, a backlog of 14 500 projects. They have been making progress in dealing with those issues and I want to help them with that and not further damage their morale or that of the DGs.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore important to understand the difference that exists at the moment between problems caused by applications which cannot be met because of budgetary considerations and the processing of commitments, where the situation, despite difficulties at the beginning of the year, has improved; and it is worth remembering that some of the problems at the beginning of the year had a little to do with the lateness of receipt of commitments in December. We all have to work together to try to ensure that the European Union gets the assistance it has promised to those to whom those promises have been made as rapidly and as effectively as possible.</p>

A number of specific projects are currently under way. The European Union is contributing EUR 500 000 to the UNDP Weapons in Exchange for Development pilot project in the Gramsh district of Albania, which, if successful, might be expanded to other districts.

<p class="contents">Firstly there is the immediate humanitarian assistance which is essential, not least given the systematic trashing of infrastructure and transport by the militias in East Timor.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly – and this is immensely important and I discussed it at the UN with the Secretary-General and the deputy Secretary-General – there is the question of funding civil administration in the short and medium-term. There has not been any indigenous civil administration in East Timor for as long as anybody can remember. It is going to be costly to run services in East Timor. That is why I mentioned as I did contributions to UNAMET. I hope that we will be able to help there and I hope that Member States will be able to help as Portugal has already indicated it will.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is the question of longer term development assistance and longer term reconstruction help. We are discussing that with the World Bank. There was a donors’ meeting on 29 September. There is going to be a subsequent mission to look at what is required. I want to see that we do what is best for East Timor, not just pluck figures out of the air.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure the honourable Member that is not a way of excusing ourselves from the obligations we have to that part of the world, to that soon-to-be country.</p>
<p class="contents">For years every foreign minister from Europe and North America who has been to Indonesia has had a speaking note about East Timor. Now there is an obligation on us to put our money where our mouths have been all those years. I hope that we will do it in a way which is sensible and effective and focused and targeted on real needs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Council should have adopted a position on this proposal by the end of 1996. The Council did not endorse this proposal. As a result, the Commission sought to implement other measures so that premium hunting – as it is termed generally – in this area could be curtailed. Here, I would like to stress particularly that we introduced compulsory supply contracts between the producers and the primary processors, and we then also introduced the principle that every primary processor requires a licence. Finally, in addition, we also introduced a processing commitment for the harvested flax and a minimum yield. Besides this, the system of explanations of sowing areas, controls and sanctions was reinforced.</p>
<p class="contents">On top of that, within the framework of the EAGGF statement of accounts for the budget years 1994 and 1995, the Commission services cut back the expenditure declared by Spain by 10% due to deficiencies in the checking system.</p>
<p class="contents">Years 1996 to 1998 are currently undergoing inspection. The inspection has not yet been completed. We will then see what amounts can be paid out definitively. In addition, in February of this year, we asked the Spanish authorities to supervise the conditions of cultivation, harvesting and processing particularly carefully in order to prevent premium hunting. Just today I learnt from the newspapers that currently only one region in Spain has acted accordingly in this area and has withdrawn support from various producers.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know, then, that in the Spanish Parliament a committee of inquiry was set up which has looked into these matters as well. On the part of the European Union, the anti-fraud office, OLAF, was commissioned to arrange for the Spanish judicial authorities to conduct investigations as to whether the Community aid for textile flax had been administered and monitored properly and whether incidents under assessment were to be noted as criminal offences. These investigations are still underway and are being monitored attentively by OLAF.</p>
<p class="contents">But, over and above this, I would like to say in conclusion that we still see a need for fundamental rehabilitation in this area and that the Commission, by the end of this year, will therefore be putting forward a proposal for a comprehensive reform of the aid system and the market organisation system in the area of flax and hemp. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You will know, Commissioner, that the headlines of the entire Spanish press, and not just the largest newspapers, today feature the serious irregularities uncovered by the inspection of the Agriculture Department of the Council of Communities of Castilla la Mancha in the flax processing companies which were in dispute and have been examined and analysed by the Committee which has been mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Since you know about this, I would like to ask you what information you can provide regarding the investigation, which I imagine you are also carrying out in your Directorate-General, with regard to flax and premium hunters. Do you not have any information of your own? Will you take account of the information supplied by the Agriculture Department which I have mentioned? If the Agriculture Department inspection indicates evidence of serious irregularities in the flax processing companies, should the corresponding subsidies be paid or should we await the conclusion of your Directorate-General?</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the worst possible approach would be to try to prematurely close an investigation such as this flax investigation, which involves senior members of the Spanish Government in relation to the illegal payment of subsidies and fraud in this aid for the flax processing industry. There could be nothing worse than to close our eyes to it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would also like to point out to you that at the moment a number of years are being investigated by the EAGGF, and if deficiencies in the running of the market organisation system are determined in these spot check investigations, then Spain must be prepared for the fact that a lump sum penalty may be incurred, i.e. that the support payments already paid out are reduced in retrospect by a lump sum – according to the gravity of these deficiencies.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At first they talked about privileged information, but the announcement of aid is published through the European Union, Spain and the regional governments.

<p class="contents">They then tried to accuse the then Minister of Agriculture of a supposed fraud in the award of subsidies, but responsibility for the control and payment of CAP subsidies falls to the regional governments, in accordance with the distribution of competences of the Spanish State.

At its meeting on 18 September, the Commission decided the guidelines for the re-organisation of its departments. This was previously announced – on 9 July – by President Prodi. According to these guidelines, the Directorate-General for fisheries was furthermore set up. Thus this decision is also in accord with the explanation which I gave in my hearing to the European Parliament Committee on Fisheries on 30 October. Over and above that, the organisational plan for the Directorate-General for Fisheries was adopted by the Commission on 29 September. There is therefore also a valid organisation chart for this Directorate-General. Finally, at the same meeting, a new director-general for the Directorate-General for Fisheries was also decided, and so it is Mr Smidt who will, in future, be the director-general in charge of the Directorate-General for Fisheries. This, I hope, clearly establishes that the Directorate-General for Fisheries does exist.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
