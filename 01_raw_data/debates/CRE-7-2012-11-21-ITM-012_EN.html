I am sure you followed developments last night as closely as I did and with the same hope that a ceasefire would be attained. Regrettably our hopes proved to be premature. While I understand there were indeed intensive negotiations on a possible ceasefire, to come into effect at midnight last night local time, the announcement of such a truce was postponed. Negotiations have continued today – it is vital that they succeed.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations Security Council met last night to discuss developments and will resume discussions later today in New York if need be.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout the day I have also been receiving reports of a terrorist attack on a bus in Tel Aviv. This has to be condemned in the strongest possible terms. I wish a speedy recovery to those injured. The European Union reiterates its strong and unequivocal condemnation of all forms and acts of terrorism – irrespective of their origin, cause or motive – and its unwavering commitment to the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation on the ground is very volatile and attacks continue in both Israel and Gaza. We reiterate our call for an urgent de-escalation and cessation of hostilities. The diplomatic focus is now on a ceasefire as a stepping stone to a longer-lasting solution. In order to achieve this, the High Representative/Vice-President is in continuing close contact with key players in the region and elsewhere. During the last few days she has been reaching out in particular to Egypt, the US, Israel, the Palestinian Authority, the UN and the Arab League. She co-chaired the EU/League of Arab States ministerial meeting in Cairo, where she was able to speak to key players including Egyptian President Morsi and Arab League Secretary-General Elaraby. She has remained in constant touch throughout.</p>
<p class="contents">As you will have seen, on Monday 19 November the Foreign Affairs Council agreed conclusions on the violence in Gaza and Israel and on efforts to achieve a ceasefire.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union calls for a ceasefire and an immediate de-escalation, given the continuing violence over the last few days and mounting civilian losses. The EU has strongly condemned the rocket attacks on Israel from the Gaza Strip, which Hamas and other armed groups in Gaza must cease immediately. We have also stressed the need for all sides fully to respect international humanitarian law. Protection of civilians should be strictly ensured at all times. By recalling the EU’s overall position on the Gaza blockade, this text represents a balanced consensus but also reflects clear and strong EU positions on the current situation and demonstrates a unity of purpose in the present crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Gaza has placed Egypt at the heart of international efforts to bring about a solution to the crisis. On Monday, the EU stated its support for the efforts by Egypt and others to achieve a rapid ceasefire. It also welcomed the mission of the UN Secretary-General to the region and supported him in his efforts to bring about peace. The EU now stands ready to do what it can to encourage all sides to ensure the implementation of a ceasefire.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, a ceasefire is in the interests of both sides, and not least of the civilian population, which has already taken a heavy toll over the past few days, enduring both physical and psychological trauma. The loss of civilian lives on both sides has been tragic.</p>
<p class="contents">The humanitarian situation, already precarious in Gaza, has inevitably taken a turn for the worse, but humanitarian support is still available. The vital border crossing for goods at Kerem Shalom has remained open throughout the hostilities. For the time being, food is not in short supply. The World Food Programme continues its food distribution activities. Gaza’s limited power supply has not been seriously affected but clean water and drugs are in short supply.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU will continue to play a leading role on the humanitarian front and already dedicates a considerable proportion of its Palestinian assistance programme to the Gaza Strip. This includes not only our support to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees – the majority of the Gaza population being Palestinian refugees – but also direct financial assistance to support vulnerable Palestinian families. The EU is also providing support to sustain vital social services, including in the health sector, and is engaged in upgrading the Palestinian side of the key Gaza-Israel crossing at Kerem Shalom, through which so much of the support on which Gaza depends must pass.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU stands ready to reactivate the European Union Border Assistance Mission (EUBAM) at Rafah, once political and security conditions allow, to ensure its third-party role at the crossing point there, as set out in the 2005 Agreement on Movement and Access.</p>
<p class="contents">Fully recognising Israel’s legitimate security needs, the EU continues to call for a complete stop to all arms smuggling into Gaza. At the same time, it also continues to call for the immediate, sustained and unconditional opening of crossings for the flow of humanitarian aid, commercial goods and persons to and from the Gaza Strip. Gaza’s position remains unsustainable for as long as it continues to be politically separated from the West Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU reiterates its readiness to assist in the reconstruction and economic recovery of Gaza, in close partnership with the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli Government, in line with UN Security Council Resolution 1860.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, the recent upsurge of violence in Gaza and Israel, against the background of a seismic shift in the political landscape of the Middle East and North Africa, shows how fragile the region continues to be. Moving towards resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would help to stabilise the entire region and would reward those who are committed to non-violence. The EU has a strong interest in fulfilling Palestinian aspirations for statehood and Israel’s aspirations for security, including against regional threats.</p>
<p class="contents">A ceasefire, if properly implemented, would help but would not be sufficient. The need to find a sustainable solution for Gaza is more urgent than ever – a long-term solution which will not lead to yet another round of violence. To that end, and as soon as is practicable, the EU will intensify its contacts with its partners within the Quartet, and with other key players, to explore all possibilities for creating a new dynamic in the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, I have just been informed that Egypt confirms an agreement on a ceasefire. We will seek confirmation of this information but I wanted to let you know without delay about this development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">More than 35 children were among the 140 victims in the Gaza Strip; six people have been executed as alleged Israeli collaborators; a number of Israeli citizens have also killed by hundreds of rockets made in Iran; there has been an attack against civilians today in Tel Aviv; 45 000 reserve troops have been mobilised; and a ceasefire seems to have been confirmed, or so Mr Cohn-Bendit has just told me, after frantic diplomatic activity: mediation by the President of Egypt; phone calls by the President of the United States; visit to the region by the Secretary-General of the United Nations and US Secretary of State; involvement of the Arab League ministers; French-Qatari plan; and threat of a resolution on Syria in the United Nations Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, Mr President, in this case words are not enough as the situation is so serious. There is a great deal of impotence and frustration after the trite condemnation of the Council of Ministers the day before yesterday, and I believe that the most important thing is to achieve, and consolidate, a ceasefire that is guaranteed by the United Nations, and that protects the civilian population and supports the moderates.</p>
<p class="contents">We saw the alternative, Mr President, in 2008: 1 400 victims. We are only too aware that the circumstances are not the best: fragmentation and division within the Palestinian cause, elections in Israel in January and, of course, a nuclear escalation in Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, President-in-Office of the Council, what Europe must do is support unreservedly this ceasefire to prevent the worst from happening. However, we must not fool ourselves, Mr President, into thinking that there can be stability in the area, stability in the region, unless we tackle the deep-seated causes and injustices that are fuelling the hatred and violence in that troubled part of the Middle East. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Too many civilians have died, too many children have died and too much blood has been shed in that region, so it is a real relief to hear that. However, as well as consolidating the ceasefire, we also have to support President Abbas’s legitimate request to the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, Operation Pillar of Defence resembled 2008’s nightmare operation, Operation Cast Lead: they were both close to Israeli elections and there was the same escalation of violence, which on the Israeli side meant extrajudicial killings and attacks, and on the Gaza side, missiles and rockets being fired at Israel and perhaps even an attack in Tel Aviv today.</p>
<p class="contents">This time, however, something was different. Two things were different, in fact: on the one hand, the Arab Spring changed the goalposts and Gaza is no longer isolated, and on the other hand, there is also Operation Pillar of Defence, which to some extent was part of pressure on Mahmoud Abbas to refrain from putting his request to the UN.</p>
<p class="contents">Egypt acted as mediator with Gaza. I think that it is really up to us in Europe to face up to our responsibilities and support President Abbas. Our concern for Israel’s security, which is a genuine concern, is on a par with our responsibility to offer the Palestinians secure state, too, with the same borders as it had in 1967. These obligations are moral and historical and are based on international law.</p>
<p class="contents">I would point out that South Sudan became a member of the UN three days after gaining independence, even though its borders were not defined and it was still at war with Sudan. It is not right that, since 1988, when it gained its independence, Palestine has been floundering in the corridors of the UN.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we are providing some food for thought for all extremists, all those who ridicule Europe for its weakness, all those who only believe in a solution by force. It is up to us, not the United States. It is our European history; we cannot ask the Palestinians to pay the price for it.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the new Egypt, with which we have just negotiated ambitious agreements, is now helping us to resolve this crisis. I would like to send my condolences to the families of all of the victims, on both sides, but I believe that they should not have had to pay for our history and our responsibilities with their lives.</p>

That was more than 10 years ago and the violence has really never stopped since then. The most recent episode has again been particularly bloody. At the end of the day, knowing who started it hardly matters, because if you go back far enough, there is always someone else who started it and you have that diabolical chain of actions and reactions.</p>
<p class="contents">So I hope from the bottom of my heart, and I am sure that my group shares this feeling, that a ceasefire has indeed been agreed, in part thanks to the efforts made by Egypt and all other parties who have contributed, and that the cease-fire will be sustained. I also warmly concur with all those who have pointed out that we must help to remove the causes of the violence.</p>
<p class="contents">That will only become possible when both Israel’s continued existence in peace and freedom and the development of a viable Palestinian state are guaranteed. I hope that the changes in the entire region and the events of recent days will make everyone realise that the status quo is untenable, that the status quo cannot be sustained, and that every effort must be made to seek a peaceful solution for the future of both all Israelis and all Palestinians. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The simple truth is that bombarding Israel with rockets or carrying out attacks in Tel Aviv is not the way to achieve a Palestinian State. Continuing to build settlements and refusing to give Palestinians any prospects for the future is not the way to ensure the security of the State of Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this Parliament must face up to its responsibilities: it must demonstrate, state and support the strategies that could bring peace. Those strategies are clear. We need an unreserved yes to the reality of the State of Israel and the defence of the State of Israel. We need an unreserved yes to the State of Palestine, that is, a Palestinian State that is not restricted by settlements. That means today that we need to support President Abbas’s non-violent strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">If we do not support this, we will be automatically supporting those who do not want peace. That is why I am very pleased that the EP resolution that we are going to vote on tomorrow states explicitly that we support President Abbas’s strategy of requesting the UN to recognise the State of Palestinian as a non-member observer. If we do not support this, if we do not call for an end to the Gaza blockade under international control, we will not achieve peace in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not possible to imprison 1.5 million Palestinians and believe that they will continue to be rational. Yes, what the Islamic Jihad does is awful. Yes, firing rockets at Israel is awful. Yes, this has to stop, but it will only stop if these human beings in Gaza have the prospect of a better life. That is very easy to understand and that is why we say yes to Israel’s security, yes to Israel’s identity and yes to Palestine. We must stop the blockade and support President Abbas in the UN.</p>

They came about from the escalation of Gaza-launched rocket attacks, including longer-range Iranian ones, on Israel, with indiscriminate targeting of civilian areas, resulting in five civilian deaths in Israel and damage to infrastructure. Every state has the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter, so Israel is fully entitled to seek out all legitimate military targets, including rocket launch sites and ammunition dumps, which it has done on a surgical basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Hamas disgracefully sited its launchers in densely populated civilian areas, which make it guilty of another war crime by putting its civilian population at risk of Israeli bombardment. The ECR Group of course supports a two-state solution based on a viable Palestinian state which includes both Gaza and the West Bank living in peace and security with Israel. However, there can be no prospects of such when Gaza is run by an EU-banned terrorist organisation wishing to destroy the state of Israel. Of course we also wish to see negotiations for a Palestinian State to restart and we support the moderate leadership of President Abbas. However, I am not convinced by the calls within the resolution for UN observer state status for the Palestinians, as this would undermine the restarting of the peace negotiations. Nor am I convinced by the desire to lift the blockade, as I doubt very much, Mr Zala, that political guarantees or international mechanisms can ensure that there will be no maritime smuggling of arms to Gaza, particularly from Iran by ship.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, my sympathies go out to the victims of today’s bomb attack in Tel Aviv in which 10 people were injured, making the calls led by Egypt for an immediate ceasefire extremely difficult, but I do hope the announcement made by the Foreign Minister of Cyprus will hold and there will be an immediate ceasefire.</p>

More faithful to the facts, more balanced, however, would be the title ‘Situation in Israel and Gaza’. This is because it was the rain of Hamas rockets and related jihadist terror groups on Israeli soil that led to this most recent violent outbreak in the Gaza conflict. The entirely legitimate defence of Israeli citizens’ lives and property was and is at issue. Add to that admiration for the disproportionate resilience on the Israeli side before this escalation: two indispensable elements for Parliament’s resolution in my opinion. In these darker days I pray for real peace in Jerusalem, for both Jews and Palestinians.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore expect all the European institutions to adopt a responsible position in the long drawn-out Gaza conflict. The main point is that our position must be to fundamentally oppose all forces in the Middle East that deny Israel’s right to exist and threaten Israel to this day. A forceful European message is especially desirable today for Hamas’s protectors, Egypt first of all, Qatar and Turkey. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From that point of view, Parliament must adopt a clear, strong resolution to support the ceasefire – if there is one – and encourage a lasting peace and a two-state solution. However, I think that it is not possible to justify this escalation by constantly putting the two sides on the same footing.</p>
<p class="contents">In this matter, there is a party that is doing the colonising and there is a party that is being colonised. In this matter, there are the people of Gaza who are being blockaded, and the other side that is dominating them. The truth is that by calling Hamas the enemy and the representative, we have undermined the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organisation, which decided 20 years ago to abandon their armed struggle and participate in a process of dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community and the European Union have undermined, and even humiliated, the Palestinian Authority and allowed Israel to act with complete impunity. Not a single political initiative has ever been taken to ensure respect for international law.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what fuels the radical fundamentalist groups, which, now and always, justify this unacceptable policy of blockade, of colonisation and of war. The truth is that, like four years ago, the Israeli authorities are today using fear, triggering a war and causing bloodshed among the Palestinians just to gain votes in an election campaign. The truth is that this warmongering aims to prevent Palestine from becoming a United Nations observer.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to be clear now and help to ensure that international law is respected. We can do this through Article 2 of the Association Agreements and by expressly supporting Mahmoud Abbas’s request for Palestine to be given observer status. </p>
<p class="contents">There is no more apt appeal than that of Michal Wasser, an Israeli teacher who lives three kilometres from Gaza and who wrote a letter to the Israeli Prime Minister that was published in the Israeli newspaper <span class="italic">Haaretz</span>. I will read from it: ‘If you are worried about us, stop defending us with missiles. Instead of Operation Pillar of Defence, launch Operation Hope for the Future’. I use those words because I could not say it better myself.</p>

I hope it is a ceasefire that will bring some stability into a tense and very violent situation. Here in this House we should also be uniting in condemnation of the terrorist bomb attack on the bus in Tel Aviv. We should be defending the right of Israel to defend its own citizens from rocket attack, and I think that we should really examine the role of this House and these institutions. Surely we have taken our eye off the ball in that we have allowed this situation of rocket attack after rocket attack from Gaza on southern Israel to develop over many months and it is only when it becomes so tense and violent that we sit up and take notice.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to act as an honest broker in these institutions; we need to actually not pursue a quest for statehood at the United Nations, but start to build the confidence that can lead us to a viable ceasefire and a long-term solution.</p>

It was announced by the Foreign Minister of Egypt, Mohamed Amr, and the Secretary of State of the United States, Hilary Clinton, at a press conference just a few minutes ago. The ceasefire will start at 19.00 hours GMT.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, by holding a debate on developments in Gaza the European Parliament has shown once again its overriding concern for the civilian population in the region and its constant support for lasting pace in the Middle East. With 130 people killed in Gaza and five in Israel up to last night, many of them women and children, and more deaths in Gaza today, we owe it to the ordinary people caught up in this conflict to make every effort to consolidate the ceasefire reached and find an enduring solution which addresses Gaza’s isolation. Journalists have also been among the casualties and I repeat my call to Israel to ensure the protection of civilians at all times.</p>
<p class="contents">I also deplore the summary executions of seven Palestinians in the Gaza Strip over the last two days by armed groups there. This represents the grossest violation of human rights. Israeli-Palestinian reconciliation remains a key element for any durable solution. It is important to bear in mind that the situation in Gaza has also led to an increase in tensions in the West Bank, with two deaths confirmed after the use of live Israeli ammunition in the West Bank protests on 18 and 19 November. Palestinian unity is an important element for a viable Palestinian state and essential for ensuring lasting peace with Israel. The European Union has consistently called for a Palestinian reconciliation under the authority of President Abbas and has commended Egypt’s earlier efforts to bring this about since the signing of the reconciliation agreement in May 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">A negotiated two-state solution which we have always called for continues to be the only viable option open to both Israel and the Palestinian people. Escalations of violence of the type we have witnessed these last few days are a tragic distraction from this hard-nosed reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are, however, many aspects that we cannot overlook. Israel has been the target of missiles fired from Gaza for many years. A total of 1 100 rockets have been fired into Israel since 10 November and over 900 since the beginning of Operation Pillar of Defence. A further bomb attack took place in Tel Aviv despite intense diplomatic efforts. Few governments would tolerate a situation in which civilians are deliberately targeted. We are also faced with an unbalanced situation, whereby the Israeli army is forced to respect the rules of armed conflict whereas its enemy – the armed group Hamas – is not. </p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, Europe was again absent from the conflict mediation efforts. If we want a long-term solution, Europe must make its voice heard. We must, therefore, resolve the recurring missile issue in the Gaza Strip and ensure that international humanitarian laws remain at the centre of the peace process. Finally, I do not believe that the reference in paragraph 5 of our joint resolution to granting Palestine observer status in the UN is appropriate in this context. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand there is a state that has the right and the duty, like any other state, to protect its citizens from the over 5 000 missiles and rockets launched since 2005, and on the other a terrorist organisation the aim of which is the destruction of the State of Israel, deliberately targeting civilians in order to terrorise the population. The situation is even more worrying if we consider the military and financial support provided by Iran to Hamas and the ambiguous role played by the new Egypt, in which the Muslim Brotherhood is increasingly influential. To forget these facts and turn the victim into the aggressor is not only to encourage extremism but also to allow extremists to voice the claims of the Palestinian people.
