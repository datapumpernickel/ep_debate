<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jové Peres (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(ES)</span><span class="bold"> </span>Mr President, I think it is important to point out first that the Commission metes out different treatment to the various sectors dealt with in its communication. Three options are provided for sugar, but only one for olive oil, tobacco and cotton.</p>
<p class="contents">These three crops are cultivated in the same geographical area. They also have in common that they are labour-intensive and dependent on other associated economic activities. Furthermore, many of the holdings on which tobacco and cotton are cultivated cover only a small area.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the impact on the cultivation of these three crops is likely to be significant. Serious consequences can be anticipated regarding the area under cultivation, the number of holdings, employment and economic activity in producer areas.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of cotton, the Commission has already recognised the danger of the crop ceasing to be grown altogether. It has therefore proposed partial decoupling of aid. The circumstances surrounding olive oil and tobacco are similar, yet no such proposal has been made for these crops.</p>
<p class="contents">I would be interested to know what alternatives the Commission is contemplating for the area concerned should cultivation be reduced or cease altogether. I am particularly anxious about tobacco-producing areas. Doing away with tobacco growing seems to be part of some hidden agenda. I would also be interested to know from the Commission what it envisages the impact on tobacco imports will be, and whether it is of the opinion that consumption will decrease when the crop is no longer grown.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s communication also raises a number of major legal difficulties. In the case of oil, Council Regulation (EC) 1638/98 amending the common organisation of the market in fats and oils provided that: ‘no aid may be paid to olive growers in respect of additional olive trees or the relevant areas planted after 1 May 1998’<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, the Commission’s communication suggests that all aid to olive oil would be calculated on the basis of aid received in the period 2000-2002. It should be borne in mind that an olive grove only starts to come into production five years after it is planted. It only comes into full production ten years after it is planted. According to the proposal in the Commission’s communication, olive trees planted between 1990 and 1 May 1998 would be entitled to aid, but the implication is that such aid would be less than the aid awarded to trees in other groves. This raises serious doubts as to whether the guidelines outlined by the Commission are compatible with the principle of legal certainty.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the 1998 Council Regulation provided for guaranteed national quantities. Exceeding these quantities would incur penalties, and entitlement to aid would be reduced. Furthermore, aid to olive trees planted between 1988 and 1 May 1998 would also be reduced if the approach outlined in the Commission’s communication were adopted. In this case too, there could potentially be a conflict with the principles of legal certainly and equal treatment of workers. Commissioner, I would be interested to learn the Commission’s views on this subject. I wonder if it is aware of the danger of one of the affected producers challenging the regulation in the Court of Justice and rendering it ineffective.</p>
<p class="contents">The common market organisation for cotton is based on Protocol 4 annexed to the Act of Accession of Greece. It therefore has the force of a treaty. Paragraph 2 provides for the establishment of a Community regime with a view to maintaining the production of cotton in those regions of the Community where it represents a significant part of the agricultural economy. The aim was to enable producers to have a fair income and to stabilise the market, so as to improve structures as far as supply and demand are concerned. Paragraph 2.1 provided for the establishment of a Community regime aimed principally at maintaining cotton production in those areas of the Community where it is important for the agricultural economy. In addition, paragraph 3 provides for the granting of aid to production under the regime envisaged.</p>
<p class="contents">The aid outlined by the Commission will not make it possible to maintain production in parts of the Union where the whole social situation is very finely balanced. Furthermore, the consequences of decoupling aid run counter to those sections of the Act of Accession of Greece I quoted earlier. They also run counter to what was agreed in 1979, ratified in 1986, and enshrined in texts that are a primary source of Community legislation. Commissioner, I do wonder whether the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, really does believe that its proposals comply with those Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, I should like to voice my astonishment at the fact that the European Parliament has not seen fit to express its opinion on the Commission’s communication by means of a resolution. If the Commission forwards a communication to the European Parliament, the latter should at the very least produce a response to the contents. Furthermore, this is an unprecedented decision. To date, the European Parliament had always responded with a report or a resolution to communications prior to reform of the CMOs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lamy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, as Mr Jové Peres as has just said, we have placed on the table a new stage in the process of the reform of our agricultural policy concerning cotton, olive oil and tobacco, with a view to bringing these areas into line with the general system, which is now that of the common agricultural policy, with the same objectives: no longer supporting production but supporting producers’ incomes by transferring a significant proportion of the current expenditure on production to a single farm payment scheme.</p>
<p class="contents">As has just been said, it is true that the cotton, olive oil and tobacco sectors have very specific characteristics and that their production is concentrated in regions which, in general, are less developed. That is why the Commission has taken account of the economic, social and environmental effects of total decoupling in these sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards cotton, we calculated the proportion to be transferred to the new single decoupled payment, which totals 60%, with a view to allowing cotton production to continue, whilst enabling producers to achieve margins similar to those of competing crops. However, in order to reduce the negative effects on the environment, we are also proposing maximum area limits, which are in fact below the areas planted during the reference period for the allocation of the new area payment. We must therefore expect a decrease in cotton production and we are aware that this reform will require adjustments on the part of the sector. That is why we have also proposed that it should be accompanied by rural development measures. Thus, there will be an impact, and that impact will have to be accompanied by rural development measures.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to olive oil, at present we are also seeking to achieve better market orientation and greater stability of farmers’ incomes on the one hand and the preservation of olive groves where they offer a clear social and environmental advantage on the other hand. We have therefore proposed that the Member States should retain 40% of their current aid for payments linked to production in order to finance, in the form of national envelopes, aid for the preservation of olive grove that offer these advantages. This aid is intended to cover the costs of maintaining the olive trees, independent of any support for production or harvests. Because we are aware of the diversity of regional situations, we feel that the Member States should have the capacity to establish the levels of the payments so that they can adapt the amount of aid according to the local situation in order to ensure that it reaches the areas where it is most needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards tobacco, our proposals are also based on an extended impact assessment. We analysed all of the direct and indirect implications of the current market organisation, from the point of view of production and from the point of view of the impact of various options on agricultural incomes and on employment in the different regions where tobacco is produced. We consulted producers, we consulted local representatives in producing regions during a forum which brought together all of the interested parties, and we reached the conclusion that the reorientation of tobacco production was essential. We must not forget that even now the revenue of many farms does not cover the variable production costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Our study also shows that this reorientation of production may, of course, have a negative impact on employment in the sectors at both ends that are linked to the tobacco economy, even though we do not have any precise assessment of the global and local impact. There is no doubt that tobacco production is important for the economy of certain regions today and there is no doubt that its disappearance will have consequences from that point of view, which we hope to limit. Therefore, unlike the proposals for cotton and olive oil, we have adopted a specific approach which first and foremost involves entirely decoupling small farms – those where production is below 3.5 tonnes – in order to ensure immediately that these small structures continue to receive the full income support they currently receive.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as restructuring is concerned, we are proposing additional financing, by transferring a proportion of the funds currently used for direct aid for production to a restructuring envelope, which would bolster the existing rural development funds of producing regions, thus helping them to support diversification.</p>
<p class="contents">This form of redeployment, which involves using existing money to benefit restructuring, forms part of the Commission’s proposals, on the understanding that it would be up to producers and those involved in the regions concerned to lay down the most apt measures from among the array of “rural development” measures available.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, our proposals in these three sectors take account both of the general rules, which we hope are now those of the common agricultural policy, and specific characteristics. These three sectors differ a great deal from the other major crops, they differ a great deal from each other, and our proposals seek to reflect this diversity, whilst remaining faithful to our general principles. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One might well wonder if it really is so difficult to understand the President of the Council of Agriculture Ministers. I refer to Mr Alemanno, the Italian Minister. He spoke eloquently about the social importance of retaining this crop, notably in Spain, Greece and Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">Tobacco imports into the European Union are bound to increase. The President of the Agriculture Council has argued along these lines. The Spanish Agriculture Minister is of the same opinion. So too are the authorities in my constituency, Extremadura. It is one of the regions set to suffer most if this body blow to rural society is actually delivered.</p>
<p class="contents">I would point out yet again that the move could have devastating consequences for the region. Some 20 000 families would be affected. Loss of income would be of the order of EUR 200 million. I must also state that no alternative use of the land has yet been identified, other than leaving it uncultivated.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to make some summary comments. The Commissioner has endeavoured to demonstrate that the Commission undertook thorough research. It should therefore be in a position to provide figures for the drop in tobacco consumption in the Union following reform. It should also be able to provide information on the tariffs to be imposed in order to restrict imports of tobacco into the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust the Commission took careful note of events in the House this morning during the vote on the budget. Parliament rejected Amendments Nos 723 and 338. The amendments would have resulted in drastic reductions of tobacco premiums. Once again, Parliament has demonstrated its understanding of the social damage a cut in premiums would inflict on so many rural European families. I must reiterate that there is nothing else they can grow.</p>
<p class="contents">I know the Commissioner for Agriculture has feelings. I would like to hope he has taken this political message on board. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By contrast, the only chance of debating the implications of the communication for the other three Mediterranean crops will be following an oral question today. This will not even lead to a resolution in plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">There does not appear to be any justification for such differences in formal procedures. Furthermore, discrimination and variable treatment are evident in the substance, not just in the formalities. Changes are in train within the common agricultural policy. Price support mechanisms are being phased out and replaced with others designed to support income. The Commission itself is on record as stating that this concludes the 1992 decoupling. Transitional periods of between 15 and 17 years are therefore involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, immediate changes are demanded in these three sectors. This means that for cotton, olive oil and tobacco, there is to be a sudden change from aid linked directly to production to totally decoupled aid. There can be no justification for failure to provide an opportunity for us to discuss a suitable transitional period with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The employment generated in the sectors in question is of crucial importance. I refer not only to the jobs linked to cultivation of the crops, but also to jobs dependent on the processing industry, jobs in the service industries and in general to the wealth created in rural areas. Loss of production and winding up production in these sectors will have dramatic economic consequences. The result will be large-scale rural exodus.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore urge the Commission to be flexible. There must be an opportunity to discuss the various options contained in the proposals made. Impact assessments are needed too. I would remind the Commissioner that no impact assessment has yet been undertaken for the cotton sector. I also appeal to the Commission to be flexible when it comes to discussion of transitional adjustment periods appropriate for these sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I conclude, I should like to call on the Commissioner to provide a clear explanation of the importance of Community cotton production in the global market. I do so in my capacity as rapporteur for the cotton sector and in the wake of Cancun. The Union accounts for 0.5% of global cotton production. It does not grant any export refunds whatsoever. Imports are totally free. They are not subject to tariffs of any kind. Furthermore, 80% of the cotton used in the Union is imported. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patakis (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, I hereby state from the outset that, if the Commission's new proposals are implemented, they will be the <span class="italic">coup de grace </span>for Mediterranean products. The Greek countryside and three of the country's basic products, which are grown by 75% of farmers, will receive a mortal blow so as to serve the new plans and commitments of the CAP, the WTO and the enlargement of the European Union, in other words the instructions of big business and the multinationals, which are ordering that tobacco farming be wiped out, cotton farming be cut back, olive oil farming be abandoned, products in which the European Union is highly deficient. They are indifferent to the consequences, which will be painful not just for the farmers, but also for workers in processing, warehouses and so on, as well as for anyone with professional connections with these products and numerous small- and medium-sized businesses active in these sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is cruelly proposing with no turning back to abolish tobacco farming and subsidies by 2013. The chronicle of a death announced before Gothenburg. On the pretext of protecting health, it is wiping out European tobacco farming, tobacco farmers and, for Greece, all the activity surrounding the farming, trading and processing of tobacco which, as you know, is concentrated mainly on small lots in problematic mountain areas. The highest hypocrisy and cynicism, given that it does not at the same time propose to abolish the European tobacco industries which, of course, will continue to import raw tobacco unimpeded from third countries and to speculate by making and exporting cigarettes.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union of 370 million citizens is being called on to stop financing 347 000 tonnes of tobacco, while the USA of 263 million citizens continue to increase their production of 586 000 tonnes, a large proportion of which is imported into the European Union. What is clear is that tobacco farmers will receive less money, referred to in future as decoupling subsidies but in practice they will be scant unemployment benefits and pseudo-compensation for abolishing tobacco farming from the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as cotton is concerned, so that the cotton farmers do not delude themselves, the Commission clearly states in its introductory report that the new reform of the COM is being carried out because the objective of reducing the price and reducing the cultivated areas and production, for which provision was made in the 2001 reform, has not yet been achieved. In two years, cotton farming in Greece has been reduced by 70 000 hectares, with a significant reduction in the price of cotton and in producers' incomes, due to the increase in coresponsibility levies and all the absurd measures for prohibiting and limiting the number of hectares cultivated and the return per hectare. 250 000 tonnes of two years' Greek production did not receive any subsidies and only obtained the international price which, as we know, is fixed by the multinationals. The same prices are obtained by the developing countries, which the European Union is supposedly doing its utmost for. However, the Commission is demanding even greater reductions under a new disastrous reform. With a 'because I say so', it has set a low ceiling of 34 000 hectares for Greece and similar cutbacks for Spain and Portugal in a bid to lower the ceiling even further with the measures it is taking. The Commission proposals for cotton even overturn Protocol ΙV, as Mr Jové Peres mentioned, of the 1981 Act of Accession of Greece to the EEC on the basis of which the guarantee of a minimum price for producers is laid down.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor does a proven healthy product, such as olive oil, escape the European Union's eternal anti-farming policy. Hypocritical and groundless arguments are being used to wipe out olive oil farming. A spirit of hypocrisy and mockery at the expense of olive farmers prevails in the proposals in the Commission's report on oil. Having stated that there is a serious risk of cutting care for olive trees on a broad scale, while those who wrote and inspired the proposals are obviously conscious of what will happen with them, measures are being proposed which will achieve what, theoretically, they do not wish to happen, in other words 60% decoupling.</p>
<p class="contents">These three Mediterranean products are victims of the mid-term reform of the CAP which is strangling farming. The catastrophic CAP is turning into an even more efficient mechanism for wiping out farmers, especially small- and medium-sized farmers. The constant reference to environmental protection is being used as an alibi to reduce farm production. The hypocrisy becomes crystal clear from the anti-tobacco rather than the anti-smoking campaign, at a time when the cultivation of modified crops is being promoted. These proposals are not open to amendment or improvement. That is why, if they are not withdrawn as they stand, they will come up against the combative, fighting opposition of the agricultural world in order to avert their implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">When you expressed your position, Mr Lamy, you said that you had also come to an agreement with the producers. The only thing you did not do was to come to an agreement with the producers, the real producers. You came to an agreement with those who have nothing to do with production, nothing to do with the products and, mainly, you came to an agreement with the multinationals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That much is obvious to Parliament, the Commission and to those affected. When all is said and done, the fundamental objective of agricultural aid is to provide people in rural areas with a reasonable income. They will then be deterred from leaving their land and flocking to the cities or to richer parts of Europe. It should be borne in mind that we are striving to attain two of the Union’s fundamental ambitions. These are to achieve territorial balance within Europe and to prevent the depopulation and desertification of rural areas. Sadly, there is considerable experience of the latter in Aragon, the region I represent.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, this is what the common agricultural policy should be aiming at, especially in the case of crops with such social importance. It is essential to encourage people in rural areas to remain on the land in their regions in order to prevent the desertification of parts of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So far, my efforts have been in vain.</p>
<p class="contents">I put a specific question to the Commission yesterday and received a reply today. This reiterated that the reform will not have a negative impact on the income of the holdings. The Commission has also reiterated here and now that the reform will not have a negative impact on producers’ incomes either. To date, however, the Commission has failed to respond to the question concerning the effect of the reform on employment. You are yourself on record as stating that no specific assessment exists, Commissioner. I have received similar information in written answers, despite indications that 14 Directorates-General have been exercised on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Lamy, I feel it is irresponsible to undertake such a far-reaching reform without any information on the implications for jobs. Some 100 000 directly related jobs are at risk in the sector, together with 500 000 indirectly related ones. I believe the Commission does actually know this. I suggest it is withholding the figures because it is fully aware of their alarming proportions. I suggest too that the Commission is fully aware of the devastating consequences of the reform for employment and the regions affected. I can certainly forecast them myself, and so can all those who understand the sector and work in it. We are all also aware that the accompanying measures will prove inadequate. Incidentally, these measures are not additional, Commissioner. They come from the producers themselves. In any case, they will be insufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, producers are up in arms in Extremadura, the region I represent. They rightly believe the reform to be brutal, radical and unjustified. They feel they are about to be sacrificed in the interests of a cause ridden with misinterpretations. They find themselves in an unbearable situation. They are angry because they have been at the receiving end of hypocritical and misleading statements. Allow me to remind you, Commissioner, that in June the Commission gave assurances that reform would be undertaken taking account of the social situation in the least-favoured regions. Allow me to recall also that in June Parliament and the Council were instrumental in obtaining a political compromise. This entailed Mr Fischler abandoning the maximalist approach of total decoupling. Despite all of this, there is now a proposal for total decoupling of the most labour-intensive CMO.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I join with previous speakers in urging the Commission to reflect. Before adopting these regulations, I beg you to spare a thought for the anguish of those families and the future of the regions concerned. They must not be sacrificed on the altar of hypocrisy. I am put in mind of that excellent account of hypocrisy provided by the famous French dramatist Molière in his play <span class="italic">Tartuffe</span>. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The age-old imbalance between Mediterranean crop production and crop production in the rest of Europe needed a different approach, whereas we are faced with the reform of Mediterranean crop production after the failure of Cancun and with a view to enlargement. Our concern is growing, with the fear that these two processes may exert further, unendurable pressure on our Mediterranean crops.</p>
<p class="contents">Our concerns are, indeed, extremely serious regarding tobacco, even though everyone has to take on board the European Union’s principle of protecting health: these measures will cause extreme economic and social upheaval and result in foreign tobacco imports being increased to 100 %, so I certainly feel that greater caution would be in order.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to focus my remarks on one of the three crops that we are discussing because I feel that it is a case of enforced coupling. Each of these products is, indeed, special and deserved to be treated separately rather than them all being placed under the same umbrella. I am referring, in particular, to olive oil.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there is a desire to reduce the requirement for support based on the amount produced. I would take the liberty of emphasising, however, that this condiment enhances food consumption across the world and, since it is a product which is good for health, there is increasing demand for it. I therefore feel that we have two major problems: guaranteeing a safety net for income and boosting quality policies. We will discuss these proposals after the legislative proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">You quite rightly refer us to the decisions of the individual states, but we must also consider a number of general criteria such as employment. I put it to you: how can you reconcile the provision of incentives for the quality of this crop with the ongoing possibility of mixing olive oil with other fats? It is this possibility of mixing that causes a vertical drop in prices and is a blow to farmers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I note that the choice of speakers means that only Members with reservations concerning these reforms have spoken.</p>
<p class="contents">I will begin with tobacco. It has already been discussed, and I have some memories of my own from just over 10 years ago in this very House. Given the tensions that could be noted here and there between the agricultural policy and the health policy, one wondered whether we should review our options. So this debate has not come about all of a sudden: it has not just landed in our laps, we have been considering it for years, and you, in Parliament, have been discussing it for years.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Commission would indeed have been Tartuffe had it not drawn conclusions from these debates that have been held over the years and I believe that we are drawing the conclusions in a very clear manner. In this case, we are proposing a redeployment, a restructuring of this crop towards alternative crops. A clear option is being taken. We know that this will require considerable efforts on the part of a number of tobacco producers today, at both ends of the scale, but we are putting proposals, including financial proposals, on the table that allow this restructuring to take place due to the necessity that we have again discussed over the past years.</p>
<p class="contents">The same does not apply, however, to olive oil and to cotton, where the aim is not to restructure nor to convert or guide production or producers to other products. We want to maintain a number of cotton crops and many olive groves in the European Union by avoiding the depopulation or desertification of the zones in question, but also by correcting the effects of the current aid systems from the point of view of production, the environment and the finances of the European Union. That is why the Commission has presented an option, somewhere in the middle, that does not take decoupling as far as the measures adopted in Luxembourg this year for other products. It is, in fact, in order to take account of the particular sensitivity of a number of these regions that we have not gone as far as we could have gone in theory, and I can guarantee this, to have participated in the Commission’s discussions on the proposals by our friend Mr Fischler on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point relates to the difference in the treatment of sugar. Mrs Rodríguez Ramos, be assured that the reform of the CMO in sugar has begun as we have put forward three options. This is an initial discussion phase that must take place because, it must be said, it is the first time that the substance is being discussed, which is not the case for tobacco, cotton or olive oil. The Commission’s formal proposals will be presented next year, once the debate on the three options has been held with the main parties concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, to Mr Jové Peres, who was worried about the impact regarding aid to olive trees depending on the year of planting, I will say that as far as I can tell, this is not a real problem since the maximum guaranteed quantities have already been exceeded, which means that this does not have any impact on the amount of the aid in question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
