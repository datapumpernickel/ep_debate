<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solana,</span></span>   <span class="italic">High Representative for the CFSP</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Ladies and gentlemen, since I took up my post, I have always tried to speak frankly, clearly and respectfully to the Members of this Parliament. I believe that this is one of the most difficult debates I have taken part in and we must approach it with our customary responsibility and political sense.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem we are dealing with this afternoon, which involves a region that is close to us, is important. It relates to our values, but it also relates to our security and our interests. Therefore, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe it is the obligation of all of us, of all the institutions present here this afternoon, to seek formulae to resolve the situation. We must not be part of the problem, but rather part of the solution to the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the current situation in the Middle East is dramatic, tragic and dangerous, given its consequences, not only for the people who live there, but also for the region. And we must face this stark reality with the sense of responsibility we Europeans have always had.</p>
<p class="contents">I honestly believe that we have reached the limits of what is acceptable. The reality of what is going on on the ground leads nowhere; it does not lead to a solution to the problem and only leads to desperation and misery. I therefore believe that we must act on all possible fronts, not only to resolve the immediate crisis, but also to try to resolve its causes.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I am going to make a few brief comments on these three points. I believe there is no doubt that everybody present in this House and all the citizens of Europe have condemned, do condemn and will condemn terrorism. I therefore believe that we can state, with the frankness with which we have always dealt with our Israeli friends, that we will condemn terrorism a thousand times, as many times as necessary, and that we will have nothing to do with it. With the same frankness, we can say to our friends that we do not agree with the activities they are engaged in.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Loud applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I believe that today we are obliged to say what we think, from the point of view of friendship, and with a frankness which enables us to see how we have spoken on other occasions. To say it with the same simplicity, but with the same sense of responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I honestly believe that the military response of the Israeli Government that we are witnessing in the occupied territories is intolerable and we must stop it immediately. It must stop immediately, ladies and gentlemen, because it takes us nowhere and it does not lead to the solution to the problem, which is, as has been said, to put an end to terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we are aware of the enormous suffering of the civilian population, which does not want to take part in a war, which wants to live in peace, together, with two countries living side by side. To deprive whole populations of electricity and water are actions which are unjustifiable on security grounds. There is no doubt that this is taking place in violation of humanitarian law and military law, which we cannot ignore.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the Israeli Government had the right and the obligation to protect its citizens. However, we do not believe that what we are seeing is going to serve this purpose. This is not just an anti-terrorist operation, but it leans dangerously towards war, and I am very sad to say this.</p>
<p class="contents">We have at least two clear, very clear, Security Council resolutions, which do not allow for differing interpretations, and the only possible interpretation of these resolutions is that the situation of the occupied territories at the moment must end. And these clear resolutions must be applied immediately. The military operation must end, and not in stages, and not city by city, but immediately and completely.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, international law must be respected by everybody, and this implies that it must also be respected by the citizens who live on the other side of the northern border. Israel must fulfil its obligations to the United Nations Security Council. We also condemn the attacks taking place from Israel’s northern border against Israeli citizens. I insist: we will always be in favour of respect for international law.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, these military actions are not the right way to put an end to terrorism. We can ask many questions about these operations and we can ask whether, when they end, the citizens of Israel will be better protected or not, whether their security will be increased or not, whether this operation is going to fight and reduce terrorism. Unfortunately we do not think that this will be the case, that these operations will achieve this end, and therefore, honestly, as the United Nations Security Council has done, we ask that they stop.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I am very keen this afternoon to stress that one of the consequences of this military operation is the destruction of the Palestinian Authority. This is of immense concern to us, because if we have to achieve a ceasefire, with whom are we going to establish that ceasefire if there is going to be nobody amongst the Palestinian Authority’s people or institutions to speak to.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been able to do this on many occasions, on the many trips I have made in recent months – as the honourable Members know – with the security leaders of the Palestinian Authority. We worked with these people, together with Israel and the United States. Today some of them have lost their credibility and all means to act. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, we must make an effort to recover the Palestinian Authority. Progress towards peace, after this military operation, is inconceivable with a ruined Palestinian Authority. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament, the European Union, must make a more serious and stronger appeal for the Palestinian Authority to be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we believe that the Tenet plan, the security plan, must be supported, but who on the Palestinian side can carry out the negotiation contained in that plan? Unfortunately we do not know, and therefore we will have to continue to insist that the Palestinian Authority should recover the status, the responsibility and the meaning established in the Oslo agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, ladies and gentlemen, we must continue to act on all fronts. I honestly believe, and I will say this a thousand times, that President Arafat must be free to move and to meet with his colleagues.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we are in a situation, a rather ridiculous situation, if you will pardon the expression, where after Mr Zinni met with Arafat to try to implement the security operation, the leaders of the Palestinian Authority who should have seen Arafat to subsequently negotiate that security agreement were not allowed to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">At 8 p.m. last night, the representative of all of us, Mr Moratinos, entered Ramallah for the first time and spoke to one of Arafat’s closest advisors, Abu Mazen. The latter’s only request, addressed to all of us, is that Arafat’s political colleagues and leaders be allowed to see him. Fortunately, thanks to pressure from various parties, this has been possible and we must be pleased about it.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, it has been said and written that Europe has been humiliated. Ladies and gentlemen, I am going to refute that argument, since I believe that it has not been Europe that has been humiliated. There has been one Prime Minister who has not had sufficient vision to take the correct decision and the humiliation has been for the leaders of the Palestinian Authority, who on the same day were forbidden from seeing their President, their political leader, Arafat. That is the real humiliation, the one which is being experienced by the Palestinian people. We are still working within the capacities and resources available to us, and with the will which we have all shown in trying to resolve this dramatic problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, not only do we have our representative, Mr Moratinos, permanently on the ground, but also representatives of this Parliament have also been there and have witnessed the situation and needs <span class="italic">in situ</span> with their own eyes. I have had the opportunity to speak to them. I thank them for their work, which has been useful and very positive for everybody, myself included.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that what we have to do at the moment is not just concentrate on the possibility of a ceasefire. While a ceasefire is absolutely essential, we will not achieve a lasting ceasefire unless there is a political perspective for the future. Our desire must therefore be to start as soon as possible to go beyond a ceasefire and move towards the possibility of a lasting political relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">We will wonder what the parameters of this political agreement must be. Ladies and gentlemen, the agreements and the parameters of that political agreement are well known to everybody, we do not have to invent anything much. We want at the end of the day to have two States, an Israeli State with fully-recognised and secure borders and a Palestinian State with borders which are also secure and guaranteed, which can live together side by side. That has also been the offer made by the political leaders of the region in Beirut, where the European Union was present and I had the honour of working in the preceding days in order to reach that resolution. Therefore, we have the objective conditions for reaching the end of the process, but what we do not know is how to get out of the hole we are in at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, in a few hours time we will have the opportunity to meet in Madrid with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Secretary of State Powell, before he sets off for the Middle East, for Israel, with the Russian Foreign Minister, to see if we can jointly find a mechanism to end this situation. I believe that the only solution is correct, frank and intense coordination between the players I have just mentioned, in order to try to find a formula which will allow us to achieve that end.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I insist, however, that a formula allowing us out of this situation must not be strictly limited to the ceasefire, which is an essential first step, because if we are not capable of providing a political perspective, the ceasefire will be signed but not implemented by the parties. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, I humbly dare to suggest that the position we should take should be to have the willpower and courage to ask for more than a ceasefire, to ask for a political solution to be put on the table as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I said at the beginning, and I would like to repeat, that this Parliament, the citizens of the European Union, everybody, is against terrorism, and Israel can always count on us to be a serious and responsible ally in the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the current situation is mistaken and, as friends, we want to say that the sooner it ends the better. We will therefore do everything possible to ensure that the United Nations Security Council resolution is complied with and on this basis to seek a ceasefire that will allow us to begin a political process which leads to the goal of two States, two democratic States with secure borders, which can live together within the context of the countries of the region, which have already offered a contractual peace to Israel in Beirut.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, that is what I wanted to say this afternoon and I would also like to say, Mr President, on my return, when the honourable Members deem it appropriate – on the 24th, if you like – I will be very happy to come back here to explain the situation or give my impression of the development of the situation during this period.</p>

The fact that I am doing so today, beside the High Representative, Mr Solana, and also Commissioner Patten, I believe is a good demonstration of the internal cohesion existing between us all.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to say that the Presidency unreservedly supports the High Representative and the Commission and the excellent cohesion and cooperation existing between us all in order to confront this crisis. You will all agree with me that the situation in the Middle East is critical. The Palestinian territories are on the brink of a humanitarian disaster. The Palestinian Authority’s future is uncertain and the stability and security of the region are clearly in danger.</p>
<p class="contents">All attempts to relieve the crisis so far have failed and have not prevented the violence from increasing over recent weeks. A spiral of violence created by brutal Palestinian terrorist attacks and by resulting Israeli reprisals is leading to ever-greater suffering within both populations. We once again have to say that the conflict we are facing will not be resolved until the Palestinians are free from the 1967 occupation and the Israelis feel that they have peace and security; until the Israelis and the Palestinians can live in two States, with secure and internationally recognised borders.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again it is also necessary to insist that there can be no military solution to this conflict and that peace and security can only be achieved through negotiation. The international community and specifically the European Union have a responsibility and a role which cannot be ignored. It is also necessary that any intervention or initiative be rigorously coordinated, especially between the United Nations, the European Union and the main powers involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency of the Union has not been inactive over recent weeks. In the Barcelona Declaration of 16 March the European Union insisted on the need to deal with all aspects, both security aspects and political and economic aspects. The Declaration also reiterated the bases for a solution to the conflict, that is, Resolutions 242, 338 and 1397 of the United Nations Security Council and the principles of the Madrid and Oslo Conferences and subsequent agreements which would allow the two States, Israel and Palestine, to live in peace and security. As I said before, there is a double objective: the creation of a democratic, viable and independent Palestinian State, putting an end to the 1967 occupation, and guaranteeing that Israel has the right to live within secure borders, guaranteed by the commitment of the international community and the Arab countries in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest phase of the current crisis practically coincided with the end of the Arab League Summit in Beirut. The Presidency of the Union, represented by the President of the Spanish Government, attended that summit in order to demonstrate the European Union’s interest in the whole process and with the aim of supporting the Saudi initiative, which would have implied the possibility of normalising relations between Israel and its Arab neighbours, in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal to its 1967 borders, and a fair solution to the problem of the refugees, on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions. It was the first time a representative of the European Union has attended an Arab League Summit at the highest level.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has made constant efforts to achieve an immediate ceasefire, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Palestinian towns, the restoration of total freedom of movement for President Arafat, compliance with international law and the return to political negotiations. Furthermore, we have unequivocally condemned the terrorist attacks, such as the attack in Netanya, and we have urged Mr Arafat to take all the necessary measures to prevent them.</p>
<p class="contents">Israel’s right to combat terrorism cannot restrict the operational capacity of President Arafat as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people and of the Palestinian National Authority. The Union demands an end to the attacks on the general headquarters of the PNA in Ramallah and the immediate withdrawal from the city by the Israeli army. The Resolution of the Arab League Summit in Beirut forms a solid base for progress towards a political perspective for a just and global solution in the region and for the normalisation of relations between Israel and the Arab world. The diplomatic contacts of the Presidency at all political levels with the other European capitals, with all the Arab countries of the region, as well as the United States and Russia, are attempting to impose the necessary coordination between all international players in order to end the conflict and begin resolving the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently, given the gravity of the situation, the Presidency of the Union summoned the Israeli Ambassador to communicate four points to him: firstly, there can be no military solution to the conflict; secondly, the Israeli troops must withdraw from Palestinian towns as laid down in Resolution 1402, which must be applied immediately, and the siege of President Arafat must end; thirdly, Israel must allow the special envoys to carry out their diplomatic mission and have free access to President Arafat; fourthly, Israel must guarantee free access by the European Union’s diplomatic and consular representatives to their nationals, as well as guaranteeing that they can carry out their normal diplomatic and consular duties.</p>
<p class="contents">As holder of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council of the European Union, Spain called a special European Union General Affairs Council on 3 April in Luxembourg, with a threefold objective: to coordinate the actions of the Member States of the Union, to express the concern of the Presidency of the Union at the events and its will not to remain passive in an intolerable situation and to apply all the European Union’s political weight to an action intended to move beyond the current stalemate. As a result of this meeting, as you know, it was decided to send the Presidency and the High Representative, Mr Solana, to the region with the aim of meeting with the parties at the highest level, in order to demand an immediate ceasefire, the application of United Nations Resolutions 1397 and 1402 and the return to negotiations on a political agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Israeli Prime Minister’s opposition to the European delegation meeting President Arafat has unfortunately limited the scope of the mission, the absolute necessity of which the Presidency was and remains convinced of. It is also convinced that the speech by President Bush last Thursday was a further attempt to redefine the conflict and seek a short-term solution.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union believes that subsequent steps must be directed towards the following objectives: the complete and immediate application of Security Council Resolution 1402; the urgent need for a real ceasefire and the withdrawal of the Israeli army from Palestinian cities, including the general headquarters of the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah, guaranteeing the safety and complete freedom of movement of President Arafat; the diplomatic efforts of the special envoys to the Middle East must not be hindered and in particular they must be guaranteed free access to President Arafat; the need for Israel’s legitimate right to combat terrorism to be exercised within the framework of international law and in particular international humanitarian law; the Palestinian Authority, whose operability must be guaranteed, must make all the necessary effort to prevent terrorist activities; the grave humanitarian situation in the territories demands that medical and humanitarian personnel and institutions must be able to carry out their activities freely.</p>
<p class="contents">I would finally like to stress – as the High Representative did previously – that tomorrow the Spanish Foreign Minister, Mr Piqué, as President-in-Office of the European Union, and the High Representative, Mr Solana, are going to meet in Madrid with the United States’ Secretary of State Powell, the Russian Federation’s Foreign Minister, Mr Ivanov, and the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Kofi Annan, in order to analyse the situation and seek solutions to this crisis, in yet another effort by the Spanish Presidency to coordinate the efforts of the international community in this respect.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I should like to say at the outset how strongly I endorse what has been said by the High Representative and by the presidency of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">How have we come to this? Almost ten years ago Israel and the Palestinians laid the foundation for a peaceful settlement of the Arab/Israeli conflict by recognising each other's right to exist and by concluding the Oslo Accord which helped to establish a Palestinian governmental structure for the first time ever. It equally helped Israel to improve its diplomatic and economic standing in the international community. The Oslo Agreement also offered a precise time-line, at the end of which, in 1999, we should have been able to witness the final Israeli/Palestinian peace agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Alas, the promise of Oslo has not been delivered, partly because of what has happened on the Israeli side, with the rapid expansion of settlements and the non-implementation of agreed withdrawals from areas in the West Bank, and partly because of Palestinian violence perpetrated by extremist forces with the clear aim of sabotaging any Palestinian/Israeli peace deal. Subsequently, the meeting in Camp David in the summer of 2000 and the last-ditch attempts to find a negotiated solution at Taba in January 2001 also failed to bring a lasting peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then we have seen appalling destruction and misery. Israel – a democratic State that rightly takes pride in its democracy, rule of law and humanitarian principles, and which undeniably is threatened by horrendous suicide bombings – has, I fear, behaved in a way which contradicts much that it stands for.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Suicide bombings are totally unacceptable; they are horrendous acts of terrorism – and I say that without any qualification. They are wrong at every time in every place. Wrong always, wrong everywhere!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that I would have wished that Islamist leaders had been more outspoken in their condemnation of such attacks. Indeed, I wish they had been outspoken at all ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">... and I wish they would commit themselves to working more actively to prevent young people from taking such extreme action. No circumstances, I repeat, can justify such acts. I sympathise with all of those Israeli families who have lost their loved ones in such attacks, just as I grieve for all the Palestinian families who have also been bereaved.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that there are no easy solutions. In my view the only way to bring a definitive end to the wave of suicide-bombings is to tackle the source of the problems and to find a just and lasting peace. Without this there will be no guarantee of a cessation of violence. This is the only alternative, as has been pointed out by courageous people like the Speaker of the Knesset, Avraham Burg, whom we all recall speaking from that podium a year or so ago. He has openly spoken out against entering into what he described as "this insane cycle of violence".</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The current Israeli response of blockading an entire population, withholding tax revenues, extrajudicial killings, destruction of infrastructure, destruction of Arab land, is not in any sense the answer. This kind of behaviour seems not only to be aimed at the elimination of terror but also at the elimination of the Palestinian Authority and any achievements of the Oslo Accords.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Let me just give Parliament the latest report that I have received, which I cannot vouch for but it seems to me likely to be true. We have just heard that Israeli forces have broken into the Ministry of Industry, have broken into the Ministry of Education and into the Ministry of Civil Affairs. They have destroyed computers, they have destroyed files, they have destroyed office infrastructure. The expectation is that they will break into the Ministry of Economy tonight, and presumably do exactly the same thing.</p>
<p class="contents">I wonder what on earth this has to do with stopping suicide bombing?</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Loud applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is a deliberate and targeted attack on the infrastructure of government in Palestine. It is a deliberate attempt to destroy the legitimate political ambitions of Palestinians to live in a viable state in their own land.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has made clear that it will continue to support the Palestinian Authority, that it will continue to support its elected president because, as the High Representative said, there is a need for organised structures to run the Palestinian territories and to represent the Palestinian people in peace talks and internationally. As I have said here before, and as others have said, what on earth is the alternative to the Palestinian Authority? The alternative to the Palestinian Authority is Palestinian anarchy. Is that what the leaders of Israel really want?</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In such circumstances, we Europeans, appalled by the daily deterioration in the situation, appalled by the horrific violence, must ask ourselves what we can do. We can in due course provide a minimum of humanitarian assistance if and when the situation allows. In this context we must implore Israel to uphold international humanitarian law, in particular the Fourth Geneva Convention. We must urge Israel to desist from denying medical services to those in need, to end the indiscriminate shelling of refugee camps, the humiliating treatment of prisoners and wanton destruction of public and private property. This will all only leave a legacy of bitterness and it will drag Israel's international reputation through the mire.</p>
<p class="contents">We must obviously support initiatives such as the proposed mission by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, to look into the human rights situation and to recommend any appropriate action which may be necessary to protect human rights according to international standards. There is no question that sooner or later Israel will have to justify, as a democracy which takes pride in its pluralist traditions, the way it is behaving at the bar of world opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the international community's call on Israel to stop its military operation in the West Bank and stop it now. We support the Saudi initiative, which led to the historic decision of the Arab Summit at the end of March. We also support the latest UN resolutions and we have expressed our agreement with President Bush's statement urging Israel to stop its military operation without delay. However, Israel does not appear to be listening to any outside advice. It should care about the damage its current policies are doing to its international reputation. Quite apart from the fact that a policy based on repression and force, as the High Representative said, will not achieve the aim of bringing lasting security to Israel's population. All it will do is to give a malign new impulse to a cult of violence and death.</p>
<p class="contents">The General Affairs Council next week will want to consider the gravity of the situation and to discuss how we can make our concern felt to Israel in the most effective way. We want to keep open the channels for dialogue with Israel. This is what President Prodi himself certainly had in mind. However, Israel has to show for once that it is listening, that it will respect the international standards of behaviour that we have all agreed to uphold and that it will explore all avenues to peace, not just stick to a military approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Just about the whole world is united in its calls for an Israeli withdrawal from Palestinian territory and in the call for a return to the negotiating table. This is the only way to find an honourable and lasting peace which is so desired by the populations of the region and by the wider world. Unless we take that way, the only alternative will be more misery, more destruction and more death.</p>

This must be the objective of all of us, and that objective must be achieved soon.</p>
<p class="contents">In the present frightful situation we strongly condemn all the terror attacks against Israel. Every territory that claims to be independent must be able to ensure that crime and terror do not surge across its borders, threatening its neighbour.</p>
<p class="contents">The Palestinian leaders have not shown themselves to be capable of this. Nevertheless, the use of excessive military force to destroy civilian areas in the Palestinian territory is totally reprehensible and cannot be justified, even though it is said to be a war against terrorism. Furthermore, the isolation of the Palestinian leadership, and Yasser Arafat in particular, must be broken. Neither should Israeli troops be allowed to prevent wounded and injured Palestinians from getting to hospital. The Red Cross has repeatedly reported that Israeli troops are doing this.</p>
<p class="contents">If Palestinian extremists believe that they can drive the Israelis into the sea by means of senseless suicide attacks, they are wrong. If the Israelis believe that their country’s future can be secured only through the might of their army, in the long term, they will have made a tragic error. Only peaceful cooperation can ensure the existence and welfare of both countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As Commissioner Patten said in this House in February: “How many more people have to die before the voices of the moderates who are left in the Palestinian Territories and Israel are actually listened to by the citizens of those communities?” In the same debate Hans-Gert Poettering remarked that it is extremely important for the future of us Europeans that we achieve peace in the Middle East and that we should work effectively and in peace with all the Mediterranean countries. That is absolutely right, but the Israeli and Palestinian leaders know that they also need Europe. We are Israel’s largest trading partner and by far the greatest source of assistance for the Palestinians. If we do not see any sort of harmony or desire for peace in the region, we may alter our policy. We have the option of terminating the Association Agreement with Israel and we have no desire either to finance any operation that we may reasonably suspect is continually breeding terror and endorsing its use against Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning’s news concerning Israel’s partial withdrawal is encouraging, but obviously it is only really a very partial withdrawal. What Commissioner Patten has just said in a way is totally inconsistent with this news. We are calling for total compliance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1402. Hopefully, Secretary of State Colin Powell will now work swiftly and resolutely to bring about a cease-fire on both sides and Israel’s complete withdrawal, naturally with the firm and effective support of the Council. The killing must end immediately. Some time in the very immediate future Israel, the Palestinians, the European Union, the United States of America, Russia and the moderate countries in the Middle East that want to see peace in their region must sit around the table and lead the region to peace.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Mr Solana, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, these are grave times in which we have to work together in order to break the infernal cycle of violence by achieving a ceasefire which creates a window of opportunity and opens the way to negotiations in order that the states in the Middle East may live together.</p>
<p class="contents">The Europeans, for historical, cultural and even religious reasons, have an enormous responsibility which we cannot ignore. Therefore, on behalf of the Group of the European Socialist Party I propose that we send three messages.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, via the High Representative for the common foreign and security policy addressed to tomorrow’s Madrid Summit. We ask the Presidency-in-Office of the Council, together with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the United States’ Secretary of State and the Russian Foreign Minister to express with one voice the need for a ceasefire and their joint willingness to send an international peace enforcement and observation force to support it. The State of Israel was founded as a result of a decision of the United Nations, a David which is an expression of a world political and moral commitment and that David must listen to us and conform to the repeated declarations of the Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The second message we should send is to the Sharon Government, which must completely end its attempts to turn David into Goliath through its unilateral declaration of total war in response to the suicide attacks against the civil population by certain Palestinian elements. The solution does not lie in an escalation of operations aimed at eliminating the Palestinian Authority and its elected President, Yasser Arafat, whose confinement must end immediately, nor in the flagrant violations of international humanitarian law or the law of war in the occupied territories.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the third message is a message of support for the Palestinian Authority so that it can play its role in the fight against terrorism, for which it needs resources that must not be destroyed – and we must remember that we, as the European Union, have actively contributed to these resources – and can act in the future as the core of a Palestinian State.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we also want to express our concern at the occurrences of the conflict’s spreading and polarisation that we are currently seeing throughout the world. We condemn attacks on Jewish symbols and institutions in Europe and we are also worried about the increasing tension, not just in the Arab countries, but also elsewhere in the world. We are linked to both parties by means of Association Agreements and treaties which imply reciprocal friendship and cooperation. Within this framework, we wish to express our disapproval of the Israeli Government’s refusal to accept the mediation of a mission from the European Union on 4 April and we believe that, under these circumstances, the Association Agreement must be suspended in accordance with its Article 2 until we see a clear and unequivocal sign that the Israeli Government is willing to resolve this crisis.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we support and advocate an arms embargo on both sides by the European Union and will ask my Group, in relation to the transnational compromise resolution we have negotiated – although we go further – to vote in favour of Paragraph 8 of that compromise resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, despite everything, we want to reiterate our conviction that, despite the gravity of the current situation, peace is possible. As you know, we have had a long and fruitful historic relationship with our colleagues in the Israeli Labour Party. We have publicly criticised their participation in this government, but we want to continue talking to them. Just yesterday I received a call from Simon Peres, a well-liked and respected person in this House, and we have agreed to hold a debate soon with the Labour Party in our group. I urge everybody not to cease in this effort and to use all possible opportunities for dialogue with our Israeli and Palestinian friends and partners to tell them that we are not condemned to endless violence. Our own history demonstrates this and what we have to do is support coordinated international action within the framework of the United Nations, taking advantage of the proposals of the Arab League so that Madrid may offer another glimmer of hope.</p>

Both have worsened since the Western World declared war on terrorism. It seems almost as if the dominant power in each conflict has taken advantage of the anti-terrorist cause to enhance its strategic position. The impact on the lives of those caught in the crossfire, both literally and metaphorically, has been devastating.</p>
<p class="contents">For reasons of history, humanity and security, we have a duty to intervene to prevent the fighting. Diplomacy, thus far, has failed, whether sponsored by the United Nations, the United States of America, the European Union or the neighbouring states. It is probably the Saudi peace plan which currently offers the most promising pointers to peace. The warring parties themselves offer little hope of a solution. Neither Mr Sharon nor Mr Arafat can secure peace, just as certainly as neither can impose it. Mr Arafat's record of involvement in terrorism and his continued acquiescence in abominable Palestinian terrorist acts are at least in part to blame for the current situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The best way forward, in the view of Liberal Democrats in this House, is to establish an immediate embargo on arms exports to Israel and Palestine, and to persuade the United Nations to mount an international mission to send troops to the region to enforce peace.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Only then might the extremists be moved aside and the moderates be brought together by an honest broker in a political process in which the arguments of force give way to the force of arguments. Reckless military adventurism on one side and cynical acceptance of terrorism on the other offer only further bloodshed and misery and the deepening of mutual hatreds, which will delay and render more difficult the achievement of lasting peace.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent Israeli military incursions into Palestinian territory have been as shocking as they have been self-defeating. The West does have levers of pressure. You, Mr Solana, must employ them. An urgent meeting of the EU-Israel Association Council should be called. On the agenda you should have Israel's refusal to allow our representatives to meet Mr Arafat; you should have its wanton destruction of EU-funded infrastructure and its violation of human rights provisions in Article No 2 of the Association Agreement. You might talk to Colin Powell tomorrow about threatening suspension of USD 3 billion of aid annually to Israel. Human rights observers should be deployed to document the plight of innocent Palestinian citizens, who suffer daily disrupted lives, random harassment, gratuitous humiliation and, in some cases, torture and death.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community is clear on where the borders must be drawn to secure the co-existence in two states of six million Israeli and some 4 million Palestinian citizens. We cannot stand by while United Nations resolutions are flouted by an aggressive policy of settlements and a refusal to seek peace. When international law is so blatantly ignored, such bloodshed, as we have seen, is unavoidable. Those responsible must, eventually, be brought to justice. On Thursday of this week, the statute for a permanent International Criminal Court will enter into force. From Sabra and Chatila 20 years ago, to what is happening in Jenin this afternoon, Mr Sharon might reflect on whether he wishes to be among its first clients.</p>

<p class="contents">Words cannot express the horror of the situation or the atrocities suffered by the people of Palestine who are denied the most fundamental rights. The hospital in Ramallah has been surrounded and the clinics are inundated by the number of people who are seriously injured. All the hospital buildings have been destroyed. Women are dying in childbirth, their babies too. Ambulances drive round under a hail of bullets to rescue the injured and to collect the dead that they are unable to bury. A single pit has been dug in the hospital yard so that the bodies can be piled into it. A child crossing the road was hit by a bullet which paralysed him for life. An old lady went outside to fill a saucepan with water in the yard, was hit by a bullet and was killed instantly. An ill man, leaning on his walking stick for support, who came to be treated for diabetes, was killed by a bullet as he climbed up the first step into the hospital.</p>
<p class="contents">When we arrived at Yasser Arafat’s headquarters to bring him food and water, a tank pointed its gun at us. The soldiers, maintaining the firing position, forced us to retreat. In the light of these threats, we left taking the supplies with us. Are these children, these elderly people and these women, terrorists who are putting the state and people of Israel at risk?</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a curfew in force in Bethlehem. We were there on Sunday, the day of universal prayer. There was the sound of constant gunfire. We decided to accompany worshippers to church. Tanks were positioned at the bottom of the steps in Nativity Square blocking all access to the church. The soldiers ordered us to leave immediately, threatening to shoot us. We went back up a narrow pathway, past churches and schools that had been destroyed. We walked through ruins, past smashed up and burnt out cars, the rubble from collapsed houses and smashed pavements. Torrents of filthy water spewed out of crushed pipe work. Drinking water supplies stored on roofs were practically empty, meaning the inhabitants will soon be without water. They are already without electricity.</p>
<p class="contents">At the corner of a house, we were again surrounded by soldiers who pointed their rifles at us. You must be aware that our parliamentary delegation entered these towns secretly, using winding dirt tracks, through quarries and building sites, to hide from patrols, patrols of soldiers.</p>
<p class="contents">When they saw us, people of all ages came out to speak to us, to plead with us to intervene urgently. They expect so much from Europe. They are pinning all their hopes on us. They told us that they would never abandon Yasser Arafat, the person that they consider to be their only legitimate representative, despite the criticism that has been made of him.</p>
<p class="contents">As democratically elected representatives waving the white flag, we hid like terrorists to assist and protect these people who are victims of terrorist acts. Yes, it is war, but not a war of religion. No, it is a colonial war, where people are resisting military occupation and a state which continues, with utter impunity, to breach international law and the right to live.</p>
<p class="contents">In the birthplace of cultures and civilisations, universal values and human dignity are being treated with contempt and humanity is collapsing. We do not have the right to remain silent and we cannot say, in the future, that we did not know what was happening. We must face up to our responsibilities and make every effort to bring an immediate end to this massacre. We must make some genuine proposals. You must make some genuine proposals, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, Minister, to bring about a political solution.</p>
<p class="contents">If we vote in favour of suspending the Association Agreements, declare an embargo on arms exports to Israel and send a peacekeeping force urgently to protect the Palestinian people, we will be taking practical action to restore peace and security in these two states. We will also be taking action to promote peace for all the peoples of Israel and Palestine, for the entire region and the world. We will be reaffirming that a future and prosperity cannot be achieved by disregarding justice and the law.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for making your own contribution to peace by supporting this resolution.</p>

I wept for Ahmed who was lying on the ground, gesturing to us to come and help him. I wept – I have to say – for my powerlessness, our powerlessness. I wept for the Israeli soldier who had lost his humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">I told him: ‘I am not crying because I am afraid of your machine gun: I am crying for you who are young. I am crying for Hetty Hillesum who, even in the concentration camp where she was interned, wanted to be the thinking heart of the barracks. I am crying because you are stopping me helping a dying man who – as you know – was not firing. I am crying because I saw you throw to the ground Palestinian policemen who had not fired on you and I saw you force them to kneel with their hands up against a wall. You forced them to strip naked and then you blindfolded them and tied their hands. They had all come out of their building – the front door had been knocked down by force – with their hands in the air. With them was an old man whom I have seen year after year in Ramallah. We would always greet one another. ‘<span class="italic">Kiffech</span>’ he would say to me. ‘<span class="italic">Mapsuta</span>’ I would reply. I am crying because, while the tank was firing on the building you forced us to evacuate – men, women and children – a young man was asking us for bread and cigarettes from the window of another house. I am crying because Mohammed Iska’fi, a doctor who had been wounded several times, did not hesitate to help a wounded Israeli soldier. And yet we have been stopped by tanks and by your machine gun. The wounded Israeli has been taken away; Ahmed is still lying in the street: you tore him away from us as soon as we had managed to lie him down on a makeshift stretcher.</p>
<p class="contents">Are these normal scenes of war? Is there an unfortunate need for military intervention to protect the Israeli State against the wave of suicide bombers threatening to destroy it forever?<span class="bold"> </span>I believe, together with many Israelis with whom we have been working for many years for a fair peace that recognises the right of both sides to their own state, that the only way to save the Israeli State is to end the Israeli military occupation.</p>
<p class="contents">The spread of the settlements, the seizing of land, the curfews, the Palestinians imprisoned in their own villages, the summary executions, the ambulances prevented from reaching their destinations, the women giving birth at check points, the destruction of the Palestinian Authority: these are not mistakes or accidents. They are clear political policies dictated explicitly by Ariel Sharon, who, together with the parties of his coalition government, is demanding the transfer, in other words the deportation, of the Palestinian people, and not just the people of the occupied territories but the Arab citizens in Israel as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The reoccupation of land and the destruction are evidence of the Israeli Government’s intention to annex the occupied territories. The policy of using suicide bombers, which, I am sad to say, is tragically no longer limited to <span class="italic">Hamas</span> or <span class="italic">Jihad</span> – organisations which, as a woman, I consider not just to be universally destructive but also to injure my rights too – must be stopped. There is neither moral nor political justification for these acts.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand the Israelis’ fear, but I take courage from the organisation of Israeli and Palestinian relatives of victims who are saying, together: ‘Military occupation kills all people’. I take courage from a Palestinian, Jamal Zakout, who bears the scars of torture on his body, who says: ‘I am totally against attacks on civilians in Israel. Even though civilians are being killed by<span class="bold"> </span>bombing, it is wrong to take the line ‘an eye for a eye, a tooth for a tooth’, it is wrong to say that because our own children and young people are dying every day theirs should die too. We must not lose our humanity. The future of the Palestinian people must not be shaped by the culture of death and revenge.’</p>
<p class="contents">The tragedy is two-fold. I wish we were all there, together with those Palestinians and those Israelis who continue to believe that the best form of security for all peoples, for all people, lies in the mutual acknowledgement of the right to exist and live in one’s own land in democracy and freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">Shulamit Aloni, an Israeli woman, declares, every day: ‘I fought in the <span class="italic">Hagannah</span> to establish a Jewish state in Palestine and I find we have a colonialist state. I do not support this, I am ashamed of this army, of our governments who are destroying lives and all our human values in the name of security.</p>
<p class="contents">I apologise to my group for using the common time available to us for such a personal testimony, although it is full of political relevance.</p>
<p class="contents">We call upon the European Union to take up a firm, clear position in line with international law and the protection of human rights. It must use all the means available to it to compel the Israeli Government to withdraw from the occupied territories. It must recognise the State of Palestine with the 1967 borders. It must call for the immediate deployment of an international force. It must suspend the Association Agreement with Israel for Israel has patently violated Article 2; there is no need for further analysis. Peace is vital for the Palestinians, for the Israelis, for the entire region and for us too.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not taking sides. I am for peace, we are for peace; there must be no victory on either side. But it needs to be established where the responsibilities lie and we must shoulder our responsibilities fully, so that we can all declare together that we want the reign of death, pain and suffering in Palestine and Israel to come to an end.</p>

<p class="contents">The first is, of course, the emotion that the House feels in response to the account of what is happening in this part of the world, which concerns us all. The successive attacks and killings have led to war; this is what we are talking about here, war. It is war that involves many horrific acts of violence.</p>
<p class="contents">My second sentiment is, when I listened to Mr Solana, who spoke with a great deal of honesty – and I am more than happy to acknowledge this – and impartiality today, what I felt, as well, was a certain feeling of helplessness. It is true that the European Union has so far been unable to find the resources required in order to put all its weight behind finding a solution which would bring an end this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, this is not a straightforward matter, of course, and I am perfectly aware of this. I must, however, reiterate a number of things, particularly the fact that peace was almost achieved and that the reason it was not is precisely because the agreement proposed by Mr Barak was rejected, and since then the situation has only deteriorated. I am convinced that the proposal by the Arab countries will not bring an end to this situation either. The only way to bring this tragic situation under control is by sending a military intervention force to the area and the international community must also make a firm commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be all the more attentive as there is a risk that this situation could have consequences in our countries, where we are beginning to see confrontations between representatives of various communities. We are also seeing an increase in some racism, and anti-Semitism, which is unacceptable. This is why I shall wholeheartedly support the proposals that will be made to send a peacekeeping force to the Middle East and to obtain the resources needed to put an end to this situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President, four months on, we have to conclude that Arafat and the other Palestinian leaders have not met this demand by the EU Member States in any way. What is worse, evidence is mounting that the President of the Palestinian Authority is directly involved in acts of terror against Israeli citizens. What conclusions does the EU draw from this line of action, being, as it is, the Palestinian Authority’s largest donor? Should we not seriously consider the option of financial sanctions in this instance?</p>
<p class="contents">It is legitimate that the Sharon administration, albeit only after numerous, extremely bloody Palestinian suicide attacks, has finally eliminated the Palestinian terrorist networks of its own accord. Western diplomacy is now bringing heavy pressure to bear on Israel to dismantle the military operation. However, what security guarantee do the EU and its Member States offer Israel? Can Europe promise that after the withdrawal, the Palestinian terror against the residents of Israel will not flare up again in all its intensity? I call on the Europeans <span class="italic">and</span> the Americans to specifically put this nightmare vision for the potential victims, the Israeli citizens, on the agenda tomorrow during their summit meeting in Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the escalation in the Middle East has meanwhile led to extremely shameful expressions of blatant anti-Semitism in Member States of the European Union. I call on all the European institutions to unreservedly condemn these, and hope that the Member States can counter this anti-Semitism effectively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And Europe – it cannot be denied – has produced nothing but a cowardly silence on this matter to date.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe cannot claim that it is being completely neutral as regards Israel and the Palestinian Authority. We will have no moral authority for any form of mediation if, most of the time, we only ever condemn one side, if we cannot show that we are making the distinction between a democratic country, the only one in the entire region, which is, moreover, committed to respecting human rights – although we do not know for how long – and a satrapy where those suspected of collaborationism are executed without even the semblance of a trial, if we do not acknowledge the fact that the Israeli army is engaged in an armed response which may be a futile mistake and which must not and, above all, cannot be the only response, but which is caused by the repeated massacres of unarmed, blameless civilians. Few tears are shed for them.</p>
<p class="contents">As the High Representative, Mr Solana, said, in attempting to eliminate the infrastructures of terrorism Ariel Sharon is likely ultimately to produce fresh armies of fanatical terrorists, but we must not for one moment think that, unlike those who destroyed the Twin Towers, the Palestinian suicide bombers are not backed by an authority which is just as bloodthirsty and cynical.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on Ariel Sharon to withdraw and stop using armed force. That is all well and good. But what are we going to ask Yasser Arafat? Always providing Mr Arafat has a choice of whether to say ‘no’ or not, as he has done thus far. When we ask Mr Sharon to stop his violent retaliation, what guarantees, what solutions, are we going to offer him? There is talk of economic retaliation against Israel. It would be interesting if the Palestinian Authority were to be asked to carry out an inquiry into European financing, at least to reassure the European taxpayers that they are not paying the salary of officials and leaders involved in organising suicide attacks?</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must take a clear step and offer the Israeli democracy full integration into the Union. This would be a way to overcome its authoritative behaviour, to stabilise the institutions of the State of Israel and to offer a strategic possibility of economic development too. It would be a way of giving the Palestinian and Israeli citizens tangible hope of peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the same area we must show our deep concern about the development of events on the border between Israel and Lebanon and call on the influential countries, such as Iran and Syria, despite their obvious indignation, to offer their good services to contain the climate of tension. But in other geographical areas we have also seen angry reactions of solidarity with the humiliations being suffered by the Palestinians, as in the case of the massive demonstration in Morocco.</p>
<p class="contents">The Israeli Government must understand that it cannot ignore the clear views expressed by the international community. We trust that tomorrow’s summit in Madrid, with the Presidency-in-Office of the European Union, the United States, Russia and the Secretary-General of the United Nations, will serve to confirm the strong will and agreement of the sponsors of the peace process that the last resolutions of the United Nations be complied with. It appears that a partial withdrawal of troops is taking place and this is a step in the right direction, but it is clearly insufficient, especially if what Mr Patten has said today is true.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I come from a country in which terrorism is the main concern of the citizens and we therefore feel particular solidarity with its victims. But not everything is acceptable in the fight against terrorism; the Rule of Law and international legality must always be respected. From this point of view, it is not acceptable, under any circumstances, to attempt to undermine the structures of the Palestinian National Authority, which is for the moment the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, however worthy of criticism some of their actions may be. It is true that we must demand that it condemn the attacks: there are no good terrorists and bad terrorists; they are all equally detestable. They must do everything they can to prevent attacks and to arrest their perpetrators and instigators, something which unfortunately has not always happened.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Union we must ensure unity of action. A divided Europe is like having no Europe at all. There has been progress between the Foreign Ministers of the Member States which I believe our public opinion considers to be insufficient. I believe there are other avenues; there are instruments in international practices which allow us to express our displeasure towards the policy of a government such as Israel’s.</p>

<p class="contents">Violence also prevails for the Palestinians on the West Bank and in Ramallah, with hundreds of Palestinians dead, among them many children. Those of us who are friends of Israel, those of us who defend the Israeli state and its right to exist must react vigorously when the military and the government act as they do. The escalated violence and brutality of the occupation is quite disproportionate. A whole world is now united in demanding that Israel withdraw from the Palestinian areas. Its action is indefensible, and the attacks against Palestinian civilians will lead to more, not fewer, suicide bombers. The violent offensive and the killing can never lead to peace.</p>
<p class="contents">If Israel is at war, as Sharon has stated, there are certain international conventions and laws which apply. Now, reports are flooding in that these are being violated. We do not know this with any certainty because no organisations or media are permitted in the area. Our fellow MEPs tell us that ambulances are not allowed to get through, either.</p>
<p class="contents">The hatred between Sharon and Arafat is bitter and long-standing. It seems as if the parties can no longer escape from the situation. Comprehensive international commitment and a clear list of demands are therefore needed. It is good that the United States has stepped up its commitment and finally sent Colin Powell to the region.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU too must do more, however. At the meeting on Monday, the ministers must ask themselves what we can do. An immediate weapons embargo? Yes. Obviously, the Association Agreement must be discussed. I do not believe that, in the present situation, this would be the right moment to suspend it, but the matter must be discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be possible for Palestinians and Israelis to live in peace, side by side. There would be no more important contribution to world peace and the international fight against terrorism than if this conflict were to be resolved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The violence must end and must make way for lasting peace. A Palestinian state alongside an Israeli state. However, we are disappointed with the resources used by the international community to achieve this goal, and more specifically, with the EU’s powerlessness. We are ashamed by our powerlessness in the face of the suffering of so many people, so many unnecessary killings, the capture of so many citizens. The Oslo spirit is dead. Israel is guilty of state terrorism. In his government, Mr Sharon has appointed ministers who want to reclaim the West Bank. The serious human rights violations by Israel in Jenin and at many other locations in the reoccupied territories are tantamount to a cancellation of the Association Agreement by Israel itself, since respecting human rights forms part of the very substance of this Association Agreement. The EU must now suspend the Association Agreement. The proclamation of an arms embargo is not sufficient. The Israeli and Palestinian peoples are crying out for peace, water, bread and dignity, but instead they are swamped by violence and war. We must do everything in our power to stop this violence. This is why we must decide to send a peace force now, as this has become inevitable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unless the root causes of conflict are addressed, no peaceful solution can be secured between the opposing sides. Prime Minister Sharon has offered an uncompromising war on terror, but he has not offered any diplomatic solution to avoid the escalating spiral of violence and brutality.</p>
<p class="contents">The Tenet and Mitchell proposals are still on the table and, together with the recent proposals from the Saudi Arabian government, they too provide a basis for the resumption of peace talks if there is a full compliance with the recent UN resolutions by the Israeli government.</p>
<p class="contents">I firmly believe that Yasser Arafat is the political leader that the Israeli government must be negotiating with at this time, and that seeking to topple the Palestinian Authority is a recipe for long-term instability and will only intensify the hatreds between the Palestinian and Israeli people as well as between Israelis and other Arab countries in the Middle East. The two sides will not be brought together unless there is an immediate and serious third-party mediation, and the US government must be seen to be vigorously involved in this process in a firm and meaningful way, as must the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Consideration must be given to suspending the EU-Israel Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreements which exist between the Union and Israel if Israel's military attacks on the Palestinian people continue.</p>

Nor is there anything at all to suggest that Israel is concerned about its reputation at the moment. However, Israel does respect money, and the only way to put pressure upon Israel is therefore to demand preliminary talks on our trade agreements. I was in Israel in January when there were large demonstrations against reductions in the amount of support for students and the elderly. Like any politician, Sharon obviously wishes to be re-elected, and the prospect of re-election would fade from sight if Israelis were exposed to economic sanctions because of the way in which he governs. The EU has for all too long indulged Sharon’s government in its attempts to obtain influence over it, and the only result is Sharon’s refusing the EU access to talk with Arafat. All the friends I made in Israel when, in 1967, I landed there with the first plane-full of volunteers and subsequently stayed for two years are agreed that Sharon’s state terrorism is destroying Israeli society from within, and we must therefore curb Sharon for Israel’s sake too. When does the EU plan to say that enough is enough? And when does the EU plan to call a spade a spade and designate as terrorism what Sharon and his soldiers and settlers are doing, namely killing thousands of civilians and innocent people – men, women and children. For until we put that label on Sharon’s actions, he can, as now, continue to cut off supplies of food, water and medical aid by shooting at ambulances, all in the confident assurance that we do not plan to do anything at all other than talk and that we shall never take action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Violence does not bring justice, it does not put wrongs right, it does not address the root causes of a problem.</p>
<p class="contents">There are appalling violations of international law and human rights constantly taking place in the Palestinian territories at the moment, and the international community must stop this, as it must stop the madness of terrorism which is leading young people to sacrifice their young lives for a cause which, far from benefiting their own people, makes more innocent people victims and gives the leader of the Israeli Government the excuse to declare unilaterally outright war on the Palestinian Authority, its structure and members, starting with President Arafat.</p>
<p class="contents">One important development is that we have succeeded in organising a meeting, to take place tomorrow in Madrid, in which the United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations will, at last, be able to focus their efforts in the direction – it is to be hoped – of immediately sending an international peacekeeping force to the region which will be able to enforce the ceasefire and put an end to all the violations of rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to bring about compliance with the series of resolutions adopted by the UN Security Council, to bring about the immediate, total withdrawal of the Israeli army from the occupied territories and the release of President Arafat, we must put all possible pressure on the Israeli Government, not least placing a question mark over the EU-Israel Association Agreement.

That is very much how it appears from their own subjective point of view. It is a struggle for existence in which neither side exactly has the benefit of good political leadership. Given that situation and the fact that emotions are running so high, it would be wrong to try and establish how one action or another started. Anyone familiar with the more modern or more ancient history of the Holy Land knows that he who cast the first stone is impossible to find!</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason we should not be stirring up fresh emotions but rather trying to inspire trust, so that the peoples there can find some peace and thus be able to talk to each other again. So it is extraordinarily important for us not to throw oil on the fire. That is why I would like to thank you all for coming here today and for the meeting being held in Madrid tomorrow. If the European Union, the United States of America, Russia and the United Nations can reach a joint position worked out by their most high-level foreign policy representatives and jointly put this over to both parties, then for the first time there will be a chance of the seriousness of the situation being appreciated by both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, there is a credibility factor, because just as each party has a credibility gap on one side or the other, there is a collective credibility here. We should take advantage of that. Credibility that we are in a position to give security guarantees for a state of Israel and a Palestinian state, that we are in a position to take onboard the proposals of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, including the recognition of the state of Israel by the Arab states, and on this basis to establish the credibility of the idea that it is now time to withdraw and to refrain from terrorism, which is a condition for entering into concrete negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">We have got our own concrete interest here, not just a general interest in peace and human rights. Because of our close geographical proximity we are interested in the anti-terrorism coalition not collapsing and in a new fundamentalism not being used as an excuse, and we have an interest in our Mediterranean policy making successful progress under the Barcelona Process. We should therefore seek to ensure that Mr Solana, Mr Patten and the Presidency should not travel alone to Jerusalem with Vice-President Powell travelling there alone eight days later. Please try to ensure tomorrow that you will go there together. That would send a message from the world community to the warring parties as a way out of this appalling situation.

That is why I feel that, while the European Parliament must call for peace and make every effort to bring peace to the region, it must also state clearly that a government which we respect, a country for which we have sincere affection and which we want to protect has a responsibility to change, and that it is precisely because we want to protect it that we are asking it to do so.</p>

The sad conclusion we must draw is that there is currently no possibility of stopping the war in the Middle East. In any case, in the Middle East, two men – Ariel Sharon and Yasser Arafat – are continuing to jeopardise the stability of the world today, and although they talk of peace they do not genuinely desire it, they are shying away from it, avoiding it, for neither of them want peace: both hope, or believe they will win the war, one with superior military force and the other with suicide bomb attacks.</p>
<p class="contents">The effects of this crisis in the Middle East are starting to impact on our countries too, as Mr Pasqua said just now. Racism is on the increase and is attacking the rest of the world, Europe and the United States, leading to dangerous misunderstandings and differences of opinion between these two continents, between Europe and the United States. It is difficult to envisage any sort of solution but, as Mr Solana said just now, we need to establish a political perspective for the future, and I feel that the idea of a sort of international Marshall plan aimed at resolving at least a small part of the problems of the Palestinians could be a useful contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">The Italian Government has developed an initiative of this kind, an initiative to support the economy in the Middle East and, in particular, the Palestinian economy, an initiative which Mr Berlusconi recently proposed to all his European colleagues.

Words alone, however, are not enough! We have already said as much as can be said and no one has listened. Mr Solana is wrong: we have been humiliated by the treatment that the European Union delegation received in Israel, which is unacceptable. We must now translate our words into action to ensure that we are treated with the respect we deserve. At the point Ariel Sharon’s Government has now reached, only action can be understood. Israel is no longer abiding by the rule of law, as hard as this may be for us to accept. It is not complying with international law or with its own laws. As Commissioner Patten said, the fight against terrorism that we all support cannot be used as an excuse to disregard international law. I therefore support the measure, which must be implemented as a matter of urgency, to suspend the Association Agreement between Israel and the European Union. This is the only option we have left. We must also insist that the United Nations sends a military intervention force to enforce the cease-fire. Following the repeated statements by President Bush, which have not yet led to any action, there is no other way. I used to have a great deal of respect for Israel, but – and it pains me to have to say this – its army is acting like a real colonial army and, in the war that it is waging on the Palestinians, is not even respecting the Geneva Convention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, his policies have lead to less security for Israel and less peace for the region as a whole. We in Europe too should criticise what Israel has done, because we should measure Israel by the yardsticks that we have in common, those of constitutionality and the protection of human rights. However, that statement should not obscure what this conflict is really all about. It is about the right to exist, the very principle of Israel's right to exist, and not about that of the neighbouring Arab states. One aspect of a secure existence is a life free from terror. The Israelis have always been denied the right to a life free from terror. Israel has constantly not only been threatened by terror, but terrorism has also been put into practice by organisations like Hamas and Jihad, who have been able to ply their bloody trade in the Palestinian areas almost with impunity.</p>
<p class="contents">Some responsibility for these acts of terrorism clearly lies with the Palestinian leader Mr Arafat, who has never firmly distanced himself from terrorism, let alone effectively fought against it. The inadequate measures taken to combat terrorism have destroyed a great deal of trust. We Europeans should not let our influence be diminished still further by creating the impression that we are no longer capable of distinguishing between cause and effect. No conflict can be solved through terrorism and violence. Accordingly both sides must end this violent conflict. Israel must withdraw from the Palestinian areas. The acts of terror by the Palestinians must cease. We need to make demands of both sides.</p>

He confuses the aim of fighting terrorism with the liquidation of the Palestinian Authority and the daily carrying out of massacres. Using his tanks, and with our consent, he has managed to establish a new political-administrative category: now there are occupied Palestinian territories and re-occupied Palestinian territories.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the advice given by President Bush that the perpetrators of the massacres withdraw from the places they have cruelly and unnecessarily destroyed. Powell has pointed out that the President does not give orders to the Prime Minister of a sovereign country, but it does not appear that the advice has done much good. Sharon will decide to order a withdrawal when the massacre is finished. Unless we all, those of us who do not carry out massacres, decide jointly that there is a limit, even for sovereignty, when that sovereignty is employed in a way that goes against the dignity and ethics of humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">I found Secretary of State Powell more lucid when he said that we may be radicalising a whole new generation of Palestinians and that many new terrorists are perhaps waiting to act when the current operation ends. That is the possible effect, to put an end to the moderates. The day before yesterday, as we know, almost a million Moroccans demonstrated in Rabat against Sharon and in support of Palestine. They are moderates or radicals. If amongst all of us we do not stop Sharon now, hate and radicalisation will spread throughout the Islamic world. We must take concrete and appropriate action now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The situation was desperate then. There was a vicious circle of terrible violence but at the same time the recent knowledge that the ingredients for a solution had been on the table at Camp David and Taba.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then the security situation has deteriorated catastrophically. Terrorist extremists have committed the most vile acts and deliberately incited the emotions, prejudices, ignorance and anxieties of vulnerable peoples, particularly among the Islamic communities, and aroused the deepest fears among the Israelis. We should remember the strategic vulnerability of Israel, a tiny country whose people have been subjected to the most terrible terrorist attacks, at once unpredictable and random while organised and planned in order to have the most cruel and devastating effect.</p>
<p class="contents">I think of the Israeli mother who would not let her small children travel on the same school bus in case they should all be lost. I think of the parents of those teenagers and others murdered or maimed in countless terrorist suicide bomb attacks. There is no moral or political justification for such horrendous acts.</p>
<p class="contents">But I hold no brief for Ariel Sharon. In fact I am baffled and dismayed by his approach. On the one hand he has called for the Palestine authority to bear down on the terrorists in its midst but on the other he has crippled those very agencies which have the capacity to take such action. He has wanted to change the attitude of the Arab peoples to Israel, but by his own actions has helped stimulate primeval hatred in yet another generation of Palestinians and fuelled the martyr culture.</p>
<p class="contents">We must recognise the desperate plight of the Palestinian people, so many of them abandoned by their Arab brethren in refugee camps for generations, prey to extremists, so often lacking the quality of leadership at crucial moments that would help release them from their misery. These are the raw ingredients that we have to work with.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage the European Union should not be self-interested, trying to promote some role for itself, but balanced, positive and constructive. It would certainly not be helpful for the EU to take one side in this matter by some policy of sanctions against Israel, for example. This would merely give comfort to extremists and sharpen the differences with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">What is needed now is a bold, generous, urgent international initiative with the European countries, the United States, Russia and well-meaning Arab states, speaking with one voice. We need to come together with a clear offer of massive international assistance. There are other darker forces waiting in the wings of this conflict. Time is running out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let us, therefore, shoulder our responsibilities, and I hope that tomorrow in Madrid, Mr Solana, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, you will be able to convince President Bush’s envoy that the time has come to become involved in this conflict to find the solution, and this can only be a political solution.</p>
<p class="contents">This also assumes that, in the future, when the ceasefire is in place and the withdrawal from the occupied territories has been accomplished, the Security Council will be able to send an intervention and observation force to the area. Its task will never be to enforce peace but will be to remind each party of its responsibilities within the Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority of French Socialists is in favour of suspending the Association Agreement, but we must ensure that we find a solution where we are still able to address all parties and that we do not put in place mechanisms which might be overturned, which would strengthen support for those whom we wish to punish.</p>

Third and finally, we must urge the governments of the European Union to organise immediately their participation in implementing a peacekeeping force should the United Nations Security Council decide to use this option. I recall that I once said, in this very Chamber, to our colleagues in the Knesset that this was the only way to restore peace.

I would like to reassure him: there was no tourism, only war. The eyewitness accounts of Members of this Parliament are one contribution to opposing this war. While we were there we saw things we would have preferred not to: we saw check points closed by the Israeli army, bursts of machine gun fire at old people and children, we saw Israeli army tanks parading in the courtyard of Ramallah hospital.

<p class="contents">In this sense, Sharon's political actions are to be condemned. At this stage, sitting on the fence – or going nowhere near the fence – is tantamount to complicity.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solana,</span></span>   <span class="italic">High Representative for the CFSP</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, due to time restrictions, I shall make a few brief comments.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the last intervention by Mr Souladakis, I would like to tell you that tomorrow will not be the first time we have spoken to Colin Powell: we speak to Mr Powell practically every day and it is certainly partly as a result of those conversations that the meeting will take place tomorrow. I do not share the frustrating feeling that the European Union carries no weight. Quite the opposite: as a result of these contacts, of this passion we have applied to trying to resolve the problem, tomorrow’s meeting in Madrid has been called and the major players in relation to this conflict will reach a collective agreement to try to resolve it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that, at least for tomorrow, I believe there are three fundamental messages. Afterwards, we will return to this House to explain the development of the issue by means of a parliamentary debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The first message, which is fundamental, is that the representatives of the major players who are going to meet tomorrow must make an effort to ensure that the Security Council resolutions be applied immediately, without delay. I repeat: without delay.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is essential that for the first time a joint and public declaration of this kind should be made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the European Union, the Russian Federation and the United States. And I believe that we Europeans must support this proposal and this type of declaration.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I believe we must do everything possible to ensure that the important players meeting tomorrow see to it that the Palestinian Authority is not degraded any further. Everything possible must be done to ensure that the Palestinian Authority recovers its capacities. It is highly contradictory – as has been stressed already – to ask the Palestinian Authority to sign a ceasefire agreement, to arrest the terrorists who are free in certain parts of Palestine, when it does not have the means to do so. This morning, you have seen the news that Israeli forces have withdrawn from a city. On leaving that city they have bombed and destroyed the general headquarters of the Palestinian Authority. At the same time it is very contradictory tomorrow to ask the Palestinian Authority to lead the way in finding the solution for a ceasefire. Therefore, and as a result of this reasoning, it seems to me fundamental that this message be sent rigorously and clearly. It is a message that must be understood and that must be expressed clearly so that everybody understands it and so that our Israeli friends also understand it. We all have many friends in Israel who agree on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">It follows from this approach that it is necessary for the international community to be willing to engage on the ground. This is something that I am saying with conviction, for the first time. I believe that we must begin to think seriously about it. But this is not going to happen in 24 hours, it is not going to happen without any mandate. When it was said that the Europeans should be deployed in a military or policing sense – or I do not know how – in the territories, it is clear that this will require some kind of mandate. And that is what we have to work on: on ensuring that the next Security Council Resolution allows, once the necessary conditions are in place, for the possibility of an international presence on the ground. I believe that is a reasonable measure which the European Union can support, but which it must support jointly with others, in particular the United States and the Russian Federation. That is what we must do.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly: tomorrow we must send a clear signal – not just the Europeans, but collectively with all the major players – that there must be a political perspective. And there is no need to invent that perspective, since one has already been invented: it consists of two states, with secure borders (one of which is the Palestinian State, whose borders must be set in accordance with the Security Council Resolutions, that is to say, those set in 1967) and able to live together. That is the final objective. How can that objective be achieved? That is the difficult question that we have been working on for many months. It is possible that the only way forward is the Tenet Plan and that, afterwards, the Mitchell Plan should be implemented, which I know very well since I drew it up jointly with Senator Mitchell.</p>
<p class="contents">I am beginning to rather doubt – and this causes me to be very pessimistic – that the Tenet Plan, followed by the Mitchell Plan and followed by a negotiation – and I do not know when it will take place – is going to be the ideal formula. If we do not have a negotiator on the Palestinian side, it is going to be very difficult – as I said before – for us to achieve our aim through this process of tiny steps. That is my worry and that is why I am pessimistic. I am not going to suddenly come up with some miraculous solution and it would be naïve, stupid and unworthy of you to expect it. However, if we have to seek some solution, I have said on previous occasions that we need an ‘express’ Mitchell Plan, a fast Mitchell Plan, not for the times in which it was conceived, but a much faster Mitchell plan, which would lead us as quickly as possible to a final agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I think it is essential that we ask that the Beirut Resolution – which has not been read properly and it should be, since some of its points are very important – should also become a United Nations Security Council Resolution; that that commitment, this gesture from the Arab world towards Israel’s security should also become a Security Council Resolution. I believe that that would be an additional element in terms of recovering the trust between the parties, a trust which unfortunately does not exist at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a comment of a personal nature: I know that many of you have suffered a lot. I have seen some people who have particularly suffered, some of whom have even been expelled from the region. I can say that I understand your feelings just as I understand the feelings of the Palestinians and the Israelis. I have seen many Palestinians die and I have seen many Palestinians suffer and I have also seen families of old friends on the side of peace in Israel who do not take their children in the same bus to school and who separate their children into two groups for fear of dying in a terrorist attack. We must understand all of this. If we do not understand the two things, we will never resolve the problem. Therefore, let us understand the problem in depth so that we can resolve it.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, as for me, Javier Solana, rest assured that I will never cease working for peace in the Middle East, as I have done up until now. I have been working for it since the Madrid Conference, many years ago, and I expect to continue working for it while I still have the energy and the strength.</p>

All I can say is that I, and the Presidency as a whole, support everything Mr Solana has said in response to today’s debate in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to make two observations. The first is with regard to the meeting that will take place tomorrow. I believe that we can allow ourselves to feel a degree of satisfaction, insofar as it is no coincidence that this meeting is to take place in the capital of the country which currently holds the Presidency of the European Union. This meeting is taking place on the EU’s, and the Presidency’s initiative, and therefore will be the most important event that has taken place until now with a view to achieving peace, and presents the only real opportunity to bring together all the major players, in one location, to break this vicious circle of violence. We hope that all present will share the Presidency’s, and, naturally, the whole Union’s, determination to see this succeed, a determination that has been expressed here in Parliament, with whose support a final effort will be made at tomorrow’s meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">The second observation I would like to make, Mr President, refers to the need, that many honourable Members and leaders of political groups have expressed, for us to review our Association Agreement with Israel, in other words, that we should use our Association Agreement with Israel as an instrument. I would like to say emphatically that the Presidency totally agrees with this approach and this very morning the Spanish Foreign Minister, Mr Piqué, announced that he intends, in agreement with the Commission, to call on the Association Council to carry out a review of our relations with Israel.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I have to tell you, however, that for any steps to be taken within the Association Agreement, we need unanimity from the Council. Put simply, and as you are all aware, these measures do not only depend on the determination of the Commission or the Presidency-in-Office, but on that of every Member State of the European Union. We are already well aware of this Parliament’s determination. I believe that this will also be reflected in the resolution that will be approved tomorrow and I hope that this will act as a wake-up call to the conscience of every EU government.</p>

We are not alone at this night session. Working alongside us are not only the interpreters, who you can see, but also a good many people behind the scenes, and whose work will continue once we close the sitting, because the Minutes have to be ready by tomorrow. So please all try to ensure that can get on as quickly as possible and in an orderly way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
