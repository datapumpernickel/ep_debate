<p class="contents">It was following essential work in partnership with the different political groups and the representatives of the Commission and the Council that we arrived at this text, which will be put to the vote tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a report that we can be satisfied with, as it places consumer protection at the heart of our concerns. By considerably reducing levels of cyclamate in drinks following an evaluation by the Scientific Committee we are responding well to the demands of European citizens in terms of consumer protection. The Commission undertaking to re-evaluate all sweeteners in the near future is also a decision that is in line with our objectives, as we are aware that we need consistent statistics and that we need to regularly re-examine our positions in the light of the new data.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand my fellow Members in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance who wish to place particular emphasis on aspartame. However, in this respect we need to take into account the recent evaluations that have taken place both in France and the United Kingdom, and consider that perhaps there is no reason for singling out aspartame, as we know, of course, that it is going to be evaluated on a more global level anyway.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we need to realise that we also have our weaknesses, and the fact that we were not able to reach an agreement on the subject of defining fine bakers’ wares shows that our work is not quite finished and that labelling will have to be the subject of future legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">This element of the report also demonstrates the position that we intend to give sweeteners in food. They are essential for treating certain diseases and on this subject, I have received many letters from people suffering from diabetes and other illnesses, saying how pleased they were to be able to vary their diet thanks to an increasing number of products containing sweeteners. There is also a risk that they will be increasingly consumed by Europeans if we consider the many alarming reports of a constantly increasingly number of people suffering from obesity. However, this serious public health problem should not be solved by sweeteners but by preventing the disease. Moreover, some studies have shown that the power of sweeteners led to nutritional behaviour involving an increase in the consumption of sugar or sweet products.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware here that the multitude of increasingly sweet and increasingly varied products aimed at children is not an insignificant factor in this public health problem. In saying this, I am not moving away from the subject that we are dealing with this evening, because sweet products, whether or not they contain sweeteners, are interdependent. I know that the Commissioner is particularly aware of this public health problem. He can be assured that it is a priority for us.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I will say that we can consider sweeteners as useful, which is why, through this legislation, we are authorising two new products to be placed on the market. However, we now need to ensure that they are only essential to an increasingly restricted number of European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the European Parliament for its collaboration on this proposal. In particular, I would like to pay tribute to the rapporteur, Mrs Ferreira, for her work on this dossier.</p>
<p class="contents">There are four proposed amendments to the common position. The first amendment would delete comitology for deciding whether a substance should be considered as a sweetener. The Commission made this proposal as such a decision is of technical nature and can already be taken by comitology for all other food additives, in accordance with existing legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would have welcomed a formal tool to bring certain substances under the scope of the food additive legislation. This is in the interest of consumer protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has refused this, but your rapporteur pointed out that the Commission proposal should be re-considered when the framework legislation on food additives is considered for amendment. Furthermore, the committee has agreed to grant comitology to decide whether a sweetener is used according to Good Manufacturing Practice, as proposed by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In the spirit of compromise, the Commission can accept this amendment and will, as suggested by your rapporteur, retable its request in the context of the amendment of the framework legislation on food additives.</p>
<p class="contents">The second amendment requires the Commission to present a progress report on the re-evaluation of additives in general and, in particular, on the two newly authorised sweeteners. A similar amendment has already been accepted in the context of the amendment of another directive on food additives. Therefore, for the sake of consistency, the Commission can accept this amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">The third amendment concerns the transposition of the directive. It introduces a clause for the exhaustion of stocks of products no longer conforming to the directive. For this, a time limit of 24 months after entry into force of the directive, is set. The Commission can accept such a clause and welcomes the fact that it is limited in time. This limitation in time creates legal certainty and facilitates the enforcement of such a clause.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth and final amendment calls for the re-evaluation of the authorisation of two sweeteners – aspartame and stevioside. The Commission cannot accept this amendment for the following reasons. At the request of the Commission, aspartame has been re-evaluated by the Scientific Committee on Food in collaboration with the British and French Food Safety Authorities. To this end, the scientists have reviewed all the scientific literature published since the last opinion on aspartame, amounting to some 150 articles. The resulting opinion, adopted as recently as December of last year, fully reconfirmed the safety of aspartame and that the intake of this sweetener remains well below the acceptable daily intake.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards labelling, the presence of aspartame in a foodstuff must be labelled, as for any other additive. Furthermore, the labelling of a foodstuff containing aspartame must bear a particular warning to protect consumers that do not tolerate this sweetener due to a specific metabolic disorder. The Commission, therefore, does not consider it justifiable to proceed with a further re-evaluation of this sweetener or to alter its labelling rules.</p>
<p class="contents">That leaves Stevia and the sweetener extracted from this plant, stevioside, which has also been thoroughly examined by the Scientific Committee on Food. The committee has serious doubts about the safety of stevioside and does not consider it acceptable for use in food. The Commission, therefore, has never proposed this sweetener for authorisation. No new scientific data justifying a re-evaluation of stevioside have been presented to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3, but cannot accept Amendment No 4. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our examination of this document went exceptionally well. A balanced compromise has been struck with the Council and it is this compromise that will, if all goes well, be adopted tomorrow, for which many thanks.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make three comments with regard to the discussion of what is, in fact, a minor legislative proposal. These comments should also be observed in future. What irritates me is that we in this House are sometimes inclined to twist things that have been scientifically proven, in order to adapt them to political statements or political sentiments.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what Parliament does, and it annoys me. However – and I am also addressing this to the Commissioner, for I have also had a run-in about this with your officials – the Commission does not get off completely scot-free on this score either. They resembled political weather vanes to some extent. In my opinion, we should involve ourselves with matters that have been passed on to us by independent science, and not what we find politically agreeable.</p>
<p class="contents">So much for my first comment. The second may equally come across as a little abrasive and is addressed to the German and Austrian bakers and the Italian pastry cooks. Because of them, the discussion was very gruelling, because they thought that we would overlook their products. Last Thursday, I rang them up and asked them whether they had read the original Commission document. Had they read it, they would have seen that a separate category had already been inserted for energy-reduced products. They made our lives very difficult on that score. A lot of discussion eventually turned out not to be necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to make a comment with regard to Mr Lannoye’s Amendment No 4. In this amendment, a request is made, among others, for a report about the re-evaluation of the licence for aspartame. This strikes me as entirely superfluous, because everything on this subject is sufficiently dealt with in compromise Amendment No 2. Moreover, as the Commissioner mentioned again a moment ago, this sweetener was evaluated extensively in December. This therefore means that we should adhere to these results. I fail to understand why Parliament then comes trotting along with the safety issue of another sweetener, stevia – which the Commissioner also touched on a moment ago – of which scientific evidence proves the contrary of what is claimed in the amendment. On that score too, I urge you to be led by independent scientific research in future and be less swayed by the political issues of the day, because that way, I think we will arrive at the best legislation. My thanks, once again, to the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that shows that in this debate at least, sweeteners can be a '<span class="italic">douceur</span>' as well!</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has steered this debate impeccably through the difficulties that we often encounter with these comparatively small arguments. The problem very often is that they turn into the legislative equivalent of a Venus Flytrap. You hover around them and suddenly you are sucked in and find enormous difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the three amendments the Commission has accepted are the right ones. I think it is completely satisfactory for us that we have a period of review, that we have avoided the problems that we suspected in comitology and that, as Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has said, we have been able to support and not needlessly challenge the opinion of the scientific committees.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I think Mr Lannoye's amendment was an amendment too far in that direction. It is not our job always to say, after there has been scientific appraisal, that is not good enough, and there should be further appraisal immediately. If you do that you devalue the work of the scientific committees, introduce an atmosphere of suspicion and end up with an unsatisfactory proposal. So I am delighted that we have moved in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted also that we have reduced the level of cyclamates that can be used because of all our concerns about the exploitation of children and the way they now consume a variety of sweetened products.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I should say to the Commission in particular that if we could, in all circumstances, treat these small but important debates seriously but without the kind of hysteria that we sometimes get on either side, this Parliament would be a happier and a wiser place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It concerns a subject which it has to be said is technical and does not mean a great deal to citizens, but nevertheless it should be of great interest to consumers, in any case the increasing number who are fighting the battle against sugar and calories, but also against dental caries among children.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are talking about here is improving welfare by authorising tomorrow the sale of two new sweeteners throughout the Union: sucralose and salt of aspartame-acesulfame, which have at least three characteristics in common: they have no safety problems (it has been confirmed and reconfirmed that they are harmless, as has already been said), they are easier to apply (they dissolve more quickly and can better withstand higher temperatures) and also they have a far superior sweetening capacity than traditional sugar.</p>
<p class="contents">These substances can therefore be useful for day-to-day foods, in particular for diabetics and those suffering from obesity. With regard to cyclamate, a Danish study showed that excess consumption of it can be harmful for the weakest among us, pregnant women and children under the age of three. It is therefore a good thing that the maximum dose of cyclamate has been reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the three amendments adopted in Committee, although we have been forced to water down our position, we should welcome the compromise, which was reached between the three institutions and therefore means that we can avoid the conciliation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">As at first reading, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party will not, however, vote for Amendment No 4 tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance asking for a re-evaluation of the authorisation of aspartame. We trust the opinions given by the European Scientific Committee, which is an entirely independent body, and the opinions given on many occasions by many national authorities confirming that the sweetener is harmless.</p>
<p class="contents">As there are nevertheless some reports of problems following over consumption of aspartame, we wish to remain vigilant and our rapporteur has explained how we can do so.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased to note that the common position has established an obligation to label salt of aspartame-acesulfame, thus relieving the concerns that were expressed by some of us at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, as Mrs Ferreira said, I would like to say that there are some quite frustrating aspects to this debate. It certainly does not answer the vital, or rather I would say priority question of the merit of these false sugars. Are they really a good thing for everyone, are there really no dangers to health, and I am talking hear in the broader sense and in the long term, do they really help combat obesity or, on the contrary, do they maintain the taste for sugar, whether genuine or false? There are so many questions that are only partially dealt with, although I would like to state to conclude that the Liberal Group is entirely satisfied with the results obtained from the questions that were on the table. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission justifies change in terms of the state of the art in technology and science. I too am in favour of scientific progress, but not everything that appears to be an improvement is actually in the consumer’s best interests.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask myself what will be the end result when the food industry produces food by refining, to a high level, animal and vegetable raw materials and by the use of thousands of synthetic flavourings, and is able to take these processes almost to extremes. Our daily food intake is being taken over by pharmacists, chemists and genetic engineers. Whilst I cannot and will not put up with this situation, it is evident that someone is making money out of it, and it is for precisely that reason, and in the interests of public health, that it is an absolute necessity that food directives should rest on a scientific basis.</p>
<p class="contents">The assessment of risks is, however, being made ever more complex and problematic by increases in the depth of processing and in the diversity of the procedures and additives used, while, at the same time, legislation becomes out of date more quickly. Turning specifically to the subject of the recommendation adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, there are two comments I would like to make. I endorse Amendment No 1a to the effect that all sweeteners should be re-evaluated within as short a time as possible before the directive enters into force. My reasoning is that I believe that the warning by sceptical scientists associating aspartame with tumours cannot simply be dismissed, the all-clear sounded by the official scientific committee on food notwithstanding.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst I have every confidence in the choices scientists make, I do take the view that the specifics of threshold values have to be handled with care and on a methodologically justified basis.</p>
<p class="contents">I endorse Amendment No 3 because setting a definite deadline for the distribution of stocks of products that are no longer permitted can prevent these products from being got over the counter quickly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also support her proposals, for example when it comes to our not being able to accept the Commission’s deciding alone which substances constitute sweeteners. Nor can it be reasonable that a substance considered dangerous and not to be approved should be sold until stocks are exhausted. Health must come first in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance think that Amendment No 2 (Article 1a (new)) is far too general and that it focuses too much on the new sweeteners. In our Amendment No 4, we want the Commission to present a report regarding a re-evaluation of the authorisation granted in respect of the sweetener aspartame. There is comprehensive criticism from independent experts who question the fact that the Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) has given the green light to aspartame. According to the criticism, the Scientific Committee has ignored critical and independent investigations and perhaps let itself be influenced by the food industry or the aspartame manufacturers.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot disregard the fact that there is information that should prompt a reaction on our part if we want the precautionary principle to apply and protect people’s health. There is a recently written report from Spain showing that aspartame formaldehyde accumulates in cells, something that may destroy DNA and, for example, cause liver or brain damage, especially in the case of people vulnerable to such damage.</p>
<p class="contents">To use Mrs Oomen-Ruijten’s words: the political winds are blowing from both right and left in this House this evening. That cannot, however, prevent us, in the Greens/ALE Group, from requesting that the arguments be examined once more and the precautionary principle applied when the researchers disagree and come up with different positions. I therefore appeal to my fellow MEPs in actual fact to vote in favour of Amendment No 4 tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I certainly support her final tweaks of the text in the three amendments that she has put forward. However, I have to say to Mrs Schörling that I cannot accept Mr Lannoye's fourth amendment. It is unrealistic and it is one that he tried at first reading. When I criticised it at that point, his response was that 'it showed that knowledge can develop and that development sometimes leads us to question the authorisations that were given previously'. Well, many regulatory bodies across the world have evaluated aspartame and none have come forward with evidence that suggests that knowledge has developed in such a way as to doubt previous authorisations.</p>
<p class="contents">So, are we to keep on re-evaluating the evidence until we get the result that Mr Lannoye wants? Where are the wide criticisms of the SCF opinion? Have any Member State competent bodies contradicted it? Has the World Health Organisation contradicted it? Who are we to believe – a large number of national regulatory bodies, legally responsible and accountable for examining evidence objectively on the basis of science or, for example, the Internet campaign that we have seen only this week suggesting that the tragic ferry accident at Staten Island in New York was somehow due to aspartame?</p>
<p class="contents">Scaremongering of this sort can only undermine public confidence in the bodies set up to protect our food and our health. With such widespread consensus from regulatory bodies, it seems wasteful to divert the overstretched EFSA from meaningful work into an endless cycle of re-evaluation.</p>
<p class="contents">There are safety considerations with the use of aspartame. If you look at the UK Food Standard Agency guidance it says that there is a small group of people who cannot safely consume aspartame. They are the sufferers of the inherited disease PKU, who are unable to metabolise the amino acid phenylaline. Since aspartame was also a source of this, all food products containing aspartame are clearly labelled to that effect, as the Commissioner said.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the right way to tackle this issue. It is time that we restored some perspective to this and stopped undermining the work of our regulatory bodies. It is time to listen to the scientists and not the scaremongers. I commend Mrs Ferreira's report as it stands, with the Commissioner's proposals. I hope that is now acceptable to Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
