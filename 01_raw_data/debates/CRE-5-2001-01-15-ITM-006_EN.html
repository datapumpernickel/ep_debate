<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Doorn (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, red tape within Dutch industry amounts to near enough EUR 9 billion per annum. This was revealed in the Netherlands last week by Actal, the newly formed Committee of Experts on the verification of administrative burdens. The average entrepreneur spends approximately ten hours on completing administrative tasks and forms. The Netherlands, as far as this is concerned, is no exception. Research has shown that unnecessary bureaucratic procedures within companies account for 4 to 6 per cent of the GNP of EU Member States. This is a heavy burden, which hits small companies particularly hard.</p>
<p class="contents">I know of entrepreneurs who have quite consciously decided against further expansion of their businesses because they want to avoid having to take on staff at all costs. Many are deterred by the administrative red tape involved. In this way, the many obligations imposed by governments on entrepreneurs hinder the growth of production and employment. Some of the time, it is not even the legislation which is wrong or ineffective, but it is often the accumulation of obligations which makes the administrative pressures so heavy, and the European Parliament contributes to this in its own way.</p>
<p class="contents">This reminds me of a report we discussed last year which related to the working conditions on construction sites. One of the prohibitions in that report, thanks to an amendment in Parliament, pertains to holding a ladder while someone is standing on it. Quite apart from the absurdity of such provisions, one wonders who subsequently monitors compliance with this kind of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the key problems in our complex society is probably the fact that we produce far too many regulations in such abundance and of such complexity, that we ourselves are no longer able to monitor their compliance. The consequences can be disastrous, as a recent incident in the Netherlands proved once more.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the heavy administrative burden on citizens and businesses, combined with the government’s incapacity to ensure compliance with the tangled web of rules, are reason enough to tackle the simplification of legislation and improvement of its quality head-on. While I welcome the SLIM project, which the Commission launched in 1996 and which is under discussion this evening, as I stated in my report, it is too little too late. Compared to the legislative machinery as a whole, it is only a drop in the ocean. That is why I argue in favour of added momentum, as well as shorter implementation periods for the results of the SLIM working parties and, obviously, for the organisation and manpower required in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I attach yet more importance to simplifying legislation in its entirety. Particular attention will need to be paid to the way in which legislation is developed. After all, it is much easier to take simplifying measures in the early stages than to adapt existing legislation later on, at great cost, also for businesses. Every available effort must be made early on to lay down high-quality legislation and to restrict the administrative and financial consequences to a minimum.</p>
<p class="contents">The Netherlands has seen the recent introduction of Actal, which I mentioned a moment ago. Actal is an independent watchdog whose duty it is to examine draft legislative proposals and to expose any negative administrative burdens on behalf of citizens and businesses. An excellent initiative which, I hope, will be copied liberally in other Member States and at EU level.</p>
<p class="contents">I would make an urgent appeal to the European Commission to make a maximum effort to improve the quality of legislation and to restrict the administrative burden on citizens and businesses. If the current situation continues for much longer, the European Parliament, too, will need to consider the consequences of legislative proposals discussed here on citizens and businesses. If others fail to come up with the goods, we might have to follow in the footsteps of the American Congress and set up a service ourselves which maps out the administrative and financial consequences of legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At least for my party in Finland, the National Coalition, the streamlining of legislation and an end to the needless churning out of directives became one of the main objectives in the last European Parliament elections. I believe that much value is attached to this approach in many other quarters too.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission communication on the present state of the SLIM project is very gratifying, but by no means fully adequate, as yet. It is vitally important that the Commission is able to make the proposals for the project’s third and fourth phases into clear legislative proposals as soon and as effectively as possible. Furthermore, the six-month deadline proposed by the rapporteur should be taken seriously. I warmly support our rapporteur’s proposals that the users of the legislation – the customers of our decision makers – should be heard more than they have been when concrete proposals are being drafted. Only this sort of coregulation can fully serve to speed up the development of the European internal market, and, ultimately, guarantee that consumers actually do benefit from legislation projects and the adoption of the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">Proposals alone are obviously not enough: they must also be able to be processed swiftly both in Parliament and in the Council. We do have debates on speeding up the legislative process from time to time here in Parliament. We members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in particular await with interest the proposals by the Lamfalussy working party on new courses of action that are to be applied in the future, at least with regard to legislation on financial services. Although their interim report was still not very detailed, it nevertheless gives us to understand that the working party is pondering a procedure in which only the broadest policy issues would be solved through a full-scale codecision procedure, while for other amendments to directives of a more technical nature the fast-track procedure would apply. In principle, I take a positive view of such proposals, although it is notoriously difficult for us parliamentarians to relinquish power. I believe that the relinquishment of power in certain respects will be inevitable to remove the final barriers to the internal market as soon as possible. My final position, and that of my group, will surely depend on what form the fast-track procedure will take. In no case should it be an imitation of the present comitology procedure, where there is a very great need for reform, especially in the area of transparency. Our rapporteur also referred to this.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the general development of the legislative process, I also await with interest the Commission’s white paper on governance it is drafting for the Gothenburg Summit. Whatever the Commission proposes in its paper will determine how quickly new projects for legislation are dealt with, and, how effective the Union is as a whole for a long time ahead. Hopefully, the paper will contain good, concrete proposals, but I also hope that we can still put some effort into the SLIM project. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Titley (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, it is clear that improving the quality of legislation is essential to the effective functioning of the internal market and to increasing the competitivity of the European economy. So we all welcome the SLIM initiative, but we must all share the rapporteur's reservations about how it has worked so far. There are surprisingly few areas which have been subject to the SLIM process and it is not always clear why those particular areas have been selected. We need, without a doubt, a fast-track procedure to turn SLIM opinions into legislative proposals, because it all seems to take rather a long time.</p>
<p class="contents">So we welcome the proposal to set up a special group within the Advisory Committee and we welcome the rapporteur's suggestion that it should have more resources. Clearly we also need greater synergy between the different Commission initiatives for improving legislation. We sometimes think that the different parts are operating in isolation. And, of course, we need greater cooperation between Member States and to overview best practice and seek to repeat best practice elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">And finally, it is crucial to ensure maximum involvement of the users of this legislation, particularly businesses, because they know best how this legislation affects them.</p>
<p class="contents">However, having said that, you could quite conceivably produce wonderful, simple legislation, yet it could be completely destroyed by the way that Member States implement it and enforce it. We must understand that there are three stages of legislation – formulation, implementation, including transposition, and enforcement – and we have to see the process as a whole. We often find the greatest problem is not the original legislation but how it has been transposed by Member States and the speed at which they have transposed it, how they have implemented it and how they have enforced it. I am often quite surprised by how relatively simple ideas are turned into the most complex nightmares as we go through that process.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of this on-going determination by the Commission to simplify legislation, I would like to see much greater cooperation between Member States and the Commission about the whole life of legislation and, particularly, involvement with the people who have prime responsibility for enforcing the legislation, who are often local and regional actors. So we must consider the whole process when we draft the original legislation. In some ways, you could argue, we should start at the end and look at how we enforce it and then work backwards as a way of getting simpler legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">But the SLIM process ought to go much further. We need a rolling programme which will cover all legislation and look at simplifying, consolidating, re-casting, sometimes repealing legislation. Sometimes we may need to go for the status quo, but we need a more dynamic process than we have had so far. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All credit to Mr Doorn, who has managed to put his finger on the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be highlighted, rightly so, that EU citizens and businesses consider complex legislation and red tape to be evidence of a lack of efficiency within the institutions. The causes are obvious. As long as the Commission does not adopt a clear, centralised approach to SLIM, the SLIM initiative remains an exercise with no strings attached. It should be anything but that.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, two goals need to be brought into focus, in addition to the recommendations which are currently in the report. First of all, the SLIM initiative must be lent a binding character, particularly with EU enlargement on the horizon. Secondly, Member States must, as of now, set a good example by guaranteeing a correct, but above all, timely transposition of European directives into national legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">All too often, we have been under the impression that the process of simplification, which is so crucial, is much like a procession of Echternach. Pending the Union’s enlargement, we must shift up a gear if we want to develop the internal market in a professionally responsible manner. I am delighted that the Member State which I have the honour of representing here, has realised that special measures need to be taken, as is the case in the Netherlands, to simplify legislation in a consistent manner. Convinced of the need for simplified legislation, the Liberal Group will be lending the Doorn report its unqualified support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I congratulate the rapporteur on highlighting such a very important issue and also highlighting the failures of the Commission to get to grips with it thus far. I hope that the Commissioner will say what more is to be done to give added urgency to what is such a very important programme.</p>
<p class="contents">However, rather than criticise the Commission more than the rapporteur has already done, rather even than refer just to the four committees involved in this particular issue, I should like to highlight one issue the rapporteur also raised, which is that it is really entirely up to us, as Members of this House, to ensure that legislation is better in the first place. He wondered to what extent legislation should delve into details and gave an example involving people holding ladders. That particular subject came up in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. It must be said that this particular committee has contributed very significantly to the extra bureaucracy that we are now passing the buck to the Commission to try and reduce.</p>
<p class="contents">How much better it would be if that committee, and indeed all other committees, had left such legislation alone in its simpler and purer form in the first place.</p>
<p class="contents">My final suggestion is that for us the acronym SLIM – "Simpler Legislation for the Internal Market" – should represent "Substantially Less Interference by Members". </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ford (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his report and say that the proposals on the simplification of legislation in the internal market that were launched in 1996 are very welcome. An attempt was made there to improve the quality of legislation, to try to cut down on superfluous legislation and to limit the costs associated with implementing legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that we have finished the third and fourth phases, with teams of Member State officials and users identifying concrete suggestions to simplify legislation, it is right that we have a review. We need to have clearer definitions of what is going on. Improved selection at the moment seems to be fairly random and we need some clear guidelines for the operation of the management teams and, of course, the implementation of recommendations which, at the moment, are too little and too late. Many of the recommendations are not implemented at all and many have to wait considerable periods of time.</p>
<p class="contents">So we are in favour, but there are two things we want to add. Firstly, we have to ensure that political control remains with the Commission and Parliament. Recent press reports on the new approach to legislation dating from the 1980s and '90s – not so new now – which allowed the detail of legislation to be worked out by industry-led standardisation organisations, seem to indicate that this is not always the best way forward. The European Committee for Standardisation, for example, recently did work on the packaging of waste directive, which the press has described as "fundamentally flawed, undermines democratic accountability and fails to meet the demands of the directive or, for that matter, environmental protection". So we need to ensure that there is political control there, unless of course there are strong political or consumer pressures to ensure that industry makes progress.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we would also wish to go further in a different direction. SLIM seems to have become fundamentally about simplification, even though in the original proposals we talked about limiting costs. What we would like to see are proposals for dealing with economy of legislation as well as simplicity.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore welcome the proposals from Lisbon for better regulation, which will look at the costs of legislation; we welcome the informal meeting of ministers of public administration held in Strasbourg on 7 November; we welcome the establishment of the high-level group to look at recommendations on making legislation more cost-effective; but we are disappointed that the promised European Parliament representative on that high-level group has not been appointed by Parliament nor, as far as I understand, have we been approached to appoint such a representative. We welcome the fact that Commissioners Bolkestein and Liikanen are looking at various pilot projects in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission and Parliament will have to begin to act on their own rules in looking at the financial implications of legislative proposals in order for them to be taken into account. It can only devalue our work in the European Parliament if claims can be made, for example, that the end-of-vehicle-life directive will cost us £400m a year in terms of the cost to the producers and the consumers but will only deliver £100m a year of benefit to the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">While such claims can be made, obviously we in this Parliament will look rather ludicrous. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It underlines the need for stepping up our joint efforts in order to improve the quality of new and existing Community legislation – with good reason. I therefore welcome the support lent to the SLIM initiative, as well as the support shown by this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Our review of the SLIM initiative and this report have demonstrated where and how the initiative can be improved. Consequently, in tandem with the representatives of the Member States, we are, in this connection, looking forward to making and implementing important recommendations under the wing of a newly established internal market Advisory Committee. With the fifth and subsequent stages of the SLIM in mind, we are currently considering suggestions with regard to sectors which could be due an overhaul. Any suggestions in this connection from this Parliament are, of course, welcome. As soon as agreement has been reached on a shortlist of sectors which can be overhauled, we will contact representatives of the industrial and business world, consumer organisations and trade unions, all referred to as the so-called ‘consumers’, every step of the way. That should offer them the opportunity of contributing to the SLIM initiative, either directly or indirectly, and of being informed of the progress made. I am convinced that this approach will allow all those taking part in this overhaul exercise to focus on the key issues of simplification, and that the SLIM teams will be making relevant and practical recommendations. I am therefore looking forward to reporting on the progress made during the next couple of months.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Commission is required to submit proposals to the best of its ability within six months of receiving the recommendations of the SLIM team, provided that these are recommendations which it can subscribe to. We will make every effort to fulfil this commitment, and I am addressing Mr Bushill-Matthews in particular with this statement.</p>
<p class="contents">We are thrilled with Mr Doorn’s recommendations that Parliament and the Council will each assume their responsibilities, by carefully considering all proposals in this connection, so as to ensure that the SLIM initiative runs as smoothly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I share Mr Doorn’s view that an increasing number of legislative areas should be simplified. I am with him on that one. I, too, would like to see this happen. That is, of course, only possible within the confines imposed by other priority duties and within the budgetary scope available.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to underline this point. The Commission receives many requests. The Commission has many duties, but it does not always have the means available to fulfil these duties fast and efficiently. That is an important matter which also merits much attention in this Parliament. Nevertheless, I have no doubt that we can accelerate the simplification process, not least as a result of the work in which the Commission itself is involved.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to the appeal made at the European Council in Lisbon, to reach a coordinated policy so as to simplify the legislative climate, the Commission is currently subjecting its position on legislation in general to a thorough investigation in the widest sense of the word. It is examining areas where non-regulatory alternatives could be introduced. Moreover, it is pressing for the development of better ways of gauging the effect of newly proposed legislation on the business world and industry, so as to minimise possible extra expense and administrative red tape. An enquiry in this connection was also submitted this afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">The efforts which are now being made to draft better legislation coincide with preparations for the white paper on better management. I am mentioning this particularly for the benefit of Mrs Kauppi.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s work will be complemented by the results of the discussions held in a high-level working group on better legislation, which was convened by ministers of the Public Office following their meeting in Strasbourg in November last. It is this working group’s duty, and Mr Ford called for attention to be given to this, to examine the quality and simplification of both national and Community legislation. I am already looking forward to the report and the recommendations of this working group.</p>
<p class="contents">This legislative process for which we all carry some responsibility, concerns us all, of course. I am convinced that the current political consensus in aid of a better legislative climate within the European Union will lead to real and permanent improvements. I would also like to thank Mr Bushill-Matthews for the alternative meaning he gave to the acronym SLIM, namely ‘Substantially Less Interference by Members’. I am very grateful to him for that. I will try to quote this at the appropriate place and time, and those whom the cap fits can wear it.</p>
<p class="contents">On a final note, I would like to let Mr Doorn and your Parliament know that the amendments are acceptable to the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
