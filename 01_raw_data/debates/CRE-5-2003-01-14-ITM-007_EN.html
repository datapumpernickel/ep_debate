<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Andria (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in financial markets, where the liquidity of the market is closely related to the confidence operators have in the reliability of securities payment and settlement systems, the inefficient operation of the latter can represent a source of risk for the markets themselves. Reliable payment and settlement systems require a clear legal framework, rules and procedures to govern securities holding, transfers, lending and related payments, as well as the imposition of constraints on these securities. Clearing and settlement, essential components of all securities transactions, are therefore fundamental to the smooth functioning of integrated financial markets. In any case we should note that, despite the increased demand for foreign securities, not only does the EU’s infrastructure for clearing and settlement for cross-border transactions remain fragmented to a high degree, but there is also an excessive and certainly not controlled incidence of costs at cross-border level. In any case, in order to attain specific objectives, it is necessary to know what the operational situation in the sector is, in order to make the appropriate adjustments.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two main reference markets: the United States and Europe. The USA has opted for the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, which incorporates both clearing and settlement systems and is overseen by a single managerial body, whose proven efficiency has led to substantial cost reductions. The European model with as many as 20 CSDs is fragmentary, benefiting from the fact that competition is only limited to securing new areas of influence. There has never been a price war, as market liquidity is controlled by a single active player.</p>
<p class="contents">From an analysis of the existing framework and from the thorough research undertaken by the Giovannini Group, it is clear that there are a range of technical, legal and taxation barriers at the root of the high costs and inefficiency. Removal of the technical barriers has to be our prime objective and can be considered easily attainable. Standardising information technology languages and paper-based documentation does not, in fact, require a particular operational effort. There would certainly be greater difficulties in harmonising legal and taxation rules. We should aim to achieve the ambitious objective of creating a single securities code, which would constitute a real guarantee for operators; but it would certainly be difficult for Member States to reach agreement on this issue, for delicate and sensitive reasons linked to the differences between legislation governing property rights, company law and insolvency law. Therefore, the creation of this code must be considered a long-term objective. In the short term, an information statement should be drawn up which would provide market participants with a guide to the differences between the laws in the Member States. With regard to taxation barriers, the difficulties do not stem only from the differences between systems but also from strong resistance to change and harmonisation by some Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Starting with the need to reform the post-trading environment, with the aim of eliminating confusion between infrastructures and functions and destroying existing natural monopolistic positions, there must be an arrangement for core settlement services managed for legal purposes as a user-owned service governed by the rules of non-profit status. This option would guarantee market integrity, ease of access to the service by users and effective supervision with regard to operational risks. There could not be any distortions of competition, because this guarantee stems from the fact that the services user participates in managing the body. Innovation and technical progress could also be attained since the arrangement in paragraph 11 of the report specifies that non-profit status comes after allowing for necessary investment needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Separation of core services and value-added services is considered vital. The latter could, in any case, be performed by central depositaries but with separate structures, including from a logistical point of view, by means of shared or supervised companies. The clearing and settlement service encompasses guarantee, margining, clearing, settlement and regulation activities. A quick read through reveals that these are all public utility services. The added-value services offered by banks or structures separate from depositaries are securities lending, collateral management, cash management, corporate actions, income management<span class="italic"> </span>and taxation services: all purely commercial activities.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, it is also vital to have strong cooperation between the States in order to ensure adequate supervision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular I should like to thank the rapporteur for his important report. The Commission will assess Parliament's response to its communication very carefully and will take into account the views expressed in that report.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares the view expressed in the resolution that efficient clearing and settlement is vital for the proper and safe functioning of the European financial markets. In fact, as is often said with reason, clearing and settlement is the plumbing system of the securities markets, without which nothing works. The challenge that lies ahead for the Community institutions is to ensure – in cooperation with market participants, national regulatory authorities and national legislators – the elimination of all existing barriers to integration and lack of competition, which would make cross-border post-trade arrangements in the European Union inefficient. That is essential for our common goal to build an integrated EU capital market by 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission feels that we should encourage market-led approaches and solutions wherever possible. However, it is also true that major public policy concerns are at stake, such as the efficiency of the systems, costs, petition issues – namely open and non-discriminatory access and exclusivity agreements – interoperability of systems, and prudential and systemic safety. All these concerns need to be taken into account, and the rapporteur referred to a number of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that the initial consultation period has been completed, we at the Commission are in the process of digesting the responses to that consultation document and of defining our approach to clearing and settlement arrangements. The Commission now intends to issue a new communication which will set out clear policy orientations, something which, until now, we have not been able to do. That document will serve as a basis for a second round of consultation, possibly in the first half of this year. I look forward to having a further discussion with Parliament, hopefully with the same rapporteur, on that subject.</p>
<p class="contents">As in all future steps that we might want to take, we intend to proceed in close cooperation with the rapporteur, with Parliament and, in particular, with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Villiers (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, like Mr Bolkestein I would like to thank Mr Andria for his hard work on this most important of subjects. I agree with the Commissioner and the rapporteur that it is very important to remove technical and other barriers to cross-border clearing and settlement in Europe. The Commission and the European Union can play a constructive role in facilitating cross-border clearing and settlement as a vital part of creating a single market in financial services.</p>
<p class="contents">There are certain points upon which PPE-DE Group opinion is divided, in particular point 11. It is not necessary to separate so-called core and value-added services, contrary to the view of the rapporteur. It is vital to price these different services transparently, so that when people are purchasing they know exactly which service they are buying and which they are not. It is also necessary to ensure that suitable risk management schemes are in place so that if there is a problem with one service there is no contagion between the so-called core services and value-added services. A law which said that a financial institution could only create or provide a certain core service and was not allowed to diversify into others would be too big an intervention in the market. I myself and many in the group therefore support a small amendment to Mr Andria's report on that point.</p>
<p class="contents">I have reservations about the proposal that we should move to a directive at this point. We might well need to look at a directive in the future but it may be premature to decide now whether a directive is necessary. There may be many other ways in which the European Union and the European Commission can facilitate cross-border clearing and settlement, without necessarily having to resort to a hard law solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the only other point of substance where I have a slightly different view from Mr Andria is the suggestion that we should prescribe that clearing and settlement systems are based on a 'not for profit' principle. I appreciate that Mr Andria has moved on this and has compromised and added the facility for allowing the services to make proper investments, but we should not prescribe a non-profit status and compel the markets to adopt this model. There are great merits in opting for user-owned systems. These are very good ways to ensure that the clearing and settlement service provides an excellent service to its users, but I am not really sure that we should prescribe on that issue. We certainly should not write in at this stage the requirement that these services must be managed on a 'not for profit' basis. It is important to allow firms to innovate and to invest, and a certain amount of profit generation is necessary to allow that investment.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome much of Mr Andria's report, with those three minor reservations. In particular we should not prejudge the market at this stage. We should allow and encourage the market to produce its own solutions, to produce market-led solutions, although I can see that there are merits in encouraging user-owned systems, because looking around the European Union we can see a number of systems which are working well on a user-owned basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Guy-Quint (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Mr Andria for his work, on behalf of my group. This is a complex subject and Mr Andria used all the means available to him to reach a compromise. Our group is highly satisfied with his working methods and the results he has achieved. The report, as voted on in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, is very well-balanced. We would like to add two minor amendments designed to clarify the text rather than change the content.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall not repeat the importance of our work in establishing an integrated financial market at European level. Parliament has already examined some aspects of this market and imposed some of the extremely numerous common rules which will be necessary for it to function properly. A single, transparent framework for clearing and settlement is part of these essential rules. That is why, in parallel with our work on the directive on investment services, Parliament is asking the Commission for a draft directive on clearing and settlement.</p>
<p class="contents">In the absence of any form of regulation, the market players have organised themselves to create a system which, although it does function, is far from ideal. Furthermore, this system naturally tends towards the establishment of a private monopoly and distortions of competition due to confusion between the differing functions of infrastructures and banks. We cannot seriously accept this. We could, of course, as some Members are proposing, allow the market to organise itself. We could also shoulder our responsibilities as co-legislators and ask the Commission to lay down rules ensuring transparency and free competition. Everyone here knows that the markets cannot achieve a healthy balance unless they are organised transparently and safely. That is not currently the case, and that is what my group is asking for.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the rapporteur on three essential points. First, the removal of all barriers to the creation of a single market for clearing and settlement. These barriers, whether technical, fiscal or legal, obstruct the finalisation of individual cross-border transactions and must be removed. Secondly, free, transparent competition. We call for open, fair access to settlement infrastructures. We believe these settlement infrastructures should be considered as a service of general interest. That should not prejudice their private or public status, but allow them to be run as non-profit-making bodies and be accessible without discrimination to all users. Lastly, we must put an end to the current state of confusion between commercial and non-commercial functions. We cannot accept that some players, driven solely by the prospect of profit, expose the non-commercial functions to the risks inherent in banking. This seems particularly relevant at a time when the United States are stepping up measures to protect their market. That is why our group will support Mr Andria’s request for clear separation of roles. That way we will protect our markets and put an end to the dumping that is often concealed in the confusion.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission has asked us to speak on this matter. If we are to fulfil our role as colegislator, it is not enough to present the Commission with a recommendation that is devoid of any content. For this reason, our group will reject all the amendments that are nothing more than delaying tactics and will support the rapporteur in his clear, constructive positions. We have tabled two amendments, whose principal aim is to clarify the text voted in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and which do not take anything away from the text. We simply believe that the wording of the current paragraph 11 no longer corresponds to the state of market forces and would lead to excessive disruption if settlement services had to be the property of their users.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also taken the liberty of adding to the compromise adopted by all the groups on paragraph 12 our concern for transparency and the exercise of free competition. I do not think that should pose a problem to my fellow Members. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">From the start, in the action plan for the financial market, this matter of clearing and settlement did not receive the attention it deserved and we therefore now need to remedy this omission.</p>
<p class="contents">Post-market infrastructures do indeed play a fundamental part in the proper conclusion of transactions. You spoke of trust and security. Systemic risks are also inherent in this type of activity which therefore clearly fall within the scope of general interest. On the other hand, these activities have an increasing return. It is for these two reasons that, based on experience, a public interest regulation is vital. We know, however, that these regulations exist at national level, as well as at European level, and fragmented infrastructures and rules predominated until recently. That is why it is time to establish a legislative act in accordance with our objective of building the internal market. We can see, however, that in the absence of appropriate legislation, the current development is biased and dangerous, as bodies are being formed which carry out both clearing and settlement activities and competing banking activities, with no general interest framework and apparently at risk of distorting competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur is therefore quite right, for reasons of both content and experience, to choose a public service line, or, I should say, public utility line<span class="italic">,</span> the terms are not important – in the United States they talk about public utility, it amounts to the same thing. Hence the proposals to separate non-profit-making activities from fee systems based on costs.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I shall say that now is the time to legislate. I do not understand why we should consult again. We have clear positions from the rapporteur which Parliament should adopt without sugaring the pill in order to achieve a positive line. We believe that the Commission should now, for the sake of the credibility of all our work, prepare the draft directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Stability in the financial markets is continuously under fire, with all the repercussions that this has on consumer confidence in the economy. Stability in the financial markets can be aided by effective management based on clear regulation. Mr Andria’s report on promoting the efficient settlement of securities therefore requires our full attention.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the complexity of the way securities are organised, there is no simple solution. I would, however, like to emphasise that a solution must be transparent and controllable. That is in the interests of confidence in the financial markets. An inquiry into competition aspects as described in paragraph 15 can contribute to creating a transparent securities market.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we can look back on the way in which this Parliament worked to eliminate obstacles to cross-border payments last year. At that time too, all the organisations, rules and interests formed a complex whole. Yet it turned out to be possible to eliminate virtually insurmountable obstacles. It is therefore high time we made sure that where there is an internal securities market, the numerous settlement costs do not obstruct cross-border transactions in this market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kauppi (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FI) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, clearing and settlement are an essential element in all securities market transactions. The Commission communication on clearing and settlement in the European Union analyses the sources of inefficiency in cross-border clearing and settlement arrangements. This inefficiency is largely due to technical requirements, market practice and the fragmentation resulting from national differences and legal barriers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also very important that the supervisory authorities adhere to a common approach and harmonised rules. Firstly, the technical barriers should be broken down and there should be a move towards interoperability of systems. Understandably, it is often the situation obtaining in the big Member States that serves as a basis for drafting single market directives and this sometimes seems to lead to the ‘one size fits all’ principle being applied. The solution chosen in drafting an EU securities code would not necessarily represent Europe’s single financial markets but the application of a national solution on a European scale. This principle is very poorly suited to the stock markets, which will still be characterised by their own national features well into the future.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it this is partly the situation dealt with by Generoso Andria in the report we are discussing today. Items 11 and 12 explore the most desirable way of organising securities trading settlement services and the relationship between the central securities depositories and the custodian banks. The message in these points, put in just a few words, is that core functions in settlement should be properly determined, and the central securities depositories and the settlement institutions should practise these with a view to making a profit and under the supervision of users, whereas those offering services must be kept separate from the others. Unfortunately I cannot agree with Mr Andria’s proposed solution on these two points. There are considerably more differences between Member States in arrangements for securities trading clearing and settlement and custodian services than in securities trading on the stock exchange. For example, in Germany securities are still kept in a physical form in vaults, whereas in Finland all securities have been converted into electronic recorded items, or book-entry securities. Owing to national laws relating to limited companies, the status of the German shareholder differs essentially from that of the Finnish shareholder in company transactions, for example. There is also a fundamental difference in the structure of central securities depositories in continental Europe on the one hand and the Nordic countries on the other, in that information on the investor in the Nordic central securities depositories is entered directly into the system and also, except in Denmark, directly into the issuer’s register of shareholders. In the systems in continental Europe custody is nominee registered, and the investor has no direct contact with the issuer.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has furthermore become conscious of these differences and is approaching the matter of clearing and settlement cautiously and from a functional point of view, which is a very good thing. If a directive should be issued on this matter, the Commission’s approach, which takes account of these differences in the markets, should be adhered to. In my country, Finland, for example, Finnish issuers have, in their everyday activities, had a high opinion of value-added services based on registers of shareholders. The giant Nokia, for example, considers them to be very important. Items 11 and 12 in Mr Andria’s report correspond very much with the views of banks in certain countries in relation to clearing and settlement structures, and in that respect they reflect partially outdated thinking.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with my colleague, Astrid Lulling, I have drafted two amendments, which are aimed at preserving the efficacy of the national markets and would make possible the existence of all structural systems and alternatives. There is a saying in English: ‘If it ain't broken, don't fix it.’ The rapporteur, Mr Andria, is trying to repair a situation here that works fine. This being the case I would like to stress the importance of accepting these two amendments, and I also hope that my group will support them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This communication builds on the Giovannini report of November 2001, which identified many sources of inefficiency in cross-border clearing and settlement arrangements within the European Union. It is essential to manage the potentially high risks of clearing and settlement systems effectively, to ensure the stability of the financial system.</p>
<p class="contents">With the increased demand for foreign securities since the introduction of the euro, our infrastructure for clearing and settlement of cross-border transactions remains fragmented, resulting in much higher costs than with national transactions. In this report we are presented with proposals to remove the barriers and distortions in the European Union post-trading environment, to create a level playing field between institutions, a common regulatory view and the development of rights of access and choice.</p>
<p class="contents">Pan-European infrastructures are essential to an integrated financial market, with market participants, regulators and competition authorities all playing a role. We know the European Union has already accepted natural monopolies in certain service areas such as gas, electricity and air traffic control to ensure fair access to all users in the single market. Now the same principle must be applied to post-trading infrastructure. But – and I enter a very strong caveat here – it is very important for the effect of consolidation on competition and financial stability to safeguard prices in what will, de facto, be a less competitive arena. In concentrating the services in one or two main players we must be sure that we do not risk security in the event of institutional collapse. Proper safeguards will be needed.</p>
<p class="contents">The American model is obviously an attractive template. It is very efficient in its delivery of cost-effective clearing and settlement. But such radical departure from our present systems of up to 20 central security depositories and very different legal frameworks would probably make it very difficult to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">While a lot more work is needed prior to any legislative initiative from the Commission – and I welcome Commissioner Bolkestein's offer of a second round of consultation – the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has laid out its stall, proposing separate core settlement services as a user-owned or public service, governed by the rules of non-profit status. It wants a specific directive on clearing, on the one hand, and settlement on the other, laying down common rules on authorisations, supervision and a common framework amongst others.</p>
<p class="contents">An early step will no doubt be the revision of the investment services directive which provides for the possibility of choice of systems for post-trading activity. There is certainly a long and fraught road ahead, with different banking cultures and legal systems, but there can be no doubt about the bottom line: without provision for efficient cross-border clearing and settlement, the full benefit of an internal market for financial services cannot be realised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lulling (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, I cannot but wonder at the way in which several Members here present have been giving us the benefit of their views on this highly complex subject-matter without ever having taken part in the discussions on it, but I do want to say that, whether in agriculture or in politics, you must know that there is no point in putting the cart before the horse. I find it regrettable that our rapporteur has largely disregarded this self-evident truth. As regards clearing and settlement, we have reached the stage of consultation on the basis of a Commission communication, a stage at which it is premature to say the least to instruct the Commission, in precise terms, to submit a proposal for a directive, and to tell them what should be in it.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all in agreement with the Commission that it is right to make the cross-border clearing and settlement systems more efficient and to cut their costs. It does not inevitably follow, though, that we need a European legislative instrument in order to do this. What is first required is that the technical barriers within the EU be dismantled. It is at least premature to predict today what form this might take, having had a not very satisfactory discussion in committee, when we could have done with more time in order to dispel various evident misconceptions. We would, in my view, have done better to wait for the second Giovanni report, which is due to be with us in mid-February, rather than now attempting to commit this Parliament to a line that I regard – putting it bluntly – as nonsensical. In this area, though, nonsense is a public menace. My hair stands on end at the sight of the proposal that core settlement services should be handled by a service subject to the rules applicable to non-profit organisations. Such a proposal simply ignores the fact that a single legal system is capable of being applied only if laws on securities and taxation have already been standardised. I have been told by practitioners and specialists in these fields that there is at present no system capable of bringing together even only two jurisdictions, which means that such a system could not be made to work throughout the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also astonished at the sweeping proposal for a non-profit system of this sort, even though it is far from being proven that such a model would be preferable to a system run on a profit-making basis. There are enough examples to demonstrate the fact that the achievement of profit and reductions in cost are not mutually exclusive. Indeed, if I understand him right, the Commissioner has, in this House, declared himself to be in favour of a market-based approach. There are today many sectors in which a policy of moderate deregulation is being pursued and in which the market is being opened up. To do the very opposite in a sector like clearing and settlement, which is so important to the nascent internal market in financial services, and to attempt to establish a public monopoly, is quite simply absurd and demonstrates a lack of awareness of the world's realities. Healthy competition – which already exists – has always benefited the consumer. Contrary to what the rapporteur would have us believe, that is not fragmentation; that is competition.</p>
<p class="contents">As adopted in committee, the report also envisages the provision of core settlement services by one structure, and of ‘value added services’ by another, separate structure. This would result in the enforced breaking-up of a variety of enterprises and is contrary to the approach favoured not only by most market operators, but also by the European Central Bank. Any operator in the market should be able to provide all these services, and any future European legislation should focus on the service itself and not on the body providing it.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of these considerations, Mrs Kauppi and I have tabled amendments, and I hope that Members will support them. It is my especial hope – having heard the rapporteur's praises sung by the Socialist/Communist element in this House – that Mr Andria will take time to think things through again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Both in my personal capacity and as our group's co-ordinator, I repudiate any and every personal attack upon the rapporteur. It is a matter of political good form that opposing views are to be accepted as such and that one engages with them without simply dismissing them as nonsense.</p>
<p class="contents">The report presented by Mr Andria has been passed, by a clear majority, by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. It is not his report alone, but a report to plenary by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and Members who have failed to win their case in committee are entitled to use the tabling of amendments as a means of keeping discussion going and making differences of opinion clear. This is all the more the case – and, in my view, right and proper – when we are engaged in an intermediate consultation, that is to say in the midst of the opinion-forming process. Many interventions, as well as what has been said here today, show us that opinions have not yet taken their final form – it is not that the report is not good enough, but that the subject-matter is too important. The creation of an integrated financial market is not alone in still facing too many obstacles, hindrances and barriers, and the costs involved are still excessive. Historically speaking, we know that the settlement systems within the European Union have developed along different lines. This means that integration is something to be advocated if we really want an integrated financial market, but I would not venture to say today whether vertical or horizontal integration is to be preferred, in other words, whether the amalgamation of different settlement systems is in itself something to be favoured or repudiated, or, indeed, whether it is inimical to competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, we have excessive costs. Reference has been made to reports that make it clear that barriers are among the causes of this. A study carried out jointly by the German stock exchange and <span class="italic">Clearstream </span>has clearly shown that overall transaction costs resulting from barriers amount to some EUR 4.3 billion. We all want a level playing field. We all want improved access, and many of us believe that the structures of power mean that regulatory intervention is contrary to functional approaches to regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Criticism of the report has focussed on two aspects; one being the idea of a government body for ‘core’ settlement services, and hence of restricting the services of international central securities depositories to ‘core’ settlement services, and the other the idea of non-profit status, many being of the opinion that this would preclude competition. There is, moreover, the desire that all these services should be able to be performed by both banks and central securities depositories. Hence the amendments, and we hope that the debate has also demonstrated to the Commission the need for the various standpoints to be reconsidered. We await a proposal for a directive, which will make it possible to move this debate on to a more concrete phase. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
