<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pier Luigi Bersani (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (IT) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a very important and positive discussion on this report took place in committee, and for this I should like first of all to thank all my colleagues.</p>
<p class="contents">The reasons for suggesting the introduction of a common consolidated corporate tax base for businesses operating in various EU countries concern the removal of the obstacles hindering the completion of the internal market, and are inspired by the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two reasons in particular. The first relates to the need to simplify and reduce the management and administrative costs for businesses, which are today faced with 25 different tax bases. As a consequence of this measure, they will instead be able to pay their tax burden more easily, and will also receive encouragement to invest and to work in a European, and not exclusively national, dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason relates to transparency, because harmonisation of the tax bases will make any kind of opportunistic behaviour more difficult, insofar as a common tax base – while in no way interfering in the tax rates set by the various Member States – will at last make the various tax rates fully understandable and comparable.</p>
<p class="contents">These two reasons, which are fully acknowledged by experts and company representatives whose opinions we sought while drafting the report, have convinced a very large number of the committee’s members.</p>
<p class="contents">This is, however, a very difficult undertaking from both a political and a technical point of view. The political difficulties are due to the fact that a certain number of countries – albeit a smaller number than a few years ago – express difficulties with, and opposition to, tackling taxation matters, even though, in this instance, it is not a matter of tax rates. The main technical difficulties lie in identifying a common base of indicators with the aim of progressing to a common tax base.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already been working along these lines for some time and has set up the technical groups. With this report, we want to show our appreciation for the work done by the Commission, by giving it encouragement, by spurring it on and by providing a number of suggestions. The purpose and commitment of the committee’s members has been to encourage Parliament to voice its opinion loud and clear, something that I hope is possible, even though this will obviously entail some sacrifices and self-control from the political groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Fiscal matters are very problematic. It is no secret that the positions of the various groups and the various Member States are very far apart. That is why in committee we drew up some possible compromise ideas that might focus attention on the core aspect of the issue, that is to say the common consolidated corporate tax base, without entering into the broader area of tax competition or convergence, which remains open and which has not been addressed here. This approach has enabled us to draft a practical report and to provide a number of useful and specific suggestions.</p>
<p class="contents">The report calls for a regulation to be drafted and points out the subject-matter that should be included. It also provides for the possible use of enhanced cooperation in the event of a unanimous agreement not being reached, and suggests a gradual approach to the introduction of the – initially optional – common tax base, with a medium-term assessment to consider the practicality of making it compulsory at a later date.</p>
<p class="contents">The subject we are presenting therefore has clear boundaries, but it is nonetheless an important subject that I hope can involve a large majority of Parliament. For this reason, and even though I can also see a number of my own opinions in certain of the additional amendments tabled, I believe that it is crucial, both in this debate and in the vote in Parliament, to maintain the profile of the report – a balance achieved in committee – which I believe is invaluable to the success of this initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I read with great interest the report from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and I participated in an extremely interesting hearing which the committee held recently on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly pleased that the draft report is so supportive of the current Commission company taxation policy and I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Bersani, on this thorough piece of work. The draft report includes an excellent summary of the current situation as regards the taxation of companies in the internal market. Its conclusions are very similar to those of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The main objective of a common consolidated corporate tax base is to remove the remaining tax obstacles to the proper functioning of the internal market. These obstacles were catalogued by the Commission in its company tax report in 2001, and the Commission’s response was to promote the introduction in the longer term of a comprehensive solution: a common consolidated corporate tax base.</p>
<p class="contents">This project has recently been given additional support during the review of the Lisbon Strategy. To achieve the Lisbon goals – growth, jobs, competitiveness and investment – and to promote administrative simplification and cost reductions, we need appropriate tax policies. In my opinion, the common consolidated corporate tax base will go a long way in providing the EU with the tools it needs to progress.</p>
<p class="contents">In October the Commission adopted a communication that outlined the base on which taxation and customs policies could contribute to the Lisbon Strategy. One such measure is to present a Community legislative measure for the common consolidated corporate tax base by 2008. I know that it is an ambitious timetable, but I understand that you are proposing an even more ambitious one for 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that Mr Bersani’s report is so supportive of some of the more radical elements of the common consolidated corporate tax base, such as consolidation and the sharing of the consolidated tax base between individual Member States. I am equally pleased that the report supports the Commission’s position that the new tax base should be optional for companies and that the report avoids the trap of becoming involved in tax rates. Our current work is directed at the tax base and does not touch upon the tax rate.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, not all Member States are currently enthusiastic supporters of the common consolidated corporate tax base. Our aim, however, is to have a proposal for all 25 Member States, so your report will be an important additional tool for the Commission to use in future debate on the subject as we attempt to persuade the current dissenters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What has come into being really is a compromise, and that is something I want to emphasise, since there are of course other opinions represented in our group, and I can tell the Commissioner that resistance to this policy at European level comes not only from the Member States but also from among the ranks of our group, that of the European People’s Party.</p>
<p class="contents">There is resistance not only to the single tax base for businesses, but also to the idea of a single corporation tax in Europe, which keeps on resurfacing in this particular debate.</p>
<p class="contents">So where do I, speaking as the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, think there will be particular problems? I believe that if you start by talking about the tax base, it is virtually inevitable that you will end up next discussing the Member States’ tax rates, and that is something we will have nothing to do with. If we are to harmonise the tax base, we must be aware of the fact that we are, by so doing, obliged to make a deep incursion into the nation states’ tax-raising competences, and we want nothing to do with that either. If a tax base for European enterprises is to be created, it has to be borne in mind that businesses – DAX companies, for example – are even now operating in accordance with international accounting standards, and that is something that we have to accept. If, Commissioner, we are to make tax policy at the European level, we have to be aware of the fact that that is not far removed from competence in tax policy as described in the European Communities Treaty. That is something that needs to be borne in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the fact that the European Court of Justice is due, tomorrow, to hand down a judgment in the case of Marks &amp; Spencer, cannot do other than emphasise the obvious truth that the case law of the Court of Justice in Luxembourg is now extending ever wider the influence of Brussels. That is something else of which this debate should take account, and I want to stress that we would be mistaken to allow the European Union’s common system of law to become a community founded on laws made by judges – something that I, for one, would regard as unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is crucial to the launch of the Lisbon Strategy and the achievement of its growth and employment objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The application of twenty-five different taxes on companies creates obstacles to cross-border activities, reduces the efficiency of companies, over-burdening them with greater costs, and causes many fiscal problems for the Member States, as well as greater complexity in the fight against fraud and tax evasion, dealing with double taxation and relations between groups with a presence in different Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The diverse nature of the existing regulations prevents the economic coordination of the States in this field, encourages companies to seek to profit through fiscal optimisation practices, which may affect equal conditions in terms of competition amongst companies, and creates legal uncertainties, which is leading to increasing recourse to the legal system.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Bersani, on having dealt with all of these aspects in his report with balance and rigour, achieving a significant degree of consensus within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. The creation of a legal framework that establishes a common consolidated tax base for Community undertakings is an essential instrument for dealing with the problems raised. It will provide transparency with a view to carrying out homogenous comparisons between States and promoting their coordination in the field of tax in accordance with the approved integrated guidelines for relaunching the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The report is ambitious. Its aim is the first fiscal harmonisation in the field of direct taxation, calls upon the Commission to present a legislative proposal between now and 2007 and tries to put an end to the damaging lack of legislative progress in this field. Achieving a common tax base has great value in itself, quite apart from being essential to further progress.</p>
<p class="contents">For all of these reasons, we support the report fully and we believe Parliament’s broad support to be a very positive thing so that there can be no doubt about our will to make progress on this historic milestone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, such discussions are limited to the examination of individual taxes and not the assessment of the aggregate impact of each tax type upon the economy. The purpose of the profits tax is to promote supply, or, as it is often put, entrepreneurship. These characteristics vary from country to country and depend on a number of factors, such as traditions, education and historical experience. Thus, it is obvious that different degrees of effort are needed to promote entrepreneurship in different countries, and, therefore, different rates of tax on profits must be applied.</p>
<p class="contents">My group will not approve the amendments proposing, in one way or another, to achieve the equalisation of rates of tax on profits. Nevertheless, we support the proposals in the report of Mr Bersani to develop a common tax base calculation and enforcement procedure. We believe that the introduction of the common tax base will, first of all, allow greater exploitation of the single market advantages, and, secondly, will enable the talents of businessmen to be manifested not only in their countries, but also in the entire European Union. This will also contribute to the development of an entrepreneurial tradition and make it easier to meet the challenges of globalisation. What causes the concern then? There are two issues that are of concern and should probably be further considered in our legislative activities. First, ways to prevent unfair competition, where small enterprises use the wider tax base of their home countries, while larger enterprises operating in several countries will be able to opt for the most favourable tax base among those countries. Second, how to distribute tax revenues on profits between individual countries when an enterprise operates in several countries and uses a uniform profit tax calculation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The co-existence side by side within the EU, of 25 different tax systems, with marked differences not only in terms of the tax rates levied, but also of the manner in which profit is calculated, has, over the past ten years, led to one result above all others, in that the share of business tax in the funding of public budgets is on the way down, and a growing proportion of the tax burden is placed on the person who earns ordinary wages for working for someone else, or on the consumer, the latter of which is the worst possible solution in terms of its impact on society and on economic growth. It is in this way that big multinationals in particular are given every opportunity to minimise their tax burden. Transfer pricing and the shifting of losses are just two of their favourite ways of making sure that profits appear in the accounts at the precise place where the taxman is least inclined to stick his hand in.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite apart from this sort of fiscal dumping, the co-existence of tax systems has prompted a competitive approach to cutting tax rates. The average corporation tax rate, for example, fell by a total of 15 percentage points across the old EU from the end of the 1980s onwards. One demonstration of the fact that these cuts are not by any means nominal is to be found in a long-term study by the University of Mannheim, according to which the amount of tax effectively paid by the 50 biggest European conglomerates fell from 36% in 1988 to a mere 31% in 2000, which means that billions of euros in public revenue have been given away and wasted. Bizarrely enough, the European leader of the tax dumping pack – particularly where company taxes are concerned – is neither an Eastern European state nor Ireland, but the Federal Republic of Germany, supposedly a high-tax country, where a tax reform forced through by the former Schröder Government – which justified its action by reference to fiscal competition across Europe – brought corporation tax yield to an utter standstill. Only the harmonisation of taxes across Europe can put a stop to this lunacy, which sees companies making enormous profits while taking less and less of a part in funding the community as a whole and people on average and low incomes – and, via taxes on consumption, even pensioners and the unemployed – ending up having to make good the shortfall.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not, however, believe that it is enough to harmonise the tax base. What we need, as a matter of urgency, is a Europe-wide minimum tax rate for company profits of at least 40%, and on a broad tax base. Tax dumping is omnipresent, and this is the only way to stop it in its tracks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet the only certainty about the proposals to harmonise the base for company tax is that they create uncertainty.</p>
<p class="contents">If the negotiations follow the pattern of development of the European company statute, for instance, it will be decades before we have a settled position. Continuing changes in tax rates and tax rules and the prospect of future changes are bad for business. In this report, as in early Commission reports on this subject, it is accepted as a matter of faith that the single market must be pursued without question, with the elusive level playing field as the means to achieve it.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to harmonise the base for corporate tax, why insist that tax rates should not be harmonised too? It does not make sense. Like Mr Konrad, I suspect that uniform rates are on the future agenda, despite the denials. There is much to be gained from simplifying tax rules in the individual Member States, particularly the older ones, but this has to be a matter for those Member States. If the Member States see a need for cross-border cooperation on tax matters, this too should be their concern and not that of the Commission or the European Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">My recommendation is leave it alone. Then the countries that prosper and attract investment will be those with the lowest tax rates and those with the simplest and least bureaucratic methods of assessment and collection. If taxation is to be made more business friendly, this will be at the initiative of the individual Member States and driven by market forces. I fear that coercion by the European Union is the wrong way to achieve tax reform. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A common tax base would inexorably lead to common tax rates. By the stealth of this proposal, it is clear that Brussels aspires to replace the nation state as the deciding authority on company taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">National control of corporation tax has been a key weapon in the arsenal of many countries in fighting for international investment. Estonia, with its growth economy, well illustrates the point, as does the experience of the Republic of Ireland. Thus, harmonisation of tax would rob Member States of the right to adjust their tax regimes to suit their own needs and would bestow across Europe yet another stultifying one-size-fits-all suppression of national initiative. For economic growth, independence and freedom of action are essential with more, not less, national flexibility. For example, corporation tax in my area of Northern Ireland should be radically reduced as a means of stimulating investment, thereby moving us away from over-dependence on the public sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We cannot always draw a strict distinction between the tax base on the one hand and the tax rate on the other, as the tax base has undoubted effects on the classification of taxes and on the internal balances, and that is something that certainly has to be borne in mind when considering the Commission’s next steps. We do not want some sort of approximation of the various tax systems introduced through the back door, and I think the Commission has a vested interest in that not happening if it is to make headway with the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to say – and I am speaking on behalf of my group when I say this – that we are, without doubt, in favour of fiscal competition. You need only imagine what would happen if we were to lock the 25 European finance ministers in a room and let them out only when the white smoke had appeared and they had agreed on tax harmonisation; if we were to do that, we would be turning Europe into a high-tax region, and that is not what we want.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I sit down, there is just one other point I would like to make, and it is in the form of a question, namely: how do we arrive at a single tax base? The answer invariably given to that is that we should draw on the international accounting systems. I do not propose to address the question of whether these systems are good or bad or of how they are implemented, but it is, in any case, a process on which European policy-making has scarcely any influence. It is all the more extraordinary that politicians should recommend this system as a guide to how to bring in a single tax base. If this were to be done – and I warn this House, the Council, and the Commission against it – it would mean that policy-makers would have capitulated and surrendered essential competences in this area, and that cannot be the road down which we go. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It leads to more transparency, which benefits our economy and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">It has to be said, though, the Marks &amp; Spencer dossier, to which reference has already been made, will, whether we like it or not, very quickly lead to the debate turning to tax harmonisation. I would therefore like to draw Members’ attention to the amendments that I, together with some forty fellow Members, have tabled, not with a view to harmonising taxes, but in order to introduce a minimum company tax rate. This amendment allows for fiscal competition between the Member States, but one that is fair, not least to enterprises. It ensures that sufficient funds are raised to finance our social model and that sufficient funds are left for the government to finance such things as corporate infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, in this connection, like to quote the Hungarian Social Affairs Minister, Kinga Göncz, who takes the view that ever-lower taxes do not fit in the European social model and imperil the social protection funds. Despite the short-term benefits that they bring, it is possible that they will soon cause us to run out of the funds needed to guarantee prosperity and to implement the social model, and this is something we want to avoid.

<p class="contents">What we are talking about now is establishing common rules for defining the tax base. We are not talking about harmonising or approximating tax rates, which will remain in the hands of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Having clarified that, why am I in favour of consolidating the tax base and why do I approve and applaud the report by Mr Bersani? Firstly, because I believe in an internal market that works. And in order for an internal market to work, companies that operate throughout the market, multinational companies, cannot be subject to twenty-five different rules when it comes to defining what is taxable income and what is deductible spending.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, because I am in favour of the European citizen, and the European citizen who wishes to invest his or her savings in a company will be able to judge the assets of companies with more clarity if they are all defined according to the same rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, because I do not like tax fraud, and I believe that by consolidating the tax base we will be able to eliminate transfer pricing and the location of company operations in those countries that are most permissive in terms of not taking account of an item of spending or being able to deduct an operation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, because if we say here that we advocate fiscal competition amongst the Member States, competition will be cleaner, more transparent and, if I may say so, more brutal, if the different States apply different rates — the rates they want to apply — to homogenous realities. Because that will be the only way to calculate it</p>

I am aware of how much progress we have made since this matter has been up for discussion and I know that you are considering enhanced cooperation procedures. Let us hope that we will not be forced to go down that route. But we think that your approach to this subject and your desire to make real progress are very positive signs.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment would be that taxation can influence the internal market, and all those here who spend their whole time telling us to make the internal market work better should concern themselves with the fact that excessive tax competition can have a fundamental impact, particularly in terms of cross-border effects, on the operation of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">In a way, this report presents us with a paradox: I hope that we can reach agreement on the Bersani report, but it nevertheless conceals some differences of opinion. Whether you support tax competition or harmonisation of tax rates, we all need this harmonisation of the tax bases.</p>
<p class="contents">So, let us take this first step together, in the knowledge that - as we saw during the expert hearings - there is still much to be done regarding tax rates and that thinking in terms of a range does not completely rule out any competition.

This proposal has nothing to do with harmonising tax rates. I want there to be competition between Member States in terms of rates of tax. However, I believe that a common base for corporate tax will be in the interests of competition between Member States and to the benefit of enterprises in the European single market. Only with a common tax base will it be possible to compare the relative fiscal advantage of locating or investing in a particular Member State rather than another. It will put pressure on Member States to provide an attractive tax environment for our businesses and to be efficient and careful in their public spending and budgeting.</p>

That is not the case. It is growing investment, new jobs and high and increasing tax income that creates social protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The European country that has some of the highest corporation tax rates of all, Germany, receives less tax income in relation to the national economy than, for example, Slovakia, which has a low rate of corporation tax but a flat tax rate. It is not the countries with the low tax rates – which obtain new investment and new jobs – that threaten social protection. I believe that, in a Europe in which we have 20 million unemployed, there is reason to be self-critical about the way in which our policy has operated.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact of the matter is that a tax system that is clear, transparent and predictable creates good basic conditions for investment and new jobs. We see this in countries that have the highest growth rates in the European economy. Having a common tax base and a common method for calculating tax does not mean harmonising taxes. On the contrary, it is good that each country be able to choose the level of corporation tax that best suits that country’s basic conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is good that we should have competition. Transparency is also very much to be desired, so that we see which countries in reality have the high tax rates and which the low ones. It is not the case that some of the new Member States are dumping their tax, as the former German Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, said they were. On the contrary, it is those countries that have lots of loopholes and variable and unpredictable tax systems that make things difficult for small enterprises and that prevent new investment. I therefore support this report and congratulate Mr Bersani on a good piece of work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to join Mr García-Margallo y Marfil in saying that I am pleased that it is Commissioner Kovács who will be handling this dossier, rather than his fellow-Commissioner Mr McCreevy, who paid us a recent visit.</p>
<p class="contents">Direct taxes, as we have noticed in this debate, are a subject that stirs up huge emotions and controversy, and it has always been very difficult for this House to reach common positions in that area, not least in the previous part-session. Even so, I have a feeling that we will succeed this time and I hope that Commissioner Kovács, will also succeed in reaching agreement with the Council or at any rate with a large number of Member States. I am pleased that common sense will prevail over ideological sabre rattling.</p>
<p class="contents">Common sense also obliges me to consider the modest role that the European Union plays in this. I want to dissociate myself completely from the comment that was made earlier, among others of the kind, about Brussels taking power away from the Member States. I think it is quite simply necessary in this area to guarantee an internal market and a level playing field and to ensure that these are not disrupted, along with the simplicity and certainty that will allow enterprises to operate in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not without reason that the call for this common consolidated foundation originates from the entrepreneurial <span class="italic">milieu</span>; it comes, without exception, from companies, including UNICE and the Round Table. This has nothing to do with seizing power at European level. It is simply about accommodating the wishes of industry.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is important to consider what the win-win situation can be. If everyone is clear what foundations we are working from, then enterprises will have a smaller administrative burden and governments will not need to compete for rates indiscriminately. Many of the new countries enjoy low tax rates, while also basing them very broadly. I therefore think that the solution to this process of harmonising the tax base lies in bringing rates much closer together than they are at present, and we need that kind of transparency. The discussion as to what will happen subsequently, also about possible minimum rates or forks or whatever, will not be held until later. For now, it is crucial to make this first step, and I can tell Commissioner Kovács that he can count on our support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gay Mitchell (PPE-DE). –</span></span>   Mr President, first of all let me say that it seems there is no more a case for harmonising corporate tax rates or bases than there is for harmonising property taxes, wealth taxes or capital gains tax. Firstly, a common consolidated tax base cuts across national sovereignty and subsidiarity. Secondly, the Commission maintains that it is not trying to harmonise tax rates, but how is it possible to separate the issue of tax base from the issue of tax rate? Would the harmonisation of the base not lead to a harmonisation of the rate?</p>
<p class="contents">Some colleagues may have confused harmonisation of the tax base with the harmonisation of company accounts and requirements for transparency between companies and their accounts. This is erroneous. Accounts can, of course, be harmonised, but harmonised accounts can then be adjusted for tax purposes in Member States and that is an issue for Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the European Commission’s proposal for corporate tax harmonisation is based on the assumption that harmful tax competition results in a shift in taxation away from taxes on mobile capital and towards taxes on comparatively immobile labour and that this development is harmful for employment and ordinary EU citizens. This assumption is open to question in my view. Whilst there has been a downward trend in corporate tax rates in some Member States, this has been accompanied by both a widening of corporate tax bases and an improvement in the underlying company profitability. In my own country, for example, the lower tax rate has meant a multiplication of the tax take. We went up from EUR 385 million in 1996 to a EUR 5 707 million take in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let us not forget that the Lisbon Agenda is about making the EU the most competitive economy in the world by 2015. Paving the way for minimum tax rates or corporate tax plans will not prevent companies from looking outside the EU for more competitive rates. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Tax competition has a considerable effect on the state of the European economy, and this is currently reflected most noticeably in the low economic growth recorded by some of the older and larger Member States, as against the more rapid growth of the majority of new Member States that are implementing vigorous structural reforms, including tax reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">The lack of political will for implementing structural reforms is often brushed over by accusing new Member States of tax dumping and then claiming a need to address any imbalance by harmonising direct taxes. This debate on corporate tax base harmonisation is a consequence of such efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">The argument that tax base harmonisation will have no impact on tax rates and therefore no direct impact on tax competition is not entirely correct. The tax base and tax rate are to some extent interrelated, depending on the breadth of the harmonised tax base and the scope of exclusions and deductibles. For instance, taking the present German model as the basis, Slovakia would be forced under current circumstances to increase its tax rate in order to maintain current tax inflows.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I understand the argument that tax base harmonisation should lead to greater transparency among the individual systems in the European Union, providing for simpler comparison between individual countries. A reduction in transaction costs for businesses and in the number of court disputes would also constitute considerable advantages.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I believe that the European Commission should consider carefully all of these arguments in respect of the tax base harmonisation proposal in order to maintain an appropriate degree of tax competition between Member States as a necessary prerequisite for increasing the overall competitiveness of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As I said earlier, I am pleased that the draft report is so supportive of Commission policy on the common consolidated corporate tax base.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to comment on the proposed amendments. Mr Konrad’s proposals do not pose any problem for the Commission, so we support them. However, the Commission does not support the amendments that deal with a possible minimum tax rate and the common consolidated corporate tax base as an instrument for bringing tax rates more closely together. The Commission has no intention of limiting fair competition and harmonising the tax base. It just wants to increase the transparency of the tax burden. Tax rates should remain within the competence of the Member States. If we were to favour a minimum rate, I suspect we would lose valuable support from both Member States and business, which will, after all, be the major beneficiaries of a common consolidated corporate tax base. As they benefit, so will consumers through the general economic benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate the amendment concerning research and development and acknowledge that this is an important subject. Nevertheless, it is not an amendment that the Commission would welcome, as the fiscal treatment of research and development is just one of the issues that we will be discussing as part of our work. I believe it would be wrong to highlight it in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">I will say no more at this stage. I welcome the European Parliament’s interest in the subject and I look forward to learning the outcome of the vote on the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
