<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Christa Prets (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, if one makes a comparison with the statistics and requirements relating to the trading of animals, then the trafficking of human beings, and of women in particular, is a taboo subject. Human beings appear to be less valuable than animals, and every year sees an enormous increase in the number of women and children who are trafficked; in the absence of solid statistics and figures, estimates range between 800 000 and 3-4 million women and children every year. Figures of that order really should shake us out of our somnolence and bring us face to face with the need for action.</p>
<p class="contents">Organised crime is on the rise, and trafficking rings are becoming ever more flexible in the methods and routes they use. Demand is on the up; the market is booming. Trafficking in women is a crime and a modern form of slavery. It demands more rigorous investigation and prosecution of the criminals concerned, care and support for their victims, and preventive action too. Both within the EU and internationally, what is needed is a holistic, integrated and inter-disciplinary approach. It needs to be holistic, because, in combating the trafficking in human beings, light needs to be shed on the triangular relationship between the victim, the client and the dealer. Nor, under any circumstances, must the people-smugglers, the pimps, the middlemen and all the places where the business is done, not to mention those who profit from them, be overlooked.</p>
<p class="contents">The primary objective must be to address the most blatant aspects of the problem, such as the increasing impact of poverty on women, high unemployment and wealth differentials, and to reduce the considerable potential for violence. It is for this reason that this report makes concrete demands, among other things for action to prevent and counteract people-trafficking to be implemented across the EU as part of its Neighbourhood Policy, its development policy, its foreign policy and of many other potential horizontal policy areas. The EU’s aid policy, too, must focus more on the reduction of poverty and hence have an indirect impact on the people trade, but there is also a need for the aid policies of the World Bank and of other big institutions to be analysed and examined with a view to finding out whether the money really does reach the people who need it, and whether it might not be doing the opposite of what it is intended to do. We know, after all, that international development policy does not reduce poverty, but can even contribute to the further marginalisation of groups at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">One great deficiency is the absence of a database, so what is needed is a unitary data collection system, and the Commission needs to work together with other international organisations to develop one. The only way we will get the same results from inquiries is to tackle them in the same way.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a need for information campaigns in the countries of origin and of transit, along with an annual ‘Anti-trafficking Day’ with a logo making visible the enormity of the problems involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union needs – by which I mean that the Member States need – to take action, action in the form of information campaigns aimed in particular at the victims, but also in the existing structures, such as the establishments where police officers, social workers and the judiciary are trained and in similar places, along with more cooperation with NGOs and the executive. For this, the prosecuting authorities will need staff and funding allocated to them, and information offices on the trade in women will need to be set up.</p>
<p class="contents">National and international telephone helplines need to be set up and publicised on national and local television. There need to be reviews not only of current visa practices but also of the many things that happen through diplomatic networks. It is as a particular matter of urgency that we urge that victims be given the right to remain not only for the duration of a trial, but also after it is over. The fact is that a victim’s testimony can help considerably to identify criminals, and we know that many victims are unwilling to testify out of fear, not only of public shame, but also of deportation. Something of a rethink is called for here. Anonymous statements by victims and clients also need to be accepted if the perpetrators of these crimes are to be hunted down.</p>
<p class="contents">Campaigns will need to be started to make those who provide the demand for these services aware of the catastrophic consequences of this trade, and I would also like to see anonymous hotlines for clients as well, in order to get more evidence from them. I am not, however, in favour of the clients being criminalised across the board, and I have, in this report, endeavoured to avoid focusing on national legislation on prostitution and thereby sacrificing a global problem to national differences.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention that the International Committee for the Rights of Sex Workers recently demanded social security rights and legalisation across the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Another specific demand has to do with the trafficking in children: it appears that, in some cases, corrupt customs officials retain children’s identity cards. Belgian identity cards for children are not numbered; they are retained and used for child-trafficking. I would suggest that a numbering system for them be introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">As you can see, there is much for us to do in contending with the trafficking in human beings, and we have to be aware that these tragedies are being played out on our doorsteps. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many of you are aware that I regard fighting the traffic in human beings as one of those personal priorities which, I believe, must achieve not only visibility but also tangible and significant results during my mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">Last October, as you know, I put forward a Commission communication devoted to this subject, precisely along the lines suggested by the rapporteur, Mrs Prets. It takes an integrated approach geared towards finalising a European action plan for firmly and decisively combating the traffic in human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">In December, following that communication, the Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers agreed with the proposal put forward and adopted an action plan. This plan specifically refers to best practice and to common standards and procedures to combat and prevent trafficking in human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">With today’s report, which I particularly endorse and value, Parliament is adopting a vital – and certainly necessary – political role of its own, paying particular attention to women and children. These are the groups which, in my view, are most vulnerable to this real kind of slavery, which Europe has a duty to fight. I shall even say it has a moral duty, and not just an institutional and legal one, to stamp out this kind of slavery. This moral duty, as the report suggests, requires us to take an integrated approach based on the principle of having absolute respect for the dignity of every child, every woman and every man: every human being in general. This is not a legal or bureaucratic basis, but one of our fundamental principles grounded in the rules of the Treaties and of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, and also, if I may say so, in the rules of morality.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the European Union is already implementing policies in this area, they need to be strengthened. What I mean is, for instance, a policy designed to strengthen the principle of gender equality in order to prevent the marginalisation of women’s roles in the job market and their relegation to lower-paid jobs. Such a policy will certainly foster an improvement in cultural standards, which will be needed to root out the demand. That is another important point: demand is unfortunately a key part of exploitation. If there were no demand, if there were fewer customers, or if the number of users prepared to collaborate with the exploiters were cut drastically, the scale of the problem would undoubtedly be less horrific.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand why the rapporteur chose not to focus on the topic of prostitution in the report we are examining. Personally, however – and I stress that this is my personal view – I feel that we must also address the issue of introducing tough measures to deter the clients, who are well aware that the girls they use are exploited and victims of trafficking. No one can fail to notice their tragic circumstances. This is an extremely sensitive subject, which we cannot examine in any depth today but which will have to be debated.</p>
<p class="contents">The current degree of harmonisation is limited. The Member States have different legislations and, although there is a framework decision precisely on trafficking in human beings, child exploitation, the vile subject of paedophilia and child pornography, harmonisation at a practical level still appears limited. I agree with the rapporteur that little has been done for the victims of human trafficking, who should not be helped only when they decide to collaborate with the police. They also need help to rejoin society! A child who has suffered the horrors of pornography and paedophilia should not be helped only when she cooperates with the police and reveals the names of her exploiters, but requires constant, life-long assistance, because the consequences of the harm she has suffered will probably mark her forever.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also attempted to base the approach to European legislation on the major guidelines drawn up by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. I am pleased to see that the Council also shares this approach and is thus in favour of extending all forms of child protection to young people under 18 years of age. We must not define the concept of ‘child’ too restrictively: those who are not yet 18 must also be able to benefit from the protection rules recognised by the United Nations and Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with another aspect of the report, where it emphasises the links between the strictly criminal matter of human trafficking and illegal immigration. I also endorse the topic of social protection and the need for a European Union foreign policy that aims at introducing a clear reference – as we are doing in all our international relations – to human trafficking as one of the Union’s priority areas. In short, those who negotiate with the Union and intend to develop close international relations with us must be aware that the European Union cannot even remotely tolerate the enormous traffic in and exploitation of women and children, and of human beings in general.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to do all that, we need a database. I agree with you on that, and we are in fact working to set one up, including on a technical level. I am cooperating closely with Europol on enhancing their database, so as to be able eventually to set up a proper European statistical system providing reliable data. All too often, in fact, we do not know the real scale of the problem, and that is not acceptable. Europe will get a database and a reliable statistical system. At the same time, I intend not only to accept Parliament’s invitation but also to propose a great many practical initiatives which, on the basis of the action plan approved in December, will transform our desire to thoroughly stamp out the traffic in human beings, particularly women and children, into concrete action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, for which I was draftsman, decided on the opinion I was to draft, there was not only a very large majority in favour of strongly condemning the odious trafficking of persons but also a desire to see human trafficking as an aspect of prostitution in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">What was important to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs was to set the target of halving the trade within ten years and to see considerable efforts made to ensure that we MEPs obtain a better basis for decision-making, better statistics and, of course, better cooperation between police, prosecutors and judges. We believe – and I emphasise ‘believe’ – that up to one half of the victims of human trafficking may be children and minors. It was therefore important for the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs to emphasise that a minimum, inviolable age limit of 18 years must be set. For me, it is also only natural that women and children who have been victims of human trafficking be given the right to stay or else help in returning to their own countries. I also hope that, in the future, there will be cooperation with the tourist industry. Administrative districts and municipalities that receive large groups of tourists must make it clear that they view the trafficking of women and children as unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">A concomitant of the decision about the tourist industry that we are to take here in Strasbourg are the rumours that thousands upon thousands of women are to be imported as prostitutes in advance of this summer’s football World Cup – a matter for protest on the part of the EU’s women Social Democrats. I am pleased to be able to say that, in Sweden, both our EU minister and the minister responsible for gender equality have condemned any such development, as has the chairman of the Swedish Football Association. I hope that all the speakers in this Chamber today are able to give their support to this protest against the trafficking of women. Sport, prostitution and the trafficking of women do not go together. In its ambition to draw attention to prostitution in the EU, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs wished to go further than the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality is doing. I intend to return to this issue on a later occasion, for example in connection with our debate on Mr Frattini’s communication. We cannot, as Mrs Prets believes, bring the trafficking of persons to an end by providing information about it. What is required is for courageous politicians, including EU politicians, to take responsibility for doing so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the very moment, in fact, when our societies are legitimately yearning to preserve the memory of what constituted slavery in centuries gone by, so that such crimes might never again take place, can we tolerate the continuation and development, throughout the world, of a new and modern form of slavery – sexual slavery – which is viewed by the traffickers as a run-of-the-mill commercial activity? The response – and a unanimous one at that - of Mrs Prets and the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality is ‘No’.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be recognised today that in spite of media interest which, I might add, is only a recent development, people still have a poor grasp of the devastating physical and psychological effects of trafficking. It must be recognised that, up to now, the texts we have adopted with a view to combating, at European level, the criminals who increasingly turn to this activity have more often than not gone unheeded.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome the fact that Mrs Prets is proposing a series of measures relating, at one and the same time, to prevention, awareness-raising and repression, which is the integrated approach Mr Frattini was talking about. For the first time, the ground has been prepared for a genuine common policy for combating this terrible modern-day scourge.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Prets’ report is timely in avoiding the debate on what constitutes, on the one hand, trafficking and, on the other, prostitution. Due to the profound differences between our various sets of legislation, this debate would be liable to come to an abrupt end and to leave us powerless. I appreciate this approach, which is at aimed at effectiveness, but I also appreciate the fact that the taboo problem of demand has not, for all that, been sidestepped because, in the triangle formed by the actors in this tragedy – the traffickers, prostitutes and clients – it would be impossible, without being hypocritical, not to mention the clients’ responsibility in this affair.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that the points raised are upheld. They underline our Parliament’s awareness of the problem and its desire to resolve every aspect of it, that is to say to banish sexual slavery from our society.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the solid consensus demonstrated in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality is repeated in our plenary, and I am convinced that the commissioners concerned, particularly Mr Frattini – who said as much to us - will hear our message and be very keen to make this fight a priority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have tabled many proposals as to how the battle against trafficking in women may be waged.</p>
<p class="contents">We are alongside you one hundred per cent, Commissioner Frattini, if you take decisive action against this modern scourge. We have to drain this swamp and take action, and, with the action plan and with the help and cooperation of other bodies such as the Council of Europe, the OSCE, and the United Nations, we will be able to do just that.</p>
<p class="contents">There are plenty of proposals in the report that we can take up, and they need to be implemented now. Funding needs to be made available; Europol must be equipped with powers to act; a police task force needs to be set up: all these things can help. During the December part-session, half of the Members in this House supported the establishment of helplines for children. We want the Daphne programme to carry on being an effective instrument, but as something separate from the prevention of drug use. That is another issue, and every bit as important, but it needs to be dealt with separately.</p>
<p class="contents">Where this is concerned, Commissioner, you have our backing. None of these things can be delayed for any longer. This was an issue that concerned both your predecessor, Mr Vitorino, and Mrs Gradin; thank heavens there are rather more people interested in it now.</p>
<p class="contents">We also, however, have the World Cup football to look forward to, and that will prove to be another test. Germany is expecting no fewer than 40 000 additional prostitutes, supposedly to meet the needs of the men who will be going to watch the games, and the fact that these women will not be working of their own free will means that something needs to be done. We will continue to consider this issue in the Women’s Committee and will not stand idly by.</p>
<p class="contents">What should go forth from today’s debate is a clear message to the organisations that we support women in their campaign and will not shrink back from raising the issue of demand for prostitutes in specific terms. Let us address this problem together and, not least by collecting the relevant data, as also with concrete policy measures, at last make this grey area the subject of headlines and make the public aware of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report sharply underlines our shortcomings with regard to combating the trade in, and trafficking of, women, adolescents and children.</p>
<p class="contents">The laws in Europe on paedophilia, sex tourism and organised prostitution are in fact so diverse that we really need to show courage and determination in order to reach a consensus. We need to act quickly if we are to stop the growth in these sordid – indeed Mafia-like – markets and to combat the traffickers and their accomplices, who rely both on the prostitutes’ distress and on the clients’ sexual deprivation. I am not offended by the fact that prostitution exists, and I do not deny that it satisfies a great deal of its consumers, but I do, however, take a firm stance against this attack on a person’s integrity. I do not want to support a form of pseudo-morality that punishes the sins of the flesh but, at the same time, I do not want to accept a lax form of tolerance that disregards the Charter of Fundamental Rights, particularly in relation to a person’s integrity, freedom and dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not, of course, imagine that we are going to eradicate prostitution, but we must make a clear distinction between tolerance and legitimation. I am in favour of criminalising demand. It is our duty to reflect together on the implementation of in-depth laws to stop the growth in these markets and to thwart those who seek out, encourage and try to put in place these kinds of activities. It is, in any case, crucial to arrive at a zero tolerance approach where cases of paedophilia and sexual exploitation are concerned, but we must also succeed in using information campaigns to raise clients’ awareness and to give them a sense of responsibility. In actual fact, even if the client’s role in all of this is a pitiful one, I am convinced that it should not be swept under the carpet.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware that it will be a long and difficult fight, but I do not want to be a party to a ‘least worst’ policy by supporting a lax form of tolerance that mainly benefits the organised prostitution rings, which garner huge financial profits and which also facilitate money laundering operations. I will conclude by saying that I am opposed to people being encouraged in any way to cast blame and to inform on others anonymously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Within this framework, there must clearly be preventive measures to support the development and ‘empowerment’ of women in countries of origin, in order to prevent them from falling into the hands of people who take advantage of their vulnerability, and exemplary punishments for those who profit from people trafficking.</p>

In sport, there is a constant emphasis on fairness and consideration for others, but if, on the occasion of the football world cup, the football supporters are offered brothels like the ones in Berlin, that is when I shall waste no time in spoiling the game.

The report makes reference to a number of these latter, including poverty, unemployment, social exclusion, lack of education, corruption and violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Our priority, however, should be to change people’s way of thinking, and to move away from liberal policies that legalise various forms of corruption, addiction and prostitution in the name of the much-vaunted principles of the free market. A hedonistic and utilitarian approach to individuals lies at the root of such problems. We must move instead towards a civilisation of life promoting ethical values that ensure individuals are treated with due dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">Another cause of social malaise is the crisis faced by the family, which is failing in its role as a morally healthy environment. Children who are left to their own devices in problem families imitate the models they see promoted in the media.</p>
<p class="contents">They learn to adopt a consumer lifestyle in which the only goal or motivation to act is economic gain. Such a lifestyle is driven by a desire for success and rivalry between women and men, who compete with each other for power and influence instead of working together. This gives rise to frustration and various social ills.</p>
<p class="contents">Violence and the sexual exploitation of women and children are caused by the sexualisation that is becoming ever more prevalent, both in the media and elsewhere. Together with what is known as ‘sex education’, it arouses urges before the attainment of mental and physical maturity, which is a prerequisite for control of one’s own actions. This produces people who operate according to primitive instincts and reasoning alone, and who lack empathy and the capacity for spiritual growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Trafficking in persons, in particular women and children, is one of the worst forms of crime organised by international criminal groups. These groups mainly target people in lower-income categories on the pretext of employment as waitresses, barmaids, charwomen or au pairs. Most of the women who are ensnared in this way come from regions with adverse economic and social conditions, and high unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">Since trafficking in women is perpetrated internationally by well-organised supranational groups, combating this problem also requires coordination at the supranational level. It is commendable that international institutions such as the UN, the Council of Europe and the European Union, are addressing this modern form of slavery belonging to the 20th and 21st centuries. Their activities have led to the adoption of a number of conventions, the signatories to which have included Slovakia. In my view, however, it is also important to monitor the actual implementation of these conventions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It touches briefly on all aspects of the problem of the movement of and trafficking in women and children for sexual exploitation. Congratulations my honourable friend, and congratulations also to Commissioner Frattini on the sensitivity which he has shown and for the views which he expressed today on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The phenomenon of trafficking for sexual exploitation and trafficking in women and children is a serious disgrace to contemporary society. Unfortunately, instead of tending to disappear, it is increasing. Prostitution is the atrocious reason for trafficking in human beings, but prostitution and trafficking in human beings are two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a fact that there is social tolerance of prostitution in all the Member States of the European Union. That is not what I am discussing. However, there appears to be no tolerance of trafficking for sexual exploitation in woman and, more importantly, children in any Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, society is proving to be unable to stamp out this scourge. There is zero tolerance in words, but no results in practice. Who is to blame? It is the inadequacy of the measures being taken to stamp out this phenomenon that is to blame. As the foxes said to the hares, 'we would agree to be your allies, if we didn't know what sort of creatures you are and who you are fighting against'.</p>
<p class="contents">So an end to hypocrisy on the part of society, the state and individuals. This phenomenon demeans man and infringes the human rights of the victims involved in this venture and must be wiped out. There is no room for compromise or indifference.</p>
<p class="contents">Criminalising the knowing acceptance of sexual services from women acting under coercion, deception or conditions of social and economic constraint and, more importantly, from children, is the first practical step which needs to be taken and it will certainly have results.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament is being called on to approve the Prets report by an overwhelming majority because, apart from anything else, it adopts for the first time the position of making the acceptance of such sexual services incriminating. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, everything that is illegal in society is also illegal in the information society. The laws in force in each country also apply to the users and creators of the new information and communication technologies but, in practice, the very extra-territorial nature of those technologies and the fact that those laws are different in each country, make them extremely difficult to apply.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that an illegal information point for the trafficking of women and children, or for any other criminal activity, can be created very cheaply, the fact that it is accessible from any part of the world and that there is no reason why the information necessarily has to be consumed in the country from which it originates, enormously hinders the application of the laws.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the technology is available to use the very mechanisms offered by the new information and communication technologies to hinder access by those people investigating the crime to the information point likely to be engaged in illegal acts. This makes it even more difficult to investigate the crime and hence to apply the law.</p>
<p class="contents">If we really want Europe to be an area in which freedom and security are compatible values which enhance each other mutually, we must also deal with this problem decisively, thoroughly and in a joint fashion. This is a difficult problem that requires cooperation at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Understanding risks, rights and where to go for protection is essential to people’s protection. To this end, education is fundamental and in this regard the information and communication technologies offer some extremely positive opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">For all of these reasons, we would call upon the Commission, in coordination with the Member States, to tackle this aspect of the issue we are debating energetically and urgently. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Trafficking in human beings and prostitution are closely related, since trafficking in human beings supplies prostitution with new women and children.</p>
<p class="contents">Experiences with the legalisation of prostitution show that it only increases trafficking in human beings. It is therefore ridiculous to differentiate laws about trafficking in human beings from those pertaining to prostitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Trafficking in human beings is the fastest-growing type of organised crime. Buyers’ demands change, but what they want is unlimited access to women and children, and the market is flourishing. The globalisation of the economy also means the globalisation of prostitution, which is becoming an industry without borders.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress that if we think that we can combat trafficking in human beings separately from prostitution, we are burying our heads in the sand. It is time for some action across all areas of politics, because the sad numbers of victims show how the action taken up till now has been unable to control this situation.</p>

We cannot turn a blind eye to this worldwide scourge, which affects 600 000 to 800 000 people, of whom 80% are women and children, and the EU, where more than 100 000 people a year are victims, is also not immune.</p>
<p class="contents">There are clear links between trafficking of this nature and war, political instability in the countries of origin, the deepening of social and regional inequality, the feminisation of poverty and unemployment and violence against women and children, which means that fresh approaches and integrated policies are required. It is well known that trafficking for sexual exploitation is directly linked to prostitution, and it is therefore a matter of urgent priority that a range of integrated measures be adopted with the aim of protecting the dignity of women and children, and of taking action to combat the trafficking of human beings. Steps must also be taken to combat money laundering, and to shut down tax havens. Moreover, socio-economic policies that are aimed at enhancing solidarity, and are committed to economic and social cohesion, must also be adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I do not know of any national governments that have not already made these illegal. I cannot for the life of me see the point in reinventing the wheel when all this is already illegal across the European Union. What we need to do is get on with our business and start enforcing the laws that we already have.</p>

<p class="contents">As to the criminalisation of the client, which somebody suggested earlier, in the United Kingdom homosexuality was made legal in order to do away with what was then known as a ‘blackmailer’s charter’. If you start to criminalise the client in these matters, you will find that the law of unintended consequence comes into play, something at which I am afraid this Parliament is all too adept. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also true that, even if this practice is almost always judged to be condemnable and disparaging for the position of man compared with other living creatures, at no time and in no civilisation, including of course in our European civilisation, has it been addressed effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The Prets report, on the one hand, is yet another attempt to highlight the ineffectiveness of national and Community laws and actions. I congratulate the rapporteur on her methodical and realistic presentation and the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality on finalising a substantial text full of proposals and for developing effective actions not only at European but also at global level.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate you, Commissioner, on the integrated approach to your recent communication and on the Council's action plan. I am highlighting what is for me the high point of the report, even though I know the difficulties and the limitations imposed by the Treaties, the call for a clear legal basis to be adopted in order to combat all forms of violence against and trafficking in women and children and the full communitisation of a horizontal European policy for prevention and to protect the victims in the sectors of immigration, employment, commerce and banking transactions, transport, tourism and the new technologies which can be used to make trafficking and exploitation uncontrollable and prosecution unfeasible.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point which gives cause for hope is the call in the report for closer cooperation between the national authorities and Εuropol and Eurojust by improving international operational cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a pity that the states did not hasten without hesitation to ratify the international agreements and conventions. The Community institutions are being called on here to safeguard the coordination and cohesion of activities by international fora.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I would highlight the reference in the report to the need for action with less costly means but of fundamental importance for the future of the civilised world, by which I mean educational programmes which will be capable of teaching boys and girls self-respect and, consequently, respect for their fellow human beings, so that they do not become either perpetrators or victims. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Above all, I would like to emphasise that trafficking in human beings is international organised crime. It is the most rapidly developing type of crime at the present time, if we consider for instance the rapid spread of cybersex on the Internet. In order to combat this, we need well-organised international cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a clear legal basis. We need to take the struggle up to the level of a joint European Union policy, so that we can reduce the number of slaves by half within 10 years, as underlined by the report. The report highlights the need for the complete implementation of the existing structures. I concur with that 100%. Europol must make up for its idleness up till now, and ascertain the criminal networks, methods and persons involved.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the opportunities afforded by the European Neighbourhood Policy must be more effectively implemented. Based on the present incomplete information, the victims of contemporary slavery in Europe are mostly from Moldova and Ukraine. In order to prevent trafficking in human beings, those countries need know-how and financial assistance like that provided to candidate countries Bulgaria and Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">The victims of trafficking in human beings are made all the more vulnerable by the poor economic conditions of their families and home countries. As the leader of the Moldova delegation, I am well aware that every third woman in Moldova is unemployed. At the same time, sources argue that every other prostitute in Paris is from Moldova. It is clear that these facts are connected.</p>
<p class="contents">Women’s unemployment and the shortage of sources of subsistence make it possible for criminals to trap their victims with simple lies of well-paying jobs abroad. Therefore I share the rapporteur’s opinion that in political discussions with third countries, the Council and Commission must also very seriously raise the topic of trafficking in women and children.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I would like to draw attention to witness protection as a recognised method of combating organised crime. In combating trafficking in human beings, one should also permit victims who testify to start a new life in a new country if they so wish. Of the members of the European Union, only Belgium and Italy do this.</p>

The customers, or ‘clients’, are predominantly males who feel that they have a right to buy women, or rather, girls. Should we grant them this right without limits?</p>
<p class="contents">A recent comprehensive study commissioned by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality and conducted by the Italian-based Transcrime Institute, shows that this restrictive view on the demand side has a decisive impact on the number of victims of trafficking. I am pleased to say that Finland is about to adopt a law similar to the one in force in Sweden, criminalising the buyers of sex. The Prets report which we are now discussing is weak in that respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I know it will take some time before a majority of Member States have criminalised the buying of sex, but is it not time that we criminalise the buying of slaves and criminalise the men who buy the victims of trafficking?</p>

It is mainly women and children who are, by various false pretences, recruited into it, thereafter being exploited in slavish dependence.</p>
<p class="contents">In many cases, those who end up in prostitution are victims of human trafficking, and they are treated like <span class="italic">Untermenschen</span>. We must protect them from this, both in and outside of the Community, with all the means we have at our disposal both in the corrective and preventive spheres. This means that these modern slaves who are caught up in this vicious circle must be actively given the opportunity of breaking out of it and starting afresh. We must also prevent people from ending up in that <span class="italic">milieu </span>in the first place.</p>
<p class="contents">Prostitution is not a normal industry, in which work is carried out, and so it should not be treated as one. Clients of prostitutes do not buy services, but take advantage of other people’s bodies. That is a form of violence and should, in my view, be punishable in the same way as other forms of violence. Penalising prostitutes’ clients is the best way of preventing human trafficking.</p>

<p class="contents">Despite the difficulty in collecting statistics, the numbers are terrifyingly large, both in terms of the people being trafficked, especially women who fall victim to sexual exploitation, and in terms of the income from this activity.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a new issue, but it is worth asking how European societies and the civilised world in general tolerates and, more importantly, maintains these phenomena.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a great many reasons and responsibilities at all levels. First of all, society is responsible, given that sexual exploitation is not necessary; it is the result of the law of supply and demand.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the state is responsible, given that the Member States have not managed to control and combat these phenomena and their impact on the human victims. However, nor has the European Union been equal to the challenges and created a common area of justice and security. However, the European Union has certainly played a positive role in raising awareness, in cooperation and in addressing the phenomenon.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2002 framework decision and the 2004 directive contributed to a certain legislative harmonisation and to broader cooperation. We must continue in this direction. This crime is developing across borders. Judicial and police cooperation need to be stepped up, using the facilities of Europol and Eurojust.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to continue towards the integration and communitisation of our policies which increasingly need to accompany the single market and freedom of movement. I too would reiterate the importance of a common definition of the crime, so that we can collect statistics, the European arrest warrant, a clear legal basis, so that our policies and their Community and national budgets acquire European added value and effectiveness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is also the reason why I should like to thank Mrs Prets for her report, which contains so many specific recommendations. We are talking about many hundreds of thousands of women and children who end up in this criminal industry every year, the fastest growing criminal activity which generates lots of cash very easily. More effort is therefore desperately needed.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also search our own hearts, for there is no market without clients. Money must be made, and that is why clients are needed, so we must start close at home in order to raise awareness and public sensitivity, as well as the visibility of this distressing problem, and to discourage the exploitation of these women and children in our Member States. The Europe-wide anti-human trafficking day, for which this report argues, could serve as a useful instrument in this. I look forward to hearing what Commissioner Frattini has to say on this subject, and whether he intends to embrace the idea. At the same time though, we should not shy away from sacred cows in this report, namely the World Cup, for major events such as these have a habit of attracting criminals who want to make a fast buck at the expense of women and children.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also take far more decisive measures in tracing and prosecuting these criminals. Europe is too slow in introducing legislation that intends to combat human trafficking, and the criminal investigation services do not yet accord its combating the priority status it deserves. That is why I suggested that this legislation be included in the annual reports that we have requested. Europol too should start tracing criminals as a matter of priority. It is part of their mandate and they should now also act on it.</p>
<p class="contents">I could go on, but I think that this report has set the right tone for adopting a more proactive stance towards this problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is a problem about which no-one – and in particular the European Parliament – can remain impassive, especially when the information is extremely worrying for the Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The words 'trafficking in human beings', 'sexual exploitation' and 'forced prostitution', at both national and global level, encompass the risk of a pandemic similar to that which poverty and hunger have created, mainly in the developing countries, in the lower echelons of these societies.</p>
<p class="contents">Women and children are the victims. I agree that criminal gangs are operating all over the world. New electronic technologies give these gangs immunity, often with our tolerance. However, when vulgar tactics are applied, such as coercion, constraint, kidnapping and threats to unprotected communities, by which I mean women and underage children, then I consider it incomprehensible for us to remain impassive to and remote from the phenomenon of violence and infringement of our human dignity and fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all jointly responsible, given that the punishment of traffickers and their accomplices is and remains a theoretical act, not the demonstration of strength in practice that we should all engage in.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I should like to point out that major international events, such as the Olympic Games and the World Cup in Germany next summer, are used as cover for such incidents. The rapporteur is right to point this out, but the roots of evil run deep and in such cases the best cure is prevention, vigilance on the part of the countries which host such sporting events and, most importantly, public information for the citizens which constitute the shield of society, women and children.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask you, Mr Frattini, is the Commission doing anything in this direction? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Franco Frattini, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-president of the Commission. – (IT)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to all those who have spoken in this debate. There seems to be total agreement, and I believe that the value added by the European Union, as we address the problem together through a global approach, is clear to everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to focus on a few specific points that have been mentioned. The Commission will continue to encourage and promote specific projects aiming at the prevention of human trafficking and the protection of its victims, particularly women and children. I can confirm that I am willing to ensure that the projects that come under the Daphne initiative are kept separate from the anti-drugs strategy. I know that Parliament specifically wants that and, once you have drawn up a proposal to that effect, I shall be prepared to endorse it and to keep the instruments for preventing and combating the traffic in women and children (the Daphne programme) separate from the anti-drugs initiatives, as they are clearly distinct topics.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with the idea of a European helpline for victims, particularly children. I too am working on a project of this nature and I greatly value the proposal contained in the report. I am thinking of initiatives in the framework of the Union’s international policy to reduce or, rather, to root out sex tourism. This is not exactly traffic into Europe, but there are unfortunately thousands and thousands of citizens of European countries whose ideal holiday is to go to countries where they can have sex with little boys and girls.</p>
<p class="contents">Such sex tourism must be stamped out, and I believe that one way to do so is to involve the vast international network of travel agents. Travel agents know perfectly well, when they organise trips, what the aims of sex tourism are, and so we shall work with the governments of the countries involved and with the network of travel agents to pass on this powerful message at least.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards sporting events, this is undoubtedly an important matter. I intend to write a formal letter to the German Government to recommend that specific preventive measures be taken during the 2006 football World Cup to prevent the influx and concentration of persons who would, unfortunately, be destined to go into prostitution during that period. It will not be a difficult operation, since these are problems that are easy to spot, and the German Federal Government’s means and resources, including its investigative resources, will be in a position to help us. I shall act on your suggestion and send this request.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree on taking a tougher attitude towards customers. I am personally convinced – I have said this before and I repeat it now – that the clientèle needs to be deterred. There will be a debate on this topic and, although it seems there is some divergence of opinion on it, I believe we can all agree that there would be no trafficking in human beings, or at least much less, if it were not for the people who call for it. That is why careful consideration is needed, above all by the national governments, such as those of Sweden and Finland, which have adopted that strategy, and also by the European Union as a whole. Let me repeat my view: we need to be tougher on the customers.</p>
<p class="contents">The last subject on which I should like to focus is information exchange: more information must be given to the countries of origin, but also more information must be exchanged within European Union Member States. Like me, you probably know that a European criminal record does not yet exist for people convicted of paedophilia, for instance. It was possible for the Fourniret case to happen because nobody in another country knew where this person came from or what sort of person he was.</p>
<p class="contents">Today it is necessary to focus on paedophilia, for instance – as we are doing – by setting up a European information register: not a new structure, but a flow of real-time information accessible to all the Member States for certain types of conviction, starting with paedophilia itself, which in my view is one of the most hateful of crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">Precisely for that reason, when I spoke to the director of Europol, I could appreciate the organisation’s commitment to combating paedophilia, including through the use of information systems. I am saying this because Mrs Riera Madurell raised the subject. I can tell you that an initial investigation last year into a gang of paedophiles in 13 European countries, coordinated by Europol itself, led to the arrest of almost 100 people. That really is good news, even though few people know about it. I repeat: 13 countries, and coordinated by Europol. That shows that Europe can and must take action. Of course, you can always count on my staunch support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
