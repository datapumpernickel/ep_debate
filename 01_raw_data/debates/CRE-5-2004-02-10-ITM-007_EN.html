<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Graefe zu Baringdorf (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, I believe that this report, with the short debate on it that is shortly to follow, fits in well with what we have been discussing: not only avian influenza, but also Mr Garot’s report, which has shed light on the difficulties faced by European agriculture, whilst also stressing its significance by reason of the multifunctional role given to it and in view of the status of agriculture as a dominant factor in the overall ecological and social balance of agricultural landscapes. Consideration must be given to why it is that agriculture is in such a difficult position in this respect, even though the European Union is one of the areas importing the most agricultural produce and food. Why – for this is the theme of the report – does the Sixth Research Framework Programme allocate only 5% of its funds to agriculture? This does not do justice to the importance of agriculture, and it must also be noted that the research into agriculture announced in this Framework Programme is to a large extent aimed at rationalising production rather than at the sustainability issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Take the problem of genetically modified organisms, for example: although it must be admitted that a vast amount is spent on genetic engineering, little is being done as regards coexistence and the sustainable and long-term cultivation of crops that have been genetically modified alongside those that have not.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me return, though, to this morning’s consideration of avian influenza. We cannot fail to notice that, in the countries where it occurs, certain breeds adapted to industrial production are in conflict with the traditional and indigenous breeds. The former have developed an immune system that can deal with certain diseases, but now have to contend with genetic defects capable of affecting the immune system of the indigenous breeds. As a result, this is where the pandemics then strike, and the indigenous breeds are culled – that is, destroyed – so that these countries’ genetic resources, vital above all for their subsistence farming and food sources, suffer as well. The question must be asked – and this would be quite a research topic – why these industries go to these countries in the first place. Do they do it in order to sort out the problem with hunger that exists there, or do they do it because of better production conditions and opportunities to make a better return on the capital they invest? Look into the situation and you will discover that neither these industries nor their capital generally belong to these countries; instead, the capital originates here, here in the industrial nations, which want to do business there, and then we in this House lament – as does Mr Garot in his report – that our agriculture is producing less. It is no longer competitive, because these countries work to different social, environmental and hygienic standards. Comparative studies of that would be extraordinarily important.</p>
<p class="contents">I have mentioned subsistence farming, which is an important source of food not only in these countries, but also in the EU’s new Member States in Central and Eastern Europe. This is something else into which research should be done. In this report, we have attached the utmost importance to the question of the role played by women in the work done. Most women working in industrialised farming work in less-valued jobs, whereas, in other fields of agricultural activity, they tend to play leading roles on which the maintenance of these landscapes depends.</p>
<p class="contents">The point we are generally trying to make is that we expect more attention to be given to agriculture when preparing the next – that is, the Seventh – Research Framework Programme, and that the expected results of agricultural reforms in the European Union and of changes elsewhere in the world should be accompanied by research that will provide us with insights as to what the direction of our policies should be in the coming years and decades. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission welcomes this report, which we see as a good basis on which to prepare the Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development, and as something of which it can make use.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are aware, the decoupled payments under the new common agricultural policy will enable farmers not only to become more competitive, but also to respond better to the market’s requirements. This is where research can also make an essential contribution to improvement, by helping to develop more efficient production processes, by means of diversification and by introducing new and competitive crops. It can also help enable farmers to fulfil the demands of what we term cross-compliance, and, above all, to provide a sound scientific basis for our understanding of good agricultural and environmental practice, that is, of what is meant by a healthy condition.</p>
<p class="contents">What the regions want and need is set out in the rural development programmes, in which local stakeholders, civil society and the scientific community must also be involved. That was one of the conclusions reached at last year’s conference in Salzburg.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now briefly address some of the statements and recommendations made in the report. Although it is quite clear that the sustainability of agriculture must be one of the priorities of research policy, the content of the Sixth Framework Programme has already largely been laid down, and only minor changes can be made to the annual work programmes, so we have to devote a great deal of attention to preparations for the Seventh Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission gives priority to research into alternative production methods and sources of income in rural areas, as well as to the endeavour to get away from the piecemeal approach in favour of research into the whole chain – in a sense, from the farm to the table. Issues of the safety and quality of food continue to play a very special part in this. It is also important that the public be involved in debates about research, and that the results should be evaluated. These considerations prompted the organisation of the conference ‘Science at the service of society’ on<span class="bold"> </span>14 and 15 October 2002, and a second conference on this subject will be held in February 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Research into improved marker vaccines must be extended to include other diseases on list A, although budget limits must of course be adhered to. The same applies to research into medicines for minor species and into plant protection products for plants that are not widely cultivated. In both these areas there is the ever-worsening problem of dwindling interest on the part of private-sector researchers, it being apparent that profits will not be as high as they would be if large quantities of medicines or plant protection products were involved. This, I believe, is where the public sector has a contribution to make. I also share the view that social and environmental research into sustainable development in rural areas has to be stepped up, and that there is a particular need for research that is capable of supporting women in their roles in rural development – something that Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf mentioned earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the subsidiarity principle must not be lost sight of, I do share the view that ‘on-farm’ research needs to be encouraged, with the accent on suitable farming methods and diversification. Prioritised under the heading of ‘Scientific Support to Policies’, research is already being done into the utilisation of agricultural raw materials. As its predecessors did, the current Framework Programme funds projects in the field of environmentally-friendly cultivation and related to low-cost farming methods, although it must be remembered in this context that, particularly when we are in the middle of a WTO negotiating round, there is also a need to produce research material relevant to international issues and, in particular, also to issues relating to developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would not wish to conclude this speech without mentioning the fact that we must not simply ignore research into biotechnology, for it is another area in which we can expect results of potential use to us in the agricultural sphere, provided that sufficiently intensive research is carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, the Commission acknowledges the importance of Parliament’s report and also the need for a communication on the future direction, structure and promotion of agricultural research in Europe, which it will also produce.</p>

The Commissioner’s remarks confirm how important this initiative is. The sixth framework programme for research currently has a budget of around EUR 16 billion, of which a maximum of 2% may be allocated to agriculture and rural development. This very welcome own-initiative report calls for an increase in the funding allocated to agricultural research from the EU’s research budget.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made a clear decision in favour of the European model of agriculture, which means that we are committed to maintaining multifunctional and sustainable farming in all regions of Europe. Further development and research are inextricably linked. To conserve resources in response to socio-economic and environmental conditions, further research in the areas of organic farming, extensive agricultural management and, above all, non-food production is essential. Developing knowledge in the use of renewables for energy and materials must be pursued as a survival strategy. As the report points out, priority should be given to improvements in yield security, quality of life and environmental compatibility. On-farm research is an indispensable tool in the integration of nature conservation and agriculture, and above all in the sustainable maintenance and use of organic habitats in the agricultural landscape.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is intended to draw attention to the fact that agriculture research is also important for society and should be given greater priority. Again, I welcome this report on behalf of my group. At the vote in committee, greater priority was given to biotechnological research than was originally the case in the report, as we took the view at the outset that biotechnological research already has good programmes. A well-functioning rural environment is inseparably linked with a well-functioning system of agriculture. As a representative of farmers and rural regions, I welcome this report, and it is our genuine hope that these demands will finally be heard in the seventh framework programme for research. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must therefore change the approach we have taken so far to agricultural research.</p>
<p class="contents">This is precisely the challenge faced by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf in this European Parliament initiative report. He deals with it very sensibly in a report which I believe to be excellent. He essentially proposes that the Sixth and Seventh Framework Programme for Research should change in accordance with this new situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner has told us that the Sixth programme is being applied – and the report says this – but nevertheless I believe that we do have time for the Commissioner to introduce certain modifications relating to the role of women in rural development, as it appears he is going to do.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also very important that the drawing up of this Seventh Framework Programme for Research should reflect this approach, which considers research into sustainable agriculture and rural development.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 2 is fundamental, proposing that at least half of the budget for food technology and agricultural research be dedicated to sustainable and practical research into the various farming systems, and I would therefore be grateful if the Commission could also provide for this allocation of at least half of the budget for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">The report supports research intended to improve the quality and safety of foods from farm to table and stresses the importance of small-scale farming and of small- and medium-sized retailers. In this way a totally innovative potential is established, because we must remember that, until now, this small-scale agriculture had been completely forgotten.</p>
<p class="contents">Small- and medium-sized retailers had also been forgotten in the intensive agriculture of the past and the immediate future. All of this had been relegated within research and is quite rightly what the rapporteur now advocates as a profound change, an approach which reconsiders agricultural research from top to bottom, as is necessary, in other words, reorienting research towards the service of agriculture in harmony with nature.</p>
<p class="contents">For all of these reasons, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur once again and ask the Commissioner to change this approach as soon as possible and allocate the funds requested today by the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I too take the view that the right approach has been adopted by addressing future-oriented issues on the basis of an analysis which preceded this own-initiative report. I hope, of course, as previous speakers have already said, that the Commission will draw the right conclusions, for the CAP reform in particular has brought about a paradigm shift in European agriculture and I hope that scientific monitoring will be effective here in future too.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is right, and would like to reiterate here, that the budget for the next framework programme has been set on the basis of proposed projects. I am unsure how the 2% is arrived at, but I think it probably conceals projects as well. In the settlement of the current programme, it will be very interesting to see exactly what has happened.</p>
<p class="contents">Agricultural research is generally multiannual, and I have been told about projects undertaken within this multiannual research framework that have never entered their final phase due to budget cutbacks. The Member States are also very keen on cutting research funding. Yet any research that does not produce results is a waste of resources. In the previous debate, complex issues relating to more intensive research into income and income generation options were discussed in more detail. It will be very interesting to see how this will look in future, who will be dealing with it, and in which areas, under which conditions and with which assumptions. I too agree that the complex research areas of food and food safety must be addressed in particular. Everything else, however, has been set out so comprehensively in the report that it requires no further comment from me. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The decoupling of payments from production provides a new freedom to farm with, I hope, new opportunities. If we believe, as I do, that the European agricultural model must be multifunctional and sustainable, equally it must be commercially viable and competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis that the sector is likely to enjoy budget stability until 2013, we must use this time to initiate practical research as to how best to achieve this objective. It would be foolish and foolhardy to believe that the current level of budget support for agriculture will continue indefinitely. What would happen if this unthinkable scenario became reality? The only insurance is positive planning based on properly focused research. Two per cent of the current EU research budget for the entire agricultural sector does not facilitate the achievement of this objective.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I congratulate the rapporteur on his initiative in addressing this very timely and important question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
