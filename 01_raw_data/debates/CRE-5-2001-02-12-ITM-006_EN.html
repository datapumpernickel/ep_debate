<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Savary (PSE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I would like to thank you for allowing me to speak on the second reading of a report that is extremely important for the future of Europe’s railways and for building the European rail system. The last months, under the leadership of Mrs de Palacio, the Commissioner, will certainly have been crucial for the future of rail transport in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the conciliation on the Swoboda and Jarzembowsky reports, the opening up, or liberalisation, call it what you will, of networks is now an accepted fact. We still have to overcome the many instances of technical incompatibility and this is, of course, not the easiest thing to do, since these networks were built according to very distinctive technical and industrial characteristics in every individual country. The aim of the draft directive is precisely to ensure the technical and procedural interoperability of cross-border travel between the various 15 European networks.</p>
<p class="contents">The current situation is extremely complicated. There are about 15 signalling systems, five or six electrical voltage ratings, different loading gauges and different track gauges, different procedures, different railway cultures, and information systems that are not consistent from one rail company to another, thereby compromising efficient rail travel. Although opening up of the roads was easy, because discontinuities could be eliminated instantly, the opening up of the railway is still coming up against a whole raft of technical obstacles.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1996, an initial directive was adopted which was easier to implement because it concerned a new network of high-speed trains. This now shows us the way forward in terms of methodology. The method adopted was to lay down “technical specifications for interoperability” for each rail subsystem in conjunction with rail companies, infrastructure managers and manufacturers. Every subsystem is covered by a specification, which is then subdivided to cover the individual components which must also be verified as compatible. We are facing a truly enormous task and we have chosen to adopt a procedure inspired by the high-speed rail project, i.e. a gradual procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">This task will take so much time that it is important in the short term to make what progress we can, with the minimum cost-benefit ratio. The essence of the method involves selecting and evaluating the costs and the benefits of each step forward in terms of interoperability in order to assess its relative importance and either prioritise it or opt to implement it at a later date. Of course, the areas we really must push forward in the first instance are sharing information, procedures, data communications and all procedures involved in cross-border travel. We shall find out at a later stage, through a gradual convergence process, how to deal on a gradual basis with the problem of making tracks, gauges and rolling stock compatible.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that it is up to me to thank all the Members of Parliament who were involved in this report, as considerable work was undertaken at first reading. Parliament voted on a total of 46 amendments which had been tabled. Of these 46 amendments, 33 were accepted as they stood – and at this point I must pay tribute to the Council and the mediation by the Commission – and we can say that this vote will, or should, mark the successful completion of a broadly consensual legislative process. The Council and Commission have accepted many amendments and have enabled Parliament to make a significant shift of emphasis in order to consult rail users and staff, to involve the candidate countries in this work from the very outset and also allowed a certain leeway in terms of exemptions, given that some countries had justifiable concerns on this subject. The Council also made considerable contributions to ensure that the new rolling stock provided both safety and access for passengers with reduced mobility.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, I feel we have today a sufficiently sound text to be implemented fairly quickly, informed by our experience with the high-speed train project and benefiting from the excellent collaboration between the various parliamentary groups within the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism – and I would like to praise all my fellow committee members, from all the groups – as well as collaboration between the Commission, the Council and Parliament. Personally speaking, I am delighted that we have created such an ambitious document so quickly which today really gets the European rail system underway.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, there are two other crucial issues which will need to be addressed. The first relates to charging, which today remains the major issue in the turnaround from road to rail, and the second relates to funding of infrastructures, such as intermodal flat wagons, which is needed so that we can really make swift progress in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Tomorrow we will be voting on the Savary report at second reading on the interoperability of the trans-European conventional rail system. Approximation of technical standards is an essential and important step if we are to facilitate safe cross-border rail freight.</p>
<p class="contents">At first reading, all sides put a lot of hard work and effort into this very technical Commission proposal, and I would sincerely like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Savary, today. All that effort has paid off, as, with just a few exceptions, the Council has accepted all Parliament's amendments. The Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats is pleased to see its views largely reflected in the amendments accepted by the Council, which also explains why we are not tabling any further amendments now, at second reading. I did, in fact, table one amendment in committee that was adopted by Parliament at first reading but not subsequently accepted by the Council. It was three votes short of being adopted. This was the stipulation that maintenance and approval of warning systems should be carried out by external and independent certification bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from quite understandable economic interests in many Member States, this amendment has to be seen against the background of the many serious rail incidents which may have been caused by inadequate checks. These approvals and checks were in the past and to some extent continue to be carried out by the rail operators themselves, rather than by independent third parties. When this was discussed in committee all sides, including the Commission, showed great understanding on this point. The wording that has now been adopted for Article 18 and Annex VII to some extent takes account of our concerns, but we are not completely happy with this as things stand.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's undertaking to include proper independent approval and maintenance of rail systems in the railways package is sufficient for us to speed this otherwise excellent compromise on its way without tabling any further amendments in the plenary session. Nevertheless, when we examine future rail dossiers we will be watching very carefully to see if the Commission has honoured its promises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has done such a good job that we can adopt it without further ado and we have not even needed the excitement of the conciliation procedure, which I was so looking forward to. However, I am very pleased, as has already been said, that we were recently able to approve the railways package which Mr Jarzembowski and I put so much work into, and that we have achieved a well-rounded package to which Mrs de Palacio also made such an important contribution. This is not just a half-hearted compromise, but a really good package.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is this: can we rest on our laurels now? Have we done everything that needs to be done as regards railways? Mr Savary has already indicated that there are still some problems to resolve. The Commissioner has already announced that work is to be done in some areas on market opening in freight and passenger transport, and has already started the relevant work, and I regard this as being very important as regards working conditions and the regulation of working hours. The big problem is competition between road and rail. The work we have now done and will be voting on tomorrow means that we will be making rail transport more competitive. I would remind all those people who are always talking about competition that competition means, or ought to mean, that the initial opportunities, the competition conditions, should be reasonably equal, and that certainly cannot be said when it comes to road and rail.</p>
<p class="contents">During the Swedish Presidency we have been discussing sustainable development and giving greater priority to environmental matters, and in the specific context of a motion on the energy dependence of the European Union, we are have been talking about reducing that level of dependence. That ought to mean that when it comes to transport policy we should be taking greater account of the potential of railways. I am deliberately not talking about giving priority to rail, but it would already be a great step forward if we could create a level playing field between road and rail.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already touched on the issue of regulating working hours, and I will not go into the incredible cost-cutting tactics adopted – even on the roads – by means of artificial self-employed status in the road haulage industry, nor into the "Willi Betz syndrome" and associated regulations, which have also been mentioned several times, nor into issues relating to tariff classification, also including, of course, the issue of external costs.</p>
<p class="contents">However, all these issues are very important in the context of enlargement. When we consider how widely the situation of railways in the various candidate countries varies, and how poor and even appalling their infrastructure is in some cases, then we must do everything we can to solve these problems not just at EU level, but also at candidate country level. I say that because it is no use having the best, the most modern and integrated railway system in the western part of Europe if we cannot, at the same time, achieve better conditions on the railways in eastern and southern Europe, and this is an area where the European Union needs to make a major contribution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report, together with those reports aimed at liberalising the railways that were adopted last week, is a breakthrough in the development of the European railways. The idea got under way during the Finnish Presidential term, and was continued with successfully by France.</p>
<p class="contents">Improved competitiveness in the railways is vital to relieve road and air congestion. The development of rail transport is also a step towards more environmentally sustainable transport systems. Improved interoperability of the railway system is a necessary requirement for the whole rail package to succeed. There have been far too many long delays with regard to this matter, but now Mr Savary has managed to untie this difficult knot. There is still much to be done but now the work is off to a good start.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group supports Mr Savary’s proposal to adopt the Council common position as it stands. It has taken account of Parliament’s important amendments and thus the proposal should be swiftly advanced. At the same time we must remember that the interoperability of the rail networks is a long-term project. For that reason, it is important that a timetable is put in place to carry out the work and that we determine just which networks should be given priority.</p>
<p class="contents">I would further like to thank Mr Savary for also having understood the special needs of Finland. The compromise achieved regarding the use of Russian railway carriages and wagons between Finland and Russia will not put the aims of the report in jeopardy, but will ensure that transport on the Union’s eastern border will continue undisturbed. I believe that the importance this decision will have for the whole of the Union will be clearly evident when the time comes that north-western Russia’s massive wealth of natural resources starts to be exploited seriously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There was proper consultation. You requested proper consultation with the social partners, the railway sector, but you have also set an example yourselves by consulting everyone properly, with the consequence that we have a product with which we can do something.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are speaking about here is really a so-called railway package. Part one was the liberalisation, the deregulation of international transport which we spoke about last time. Part two is interoperability, in other words, that transport can take place between countries with different systems. Part three is still to come.</p>
<p class="contents">I already brought this matter up last time. As far as part three is concerned, we are of the opinion that the emissions standards and also the use of energy as regards the railway package need to be improved. We understand that this is not just the responsibility of this Commission and also that Commissioner Wallström is going to work hard at it in the near future. Everyone knows that the standards for trucks and lorries have been raised, in other words, the relative advantage for the railway is declining, and that also means that, assuming that this type of transport is better than others, you have to work at the emission standards.</p>
<p class="contents">I should just like to bring up a few other small points, small in a certain sense. What we are now going to see is that gigantic investments are necessary here. Gigantic investments – they have already been mentioned in recital nine – which are to be borne by both the government and the sector. The government, which means that at the same time we are dealing with another package, as has just been mentioned, of external costs. There will have to be a specific form of assistance to keep this sector at such a level that it is competitive on the one hand, but is supported on the other hand. That sounds like saying the same thing twice over but we should pay attention to it in our debates on the White paper.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing I ask myself is whether there has been societal consideration and whether the Commission has studied the qualifications of people in the railway sector who are particularly needed in order to facilitate this interoperability. I am unaware as to whether this study has been released yet and what it has produced and what it is going to mean for the future. A specified language must be spoken. Which language are we going to speak? English, as in international shipping or aviation? So, will English also be the language of rail transport? If that is the case, I immediately propose that from that moment onwards, we only speak English in Parliament as well. That will make all communication very easy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The trend emanated from a retiring government which is making itself redundant as a result of liberalisation and privatisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has made it clear that a modernisation policy need not conflict with the continued existence of state-owned or of justifiable exemption positions for areas which are separated from the rest of Europe by the sea. Much of what we resolved then has now been adopted by the Council. I congratulate the rapporteur on that outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike Mr Jarzembowski's proposals, my group endorses the result. I shall leave the technical details of the proposal to one side now and call attention to persistent problems. It is necessary to remain vigilant at all times for developments which continue to threaten the cohesion of the European rail network.</p>
<p class="contents">In the nineteenth century, different railway gauges and different types of rails prevented the railways from being able to operate as a European whole. In those days it was not just the individual countries but also the railway companies competing with each other that were to blame. Within the European Union, the Pyrenees still form a national border where the railway gauge has to be changed.</p>
<p class="contents">In the twentieth century, it was electrification and the associated safety systems which broke up the rail network once again. Where the steam locomotive could still travel over the border, as a consequence of a change in mains voltage henceforth the locomotive had to be changed. The threats of the twenty-first century reside in a combination of technical development and competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Until recently, it seemed that in Germany magnetic levitation technology would bring about divisions in the rail network once again. Only recently in the Netherlands such a line from Amsterdam-Lelystad-Groningen was still being considered, even now that it is no longer possible for it to continue via Bremen and Hamburg to Berlin. However interesting a number of aspects of the technology may be, in the short term it primarily means a system separated from the rest of the network. The interests of private companies which want to make their latest technology profitable should not be the deciding factor here.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of European integration, we still see continuing disintegration of the railways. International railway regulations are becoming increasingly hard to obtain. Train tickets to distant destinations often have to be purchased outside the country of departure. Not so very long ago, you could take a passenger train straight from Cologne to Athens, from Paris to Lisbon or from Amsterdam to Copenhagen. Not any longer. Four months ago the direct night train from Stockholm to Berlin disappeared.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from implementing technical measures, which is what this report is about, it is vital that an end is also put to the fragmentation of rail traffic. An end must also be put to the current situation in which the railways relegate passengers to aeroplanes and freight transport to lorries over long distances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Within the railway sector, the EU’s 15 Member States have 4 different electrical systems and 15 different signalling systems. Within 10 years, there may be 25 or 27 Member States. The differences between systems will presumably be still greater then.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a problem we shall solve just by finding ourselves new and, to all appearances, modern solutions. Given that, last summer, we inaugurated Europe’s longest combined bridge and tunnel in order to link Sweden and Denmark, it might well be imagined that the problem of non-interoperability had also been solved, but the reverse is true. There is one signalling system in Denmark and a quite different system in Sweden. Just to add to the complications, trains are driven on the left in Sweden but on the right in Denmark. There are various reasons why there are, in actual fact, such major differences between European countries, and these all have to do with history. One reason is that European countries have each electrified their railway systems at different times. Another is quite deliberate – never to make it easy just to go ahead and drive a train straight into another country.</p>
<p class="contents">In today’s Europe, in which we now talk about the four freedoms and in which people, goods, capital and services must be able to move with complete freedom across all borders, every obstacle remains a problem. However, we need to remove such obstacles of various kinds. We need to harmonise and to become, as the saying goes, interoperable in different areas. It is therefore an important step for the Commission now to take initiatives whereby, step by step, we obtain the same railway system. The trans-European railway systems, in particular, constitute an obvious first step.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important for this work to be characterised by two realisations. Firstly, the work will, in fact, have to take a certain amount of time, for it is going to cost significant sums of money, especially if we, in time, extend the trans-European networks to include other networks. It should also be pointed out that we need to combine with the Central and Eastern European countries to conduct the same operation there in the long term. The other realisation is that, in the short term at least, it is a question of finding solutions without having the same system in every country. The fact that trains can now already be driven across European borders does, in any case, show that this is possible, and it works partly because new technology can be built into locomotives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore wish to congratulate Mr Savary on his openness to dialogue, on his competence and on his demonstration of how crucial the action of the European Parliament is to improving standards as important as those with a social aspect, improving the position of rail users and eastwards enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a warning to anyone who wishes to reduce our Parliament’s ability to act for the sake of more rapid decision making. This directive, which supplements those that we adopted in the last Brussels mini-session will, I hope, enable Europe to move beyond good intentions and give rail transport a greater role than it currently enjoys.</p>
<p class="contents">For a country such as Portugal, located at the south-western edge of Europe, the interoperability of rail transport is crucial. Any country situated at the end or at the beginning of a railway line is always dependent on other countries if it is to enjoy a high level of cross-border traffic. Connecting ports to railway lines that are interoperational is a decisive step towards improving the service that is provided, towards reducing transport costs and towards making European rail companies profitable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is clear that competitiveness on the railways has to be improved, and this is particularly important in congested Central Europe. Europe needs a long-term railways policy, built on a common objective. Rail transport must be subjected to an honest appraisal that weighs benefits alongside costs. Then both industry and environmental organisations will be able to achieve consensus. That is a miracle which is still realisable.</p>
<p class="contents">Improved competitiveness on the railways must first and foremost come about by reducing the costs rail transport incurs and raising standards of service. At present, rail transport still, unfortunately, costs the taxpayer too much money, whether he or she takes trains or not. It is time the inefficient state dinosaurs were made extinct to make way for a new, efficient, service-minded transport business. The railway companies are still very much a relic of the past, and their standards of service are poor and inflexible when it comes to freight transport. As for passenger traffic, that is an entirely separate matter: the most important factor with regard to service in this area is keeping strictly to the timetable.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed directive being discussed is a rational one on the whole. The standardisation of technical features will result in improved competitiveness on the railways without there being any negative effects on the status of other forms of transport. Prioritising action by means of cost-benefit analyses will also be an important factor in determining how the most urgent measures should be implemented first, without wasting money. This directive, if anything, is an example of the sort of added value cooperation at EU level can offer.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection I would still like to remind people about something that is important for Finland. Finland shares a border with Russia that is more than one thousand kilometres long. Russian traffic accounts for a full 40% of freight services handled by the state railways. Because Russia has the same rail gauge as us, one that differs from that in the rest of the EU countries, there are also a lot of Russian carriages and wagons that run in Finland that are built in accordance with the <span class="italic">GOST </span>standards. Finland has been accused, sometimes with good reason and sometimes not, of Finlandisation. But the use of Russian carriages and wagons in rail services that ply between our two countries is due to the fact that when we send our own carriages and wagons across the border we are often looking at their tail lights for the last time. For practical reasons we must be able to use Russian carriages and wagons in the future. Mr Savary, the rapporteur, has done his best to take account of this, and I wish to thank him for it.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we have come on a long way since the days of ‘Stephenson’s Rocket’ in the area of rail transport. In spite of that, there is still a long way to go before we reach the terminus. As, ultimately, my words will hardly prove immortal, I will curtail my speaking time by forty-five seconds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to congratulate my colleague, Mr Savary, on his report and for succeeding in getting the directive on the interoperability of the trans-European conventional rail system through the various hoops of the parliamentary system. This was a matter of urgency, because interoperability is a fundamental prerequisite for liberalising international freight traffic, and this is something that we have together got on track, as it were, through the railways package.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem with conventional rail systems, as compared with high-speed trains, is that the various national systems in Europe are largely incompatible, yet they have involved enormous investment and can only be converted in stages through rebuilding and modification, and this needs to be done whilst still providing a rail service and in the face of continuing competition from other modes of transport. Nevertheless, the convergence process needs to be stepped up for the sake of the railways themselves. The directive, therefore, needs to be implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also to be welcomed if an internal market is to be created for the supply industry. I hope that rapid progress will be made with the bodies and procedures envisaged for establishing technical specifications and that they will initially concentrate on what can be achieved most quickly, that is to say on train control, safety and signalling equipment. The rapporteur and this House have secured the inclusion of social provisions as well as technical specifications in the directive, and also strategic consideration of the candidate countries when drafting the TSIs. That is positive.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards safety, I would, of course, have welcomed a more clear-cut vote in favour of independent third-party certification bodies, given that there is still a monopoly situation in some countries and that there are, therefore, conflicts of interest when it comes to certification or rather self-certification. It seems to me that referring to subsidiarity in this context is too simplistic. I am happy to support Mrs Jeggle in this area and I am now pinning my hopes on the railways safety package. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Specifically, the common position adopted by the Council on 10 November 2000 was received by the European Parliament at the end of November and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism was able to debate a first draft report on 4 December 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to express my satisfaction and gratitude to the rapporteur, Mr Savary, and to the whole committee, but especially Mr Savary. Thanks to his capacity for negotiation and for work on the whole of this issue, which is furthermore very complex, we have been able to make rapid progress. In the end, the whole of the railways package, which we approved in the course of 2000 and this year, the beginning of 2001, is decidedly French in nature, due to the important targets which have been adopted, no doubt with some Finnish touches, since the Finnish Presidency also played an important role.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this directive is an essential provision of a technical nature, which also has great political importance, because it is the key element for the implementation of what we indicated when we approved the railways package, that is, to open up the transport of international goods to competition. What we are doing through this latest interoperability measure is building a European railway. This goes much further than opening up a sector or modifying some specific technical requirements. This is a truly important moment in the short history of European integration. It is the construction of a European railway.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, we are also providing something very important for the European technology sector: the European railways industry, which includes some of the world’s most technologically advanced industries, is being given the possibility of operating within a massive internal market of great dimensions which will lead to a lowering of costs and greater profits, which will therefore optimise all production and greater competitiveness at international and world level, beyond our European borders.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the European Parliament has just reached an agreement with the Council in relation to the whole of this proposed package and the year 2008 has been set as the final date for the complete opening up of the railway goods network. Both Mr Swoboda and Mr Jarzembowski, who were rapporteurs for this package, played a decisive role. I believe that these measures will clearly not be effective unless, at the same time, we enable Mr Savary’s suggestions to be implemented, that is to say, that we go ahead with the removal of technical incompatibility. And that is exactly what this measure does.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that some of the major users and some operators who intend to use and benefit from the possibilities offered by this trans-European rail network have recently indicated to the services of the Commission a large number of technical or operative obstacles which hinder the organisation of international goods services. It is in this context that this directive acquires even more importance and the interoperability of the conventional trans-European rail system will enable us to overcome some of these obstacles which we are facing by trying still to reserve certain national markets.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I would like to congratulate you all once again on the achievement of having this directive approved on second reading. Its adoption will guarantee a European dimension, create a competitive market for interoperable rail products. It will lead to the development of significant economies of scale which will benefit companies and the removal of technical barriers caused by the excessive fragmentation of the sector, which are often the result of collusion between monopolistic operators and their national suppliers within a captive market.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will devote itself heart and soul to implementing this directive, never losing sight of the fact that its success depends on the ability of all the rail agents involved – managers of infrastructures, rail companies and related industries – to employ their experience creatively and find effective and economic technical solutions, preventing the overlapping of solutions, which is unfortunately taking place in some cases.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bouwman asked me some questions and I would like to reply to them. Specifically, before the adoption of the technical requirements on interoperability, consultations will be held to ascertain the opinions of the various users and parties involved, including infrastructure managers, operators, rail companies etc. and also the transport and user organisations and others. This is one of the issues that I wanted to highlight.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the economic impact of interoperability, on the question of whether or not it makes sense to guarantee a single system in the future, an issue which in a sense Mr Vatanen also raised, I must say that, before proposing any decision on harmonised technical requirements, we must carry out a cost-benefit analysis which will justify the economic effort which will be required. Therefore, as has been pointed out, what we are proposing is a two-stage process of harmonisation. Some measures will be implemented rapidly, as the rapporteur, Mr Savary, has pointed out. These will include administrative-type measures such as driving licences for train drivers, so that they may travel beyond national borders, a national licence, which will be a European licence, issues such as the documentation of the goods and signalling, which should be quicker to implement. There are others, however, which are much more complicated to implement, such as, for example, harmonising the size of tunnels so that they may all have the same standard measurements. That will take somewhat longer.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to assure Mr Swoboda, as I have said repeatedly, that before the end of the year we hope to propose the pending measures, such as the directive on safety in rail transport, the issue of the opening up of goods transport to competition and the issue of passenger transport. Of course, the whole issue of the enlargement of the European Union is a key factor for the rail sector, because rail transport is a key element in the development and the balanced growth of the new countries.</p>
