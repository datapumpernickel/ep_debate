<p class="contents">Question No 38 by <span class="bold">Paul Rübig </span>(H−1252/98)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: The euro in textbooks</p>
<p class="contents">The smooth introduction of the single currency and its acceptance by European citizens will depend to a very great extent on how rapidly and comprehensively information can be provided in the educational sector. Particular attention will, of course, be paid to educational establishments and subjects which are in general concerned with currency aspects, for example commercial colleges and subjects such as accountancy and bookkeeping.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the representative of the Commission present today say what progress has been achieved in the transition to the euro in the educational sector and, in particular, in updating textbooks and teaching materials?</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to welcome Mrs Cresson and ask her to reply to Mr Rübig's question. You have the floor, Mrs Cresson.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Cresson, </span> <span class="italic">Commission. – (FR)</span> The Commission is aware of the major challenge which the transition to the euro represents for the educational sector. Children will play a crucial role in helping parents to adapt to the single currency. While respecting the exclusive competence of the Member States in this area, the Commission is supporting several projects within the Socrates programme which are helping to disseminate information on the euro in schools and to integrate this topic into the different curriculum subjects.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of concrete measures are worth mentioning here. A working group entitled ‘Education and the euro" has been set up, comprising representatives of the Ministers for Education and the national agencies of the Socrates programme. This group"s work concerns the promotion of educational initiatives on the euro and the exchange of information and good practice in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The work of this group has led notably to the creation of an inventory of educational tools and initiatives on the euro, both at national and Community level, which is accessible on the Internet on the page entitled ‘The euro at school" on the Europa server. A handbook describing Member States" initiatives in this area, particularly concerning the training of teachers and adaptation of school syllabuses and textbooks, is currently being put together. This document will also be available on the Internet and will be distributed to interested parties.</p>

<p class="contents">As far as the research programme is concerned, I would be interested to know whether there are programmes in the research sector which address the issue of how the euro can best be introduced and what problems might arise when this actually happens, so that these can once again be overcome by giving instruction before the event.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Cresson, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (FR)</span> This activity or action does not directly concern the research sector but rather the education sector. As I said, we are indeed intending to disseminate information via the Internet which will be designed for schools and will therefore be presented in the most attractive format possible. The idea of designing innovative educational software and games has not been ruled out.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I would point out that, every year, we carry out a project of Internet and multimedia dissemination during a week of what are known as ‘net days". For the next week of net days, which will take place at the beginning of the next school year, I will recommend that we introduce the topic of the euro in exchanges which take place between European schools so that this genuinely topical issue can feature in the programmes organised at the time.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that raising the awareness of teachers is absolutely essential. This was already begun three years ago, as part of my initiative concerning the use of multimedia and the Internet. As we will have to explain the subject of the euro in greater detail, however, we can start the ball rolling first with the teachers. That is the information I have on this type of activity.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to research, at my request and suggestion, the structure of the fifth framework programme of research was modified substantially compared with the fourth framework programme, and the second main chapter heading now deals with information technology. As in the other chapters of the framework programme, within information technology there is a series of key horizontal actions relating to disciplines in both pure sciences and social sciences. With regard to the issue of educational software and multimedia, it will also be very useful to be able to introduce incentives and invitations to tender relating to the euro so that we obtain responses to our proposals which we can then disseminate if they are good.</p>

<p class="contents">Question No 39 by <span class="bold">Richard Howitt </span>(H−0094/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Charges for international bank transfers and the single market in financial services</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission agree with my constituent, Mr Vaughan of Rochford, that it is unreasonable for UK banks to charge up to GBP 20 for direct transfers to banks in other EU countries when the same function is operated by the Dutch bank ABN/AMRO for just NLG 15 (GBP 6.50)? In a Union where we are trying to abolish barriers to trade and free movement of labour, would this high cost of transferring money from one Member State to another not contradict the Commission's principles and actively discourage citizens from undertaking work and business in other countries? Will the Commission consider whether the UK banks are thus responsible for anti‐competitive behaviour in breach of Article 85 of the Treaty or whether this is indeed a breach of the single market in financial services?</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to welcome Mr Van Miert and ask him to reply to Mr Howitt's question. You have the floor, Mr Van Miert.</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><img src="/doceo/data/img/hr.gif" width="100%" height="1" alt="" /></td><td align="right" width="16"><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="buttondocwin"><tbody><tr><td align="center"><a href="#top" title="Top"><img src="/doceo/data/img/navi_top.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0" alt="" /></a></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></table>
<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Van Miert, </span> <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – The honourable Member asked first of all whether the level of fees charged by British banks for international money transfers within the European Union could be an infringement of Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome. This famous article outlaws agreements or concerted practices between undertakings in so far as they have a restrictive effect on competition and affect trade between Member States. So as long as the pricing in question is the result of an independent, uncoordinated decision of individual banks there is no infringement of Article 85. But if something else is going on there might well be a real problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the honourable Member asks whether the level of fees in question is a breach of the single market in financial services. In its communication on easier cross‐border payments of 1992 the Commission stated its view that the full benefits of the single market and economic and monetary union will be achieved only if it is possible for businesses and individuals to transfer money as rapidly, reliably and cheaply from one part of the Community to another as is now the case within most Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission continues to hold this opinion. However, there is no legal base in the Treaty for using legislation to eliminate the higher costs borne by users who are making cross‐border as compared with domestic transfers.</p>
<p class="contents">Indirectly, however, the Commission has brought pressure to bear on the banking and payments systems concerned, notably by proposing a directive on cross‐border transfers. This directive has been adopted and is going to enter into force on 14 August 1999. That proposal has encouraged banks to review their systems and to make them more efficient in order to be able to meet the directive's requirements, especially on transparency, guaranteed time schedules for transfers and the money‐back guarantee to senders. There is some evidence that some banks have reduced their prices over the past five years since the proposal came on to the Commission's agenda. Pricing policy, however, is ultimately a matter for the individual service providers, whether the transfers are made within one country or between countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in its Green Paper on the introduction of the single currency, the Commission renewed its appeal to banks to treat the introduction of the euro as the golden opportunity to move towards a single payment area, at least for euro payments. The Commission is presently reviewing its policy on retail cross‐border payments in order to deal, amongst others, with the issue of what are still significantly higher prices.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation as it is now is certainly not satisfactory. You can rely on the Commission to continue to work to remedy that.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Howitt </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – I thank the Commissioner for a very full answer and for agreeing with me that this is an unsatisfactory position. Will he go further and say that the 1992 survey showed that most Member States – most but not all – have low rate and efficient payment systems? Does not the survey by my constituent, Mr Vaughan – showing that British banks are charging up to three times more than their Dutch counterparts – reveal that we have a particular problem in Britain? Will you commit yourself specifically to addressing that problem?</p>
<p class="contents">When you say that you will continue with voluntary efforts, will you take into account the commitments from your own colleagues. Commissioner Monti, after he met the European Banking Federation on 29 January said: ‘I intend to examine in a communication what remains to be done to improve the functioning of retail payment systems in the single market". Similarly, Commissioner de Silguy, issued a warning to Europe's financial institutions on 7 May 1998 urging them to look at this matter again. Will we have more action, not just more of the same?</p>

There should be no doubt about our determination to do so in all respects.

May I ask him if he does not agree with me that there is, in fact, great difficulty in ensuring the transparency of the cost of transfers until such time as the euro applies in each Member State? Would he also agree with me that there is a lack of choice of financial intermediaries within the United Kingdom to access venture capital, particularly for small and medium‐sized companies? I feel great concern, which I would like to place on record, that to access loans through the European Investment Bank there is only a choice of one intermediary in the United Kingdom. Is there anything the Commissioner or the British authorities can do to stimulate competition in this field?</p>

It is also related to the responsibilities of my colleague, Mario Monti, but, again, we are certainly open‐minded about it and will look into whatever evidence you might make available to us.</p>
<p class="contents">For the rest, I am puzzled to learn that there is such a big difference between the transfer fees which are still applied in Great Britain and some other European countries. There must be an explanation for that though, as far as I can see, it would be very difficult to come up with a satisfactory explanation. Something must be done about it. As I mentioned earlier, it is also a reason for the British authorities either to take action or to look into what is really happening. But there should be no doubt that, as we see it, the present situation is largely unsatisfactory.</p>

<p class="contents">Question No 40 by <span class="bold">Willy De Clercq </span>(H−0091/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Major national differences in respect of recognition, recognition procedure, classification of and controls on medicinal products</p>
<p class="contents">Completion of the Internal Market still seems a long way off as far as medicinal products are concerned. Companies are experiencing difficulties in having new medicinal products recognised in the various Member states because of differences in recognition procedures and in exactly what is classified as a medicinal product.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not only companies but consumers, too, who suffer as a result. In some Member States patients can use a particular product but not in others. Furthermore, the different controls in the Member states are often the source of legal uncertainty and of inadequate protection. Nor is this an adequate means of guaranteeing safety for patients.</p>
<p class="contents">What progress has been achieved with completion of a uniform and harmonised market within the EU for pharmaceuticals, and what action does the Commission intend to take in the short term?</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to welcome Mr Papoutsis and ask him to reply to Mr De Clercq's question. You have the floor, Commissioner.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Papoutsis, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (EL)</span> Mr President, there has been considerable progress made with regard to the internal market for medicinal products. The picture presented by Mr De Clercq in this respect fully reflects the reality of the situation as it was several years ago. However, since 1995, major steps have been taken leading to considerable progress being achieved in bringing about a single market, the technical harmonisation of which is almost completed. In broad terms, what is being pursued in this sector can be broken down into three strategic action plans: the development of a European procedure for the granting of permits for the circulation of such products; the development of a high level of protection of intellectual property rights; and the development of the medicinal products market itself.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the granting of permits for the distribution of medicinal products, in 1995 two new Community procedures were launched which today allow us swift access to the European market as a whole by means of a single procedure. This procedure is based either on a joint central assessment carried out by the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products, resulting in the granting of a single distribution permit issued by the European Commission, or on mutual recognition amongst Member States, resulting in the harmonisation of national distribution permits.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards intellectual property rights, I must say that, through legislation adopted by Community institutions, Europe now has available the most adequate provisions worldwide in respect of medicinal products. The legislation adopted in 1998 by Community institutions made it possible to safeguard innovations in the biotechnology sector by issuing patent certificates, thereby putting an end to the uncertainty plaguing this particular sector. Furthermore, the procedure for the granting of distribution permits protects the data that is used in such requests for six or, more generally, ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">The third aspect of this strategy for developing the internal market in medicinal products is the development of the single market itself and, more especially, the development of the principles of free movement and competition in the context of economic regulation in this sector, in which products are subject to strict checks in terms of pricing and returns. In May 1998, the Single Market Council adopted provisions regarding the development of a single market in medicinal products. In November 1998, the Commission made a statement on these issues in the form of a communication which deals with a survey conducted into the progress made thus far in constructing a single market for medicinal products.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr De Clercq has asked a question which relates to the existence in the near future of plans to improve the operation of the internal market. I can assure you that the Commission has already made a number of proposals in the realm of so‐called ‘orphan drugs", in other words, drugs for rare diseases, and also in relation to a more effective regulatory framework for clinical tests. The debate on the single market in medicinal products will continue. Last year, in its communication, the Commission emphasised the importance of a more rational approach, which would be supported in the market, towards a regulatory framework in the pharmaceutical sector. The aim is to improve patients" access to quality drugs and to improve the competitiveness of the pharmaceutical industry.</p>

<p class="contents">Question No 41 by <span class="bold">Ludivina García Arias </span>(H−0080/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Neutrality of the Commission's Director‐General for Energy</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission not believe that the remarks made by its Director‐General for Energy, a Spanish national, during the debate organised by the European Energy Foundation on ‘the implementation of the energy directive in Spain' constitute an intervention in respect of the texts enlarging on and interpreting Article 24 of Directive 96/92 (EC)<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on the arrangements governing the transition to competition, and that serious doubts therefore arise concerning his neutrality as regards the legality of the imputation of the costs of the transition to competition relating to the Spanish electricity sector?</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Papoutsis, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (EL) </span> Mr President, in response to the question asked by Mrs García Arias, the Commission wishes to clarify that the Director‐General for Energy has reassured us that articles referring to the statements he made during a meeting organised by the European Energy Foundation with representatives of the industry do not reflect the contents of what he himself said. The Commission therefore believes that the neutrality of the Director‐General for Energy has not been called into question.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the actual substance of the question tabled by Mrs García Arias, the Commission would like to emphasise the following points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the cost of the transition towards competitiveness in Spain, as in other Member States which have declared relevant costs, is something which the Commission services are analysing thoroughly at the moment, on the basis of Article 24 of the directive on the internal market in electricity.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to clarify that, hitherto, the Commission has not adopted an official position with respect to costs in relation to possible derogations from Article 24 of the directive on the internal market in electricity or to possible state subsidies.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, in accordance with the provisions of the directive and pursuant to an explicit decision taken by the Member States, the Commission has an obligation to carry out the abovementioned analyses under the strictest confidentiality.</p>
<p class="contents">The transition procedure set out in the directive on the internal market in electricity in Spain is progressing in a satisfactory manner: the extent to which the market is opening up; the number of eligible customers; the appointment of an administrator for the market and of an independent administrator for the network; the order relating to coproduction and renewable energy sources. The statements made by the Director‐General for Energy, to which the honourable Member referred, must be looked at in this light.</p>

I was myself present at the European Energy Foundation dinner together with a number of other journalists. In the light of some of the things said on that occasion, I began to feel that, as a Spaniard, I was betraying my country. However, other journalists present confirm what has since been made public, and I agree with them. As I said, I was myself present at the dinner.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I now have serious doubts as to the neutrality, impartiality and objectivity with which the Director‐General for Energy is dealing with this issue. By his very presence at that meeting and by what he said there, he endorsed the legality of the costs of transition to competition in Spain. I should like to put a specific question to you, Commissioner, in view of the fact that this appointment has provoked a mixed reaction in Spain. In fact, it has led to much debate, is being challenged in the courts as unconstitutional, and the consumers" associations have lodged appeals in the hope of ensuring that the procedure is carried through in an objective manner. Would you be prepared, Commissioner, to meet with representatives of the consumers and of the political parties in Spain who are opposed to the procedure chosen to deliver this aid?</p>

The cost of transition towards competitiveness is something which the Commission services are investigating thoroughly under conditions of absolute confidentiality. Neither I nor any other Member of the Commission would wish to second‐guess the outcome of these investigations, in strict compliance with the provisions of the Treaty which insist on the confidentiality of this process.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, we will leave no stone unturned in our attempt to achieve an objective, neutral and substantive assessment of this particular case. All of us – the Commission, of course, the Directors‐General and all the Members of the Commission – have a duty to remain neutral and objective in assessing the various cases.

<p class="contents">My question relates to the nature of the costs. However, further to Mrs García Arias" comments, I should like to say that I, too, was present at that dinner, and I agree entirely with you, Commissioner, as to the neutrality of the Director‐General. It is quite usual for senior officials from the Commission to attend dinners. It would be much stranger if you did not allow them to go. Furthermore, we all want to hear what they have to say. I am also quite sure that you all operate discretely and maintain confidentiality.</p>
<p class="contents">My question, however, is this: is the cost we are discussing state aid? Or is it an additional element of the price of electricity which will simply be absorbed like any other, since it is a result of investments made to guarantee energy and to guarantee supply in tightly regulated and controlled markets?</p>

This will allow our services to investigate, as is proper and in accordance with the rules, whether these are indeed costs relating to the obligations of the public services, which were previously imposed by the public authorities on their own corporations, and which are now being imposed on the process to free up the market, and which run the risk of causing casualties among the companies involved.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the boundaries within which the matter is being handled. For the time being, I have nothing more to add and under no circumstances will I seek to pre‐empt the conclusion which our services will come to. What I can do, however, is reassure you yet again that, in carrying out their assessment, our services will abide by the principle of absolute neutrality and will simply assess the facts on their merits. I would also like to point out that this procedure is closely bound up with the operation of the internal market for energy and, as such, it must be a litmus test for the credibility of the system. This is one more reason for the Commission to stand firm on the impartiality of the procedure.</p>

I must take this opportunity to mention that prior to this debate, the government had refused to raise the matter with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I wish to put a question along the lines of that raised by Mrs García Arias concerning Mr Benavides" attitude. I find it quite unacceptable and I feel personally insulted. Mr Benavides" reference to political exhibitionism can only be understood as a reference either to members of the Spanish Parliament or to Members of this Parliament, and I find any such reference totally unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also remind Mr Papoutsis that very soon, when the common market for energy becomes a reality, all issues relating to energy – and this one in particular – will come within the Commission"s competence. In this context, I have to make it quite clear that in my judgment – in our judgment – Mr Benavides has forfeited the impartiality and objectivity which are essential when dealing with an issue of this nature.</p>

<p class="contents">Question No 42 by <span class="bold">Jan Andersson </span>(H−0020/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Conditions for Swedish adoption of the common currency</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction of the euro at the beginning of the year has lent urgency to the debate in Sweden on its possible future adoption of the common currency, the timing of which is one of the principal issues. Here it would be valuable to clarify the formal criteria for adopting the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission explain how the present qualifying periods for joining the ERM are to be interpreted? Are they irrevocable and absolute, or are there circumstances which might be invoked for allow Sweden to join the ERM at an earlier date than that implied by the qualifying periods laid down for the ERM?</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">de Silguy, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. – (FR)</span> In reply to Mr Andersson, I would like to say firstly that the Treaty does not specify any qualifying period for the passage of a Member State to the third stage of economic and monetary union. I would remind you that in accordance with Article 109k(2), which lays down the procedure for entry into EMU for Member States with a derogation, the Commission and the European Central Bank must report to the Council at least once every two years or at the request of the Member State concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">So to enter the third stage of economic and monetary union it is necessary to have achieved a high degree of sustainable convergence. This is what the Treaty says. The Commission examines the following criteria here: the achievement of a high degree of price stability, the sustainability of the government financial position, in terms of both deficits and debt, and the observance for at least two years of the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. The sustainability of convergence achieved by the Member State and of its participation in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System are also reflected in the long‐term interest rate levels.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Sweden, the Commission considered in its report of 25 March 1998 that this country did not fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of the single currency. Firstly, Sweden"s national legislation, including the statute of the national central bank, was not compatible with Articles 107 and 108 of the Treaty and the Statute of the European System of Central Banks. Secondly, Sweden did not fulfil the criterion of exchange rate stability. The Swedish krona never participated in the exchange rate mechanism and, in addition, in the two years under review by the Commission, 1996 and 1997, the Swedish krona fluctuated against the ERM currencies, reflecting, among other things, the absence of an exchange rate target.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the criterion of exchange rate stability set out in the third indent of Article 109j(1) of the Treaty, the Commission considered in its report last March that the currencies of Finland and Italy, although having rejoined the ERM only in October 1996 and November 1996 respectively, had ‘displayed sufficient stability in the last two years".</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would say that there is no qualifying period and I would point out again that the conditions of entry for the Member States that are today the ‘pre‐ins" are the same as for the countries that are currently participating in economic and monetary union.</p>

I put the question because the main reason why Sweden decided not to join EMU was that public opinion was against it. Now, I can safely say that public opinion in Sweden has changed dramatically. According to the latest polls, a large majority of Swedish people are in favour of the euro and of joining the single currency. This means that next year, or perhaps a little later, Sweden will hold a referendum to decide whether to join the single currency. I should therefore be grateful if there could be some flexibility over the timetable for entry. In the past year, the Swedish Parliament has decided on the position of the central bank. Consequently, I believe that we are now seeing a period of more stability.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore once again putting the question to the Commissioner. The most important aspects should still be Sweden's economy and its eligibility for a place in the club in terms of inflation, interest rates and so on. In this respect, the situation looks fairly promising.</p>

<p class="contents">As for the rest, I very much hope that the economic and political advantages of membership of the single currency that we are currently observing will be able to sway opinions in the countries which do not belong today. I hope that opinions will be changed quickly, and the excellent stability programme presented yesterday by the Swedish Government and accepted by the Council of Ministers is an encouraging factor here.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would add that the exchange rate criterion is important. It has legal force and will therefore be applied under precisely the same conditions.

The background to this issue is as follows. The French Minister for Europe, in a leading article in a Swedish newspaper, recently described his perception of Sweden's attitude to the euro under the heading: ‘A stronger euro if Sweden joins'. He also said that Sweden was perfectly entitled not to join the single currency for the time being.</p>
<p class="contents">As my Swedish colleague mentioned earlier, the situation has now changed significantly. I believe it would be a very good thing, in view of the new positive attitude that currently prevails, if the Swedish people were to feel that the present members of the single currency were keen for their country to join.</p>
<p class="contents">I should just like to confirm that the Commissioner and the French Minister for Europe are both agreed on that point.</p>

<p class="contents">Question No 43 by <span class="bold">Astrid Thors </span>(H−0042/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: The Target payment system</p>
<p class="contents">The new Target system for payment transactions between European banks was put into practice in connection with the transition to the euro at the beginning of this year. The system has, at least during the initial phase, been extremely unsatisfactory and caused considerable delays to payments between EU banks. Delays in payment have resulted in substantial losses for the banks.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Commission, which measures are needed in order to guarantee that the new Target system will facilitate the banks' transactions instead of making them more difficult, as is now the case?</p>
<p class="contents">I give the floor to Mr de Silguy to answer Mrs Thors's question.</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><img src="/doceo/data/img/hr.gif" width="100%" height="1" alt="" /></td><td align="right" width="16"><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="buttondocwin"><tbody><tr><td align="center"><a href="#top" title="Top"><img src="/doceo/data/img/navi_top.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0" alt="" /></a></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></table>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">de Silguy, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. – (FR)</span> Mr President, the Target payment system comes within the competence of the European System of Central Banks, which operates it. It is not therefore the Commission"s responsibility to deal with matters concerning the operation of Target, nor is it my place to advise the ESCB on the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the Commission has read the various reports describing the initial difficulties encountered by the system. I assure you that these difficulties are rare and limited, and that they in no way represent functional defects.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Commission"s information, Target itself has posed hardly any problems and seems to have operated normally from the first day of use. The difficulties mentioned are more likely to result from the inexperience of certain commercial banks, which is only to be expected in the early stages of using a new system. For example, these banks have input data that are incompatible with the system; it has also been the case that, out of habit, certain banks have concentrated most of their transactions in the latter part of the day, thus giving rise to bottlenecks.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it has been necessary to bring the national payment systems" links – particularly computer interfaces – into line with Target, which also explains the teething problems noted. However, given the scale and complexity of the system, these difficulties appear to be minor, and the European System of Central Banks now seems to have them completely under control. This is illustrated by a press release of 21 January in which the European Central Bank indicated that the problems encountered with the cross‐border flow of liquidity during the first few days of the euro area money market had diminished substantially and that, overall, only three weeks after its creation the market had reached a satisfactory level of integration.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(SV) I think it is important to note that part of the problem stems from the fact that some systems do not operate throughout the day. This means that there is a great deal of payment activity at the end of the day. Is the Commission aware of the continuing existence of this problem? According to my information, the situation at the end of January was that some banks were still not connected to the Target system throughout the day. That is why the problem has arisen.</span></p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to ask whether the Commission has taken part in any discussions regarding the question of compensation that has arisen as a result of the delays. It was my understanding that in certain circumstances the compensation issue was to be addressed. Consequently, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his written reply about another matter, which I received this morning.</p>

<p class="contents">On the two aspects you raised, Mrs Thors, I must point out firstly that this was an extremely complex and cumbersome system and that the difficulties encountered were negligible compared to what could have happened, although all preparations had been made. Once again, it is a question of habit. You referred to payments made at the end of the day; this is also a question of habit and all these problems will disappear as the market becomes integrated and begins to operate more smoothly. I believe that now only small technical or electrical problems occur occasionally but these are dealt with quickly and, I believe, in everyone"s best interests. In any case, the system works.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, when the system was introduced, the Commission had to deal with certain aspects which fell within its jurisdiction, for example issues related to competition, which might have posed a problem when the system was set up. These have now been resolved and are once again the responsibility of the European Central Bank; you could ask Mr Duisenberg this question at the next opportunity.</p>

<p class="contents">Question No 45 by <span class="bold">Anna Terrón i Cusí </span>(H−0082/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Excessive commissions charged by Spanish banks</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission aware that, on the pretext of the introduction of the euro, Spanish banks are charging excessive commissions for exchanging euro−11 currencies, ranging from 3 % to 10 % (in the case of sums less than Pta 30 000)?

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">de Silguy, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. – (FR)</span> These two questions are very much related and it is difficult to separate them because they rightly raise the problem of the cost of banking transactions now that the euro has been introduced. This is a vitally important issue for the Commission because the acceptance of the euro by the general public depends on it.</p>
<p class="contents">We must make the situation clear and distinguish between national banking transactions and cross‐border transactions within the euro zone. With regard to national transactions, on 15 April the Commission adopted a recommendation providing both for equal treatment of the euro and the national currency and for compulsory transactions to be free of charge. In accordance with this principle, all banking services must cost the same, whether the sum is in euros or in the national currency. On this point, as far as we know, breaches of the recommendation are quite rare.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation regarding cross‐border transactions, on the other hand, is different. There are both manual foreign‐exchange operations – exchanging notes for notes – and cross‐border transfers. In the Commission"s opinion a clear and detailed presentation of the level and structure of bank charges for both types is essential to promote competition and thus a reduction in the commission charged, which would be of great benefit to the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">The exchange rate risk has disappeared with the advent of the euro. The conversion rate between currencies in the euro zone has been fixed irrevocably, thus preventing the use of ‘spread", which means different buying and selling rates. But the euro does not eliminate all costs, for example certain handling or transaction costs.</p>
<p class="contents">In total, according to our information and our calculations, the birth of the euro should represent an average saving of approximately 20 % on transaction costs in comparison to the period prior to its introduction, and this should of course logically be passed on to the customer.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard more specifically to cross‐border payment systems for small sums, the introduction of the euro does not automatically unify these systems. They will therefore continue to operate independently, in accordance with the structure of the national systems. The issue of manual exchange will, by definition, be resolved definitively on 1 January 2002, but there will be no automatic progress with regard to transfers. For this reason we must aim, as soon as possible, to create a Target system for the public so that transfers of small sums – these being of interest to individuals, whereas the Target system which we were just discussing is of interest to the banks – between countries in the euro zone are carried out as securely and quickly as national transfers and at a similar cost.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the situation. In the light of this, the Commission has taken a number of measures to encourage banks to facilitate use of the euro by reducing excessive bank charges. Firstly, the banks are called upon to increase transparency. To this end they must publish the structure of the bank charges that they have applied since 1 January 1999. Ireland, for example, has published notices on this issue in the national press, and I believe this sets an example for other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The European banking federations must submit a complete overview to the Commission by 31 March at the latest, and at that time the Commission will undertake a full evaluation of the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission has just set up a fax and e‐mail system, known as ‘eurosignal", which the public can contact directly; it has also published e‐mail addresses in the press so that people can send messages, and we guarantee to reply to every single one of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Member States are called upon to quickly set up euro monitoring centres, as the Commission has recommended. Finally, the Commission has encouraged the banks to develop the cross‐border payment systems that I have just mentioned, which are safe, fast, efficient and at a reasonable cost.</p>
<p class="contents">In spring, the Commission will publish a communication which will allow us to bring all this together and to propose a framework for creating a single payments area. This communication will examine both existing methods of payment – cards, cheques – and future methods, and here I am referring to the electronic wallet.</p>
<p class="contents">My aim is that, this summer, all tourists – and God knows there are plenty in Europe – will realise that the euro makes it cheaper for them in 1999 than it was last year to travel to another European country and to exchange money. The Commission has not delayed in taking action; it is determined to achieve a real improvement in the situation, and this must be visible by this summer at the latest.</p>

<p class="contents">This development and the fact that all the institutions took action simultaneously lead us to suspect that some agreement on this policy must have been reached in advance. Clearly, any such agreement would contravene the basic rules of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you claimed that tourists will find it cheaper to travel within the euro zone this summer. However, tourists who come to Spain and try to change spending money may find that they lose up to 10 % of the money they change, and with no prior warning.</p>

We could not hope to resolve everything on the first day.

Unfortunately, this never happened, and so unfortunately, events have shown that we were right, and we are now having to raise our voices and complain on behalf of consumers about current practices in the various countries. These practices are preventing the citizen – the consumer – from appreciating fully that the euro has arrived and that charges should therefore disappear.</p>
<p class="contents">The Bank of Spain is to be commended for its initiative to provide free exchange of all currencies from within the so‐called euro zone in Spain. Unfortunately, however, the Bank of Spain"s network is limited and this initiative has not prevented the private banking institutions from pursuing a policy which may well have been agreed in advance. If that proved to be the case, I am sure Mr Van Miert would have something to say about it. In any case, our misgivings as to possible abuses of this nature have proved well founded.</p>

Secondly, it must be understood that the Commission does not have the necessary legislative powers to compel banks and bureaux de change, by regulatory means, to exchange notes free of charge or to observe a maximum tariff. This also applies to charges on cross‐border transfers. The Commission ensures that banks observe the existing legal obligations: conversion between the euro and the national currency unit without charge, conversion of accounts to the euro unit without charge, and non‐discrimination between the euro and the national currency unit in charges for identical services.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the measures we have taken are currently leading to progress in this area. I have already said this and I will say it again: I believe that what happened at the beginning was overexposed in the media. We must not generalise this at EU level. We must be vigilant. This is why we are maintaining pressure on the banks, and this pressure must be translated into action. If in fact no change is observed at the end of a reasonable period, we might have to consider alternative measures. But I do not believe that we have reached this stage yet: the results of measures undertaken in recent weeks lead us to believe that the situation is improving.</p>
<p class="contents">It took forty years to put this single currency into circulation, so we should not expect the obstacles and constraints encountered by our citizens and consumers to disappear all at once. Also, these obstacles are not generally linked to the currency itself but result from other factors, for example the links between banking systems.</p>
<p class="contents">I can therefore assure you once again that the Commission is aware of the problems, and we are being vigilant.

Where I believe we need to step up our efforts is on the proposals to focus our attention on human rights situations within the European Union itself.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection I should also like to refer once again to the Treaty of Amsterdam, the human rights paragraphs of which were the subject of lengthy debate during negotiations. There is also a proposal by the German Presidency circulating at present to draw up a charter of human rights. We will be discussing this tomorrow with representatives of the Council of Europe, in particular in order to see how this initiative should relate to the existing European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">To return to external human rights policy, I would remind you of the important declaration in Vienna by the Council of Ministers in connection with the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This declaration also announces a number of initiatives and studies in the field of human rights policy, one of which I should particularly like to mention, which is the suggestion that we should consider whether the European Union should draw up its own annual human rights report, something that the European Parliament has also called for.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to point out that the Commission feels that if we are to take such a far‐reaching initiative it could be very important to opt for an annual report which deals with a limited number of human rights themes, rather than perhaps seeking to produce a worldwide report. Apart from the human and financial resources which would be required, the US State Department already issues such a report. I fear that otherwise we will simply be duplicating their work.</p>
<p class="contents">All these initiatives are currently being discussed, a fact which we welcome. I would say to Mrs Oddy that we have the very definite feeling that interest in human rights issues is not only widening but also deepening in the European Union, which is most definitely to be welcomed.</p>

It is also the reason why I said earlier that we need to take a careful look at what this charter could mean in terms of strengthening human rights within the Union. The honourable Member is quite correct, apart from the national constitutions of the Member States, which generally provide sufficient protection for fundamental rights and freedoms, there is also the Council of Europe"s European Convention on Human Rights which is still unique, including in the sense that it is the only human rights convention in the world which also includes an enforcement mechanism, on the basis of which a separate court in Strasbourg can be asked to pronounce on violations and infringements of the convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking all this into account, the honourable Member will also remember that there has already been an in‐depth debate on whether or not it would be possible to allow the European Community to be a party to the European Convention on Human Rights as a legal personality. The Court of Justice in Luxembourg ruled that this was not possible on the basis of the present EU Treaty. So if this is out of the question, it then raises the question of how else human rights protection can be regulated at European level, perhaps including powers for the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the debate currently on the agenda, but as I said, we are also having discussions with the Council of Europe. We will certainly keep you informed of the progress of these discussions.</p>

<p class="contents">Question No 47 by <span class="bold">Giorgos Dimitrakopoulos </span>(H−0007/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Security in Cyprus</p>
<p class="contents">Given that the EU, and some Member States in particular, had raised objections to the initial plan of the Cyprus Government to site a surface‐to‐air missile system, consisting of S−300 missiles, on the island and subsequently congratulated it on its decision to cancel the plan, how does the Commission feel that Cyprus should improve its security?</p>
<p class="contents">I give the floor to the Commissioner to answer Mr Dimitrakopoulos's question.</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><img src="/doceo/data/img/hr.gif" width="100%" height="1" alt="" /></td><td align="right" width="16"><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="buttondocwin"><tbody><tr><td align="center"><a href="#top" title="Top"><img src="/doceo/data/img/navi_top.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0" alt="" /></a></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></table>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">van den Broek, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (NL)</span> My expert colleagues have prepared a long answer to Mr Dimitrakopoulos" question. With all due respect for everything this contains, which I am sure Mr Dimitrakopoulos is already perfectly familiar with, I would like to try to give him a rather more off‐the‐cuff reply. I agree with him entirely that the developments in Cyprus have had a positive effect in that President Clerides" decision not to place air defence missiles on the island has considerably helped to ease tensions, and not only on Cyprus: it has also reduced tensions which were in danger of escalating between Greece and Turkey, which could in turn have put further strain on relations between the European Union and Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">We also know that we are engaged in an intensive process of cooperation with Cyprus with a view to accession. I believe that this wise and courageous decision by President Clerides has created a better climate for that process.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, and this is not the least important point, the honourable Member will be aware that the European Union, both the Council and the Commission, are intensively supporting the efforts by the UN Secretary General, and more particularly the special representative Mr Herkus who is on the island at present, to try to make progress towards a political solution for Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">Here too we can say that the process was certainly not made any easier as long as the threat of conflict over the air defence missiles was in the air. The positive step taken by President Clerides – at the expense of internal political tensions within his government – was not only a wise but also a courageous act. But what does this mean for the whole political development of Cyprus as such? Although I cannot be very optimistic – there are not enough positive indications that the political process under UN supervision will bring concrete results in the foreseeable future for that – it must be said that it has increased the prospect that, for example, the dialogue on security and the military situation on the island, which is being conducted in the form of confidential diplomacy by the United Nations, will have a greater chance of success. The honourable Member can be sure that the European Union will try to contribute where we see such chances developing, through the presidency, Member States" contacts and also the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude this answer, we all know what an enormous positive contribution would be made to Cyprus" integration in the European Union if a solution could be found to the still fundamental problems that exist on the island.</p>

<p class="contents">There are a couple of other things I would like to ask.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, can the Commissioner give us any evidence of the gestures that we have been expecting from the other side, from Turkey, and which were previously contained in the Commission communication on the issue of the S−300s?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commissioner continually used the hypothetical word ‘if". I would like to ask him what course of action the Commission intends to take, if what he is expecting to happen does not happen, in light of the political solutions which the Commission considers to be vital for the security of Cyprus.</p>

I have clearly stated what President Clerides" contribution has been. It could therefore also be expected, especially when the security situation on the island itself – and here I am speaking of matters such as the militarisation or demilitarisation of the island – is so closely linked to President Clerides"s decision, that it would be extremely welcome, and we must now urge the Turkish Cypriot community and thus also Ankara to move forward on this very issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Herkus too has made great efforts recently to see whether it is possible to progressively demilitarise the island, also given the very positive boost which that would give to the rest of the political talks which, as the honourable Member well knows, are at present at a serious impasse.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, wherever the European Union, including the European Commission, can give encouragement in its contacts with the Turkish Government, it will certainly do so. I believe we must also be realistic enough to recognise that Turkey is at present on the eve of parliamentary elections, which is not a period when it is customary to see the most courageous political acts. But let us hope that when the elections are over we will again see new opportunities opening up.</p>

<p class="contents">Firstly, the Cypriot Government previously put forward a proposal to completely demilitarise the island, which was rejected by the Turkish Cypriots – wrongly, in my view. But now the Cypriot Government has put forward a new proposal to establish a NATO peacekeeping force on the island and to bring about the withdrawal of the Turkish forces of occupation and the Greek armed forces from the island. What is your position on this?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in the light of the positive gestures made by the Cypriot Government and given that it has put a stop to its plan to install the S−300s, and since it has said that the Turkish Cypriots should participate in discussions concerning the membership of Cyprus in the EU, which the Turkish Cypriots have refused to do, and in the light of the more general mood of conciliation within the Cypriot Government, do you not think that the Commission and Council should now make an unequivocal statement that Cyprus will join the EU, notwithstanding the stance of the Turkish Cypriots and their participation or otherwise in the negotiations?</p>

However, I am convinced that if the parties could agree at some point on the terms for demilitarisation and if the UN Secretary General"s special representative should deem it useful and necessary to comply with the desire for a UN peacekeeping force, then it would certainly then be discussed on the Security Council. A decision would have to be taken at that point. I do not therefore believe that the problem lies in the international community"s reluctance to make a contribution, in whatsoever form. But there must of course be a basic agreement in principle between the parties themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the negotiations, you know the Commission"s position. We have said time and time again – these negotiations have been going on for nine or ten months now – that now is not the time to talk about what the situation will be if the negotiations end without a political solution to the problem of the divided island. We do not believe it is productive to speculate on this at present and will therefore refrain from doing so. At the same time, the Commission has done all that is necessary to keep the momentum of the negotiations going and will continue to do this if the situation remains as it is at present.</p>

<p class="contents">Subject: Nuclear waste mismanagement</p>
<p class="contents">Has the Commission examined the report on nuclear waste mismanagement at UK nuclear sites, drawn up by the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate and released in December 1998, which sets out how the incompetent management of solid radioactive waste at Dounreay and Sellafield may affect the health of UK citizens and the environment of other EU Member States as a result of the leakage of radioactivity into the sea?</p>

The Commission has asked the UK authorities to give us this report. It is not clear whether the report to which Mr Smith is referring only concerns the safety of the plants, or whether it also deals with the impact on the environment in the event of radioactive discharges into the sea. If the latter is the case, our study of the report will focus on compliance with the basic safety standards for the protection of the population against ionised radiation, and if necessary will take the form of an inspection pursuant to Article 35 of the Euratom Treaty. The Commission plans to carry out further inspections under Article 35 of the Euratom Treaty in March 1999 at Dounreay and probably in the year 2000 at Sellafield.</p>

It may indeed talk about the things that the Commissioner talks about, or it may indeed talk about something completely different.

Quite honestly, I am getting a bit tired of the Commission coming along here and telling us various things. When we approach the Council on these matters the Council always says this is a matter for the Commission, the Commission's responsibility.

We assume, of course, that we will receive it, and then we shall deal with it in accordance with Article 35 of the Euratom Treaty. Since we had not heard of this report, it would have been very difficult for me to respond other than in the way I have done here today.</p>

<p class="contents">The Commission is also unaware that the Scandinavian environment ministers have submitted complaints about marine pollution due to radioactive discharges from the processing plants at Sellafield and Dounreay. This is not in fact a great surprise to us, because it concerns matters which are subject to the bilateral or multilateral contacts between these countries and the UK, and Mrs Sandbæk also said that they had complained to the UK. However, the Commission is of course aware that high concentrations of technetium 99 have been found along the coastlines of the Scandinavian countries and in the Arctic Sea. The Commission took an active part in the Council of Ministers meeting held in Sintra in July 1998. At that meeting, at which I was also present, the question of radioactive discharges was raised and a reduction in principle of the volume of waste was adopted with a view to reaching a concentration close to zero – and now we are looking a long way ahead – by the year 2020. The UK Government has given assurances that it is acutely aware of the problem with technetium 99, not least in connection with the handling of Sellafield's discharge licences. Against that background, I think I can say that we are of course monitoring developments very actively and that we also have the necessary contacts, but that we must of course have it incorporated into our work schedule and take into account the number of people available if we are to carry out inspections.</p>

Recently the German Government has been doing U‐turns and going through all sorts of contortions in relation to the whole nuclear issue.</p>

Now, we may of course have many different opinions about nuclear power, and for that matter about Sellafield and other things. I can well understand that Mr Fitzsimons and others think that some of my replies have been inadequate, but I am obliged to confine myself to our areas of competence. And the Commission has no competence when it comes to inspecting the safety of nuclear plants. This supervision is the responsibility of the competent authorities of the Member States. It is also the operator and the Member State concerned who have to assess the economic viability of the facilities. Therefore, every time we have had questions on these lines, we have had to examine where we have competence and where we do not. And if you want more to be done, as I understand that Mr Fitzsimons and others do, I am afraid I have to disappoint you, because I cannot exceed the competence we have been given in this area.</p>

<p class="contents">Question No 60 by <span class="bold">Antonios Trakatellis </span>(H−0026/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Maliakos Bay link – breach of Community environment law</p>
<p class="contents">As part of the Pathe road network, tenders are being invited for the Maliakos Bay link, an underground tunnel 4.5 km long and 4 metres wide, to be dug at 18 metres below the sea bed. Local authorities and organisations in the area are categorically opposed to the proposed project and studies have shown that Maliakos Bay is an unsuitable site for construction of this type (a small, shallow closed bay, geological fault, earthquake‐prone, fish farm).</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission aware that the location of the project and the invitation to tender are in breach of Directives 85/337/EEC<a href="#def_1_3" name="ref_1_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and 97/11/EC<a href="#def_1_4" name="ref_1_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> in that no complete and specific environmental impact assessment has been carried out, no information has been made available to the public and there has been no attempt to find alternative solutions?</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind that Maliakos Bay and the wetland of the River Sperkhios have been proposed as protected areas under the Natura 2000 programme, is it possible for this project to go ahead when it endangers the ecosystem and threatens to wipe out all forms of marine life in the region?</p>
<p class="contents">Can the project be jointly financed from Community funds when it is in breach of Community legal provisions and what measures does the Commission intend to take to enforce those provisions?</p>
<p class="contents">I give the floor to Mrs Bjerregaard to answer Mr Trakatellis's question.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bjerregaard, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (DA)</span> Mr President, the project concerned is part of the new motorway between Athens and Salonika. Large parts of the rest of the motorway are being cofinanced with the Commission. The section referred to by the honourable Member is not included in this financing. On the contrary, it is to be built, financed and operated by private investors. However, I would like to stress that EU legislation must, of course, still be observed. Only the provisional studies in relation to the tunnel, including therefore the environmental studies, are being cofinanced through the operational programme for road networks within the framework of EU aid to Greece for 1994‐1999.</p>
<p class="contents">I have the impression that the honourable Member believes the public invitation to tender in connection with the tunnel has already started. That is not the information which I have. According to the information which the Commission has, that is not the case, and the only thing the Greek authorities have done is to announce that the project will be carried out and thus invite individual businesses to register their declarations of interest. Before a public invitation to tender is issued, there will be an environmental impact assessment in accordance with the provisions of Directive 85/337. The Sperheios River valley and the Maliakos Kolpos estuary are indeed among the sites which the Greek authorities have proposed for inclusion in the Natura 2000 network in accordance with the habitats directive. The Sperheios estuary has been designated as a specially protected area under the birds directive. According to Article 6 of the habitats directive, a project which is damaging to the ecological integrity of a Natura 2000 area, and for which there are no alternative solutions, can only be given consent for imperative reasons of overriding public interest, and if appropriate compensatory measures are adopted. These rules already apply to the specially protected areas, including the Sperheios estuary, but not to the site as a whole. This will happen automatically if the site is included in the Natura 2000 network.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, in accordance with Directive 92/43 and the Treaty on European Union, the Greek authorities must refrain from any activity which could significantly damage the ecological integrity of this site. The Commission's services will make enquiries of the Greek authorities to ensure that they have complied with their obligations under the current legislation, and with regard to the project in question. According to the Greek authorities, the project will not affect the Sperheios area, but that is one of the things of which the Commission wishes to be sure.</p>

<p class="contents">Thirty‐two authorities from throughout the region, which have protested and which have not been asked about the project, have appealed under Greek law to the State Council. In accordance with the Community directive, these official bodies should be allowed to participate in the project. As a result, there has been a great deal of turmoil in the region and nobody wants this project. However, there are alternative solutions. This bridging project could be carried out differently – not via the Gulf of Maliakos. It is curious to note that, while the Ministry for the Environment places this region within Natura 2000, with the onset of the work it will destroy this region by carrying out a bridging operation which will totally transform this deep gulf into one which is incapable of supporting any form of marine life whatsoever. I would ask the Commissioner therefore to monitor this affair very closely, as it is of great significance for all communities and inhabitants in the region.</p>
