<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jackson (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – Mr President, I report to the House at the end of a long and not wholly satisfactory saga. The European Parliament's delegation wanted to see this recommendation on environmental inspection cast in the form of a directive. We were very forceful about that and we tried to persuade the Commission to sympathise with us. It did not. We tried to persuade the Council of Ministers to agree with us and it did not. This is very sad but it is a situation which we have unfortunately had to live with because, if we had not agreed to the texts which we now have in front of us, we probably would not even have had a recommendation.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of my colleagues – I hope all my colleagues – feel that we are dealing with a very unsatisfactory situation. In effect, we are constantly adding to the burden of European Union legislation on the environment, with the very good intention of improving our environment, but the Member States are signing up to legislation which they are in many cases unable to put in place in the form in which they adopt it. They may in the end be able to reach the standards that they agree to, but we have to ask how long this will take. In some instances the Commission is still very much in the dark about whether Member States are really complying with legislation because the Member States are very slow in telling the Commission about the state of implementation in the reports that they are obliged to send to Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">So, if you want to put it at its most dramatic, the European Parliament finds itself complicit in a deceit on the people of Europe. We are telling them that we have very forward-looking environmental legislation but in instances such as the nitrates directive and the urban waste water directive we find that in fact Member States are taking much longer than required to comply with legislation. Indeed the case of the fine that the Greek Government is still paying to Brussels for failing to comply with a waste directive shows that it can be a quarter of a century before a Member State is even taken to court for failing to comply with legislation effectively adopted in the 1970s.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament felt that the way to deal with this was to take what was originally a recommendation on environmental inspections and use it as a way of enforcing common standards throughout the Member States by upgrading it to a directive which Member States would, we had hoped, want to take more notice of. As I say, the Member States were against this. It was rather enlightening to go to the meeting of the Conciliation Committee where it was quite clear that some Member State delegations were not interested in the subject at all, let alone in that particular meeting that we went to that night. This is a situation in which only a minority of Member States are really interested in compliance. For most it comes very low down on their list of priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">So I am afraid we have settled in a sense for second best. We still have hopes that we will be able to return to this issue. Indeed we intend doing so because, although we have a recommendation, within it we have a revision clause which will mean that the Commission comes back to Parliament within the lifetime of this Parliament – I think I am right in saying in 2003 – in order that we can try to assess how the Member States are performing in relation to this particular recommendation.</p>
<p class="contents">That would mean that Mr Davies and I, if we are spared and have managed to survive foot-and-mouth, BSE and everything else that seems to be afflicting the United Kingdom, will be able to make sure that we move to a directive if we feel that the recommendation is getting us nowhere. We hope that we will have the support of the Commission in making that reassessment in 2003 a really serious exercise. I am sure that Mrs Wallström, who is very keen on getting better compliance, will want to support us in that.</p>
<p class="contents">We also managed to get into the recommendation the idea that the reports on inspection must be publicly available within two months of their completion and submission to the Commission. We want to make sure that more people in Europe are interested in the issue of compliance – more people throughout the Member States, not simply in a selection of the northern ones. And finally, might I draw attention to the fact that, although we could not formally record this, we have said that we will put a standard clause into directives that will simply say "Member States undertake to have in place, by the date of entry into force of the directive, systems of environmental inspection which will enable them fully to comply with the provisions of this directive". We do not see how any Member State can possibly oppose that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe the parliamentary delegation to the Conciliation Committee fought very hard before reluctantly consenting to the result of the conciliation process, and that is also how my group will vote in the Chamber. Nevertheless, we cannot be satisfied with the joint text. The European Parliament wanted a binding directive rather than polite recommendations. The Member States dug their heels in and must now take responsibility for the stagnation of environmental policy in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">At the present time, proceedings for infringement or non-observance of current environmental legislation are pending in more than 150 cases. As much as this Parliament rejoices at every step forward in the field of environmental policy, we also have every reason to doubt the sincerity of the Union’s commitment to the environment if it omits the most important step, namely the application of its policy, the enforcement of its rules. The best legislation is worthless if it is not enforced.</p>
<p class="contents">The conditions we imposed, namely the coordination of inspections between Member States in cases of cross-border environmental crimes and the publication of inspection reports two months after each inspection, represent an improvement. But Parliament’s most important demand, in my opinion, relates to the revision clause which Mrs Jackson described, the clause requiring the Commission to present a report to Parliament after two years on the application and impact of the recommendation and, should it prove to be a dead letter – which I fully expect it to be – to present a proposal for a directive too.</p>
<p class="contents">Since I do not quite trust the very wishy-washy wording of this revision clause, which now states that the Commission should present such a report as soon as possible, rather than in two years’ time, I must ask Commissioner Wallström to reaffirm her determination to ensure that this report will be on the table in slightly more than two years from now. I do hope, of course, that the report will provide evidence that the recommendation has borne fruit, that our environmental legislation has become more effective, that the situation has improved. At the present time, however, although I have heard the message, I am still lacking in faith. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report gave us the opportunity to take some practical action. It seems to me that for more than a year and a half we have had a dialogue of the deaf and the result is that we have achieved nothing worth having. I do not blame the Commissioner who inherited this from her predecessor, but the recommendation from the Commission was deeply flawed and thoroughly unpopular with Member States, who supported it only because it was non-binding and could therefore be ignored.</p>
<p class="contents">The view of Member States, that it was too prescriptive, came to be shared by many Members of this Parliament. But there was never an opportunity to have a serious discussion between the Council and Parliament about the best means of achieving what should have been shared objectives. Perhaps this was a failing on our part to take some kind of initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the radical yet eminently sensible compromise proposal made by Mrs Jackson and backed by the Conciliation Committee gained no support either from the Presidency or the Commission. So maybe no meeting of minds was possible. But the commitment secured from the Commission to consider introducing some kind of directive in a couple of years' time, while welcome, given the Commissioner's declared support for ensuring that we are enforcing rules and laws effectively, should have been coming any way and adds nothing to previous statements.</p>
<p class="contents">I regard this entire law-making exercise as a failure. There was simply no proper dialogue between the institutions. I feel we have let down our constituents across the European Union. With hindsight, I believe it would have been better for Parliament to have let the conciliation process collapse. The Liberal Group will be voting against adoption of this recommendation tomorrow. I just hope we can all do better next time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is one of the most important issues we have to work on in the next few years and that is also why it is given as one of the priorities in the Sixth Environmental Action Programme. We have to concentrate on implementation. I will, of course, come back to Parliament and if necessary introduce legislation, the so-called guillotine approach. We will put pressure on Member States. I think when people come to the conciliation process they put a lot of time, effort and energy into it and they want to agree, so it is worthwhile.</p>
<p class="contents">It will help if the citizens of Europe are kept informed about implementation and we are proposing different ways of doing that. Any more ideas on how we might achieve this and keep up the pressure on the Member States will be welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">The difference of opinion was on the legal instrument that would best meet the objectives. I am glad that we have reached an agreement on the form and wording of the instrument by taking on board Parliament's amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I also support Mrs Jackson's suggestion that this sentence should be inserted in all the proposals from now on. It is a good reminder for the Member States. The amendments will tighten up the requirements in the recommendation. For instance, reports on site visits should be available within two months of the inspection taking place. We now have to ensure that the recommendation is fully implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to acknowledge IMPEL's role. Its work on minimum criteria for inspections helped in the drafting of the recommendation and they are a very important instrument. IMPEL now has a mandate under the recommendation to review inspectorates, inspection practices and best practices in the training and qualification of inspectors.</p>
<p class="contents">The recommendation would now require Member States to report to the Commission on the operation within two years. The Commission will then consider whether to put forward a proposal for a comprehensive directive covering the inspection's life cycle. We will definitely come back to this and I hope that together we will be able to improve the implementation of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> on the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
