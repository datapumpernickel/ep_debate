<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Velzen (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> This is actually rather a sad moment. It will perhaps be after midnight, and one of the most important subjects, affecting hundreds of millions of jobs, is therefore being moved into the night by the Presidency of this Parliament. I hope that this is not symbolic, Mr President, for the future of the spring European Council that is to take place shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">I must, however, say something about the re-use and the commercial exploitation of public information and, in the first place, it is worth stressing once again that the sole purpose of this directive is to bring about minimum harmonisation. Minimum harmonisation because otherwise nothing will come of any pan-European content services in the public information field. We know from research, in the United States for example, that there is great potential in, as it were, marketing existing public information. This is especially true for the very small businesses, the SMEs, which as a result can create a significant number of jobs, and that is precisely what we want. In the United States we have already seen that this can be done exceptionally well by stimulating re-use, by making this information available at marginal cost. And the first political question of course is why are we not doing the same in Europe?</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that the so-called 3G sector, third generation mobile communication, is in serious difficulty and that we have seldom been in a position to transfer so much money from the private sector to the public sector. You must therefore at this point in particular try to give this 3G sector every possible chance. So I think it is extraordinarily wasteful if we make this information available again at a high price because it will mean that these content services will be unable to get off the ground. I strongly appeal to all our fellow MEPs not only to devote fine words to Lisbon but also actually to take action where they can, and this is a good example.</p>
<p class="contents">There was a lot of discussion as to whether or not cultural institutions, universities, research institutions, etc, should be excluded under this directive. Originally I wanted them included, but in the end we found a compromise to remove them from it and therefore I do not understand why Amendment No 33 is still necessary. I make an urgent appeal to our socialist friends to withdraw Amendment No 33 because it was originally a compromise amendment but is no longer necessary because I have made the concession.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, there are still Member States that are trying to build in an extra filter to ensure that everyone has to apply for licences again, etc. This puts an extra barrier in your way, an extra step that you have to take and, for the very small businesses in particular, that is extraordinarily wasteful, so I would say that this must not happen either.</p>
<p class="contents">In the report we make a distinction between other information and basic information. This basic information is information that every citizen needs to be able to function in a normal constitutional state. You really must be able to make this information available to the citizen free of charge so that this citizen can exercise his normal rights as a citizen. This additional information must, moreover, be made available at marginal cost. Only then will we be acting progressively. Why should not this Parliament occasionally be the driving force behind a new development in the field of the information society? I therefore also make an urgent appeal to our fellow MEPs to follow me in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">I am now going to take off my rapporteur’s hat and make some remarks as a member of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats about Mrs Auroi’s and Mr Paasilinna’s report. First of all I want to thank both rapporteurs very much for their work, their sharing of responsibility and above all their effort in producing such an excellent report. We all know that the 3G sector is in great difficulty – I made reference to it just now – and what is at issue now of course is ensuring that we in Parliament give a signal to the forthcoming European Council so that measures are taken there that take us a step further forward. We are thinking of measures that are aimed at restoring the confidence of the citizens, but also of the investors so that people know what is going to happen in that field. I think for example that it would be useful to work towards a situation in which the Member States not only, as at the moment, permit network sharing and thanks to the Commissioner for dedicating himself so much to this but in which it is also realised that 3G is quite a different product from 2G. It is highly complex. This innovative chain that has to be developed requires a very great deal of investment that the operators cannot provide alone. So you have to promote collaboration between the operators because otherwise in the end it is the customers – you, Mr President, and I – who will be the ones to suffer.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore make an urgent appeal to the Commissioner to use guidelines to make collaboration between the operators<span class="italic"> </span>and competition between the services that the operators are going to provide possible. Because if those devices, those lovely mobile handsets, cannot communicate with one another because there is no interoperability, then we will not make any progress and that is, I think, a crucial point.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think it is important to bring the regions where 3G is already in development close together because people learn from one another. This is also a way of preventing people encountering the same pitfalls. It is very important, Mr President, that we stimulate research so that the present research in relation to 3G does not become concentrated in Japan in particular. We must not look to the US, we must look at our great setbacks in the field of competition with Japan.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, Mr Paasilinna has of course rightly laid stress on the fact that we must have a very robust eEuropean plan that is good for the forthcoming European Council. I am in favour of prompt and harmonised implementation of the new regulatory framework and I am very pleased that the European Commission has today finally launched the Cyber Security Task Unit. Not before time, because we all know that security is a major concern. Bravo to the Commission that it has actually arrived. I think that we have a package that we can take back to the citizen, that we are moving the 3G sector a long way forward again and that we have a good answer as far as the knowledge economy is concerned because, in this way, we can move Lisbon another step forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Auroi (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President March 2002, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is effectively eEurope<span class="italic"> </span>that is in the hot seat this evening, if I may say so, and I shall in particular address the full roll-out of third-generation mobile communications.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate has been very poorly organised, Commissioner, for we began with the Van Velzen report, which is mainly complementary insofar as it concerns information that will be added to third-generation GSMs, such as meteorological information or information on roads provided by the public sector. All things considered, it does not matter very much since, furthermore, the aim of third-generation GSMs is also to avoid the digital divide, which Mr Paasilinna will strongly criticise. All in all, therefore, it is perfectly normal for us to have this kind of joint debate.</p>
<p class="contents">It should perhaps be pointed out that the March 2002 Barcelona Council stated: ‘Technological convergence affords all business and citizens new opportunities for access to the Information Society. Digital television and third-generation mobile communications (3G) will play a key role in providing widespread access to interactive services’. This sector of the third generation, however, seems to be in difficulties. Perhaps, in order to avoid the digital divide and to avoid breaking the continuity of eEurope, it should be said that 3G services must be established within a global framework, but we must also add the important issues of consumer health and environmental quality. We must also learn from the experience of the current GSM market in order to avoid reproducing the mistakes that might have been made in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">One key aspect of mobile telephony development is the interoperability of terminals. In this area, the Commission would point out that progress was made in the development of 3G terminals in 2002. The first models are ready. They are also ready in China, and I am pointing this out to you because we received this information last week. Furthermore, the existing 2G networks have been modernised to make them 2.5G. Some technical problems may persist, but we can say that everything is working.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the market situation, the current availability of 3G services in Europe is not clear. They are available in Japan, but the operators are confident, and, after all, since around 50 operators are capable of offering these services, the problem of competition is solved. It can exist.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to regulatory issues, the Commission would point out that the procedure for granting 3G licences has begun in all the countries of the European Union. This number of licences is sufficient. There is therefore no problem as far as the competitive environment is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Following discussions with the parties concerned with the introduction of 3G mobile communications, a consensus was reached on three points. First of all, the introduction phase for 3G services does not require legislative intervention. Market forces must be allowed to take effect. Secondly, 3G communications will, in the long term, have to become one of the platforms for services provided by a global Information Society. Lastly, the public authorities must provide constant support in the introduction process. Three factors have therefore been identified: a stable, harmonised, transparent regulatory environment, taking account of consumer interests; the proactive supporting role that the Union can play and, thirdly, long-term initiatives, taking account of what has happened in the 3G communications sector, in particular with a view to enlargement. We therefore need to increase coordination of all these decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that no changes will be required in the granting of licences and that the period of validity of licences will not be altered in the short term. The legislation does, however, require clarification in terms of network infrastructure sharing.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur, I therefore feel that the Commission has judged the matter correctly in terms of the economy, but that a number of points should have been added. This technology is expensive and could be rivalled, for example, by WiFi, which means that today, it is not clear whether 3G communications will take over part of what information technology is currently doing or if, on the contrary, information technology will gradually replace what GSMs are doing. Ultimately, it is the market that will decide, but it is good to raise the question and be prepared.</p>
<p class="contents">Generally speaking, access to 3G services must be clear to all and users with difficulties must be protected; for example, children and people with disabilities might need specific packages. Lastly, secure payment must be protected, or the consumer will have no confidence in this system.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now discuss the precautionary principle, which Members from the right, furthermore, wanted to dispose of. I want to discuss the health problems that can arise, for they are now raised by numerous scientists. A consensual request was made that the requirements of the World Health Organisation should at least be respected at European level. We are told that this is now the case, but it still remains to be verified.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the construction of 3G aerial repeaters should take place with due respect for the environment and land use planning. The Member States will ensure that authorisations from the land use planning departments are subject to a clear procedure and a public enquiry. Four to sixteen times more aerials are needed for third-generation communications than for 2G. Colocation or aerial sharing, as recommended by the Commission, is therefore extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, regulatory stability will enable this technology to develop smoothly if the European Union gives the same importance to social and environmental parameters as to economic parameters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Paasilinna (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FI)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would in fact like to thank all the rapporteurs for their excellent levels of cooperation. We are now giving the Council a clear message, and, hopefully, an impetus no longer to dally in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to speak more about the report drawn up by my colleague, Mr Van Velzen. It is a very important start and represents a crucial change in the development of the information society. It is perhaps a good idea to have confidence in the words he spoke, which were truly appropriate. The information society sector is a major employer and a factor which unites us all in Europe as a whole in a completely new way. Its development will bring with it significant economic, political and cultural opportunities. Confidence in the sector, however, has plummeted and we know the reason why, as we have spoken about it so many times. It is the result of auctions and general uncertainty.</p>
<p class="contents">Although digitalisation and networking offer a wide variety of opportunities for development, they have also led to a worldwide gulf between the people of prosperous countries and developing countries. Furthermore, the gender divide, for example with regard to students, is huge and is particularly pronounced in the rural areas of the Union and in the developing countries. In addition the introduction of information technology has led to the restructuring of job descriptions: many jobs have gone and some middle-aged people have had to give up work. Furthermore, those groups which are in a weaker position are at risk of becoming doubly discriminated against. They are being left outside the information society. I do not see any easy alternatives here: it is our biggest challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">The network has also become a political implement. It increases opportunities for civil action and hopefully also opportunities for influence. I am pleased with the Commission’s eEurope 2005 Action Plan, as with it we will increase investment, aim to create jobs, and give everyone the opportunity to participate in the information society. I also urge the Commission to speed up the introduction of third generation mobile communications and eliminate the technical and administrative barriers there are in the sector. The Member States themselves should adhere to a flexible approach to the purchase of frequencies and the costs incurred in creating the necessary infrastructure, and do so speedily in a new way. The Member States should offer their citizens sufficient Internet time, which is to say participation in the information society.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should research the possibilities of developing voice-controlled services. These will shortly be available and will make it easier for all of us to use the Internet. I would also ask the Commission to investigate the possibilities of adult education in the sector and whether a general diploma might also be required to move on to the next stages of the technology. Likewise, Member States should support SMEs and help them get online, as they represent major potential for increased employment. Perhaps there would be a need too for funds to be established in the Member States to help socially excluded groups to become integrated into the networked society.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion it is good that the Commission has now established a cybersecurity task force. It is now three years since the Lisbon strategy was created and it has met with political and economic uncertainty. We are seeing developments, but they are not fast enough or adequately coordinated. In the last six years we have seen around a million new jobs created a year, although last year the figure was only around half a million. What sort of economic know-how can be achieved when training, education and research are neglected as much as they are today and many Member States do not observe agreed rules or implement agreed projects? Commissioner, what could you do so that certain Member States do not slow down development in this sector? It might turn out that a number of Member States will establish their own sort of ‘Information Society Europe’ among themselves unless we involve all Member States in this development.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I would say that the transference of social information and knowledge to the network in digitised form, which Mr Van Velzen’s report highlighted, will create a completely new stage in the development of the information society. It will create work and opportunities, but problems too. The protection of privacy is not the least of these, but when society’s functions are online we will be in a situation where we can say that the information society has come about insofar as we are all in it together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Khanbhai (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="italic">–</span> Mr President, first of all thank you to Commissioner Liikanen, it is a pleasure to see you here. I always think of him as the Commissioner for innovation who is friendly to SMEs, and I have certainly found him to be both of those, so we are very lucky to have him.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon European Council dream for the EU to be the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010 cannot be realised unless we stimulate and I mean <span class="italic">stimulate</span> SMEs. SMEs drive economic growth; they train people with poor skills; they identify local needs and respond by producing or processing the products required. They create employment, wealth and security for the local community.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the hindrances, difficulties and bottlenecks facing SMEs in the EU? Why are they not growing as fast as those in the USA? Excessive red tape, high direct and indirect taxation, expensive and inadequate access to loans and grants, insufficient allowance for 'upskilling' workers and a lack of sponsored apprenticeships.</p>
<p class="contents">Papas and Mamas in Europe in their fifties and sixties own and manage their businesses traditionally. They are reluctant to invest in new technology because, firstly, they suspect that the investment will not offer sufficient advantage. Secondly, they do not understand the scope and function of new technology in increasing productivity and expanding sales. Thirdly, they are concerned about security of supply, quality, payment and legal liability.</p>
<p class="contents">My report has analysed the problems facing SMEs and offers a programme of action to stimulate them, so that they can compete globally. I would like Commissioner Liikanen to take very careful note of this summary, which is what I think the EU needs to do and do now.</p>
<p class="contents">- Review existing regulation of the e-economy and cut drastically whatever burdens small businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">- Reduce the administrative burdens on businesses by simplifying data collection, especially tax collection.</p>
<p class="contents">- Cut red tape, especially for self-employed people.</p>
<p class="contents">- Tackle on-line security issues by reinforcing the dependability and reliability of networks used by enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">- Establish easy and affordable access to legal advice.</p>
<p class="contents">- Encourage cross-border trade to ensure a European e-economy. That is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">- Use benchmarking to promote and establish best practice, to integrate SMEs in the e-economy.</p>
<p class="contents">- Allow Member States to offer low interest loans and tax incentives to support SMEs. I know Commissioner Monti might have a problem with that but I think it is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">- Establish close cooperation between business, the educational sector and government agencies in order to close the IT skills gap.</p>
<p class="contents">- One of the most important aspects is to offer financial incentives to the unemployed and the elderly, those who are retired. I am not asking Member States to change their rules on retirement, but I am asking for the EU to consider that people who are already retired should have financial incentives to train and acquire skills. When they work using those skills they should not be taxed at all, that is my preference. You might wish to impose a nominal tax, but preferably no tax at all. This actually reduces the import of labour, and also immediately pumps in money to people who are likely to spend their money in rural areas and therefore boost rural economies.</p>
<p class="contents">- To offer financial incentives to technical support companies to allow SMEs affordable access. This is one of the weakest things that we have in the EU: people are quite happy to buy equipment and technology, but where is the technical support if anything goes wrong? It is very expensive and very unreliable and we need to offer financial incentives in that respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope we will soon have every EU citizen wearing what I would like to call the ‘Hand C’ not a ‘PC’, a wristwatch that is a combination of a PC, mobile phone and an LCD screen that will enable us to communicate audiovisually, process data, buy, sell and pay by voicemail, watch any sport and listen to our favourite music. Technology can offer us this today, Commissioner Liikanen, let us produce more with ease, let us have less stress and more fun. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I dream of a day when we can discuss this issue in the daytime - it may come.</p>
<p class="contents">Information and communication technologies are a powerful source of growth and productivity gains, which contribute to improving our living standards. That is why the recovery of the sector is so important at this point in time.</p>
<p class="contents">The five reports which the House will deal with today and tomorrow give us the opportunity to keep the political momentum towards the achievement of the Lisbon agenda, as many honourable Members have said today. These reports also contribute to the process of building confidence in the ICT sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me first of all to thank all the rapporteurs, Mr Van Velzen, Mrs Auroi, Mr Paasilinna, Mr Khanbhai and Mrs Read, as well as the shadow rapporteurs and political groups for their thorough work on these Commission communications and proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased to have the opportunity to inform you that the Commission adopted four important documents today. These are: a communication on the situation in the telecoms sector; a draft regulation establishing a European Network and Information Security Agency, as has been mentioned here; the final report on eEurope 2002 and the Recommendation on Relevant Markets. I hope you find them in your computers when you return to your offices.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me reiterate our common commitment to an efficient and timely implementation of the new regulatory framework. The framework will stimulate investment and thus promote facility-based competition, which is, in the medium to long-term, the best guarantee for sustained consumer benefits, innovation, and investment. With the recommendation on relevant markets we aim to give legal certainty and to help restore confidence to the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me come back to the themes of tonight and say a few words first on the report on 3G. Mrs Auroi’s report, as adopted by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, sends an important signal at a time when the first 3G services are about to be launched. At this juncture, 3G deployment is clearly a priority. We need to encourage solutions which favour a quick deployment of networks while also accommodating environmental needs.</p>
<p class="contents">In today’s communication on the situation in the telecoms sector, the Commission calls for a series of actions to overcome barriers to 3G deployment. Amongst these is the clarification of network infrastructure sharing, the importance of which was also emphasised in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Information to the citizens on the health aspects related to mobile communications and continued research are important. Scientific findings need to be made broadly available. The Commission will promote the diffusion of information, for example through a specific web site. The World Health Organisation is the leading authority in this area, and we are working closely with it.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to stress the importance of 3G in the context of access to open and interoperable platforms. This is to increase consumers’ choice and thus to contribute to the establishment of an information society for all. Inclusiveness is an overriding principle in eEurope 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is committed to pursuing action toward openness and interoperability of platforms, as so clearly requested by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me briefly reiterate the main objectives of the eEurope 2005 action plan. eEurope sets out to stimulate the demand-supply cycle by, on the demand side, promoting content, services and applications, where there is a crucial role for online public services – eGovernment, eHealth and eLearning – as well as for eBusiness.</p>
<p class="contents">This will stimulate and is stimulated by the supply side, by enabling the widespread availability and use of multi-platform and secure broadband.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital to ensure an inclusive information society. Therefore we are promoting multi-platform access which includes digital television, 3G mobile, PCs, kiosks and whatever terminals are available.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to see that Mr Paasilinna's report gives such strong support to the main ideas of the eEurope Action Plan. We fully share the view that guaranteeing broadband connections at an affordable price, which is essential for a competitive and dynamic economy, requires decisive actions from Member State governments.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Paasilinna asked how we could accelerate access for the Member States. We continue to carry out rigorous reporting and benchmarking of the activities. At the same time, we have launched two presentations of European best practice in eGovernment and eHealth. We will nominate these best practices and ensure they are widely diffused among the public authorities in all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In our recently adopted communication on the situation in the telecoms sector we call upon Member States to commit to putting their national broadband strategy in place by the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Khanbhai’s report on the impact of eEconomy notes, SMEs are key drivers of economic growth and should be encouraged actively to engage in the eEconomy. I broadly share the views presented in Mr Khanbhai's report, for example, the need for SMEs to have easy access to legal advice on applicable law and on ICT and eBusiness skills. We agree that European businesses, and especially SMEs, need support in ‘going digital’. The Commission is currently working together with the Member States to set a new policy framework for eBusiness policies for SMEs, including potential quantitative targets.</p>
<p class="contents">Network security has become a major policy concern and therefore a central issue in the eEurope 2005 action plan. Parliament’s position on this matter of October last year was very much appreciated. As I mentioned earlier, the Commission today adopted a draft regulation on the Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also committed, through eEurope 2005, to promote a wider access to and greater participation in the benefits of the information society, particularly for disadvantaged groups. In addition to the specific measures foreseen by the MODINIS programme itself, the Commission intends to promote and sustain several initiatives which will be organised in the context of the European Year for Disabled and which will follow from its earlier communication on website accessibility.</p>
<p class="contents">eEurope 2005 will be implemented in part through MODINIS and, though it is not part of our debate today, I would like also to thank Parliament for the support given to the Commission proposal, in particular as far as the budget is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to the piece of legislation which we now have on the table: the directive on the re-use of public sector information. As Mr Van Velzen said today and as he underlines in his report, the content is essential for further development of the information society. The message here is clear and it comes at a time when the financial constraints in the sector bring attention to the fact that public sector information is a key content resource throughout information society services. The key elements are transparency of procedures and of conditions for re-use, non-discrimination and fair competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive will stimulate the creation of information services based upon, or incorporating, public sector information. It is important for the content industries and also for the telecoms sector, which needs to find ways to generate content for 3G services.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully share the opinion of Mr Van Velzen that the operators should work together to create a marketplace. We need cooperation and interoperability to create a market which can convince the consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I wish to thank all the Members for this important debate and for their contribution to the whole process since we started work on the telecoms framework.</p>

<p class="contents">The promotion of free computer programs is an option increasingly used by public administrations and which democratises access to and the use of public documents and data. In fact, if we make the documents available in a format not linked to the use of specific computer programs involving payment, we reduce the discrimination relating to the wealth of the users.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to promote the use of the information by people with diminished sensory capacity, for example through a textual description of the graphs and pictures contained in the documents. Furthermore, the advertising of all generally accessible documents, including those relating to judicial and administrative procedures, must reach the public sector. This is a fundamental instrument for the development of the right of citizens to knowledge and a fundamental principle of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">This objective is applicable to institutions at all levels, local, national and international, and furthermore it is necessary for the public administrations, whatever their institutional level, to promote and support the reuse of the information provided.</p>
<p class="contents">I would end by stressing that we naturally believe that all these principles should also apply to the European institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Before I do anything else, of course, I should like to thank the rapporteur very much for her draft report and also for her willingness to incorporate into it amendments proposed by other Members.</p>
<p class="contents">The mobile communications industry is in a bad way. In comparison with Japan, 3G technology is coming on stream only very slowly. We must also do all we can at European level to support this sector. This is about having reliable framework conditions, which means consistent implementation and application of the telecommunications package, exercising restraint where regulation is concerned and of course also using common resources. All of this is, as you know, also provided for in the Commission's paper.</p>
<p class="contents">This being the case, I do find it rather regrettable that prices for international roaming and call termination should be regulated, as is already the case in the United Kingdom, for example. In this regard, I am also curious, Commissioner, about the recommendation on the relevant markets, which you also mentioned briefly and which is – if I am not mistaken – to be presented tomorrow. Although consumers benefit from the reasonable charges that regulation brings, they only do so in the short term. In the long term it is to the detriment of everyone if we do not make every effort to strengthen the sector, to promote 3G services and thus also to create jobs in the medium term.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, a broad majority of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy supported this report and the promotion of 3G. This report is a clear vote in favour of the introduction of third generation mobile communications in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to offer a few thoughts on the Van Velzen report on the re-use and exploitation of public-sector documents. Of course I must first express my very special thanks to Mr Van Velzen for the work that he has done as rapporteur. He has displayed a great deal of commitment to his report and once again this has borne fruit in the form of a good report.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the majority of the Committee on Industry I too share the view that in principle public information should be made available for the benefit of all parties. The authorities in the Member States have huge quantities of information that has been collected over long periods of time. Members of the public and businesses should also benefit from this treasure trove of information, whose commercial value is difficult to put a figure on. I am confident that general access to public information will give a significant boost to growth, competitiveness and employment within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">But despite all of the agreement expressed in the debate so far, I am still missing an essential point. It will come as no surprise if I repeat what I have already said on many occasions in the committee: must Europe really take action here? Is not the issue of determining the conditions under which and the extent to which public information is made available a matter for the Member States?</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I do not see that there is any legal basis for harmonisation in this field. The old saying is true here that not every problem in Europe is a problem for Europe. This is also why several of the German members of my group will be voting against the report. I might also remind you that the issue of delimiting competences is also proving to be significant in the debate that is currently ongoing in the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are always going to have such little regard for the competences issue here in the committees and in our day-to-day parliamentary work then I do not think that this bodes well. I would crave your indulgence when I say that although I agree with the content of this report, I, along with my fellow German members of my group will not be supporting it in the final vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also welcome my fellow veterans of information technology debates. We might have to award ourselves a Lisbon medal for stamina at some stage. I take your point about the timing of this debate. We in this Parliament should be ashamed that the signal sent out to those few who are listening at this time of night is one of a lack of seriousness on our part. We need to join together and make serious protests in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, first of all, to comment on Mr Van Velzen's report on reuse of public information. I commend him on the amount of work he has put into this.</p>
<p class="contents">What is important about this proposal? First of all, it is important that progress be made. What has become very clear to me as I have shadowed this report is what an important economic engine reuse of public information is going to be. We need to make sure that progress is made on that. Secondly, it is important to support the exemptions included in the Commission proposal for universities, libraries and museums across the European Union. We want that exemption to continue.</p>
<p class="contents">The third thing of importance is to ensure a reasonable return on investment. I have listened carefully to what the rapporteur had to say. I want the amendment in the name of my group – Amendment No 33 – to stand. It clarifies Parliament's position. I hope this will be supported. A reasonable return on investment is important and should be taken into consideration. I understand there is likely to be a major second reading and quite a lot of work to be done at Council level. No doubt we will be able to return to this at a later stage.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn to the report by Mr Paasilinna who, with his customary thoroughness and ability to make practical proposals, has come up with some well-thought-out ideas on education, health, disabled citizens and the elderly, and the importance of ensuring access for rural areas and small businesses. All of that is to be commended.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Khanbhai, who does not seem to be here, ended his speech by saying that he wanted to have fun. I am not sure how much fun he thinks is associated with debates held at this time of night on this subject. He is right in one respect: as important as this for business, it is also important in terms of the quality of people's lives and what they do with their leisure time.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Auroi had a very difficult task. I congratulate her. In terms of her work, I should like to stress the importance of 3G companies and technologies being soundly managed and well run. That has not always been the case on a global scale. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Plooij-van Gorsel (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Liberal Group I congratulate all the rapporteurs on reports that in my view are relevant for the development of eEurope and an information society for all. With regard to the Van Velzen report there are two things I would like to stress.</p>
<p class="contents">Re-use and commercial exploitation of public information, as proposed by the rapporteur, will lead to a real information society for all. Where basic information such as the wording of acts and jurisprudence is concerned, this must be made available to the European citizen free of charge. After all, as a taxpayer he or she has already paid for this information. We do not allow our citizens to pay for the same thing twice. Furthermore, good information is necessary for the functioning of a democratic constitutional state. In my opinion we as a Parliament must fight hard for the rights of the citizens. Public information must therefore be made available to the citizens free of charge or at marginal cost for reproduction and distribution. As a group we fully support the line of rapporteur Van Velzen.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to my second point. Some Members are in favour of allowing certain government institutions to charge a reasonable return on investment because their income comes in part from the publication of their data, such as weather forecasts or maps. Of course this is possible where added value is a factor. There is provision for this in the exceptions. The unthinking inclusion in the directive of allowing a reasonable return on investment to be made seems highly dangerous to me. Because the question is, what is reasonable? Is it 10, 20 or 30% profit and do our citizens have to pay that? It is also important that the same conditions prevail in all the Member States. Subsidiarity in this case is fundamentally wrong. This is because we need a level playing field, only then can the internal market for public information be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">To go through that last point: this directive must promote the reuse and the exploitation of public information. The government must therefore act as a booster, that is as a <span class="italic">launching customer</span>, to make this information available at low cost to give small and medium-sized businesses the opportunity to exploit this information so that a good market develops for it, as in the United States. Because a market that is controlled by monopolists as now does not lead to more jobs and greater prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to 3G. It has already been said that the transfer of billions from the private sector to the public sector has been disastrous for the mobile telecoms sector. This means that we do not need to impose any unnecessary regulation now. Intervention may however be necessary to guarantee competition. Even then though we must ensure a level playing field. No unilateral measures by Member States to lighten the load of the mobile operators. We cannot have a situation in which France gives discounts on licences and other Member States renew licences. I think that the Commission must bring forward clear measures to guarantee that level playing field.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a word about the Khanbhai and Paasilinna reports, because they make a contribution to the eEurope that we here in the Parliament favour, to ensure that citizens and businesses can profit fully from the information society. This has happened too little to date. It is true that in Lisbon in 2000 we agreed that we must be the most competitive and dynamic knowledge economy in 2010, but these appear to be nothing more than fine words that require urgent conversion into deeds.</p>
<p class="contents">In practice it seems that over and over again the Member States are falling back on their own national hobby horses, be it a question of the European patent or of access to public information. That is why it is good that the Commission is keeping its finger on the pulse and keeping the minds of the leaders of the Member States on the matter. The basic principles are excellent, but when it comes to the implementation of the applications, such as e-health, e-government and e-learning, then it is shameful to see what is actually happening. I wish us all, Parliament and Commission, success in the realisation of a better eEurope. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The guilty parties are the governments of those countries that organised radio spectrum auctions and transferred the money companies in the sector had invested to themselves. The action taken by the public authorities to alleviate this slump in investment has not been sufficiently effective. Authorisation has been granted for installations of equipment to coexist side by side for common use, but that is all. Consequently, the slump in investment in third generation mobile communications continues, and the pious hopes for the ambitious targets set in Feira, Lisbon, Barcelona and Seville are not realised. More realistic targets should be set.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I have made my protests I would like to say thank you. Mr Paasilinna’s report has focused attention on an information society for all, and on the important reason for the Action Plan: the information society must be brought within the reach of everyone, and I mean everyone. That is democracy. This democracy must be promoted through public investment. In addition to the technical tools and fast connections we have to give attention to user instructions and guidance, because equipment is no use if the information society actors cannot use it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind Mr Van Velzen of something in the explanatory statement of his report, which mentions that for the work of public institutions to continue it is essential that they can also calculate a charge for information provided, to offset the investment needed to produce certain databases. Basic information services must be free of charge or at least inexpensive, but historical investment must also be taken into account in the production costs involved in the re-use of, for example, land register, museum, university and research institute databases.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group supports the amendment tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists which takes this matter into consideration, and we hope than Mr Van Velzen can show his support for preserving general use services with user charges without them having to be financed out of taxes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is one of the great issues of the future and one that offers the greatest opportunities, multiplied by our common efforts. It is not by chance that following the action plan <span class="italic">e</span>Europe 2002, we are already looking towards <span class="italic">e</span>Europe 2005, specifically in order to fulfil the Lisbon and Feira European Councils, held under the presidency of my country and later on, those of Barcelona and Seville.</p>
<p class="contents">What we want, it should be remembered, is to make the European Union the most competitive society in the world and it is also for this reason that the action plan <span class="italic">e</span>Europe 2005 was drawn up, with the purpose of providing an environment that favours private investment and job creation, of boosting productivity, modernising public services and giving everyone the opportunity to participate in the global information society.</p>
<p class="contents">In this joint debate, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Paasilinna on his magnificent work, which is clearly reflected in the consensus with which this report has been received here in plenary. In particular I appreciated his approach to providing the technical means necessary to implement these aims, for example extending bandwidth and multichannel distribution, and on the delicate problem of security of information. Moving onto the issue of the re-use and commercial exploitation of public sector documents, I understand and share the vision proposed by Mr Van Velzen, who recommends a broadly streamlining approach. I also think that everything concerned with basic information, related to the democratic rule of law, must be available free of charge and the remaining information should be available at a marginal cost that would not exceed the aggregate costs of their reproduction and dissemination, without prejudice to the specific system to be defined by the public cultural sector for obvious reasons of intellectual and artistic copyright.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I should like to refer briefly to the report by Mr Khanbhai, in order to congratulate him too on his work and to express the wish that the Commission enjoys full success in the actions it is recommending to ensure that EU businesses can harness the potential benefits of the <span class="italic">e</span>Economy. Speeding up the construction of a clear and predictable framework for <span class="italic">e</span>commerce, promoting the full participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in the economy, improving the availability of venture capital and market finance, etc., are several actions intended to make the aim of an information society for all a reality and to ensure that in this crucial field too, the ambitious aims of the Lisbon strategy are pursued and achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important and good that we have gathered together so many excellent rapporteurs. I thank them all for tackling different aspects of the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">I reflect on the Commissioner's news that he has now given us another four reports to work on. We need to think about the most efficient way of making an input into the process. I congratulate Mr Van Velzen and Mr Paasilinna, who are both here tonight, on the initiative of the hearing we had the other week in which the Commissioner participated. We have a shared interest in moving the knowledge economy forward. What we are talking about today is the tools, the means and the framework in which we do that.</p>
<p class="contents">I have detected a bit of gloom among a number of colleagues. However, it is worth reflecting on the fact that within weeks we will have the first commercial third generation services in a major country. They will be provided by a new investor in the market, not in any way connected with any of the incumbent companies. A new investor has made a commercial investment in the marketplace.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us remind ourselves that the knowledge economy will be driven by private investment. That is where the bulk of the money is going to come from. The innovation and the technology are going to come from there as well. None of us know how and in what ways that technology is going to develop. But I think we can make one certain prediction: in a few years' time – about the most accurate forecast – we can expect that more people across Europe and the world will be connected to the Internet through a wireless device than through any other mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the importance of third generation. Let us not underestimate it. The move to the third generation is going to open up new markets for small and large businesses. It will also take cost out of businesses and will help businesses do things differently.</p>
<p class="contents">In Japan I have been to the research laboratories of DoCoMo, the Japanese telecoms company, where they have people inventing third generation commercial applications. Let us remember, above all, that what we must do as politicians is to let the market work. We have the right legal framework, but we have to make sure that the regulators do not intervene too soon or too harshly, and that they allow the creativity of the market to work. That is what has been successful in mobiles so far. That is what will be successful in third generation. That is what will power the knowledge economy. That is the most crucial message that we must all remember. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Perhaps, however, it is not just the market that will benefit, as has just been maintained. I believe that the benefit will lie in the development of this Information Society into a society that is equally focused on the human dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">The Information Society towards which we are moving is, without a doubt, a society that makes intensive use of information technology networks and produces a large amount of innovative communication services and information. It is also, however, a society in which the risks of exclusion are many. Ignoring these new developments at an individual level means taking the risk of suffering the consequences. Collectively, it means running the risk of whole segments of the population falling by the wayside.</p>
<p class="contents">This progress does also provide opportunities for development. Information and knowledge are the raw material in this society and the source of new wealth. Creating a link between them to make them accessible means increasing the existing potential for innovation. It is essential, however, for the European Union’s public policy to keep pace with the development of these markets and harness the benefits of this development. First and foremost, therefore, we must ensure that no citizen is excluded from the Information Society, since, to some extent, taking action with regard to public services and the public interest, in a way, involves using information technology in community and spatial development.</p>
<p class="contents">By making available to all the means for active participation and considering access to it as a citizens’ right and an obligation of general interest for the Member States, we can ensure that this Information Society is actually created for the citizens and around the citizens. A fair Information Society is therefore created methodically and patiently with decisive strategies. These are essential elements if we are to ensure that 2010 is not merely a technological mirage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Under different circumstances, this progress might translate into prosperity for society as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the capitalist system, however, scientific progress serves the market, not society. Science develops within a framework that requires what were once public-sector services – welfare, health, even culture and education – to be privatised and commercialised, throttled by the most competitive knowledge-based society decided on by the European Union in Lisbon. In short, it becomes a source of profit for the few, rather than a source of prosperity for the many.</p>
<p class="contents">Under these circumstances, the positive points in the Paasilinna report are of little practical value to disadvantaged social groups in danger of remaining excluded from the information society. If remote regions, disabled people and so on run these risks, what can we say about the mass unemployed, the mass underemployed, the even bigger mass of the poorly paid? What value, for example, are telematics health services or the famous European health card to these people? Who will be able to offer these services? The family doctor or the multinational companies that keep plundering the health sector? Will developing third generation services or European operational systems resolve the problem?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I must comment on the proposal to create a market in public records. In the European Union, where everything is bought and sold, where a radio frequency market and even a market in atmospheric pollutants and polluting rights have been created, we now have a public records market.</p>

This comes at a very important time. Many colleagues have already spoken with regard to the detail of what is contained in these reports and our aspirations for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Nowadays we often hear the claim that the world is at your fingertips: one click and you have access to the whole world. For a lot of people, that one click is like trying to climb Everest because they have not been brought up in the information technology age and they have no access to education or training to ensure that they can make use of this wonderful new tool. Also, a lot of the services that should be provided for people on the Internet are not provided. I speak in particular of people with disabilities, those who have hearing difficulties who could have text messages brought to them, or those who are blind who should have access to voice-activated messages. A lot of these new technologies are too expensive for ordinary users to get access to.</p>
<p class="contents">When we look at the overall context of this new vista of the knowledge economy and at the opportunities it presents, there are opportunities, but the risk that we run is, because of the huge amounts of money required in investment and infrastructure, unless governments and other agencies are involved, along with private financing, then peripheral and rural areas will lose out on access to these opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the school initiatives was that there should be one computer for every 15 pupils. Fortunately in Ireland we have succeeded in this respect: we are now above that average. We have one computer for every 12 pupils and every pupil has email access, Internet access and knowledge-based education in their school curriculum every day.</p>
<p class="contents">On the healthcare side, one important development that can take place is the delivery of health services to rural and peripheral areas. This particularly applies to islands, where it is not simple or easy to get the kind of technology or the kind of expertise that linking up with the nearest major hospital - with a consultant at one end and the local doctor or nurse at the other end - can provide. This way they can give assistance rather than having to transport people over long distances.</p>
<p class="contents">The last point that I would like to make is with regard to 3G. I am very aware of the comments that Malcolm Harbour made in his speech and I agree with him, there is huge potential with regard to 3G. We have already seen the huge explosion in the use of mobile technology. However, the costs involved and the amount of money that is being lost by companies bidding for 3G licences will eventually pass on to the consumer, unless we take control and take charge of ensuring that there is proper regulation of the charges for those services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have a couple of remarks relating to the use and re-use of public information. Some countries have made much more progress than others in this respect, and this clearly reflects a difference that also finds expression in, for example, the transparency with which countries operate. One example that might be mentioned is the significant interest shown in Denmark in a certain mayor’s restaurant and travel bills. Since everyone in Denmark has access to such documents, simply by asking to see them, there were too many people who asked to see them. The documents were therefore posted on the Internet so that any citizen could see each and every original document there. In the case of the commissioners or their colleagues, I do not believe we have access to the particulars of their work and travel or of the items they use. In Denmark, however, we do have access to this kind of information relating to such people and, in this connection, the Internet is used, and it is made available free of charge.</p>
<p class="contents">A long list of ‘services’ use the same data again and again, and this is made available to people, who can in that way update it themselves and, for example, automatically change their tax payments and such like. Why is this kind of data made available free of charge, and why is such use of the Internet encouraged? For two reasons. Firstly, the more that people do for themselves, the faster the responses they receive and the fewer civil servants we have to employ. Secondly, society has a huge interest in this data’s being used and re-used, for we cannot count upon having a sufficient number of civil servants in the future to carry out these tasks.

They have become one of the EU's top priorities. Their aim to adopt existing policies and legislation and turn them into global strategies is commendable. However, for this to take place, all Member States need to come together to ensure universally interactive public services, hopefully thereby facilitating the information society and guaranteeing equal public access to information.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Paasilinna's action plan has very laudable aims in incorporating eGovernment, eLearning, eHealth and eBusiness. The objective of creating a competitive economy based on information will have a significant impact on growth, productivity, employment and social cohesion in Europe. It is one that I support wholeheartedly and has been much heralded as a main EU priority. However, we need to recognise that progress in this area has been far too slow. We need to make a much bigger impact than we have to date. We need to explore how we can have greater participation and ensure that we do not have a two-speed Europe nor an information underclass. I very much support what Mr Paasilinna said.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning Mr Van Velzen's report on the re-use of public information, this can be a critical and very important economic driver, creating added value products and services and new prosperity for businesses, especially SMEs. In my area, the West Midlands, many SMEs are looking for this kind of information. However, as Mr Van Velzen said, we need to eliminate the obstacles and create a level playing field across the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I have worked in the public sector for a considerable length of time. I am concerned about placing an unreasonable burden on public bodies. Therefore I would urge that there be a provision for a reasonable return on investment. We face a dilemma as, on the one hand, we need to encourage businesses and on the other hand, businesses want information at little or no cost. We have to ensure that these costs do not fall at the door of the public bodies who have an obligation to produce, but have limited scope for manoeuvrability.</p>
<p class="contents">I also very much support what Mrs Read said on this and would go along with her. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Member States are just now putting the package into effect.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate cannot be allowed to distort the picture of telecommunications legislation, which would only cause uncertainty for investment in third generation mobile communications. We must help the troubled third generation mobile communications business, not restrain it. The GSM communications business, which has grown considerably in five years, is the cornerstone of our competitiveness and virtually the only thing driving the Lisbon strategy along. Following the disaster over the financial exploitation of third generation mobile communications we have to show we are jointly responsible. The mobile phone industry is a major employer representing the cutting edge of innovation. There has to be a new upswing in the sector; otherwise, the Japanese will leave us behind once and for all.</p>
<p class="contents">I made a point of investigating the claim regarding an increase in brain cancers in Finland since the 1990s. Whilst the base station network has grown phenomenally, the figures for cancer in Finland have fallen radically. It is hard to sell dull facts to the public. In the EU we have prescribed exact limits for radiation which are lower than WHO standards. There is more radiation from microwave ovens than there is from base stations. The values for Spanish operators are as little as one two-hundredth of the safe limit values. However, it is easier to claim that mobile phones melt our brains.</p>
<p class="contents">Public documents must be made available in electronic form. Basic information must be free of charge. An authority may make a charge to cover its costs, but it is unnecessary to ask for additional payment. The Member States must be responsible for seeing to it that the public institutions have sufficient resources available to them. Finally, I would like to express my sincerest thanks to the rapporteurs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Five minutes before the witching hour we have a topic that is obviously pulling the crowds in, or I might put it this way: we know that we want Europe and need it, so please allow me to use the 90 seconds that I have left to talk about how we can achieve it.</p>
<p class="contents">Have a go, ladies and gentlemen, at using what we are debating here. Go on, click on a website – the Council's, say – go straight to where it says 'Access to documents' and click. What happens? Nothing. Click again. What happens? Nothing. We say to our dear friends in the Council and our dear friends in the Commission – whose web site looks like something out of ‘The White Horse’, which was a cult operetta in Fifties' Austria – use the money that we could save by for example not holding meetings like this in this form and spend EUR 50 000, 60 000 or 100 000 on producing an up-to-date website that is more use than what is there at the moment. You would actually be doing voters a service.</p>
<p class="contents">They could also get the search functions to work. If these very banal things are done then we can – I think – consider what we might use this new <span class="italic">e</span>Europe for, incorporating, for example, tools to survey public opinion. In the meantime it is also possible to envisage holding Europe-wide referendums with minimal effort and at negligible expense.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this must always be seen on the basis of my <span class="italic">ceterum censeo</span> – there can be no democracy without transparency and a well-used Internet is a very, very good way of achieving this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are not very many of us in the Chamber. We do not know how many people are watching this in their offices and we do not know how many people would watch if we could broadcast this sitting on the Internet. If it were even possible to use video streaming to play this sitting at an agreeable time of day, then I think the hits on our web page would rocket, and it would be possible for people to analyse and monitor what goes on here more transparently and also much more effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">What do we need? It has to be quicker; it has to be more efficient. We need search engines that direct people to the right place as quickly as possible on the basis of key words. Entering ‘Hans-Peter Martin’, ‘Paul Rübig’, ‘<span class="italic">e</span>-commerce’ and ‘participants present’ ought to take you straight to this sitting. I think that our world has changed, that the networked society is actually already a reality. It has been possible to complete bureaucratic formalities, conduct business and so on electronically for a long time, but some of the necessary prerequisites are lacking.</p>
<p class="contents">When the WTO negotiations take place in Cancun in the autumn we need to ask ourselves: to what extent has world trade been liberalised? If Hans-Peter Martin clicks on a home page now and wants to order a book from America or a certain piece of software, what barriers and what bureaucracy will he have to contend with? What duties will have to be paid and above all, what is the postal service going to do about shipping and delivery costs, which are currently completely unreasonable for small parcels?</p>
<p class="contents">We need more competition in the postal services sector. We need secure payment systems, we need a system of damages that protects customers from fraud, and we need <span class="italic">e</span>-money that enables us to pay as if paying with cash. Applying the banknotes system to <span class="italic">e</span>-money is something that we are definitely going to need to do in the future. Finally, we also need a Europe-wide investigation into the obstacles to using these new technologies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That said, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the public data concern a particularly sensitive area since they concern public information, managed either directly or indirectly by the public authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Community legislation on transparency and accessibility of public information already provides a highly comprehensive framework, but in some sectors, a few clarifications should be made in order to prevent any distortion of competition caused by a possible legislative void.</p>
<p class="contents">I would congratulate the European Commission on this proposal concerning the reuse and handling of public sector documents. I nevertheless lament the lack of precision in certain points in the text. I am thinking, for example, of the documents referred to which, in my opinion, are not the subject of a clear, specific definition. As I proposed to the competent committee for content, the concept of a public document needs to be further delineated. I am not referring to harmonisation, but simply to an appropriate definition to allow all citizens to know exactly which public documents are considered to fall within the scope of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">It would also have been desirable to introduce a reference to periods of accessibility of public documents. On the other hand, I am pleased that the proposals on the unilateral order on information production and the proposals on the conditions governing the implementation of this order have been adopted, in particular the reasonable period of notice. An order that is harshly enforced poses a risk to the operators concerned. I am thinking in particular of the SMEs and SMIs, which would not have the technical or financial means to deal with such situations if they were not given enough notice.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I would encourage you, ladies and gentlemen, to vote for Mr Van Velzen’s report. The rapporteur has successfully supplemented the Commission’s basic proposal with a comprehensive report, which has been intelligently negotiated between the various political groups to which we belong. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I will focus on just two of the reports under discussion today. With regard to the Commission’s initiative on the reuse of public sector documents, there are more and more companies in Europe who make use of information from the public sector and who reuse it. We must guarantee that the conditions for access to this information are the same throughout Europe. The price for this information must be proportional – without question – to the cost of production, but on the other hand we cannot oblige the administration – as the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has said – to produce all that information if it is not relevant or necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Council’s proposed decision on the monitoring of eEurope and the dissemination of good practices and security on the networks, I would like to highlight two aspects. The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which produced the opinion for the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which produced the main report, has also stated that it is necessary not just to promote all exchanges of good practices between public and private professionals, but that the Commission should also fund information and awareness campaigns on the issue of the security of networks.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate the Commission on its initiative today to present a single system for security of the networks. It is clear that our work and our economies are increasingly based on the information society and it is therefore important to reduce the risk of insecurity on networks.</p>
<p class="contents">We must guarantee both safe access and the protection of the privacy of the data of those who access the public sector and the networks in general.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to promote an electronic economy in the field of enterprises, it is also essential to promote a culture based on the entrepreneurial spirit and to stimulate greater participation by companies in the information society. While in Lisbon, as other Members have said, the strategic objective was set on turning the knowledge-based economy into the most competitive and dynamic economy in the world, the objective of the information society is undoubtedly an important and essential driving force. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
