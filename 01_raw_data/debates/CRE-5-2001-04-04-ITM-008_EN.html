<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sanders-ten Holte (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the liability rules with regard to international air transport have hitherto mainly been based on the Warsaw Convention dating back to 1929. These limits are now far too low. The majority of international air carriers recognise this and signed a voluntary contract in 1995 in which they dissociate themselves from random liability limits. This formed the inspiration for the original (EC) Regulation No 2027/97. This regulation was used to step up the pressure on the international community to sign the Montreal Convention in 1999, as a result of which the new all-encompassing worldwide system for liability became an established fact. Thanks to the Montreal Convention, which is being transposed into European legislation by the present regulation, a modernised and uniform framework is being set up. This is a considerable improvement on the current international system.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight six points this evening. First of all, I back the Commission’s aim, in the framework of the development of a charter for air passengers, to protect passengers’ rights and to inform them of these rights. The present transport conditions in the aviation industry are restrictive and overlook the statutory rights of the passengers. Competition in this sector is fierce, but success and profitable operations must be based on more and better, not worse, customer service. Some airline companies have complained to me about the fact that information to passengers involves a great deal of red tape. You will understand that I do not share their views. The cost and effort involved in informing passengers are considerably less than the efforts which the airline companies make to inform potential customers of new services they are offering.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Member States have agreed that the Community itself is signatory to the Montreal Convention. I consider this a considerable step towards plugging the gap in the Union’s common transport policy, since we are thus recognising the fact that there is joint authority in the field of international aviation matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there was some concern as to the implications of the case which IATA brought to the Supreme Court in the United Kingdom against the British government regarding the way in which it implemented Regulation No 2027/97. The court concluded that the regulation remained valid, but that it contained a number of elements which were incompatible with the obligations which Member States had entered into on account of previous pledges, in accordance with international conventions. In my opinion, this objection is no longer well-founded since the regulation has been amended and brought completely into line with the new international system of liability.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, upon drafting this report and the eighteen amendments which I recommended to the committee, I sought legal advice from various lawyers and legal experts in order to preclude any doubt which may arise in future in the legal sphere. At the same time, I very much tried to retain the right of passengers to information. The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism adopted the amendments by general vote. These amendments can roughly be divided into three categories. First of all, the improvement of the committee text; secondly a simplification of the proposal and the guarantee of complete consistency with the Montreal Convention and, thirdly, a reinforcement of the provisions with regard to information to passengers.</p>
<p class="contents">Our committee particularly recommends that Parliament should add an annex to the regulation, containing the text of the information notice as required pursuant to Article 6(2). That is new. In that way, airline companies will be able to offer this information in a uniform manner. The text clearly outlines the provisions of the regulation and is devoid of any legal jargon. Once this regulation enters into force – which I hope will be the case by the end of next year – coinciding with the expected entry into effect of the Montreal Convention – all airline companies in the European Union will then be required to make this information available to their passengers. The text will then be drafted in an unambiguous and understandable language which is clear to the consumer. Airline companies from non-EU countries will nonetheless be required to produce something similar covering the liability system which they operate.</p>
<p class="contents">Considering the matter once more, I believe that the Union has the right to ask all carriers which sell tickets in the EU to provide their passengers with information on their rights to damages, not only with a view to acquainting the passengers with their rights, but also to allowing passengers to take out additional insurance, should this appear necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">I have the following comment to make to the Commission with regard to Amendment No 9 to Article 3. In the Commission proposal, reference is made to a number of articles from the Montreal Convention. However, various relevant articles were missing. The lawyers in the court room will love this. The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and I are in favour of simplifying the text, thus avoiding any risk of omission. Furthermore, by ratifying the Montreal Convention, the Commission recognises the Union’s authority in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to recommend all eighteen amendments. I cannot recommend Amendments Nos 19 and 20, because they imply that third countries need not meet the obligation to inform passengers, even if they buy tickets in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In my remarks I would like to commend the report to the House. I believe that it will result in an increase in protection for air passengers. However, speaking from a personal point of view, there are one or two issues which remain unresolved to my own satisfaction. Hence my tabling, with my colleague, Mrs Foster, of two amendments which reflect the need for these problems to be resolved. This basically centres around the dispute which Mrs Sanders-ten Holte has alluded to, which originated in my own country, the United Kingdom, as to the validity of the original regulation to which the new proposals relate. Until this legal dispute is satisfactorily settled it is my belief that the report should be held in abeyance. This position is complicated by two factors.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the fact that the Montreal Convention, which governs matters globally, has not yet been ratified by sufficient countries to give it binding effect. Nor is this likely to be the situation for some years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as referred to by the rapporteur, there is the issue of extra-territoriality. Whilst, to a certain extent, a number of the amendments which have been proposed to the report improve the situation, there are still one or two issues which need to be addressed, in my opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">We must avoid any regulatory imposition on airlines which, while quite rightly protecting passengers' interests, actually achieves exactly the opposite by imposing rules which render European companies less competitive than the rest of the industry. Unfortunately some clauses still contained in the regulation would result in just such a scenario.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope the House will accept the amendments as a benefit to passengers. I commend the report to the House in its entirety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Those amendments were directed to the improvement of Regulation 2027/97 and to the consumer rights which should be asserted. I therefore particularly want to speak in support of Amendments Nos 1, 4, 8, 13 and 18, which have that effect.</p>
<p class="contents">The previous speaker, from my own country – we at least carry the same passport, though we have different views – referred to the situation in the UK. It is true that IATA brought the UK government to court in terms of the possible extension of powers beyond what the legal position allows. Judge Jowitt ruled that conflict did indeed exist between the Regulation and the Warsaw Convention. But I would point out to my British colleague that he agreed with the UK government that Article 234 of the Treaty did in fact render this conflict invalid. The Regulation was therefore held to be valid. IATA lost their challenge and no other referral has been made to the European Court of Justice on this matter. I therefore regard this as a legal red herring and I would prefer to concentrate on the merits of Mrs Sanders-ten Holte's proposals because they will give the consumer travelling by air rights which have been lost for a long time.</p>
<p class="contents">The Warsaw Convention is 70 years of age. If you now find yourself stuck in an airport, with your baggage gone, your flight delayed, or perhaps cannibalised, you get this little piece of paper which tells you what your rights are under the Warsaw Convention. Those rights are negligible. What we are doing here is extending a body of practice which will allow us to protect consumers. That is what we should be doing tonight. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As shadow rapporteur, it is always a pleasure to engage in constructive dialogue with a rapporteur receptive to the proposals and points of view presented.</p>
<p class="contents">It is naturally important to take account of the interests of air passengers in this issue. I therefore think that the final outcome of the report is entirely positive. A not insignificant proportion of the amendments adopted by the Committee come from the PPE-DE Group, and these have strengthened the position of passengers. We already have a regulation establishing the limits of air carriers’ liability to pay damages in the event of death and bodily injury. That was a very important step in view of the level of damages which was laid down by the Warsaw Convention of 1929 and which was definitely on the low side.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the present proposal is to adapt the EU rules to the new Montreal Convention which will hopefully come into force at the end of 2002. When the revised Regulation comes into force, European air passengers will be given significantly better protection. When they fly with foreign carriers, they may, however, still be confronted by the fact that such carriers have a limited liability to pay damages under the Warsaw Convention because the latter will continue to apply to those countries which have not ratified the Montreal Convention. As a result, we are faced with the difficulty that always arises in connection with international conventions, in that we shall have two overlapping systems for a transitional period. It is therefore of the greatest importance for our Member States to ratify the Montreal Convention as soon as is reasonably possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We enjoyed a highly fruitful collaboration within our parliamentary committee. The amendments presented to the House were approved unanimously and incorporated suggestions from other Groups, and right from the beginning I could see that when Mrs Sanders-ten Holte was faced with a Member arguing about legal uncertainties it was clear to her that we should press on and avoid delaying tactics, because above all we had to consider passengers’ interests. Parliament has pressed on without delays, and we are attempting to give shape to our part in the Montreal Convention, which generates a number of positive features for passengers and therefore deserves the support of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We must highlight the greater number of participating countries and the new possibilities on offer, the increase in the compensation payable in the various situations considered in the Convention, the significant introduction of matters relating to baggage and delays and the provision of information for passengers.</p>
<p class="contents">We think that providing passengers with information is fundamental. It is fundamental, and perhaps it is not covered in Mrs Sanders-ten Holte’s report in as much depth as we would like, because we would like companies to reply specifically and immediately to consumers’ complaints, but it is undoubtedly a step in the right direction and it will have our support.</p>
<p class="contents">The recommendation it makes on the amendments will also gain our acceptance on all points, and in this way our collaboration will go right to the end. We will support all the amendments Mrs Sanders-ten Holte has proposed and we will oppose Amendments Nos 19 and 20. We therefore consider that this work is a parliamentary job well done which will result in benefits for the citizens. If, one day, citizens are compensated by airlines for their delays, we will have gained a lot of credibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, I would also like to congratulate the Commission. As I see it, this evening, we are discussing the rights of the passenger against the backdrop of a number of problems which are, in fact, related to the quality of services offered by airline companies. I am thinking of aspects such as delays, loss, damage, etc., not to mention accidents.</p>
<p class="contents">We are debating the liability in this respect and the provision of information to the consumer. I am emphatically supporting Mrs Sanders’ liability proposals and also the proposals regarding consumer information. However, we are unlikely to be able to address the quality of that information service in the same way. The question is also that of whether the information service has a preventive effect, especially in the case of delays and such like.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now in a situation where we are covered by insurance in Europe. You could therefore say: fly in Europe and you will be covered, but taking the high-speed link might still be a better option. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This should not lead to the constant changing of requirements and conditions. That is why it is desirable, for the benefit of those modes of transport, that international legislation be introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, rules on the position of air passengers should ideally have a global character. The Warsaw Convention, which is still applicable, has worldwide status, and its successor, the Montreal Convention, is also being given that status. This means that the rapporteur’s approach appeals to me a great deal. Her commitment to directly link EU legislation to the Montreal Convention appears to be the best solution by far. In addition, the reinforcement and clarification of the rights of passengers are, in the light of current practice, certainly no unnecessary luxury.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, we too believe that Mrs Sanders-ten Holte has drafted an excellent report, for which I would like to extend my warm thanks and congratulations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although every air passenger can take out private insurance, it is nevertheless only reasonable that a certain basic level of compensation should be guaranteed to all in the event of an accident.</p>
<p class="contents">The provisions of the Montreal Convention on the loss, damage or destruction of luggage and loss or damage resulting from delays are contained in EU rules. This is a good thing. Generally speaking, though, I do not believe in regulation that goes too far, as airlines must be given sufficient leeway here. If all airlines were forced into the same situation it would make it awkward to cater for the needs of different client groups. Legislation that is suitably broad in scope must be used to safeguard the business opportunities of both the cheap carriers and those airlines that offer a greater range of services. This is to the benefit of both companies and consumers, as any extra requirements are reflected in the price of the ticket. This basic truth is something the consumer organisations do not always bear in mind in all their enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="contents">The important question for airlines is that of a special declaration being made at the time of check-in. The declaration would entitle the passenger to a level of compensation that was above the normal limit. It will be absolutely essential to avoid excessive bureaucracy in this. In my opinion, the requirement by airlines for the declaration to be made prior to take-off is only reasonable. The regulation lacks clarity inasmuch as the points in the Montreal Convention referred to in it are not, however, to be found in the regulation itself. The basic premise should be intelligible legislation, and that is not quite the case at the moment. However, the regulation is a leap forward in terms of its content, and there is reason to rejoice that the outdated Warsaw Convention is receding from view. The most modern laws are not a guarantee of success in one day in the life of a busy passenger, however. You understand what I mean, do you not? Breakfast in Rome, lunch in Paris, dinner in Helsinki, and luggage in Moscow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We in the Commission fully share the tenor of the report, since it supports our intention of providing air passengers with a high level of protection in the event of an accident, it aims to modernise the rules on liability for delays and damage to baggage, and especially it aims to provide users with better information about their rights, since the greatest problem is often that the users themselves do not know what their rights are.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted to tell you that at its meeting tomorrow the Transport Council should adopt a decision to ratify the Convention and for the Community to ratify the Convention at the same time as the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Community must bring Community rules on airline liability into line with those of the Montreal Convention, which is the aim of this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the amendments that have been tabled, perhaps the most important are those concerned with the information to be given to passengers on the provisions about the airlines’ liability. In its proposal, the Commission requires the companies to provide passengers with detailed information. The report intends to strengthen the wording of the rule to oblige Community carriers to make available an information leaflet, as given in the Annex that is proposed. This would ensure that the airlines gave passengers the necessary information in a precise manner, something that experience shows does not always happen.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission accepts Amendments Nos 13 and 18.</p>
<p class="contents">The other two amendments, numbers 19 and 20, would, if approved, have the result that carriers from third countries would be exempt from the obligation to inform their passengers on the rules relating to their liability, and we therefore cannot accept this discrimination and reject both amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have a few doubts about Amendments Nos 9 and 10, since according to them the airlines’ liabilities would be governed by the relevant provisions of the Montreal Convention without the corresponding articles being specified. The Commission proposal, however, lays down that liability shall be governed by the provisions of seven articles of the Montreal Convention, which are explicitly numbered. Ladies and gentlemen, changing this matter could lead to a hostile reaction by some Member States, and the subsequent debate would slow down the adoption of the regulation to the detriment of the passengers. That is why we cannot accept Amendments Nos 9 and 10.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot accept Amendment No 11 either, since the article cannot be deleted if the text still refers to specific articles of the Montreal Convention, in line, therefore, with the previous rejection.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can, however, accept all the other amendments, which strengthen or clarify the text.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, madam rapporteur, I have summarised the Commission’s position on this report. I should like to thank Mrs Sander-ten Holte once again for her marvellous work and support for the swift introduction of the Montreal Convention into Community law, and she is quite right, since this new incorporation will mean passing on from the international system agreed 72 years ago – which in the end was trying to restrict the airlines’ liability – to another, more modern system which is aiming to do just the opposite: to give a high level of cover to the protection of passengers’ rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
