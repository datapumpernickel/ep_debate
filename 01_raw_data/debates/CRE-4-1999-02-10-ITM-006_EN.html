Like all my colleagues who were present in the House this morning, I noted with astonishment the Council's absence during the debate on the Bourlanges report on decision‐making within the Council in an enlarged Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Under Rule 101, the Council may be present in the Chamber. As this is a debate on the reforms which must be undertaken in future in the context of the process of major institutional reform which Parliament is firmly demanding and which is at last gaining widespread support, we feel it is imperative that the Council should attend. It may not be required to do so by any rules as such, but it is surely only proper for it to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever our opinions, we all agree on the importance of this debate and of the ideas it allows us to develop prior to enlargement. I would ask the President to protest strongly to the Council, on Parliament"s behalf, at its absence during this morning"s debate.</p>

The European Civil Peace Corps will be able to call on a core of full‐time employed professionals, as well as a pool of mission‐specific professionals, including conscientious objectors on a voluntary basis and unpaid volunteers, for specific missions.</p>
<p class="contents">It often happens that conflicts flare up again in the wake of a military peacekeeping mission because the causes of the violence have not been addressed. Facilitating dialogue and mutual confidence building should be a part of every peace mission. A lasting peace can be achieved, above all, through a genuine process of reconciliation. It is in that context that a civil peace corps should be able to fill a gap.</p>
<p class="contents">I am fully aware that many of those who voted for this proposal believe that a civil peace corps should be complementary to the Union's military capability. However, the Green Group, including myself, clearly hope that it will become an alternative. We have absolutely nothing against the EU taking part in operations abroad, provided that the activities are peaceful and constructive. Perhaps a successful civil peace corps might persuade some European activists that it is unfashionable and outdated to earn respect on the world stage through a show of military might. The future belongs to those who promote peace, not war.</p>

It is imperative that a peace corps of this type should be an entirely civil undertaking. The main task of the peace corps should be to reduce tension and prevent conflicts from escalating; it should operate under a mandate of the United Nations or the OSCE, and its primary purpose should be conflict prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, concrete examples of the tasks to be performed by a civil peace corps are as follows: mediation and confidence building, humanitarian assistance, the disarmament and demobilisation of former combatants, supporting refugees, rehabilitation and reconstruction, and the stabilisation of economic structures. Other tasks might include monitoring and improving human rights situations, empowerment for political participation, as well as interim administration to facilitate short‐term stability. A civil peace corps might also extend its remit to providing information and establishing educational structures and programmes designed to eliminate prejudice and hostile images. An essential condition for achieving a peaceful outcome is involving both parties to the conflict in common projects.</p>
<p class="contents">What is required is a core of full‐time employed professionals, backed up by a pool of experienced men and women to be called on for specific missions. In particular, their professional expertise as peacekeepers, conflict‐solvers, psychologists and so on should be exploited to the full.</p>

It did not believe that national laws were working well or had kept up with technological developments. The Commission also wished to limit the extensive pirate copying of CDs and CD‐ROMs. In its original form, the proposal meant that a consumer who had bought a CD could not copy it on to tape in order to be able to listen to the music while he was out jogging. Furthermore, the Commission's original proposal for a directive ignored the fact that a number of public service stations would have problems if they wished to use CDs as background music for TV broadcasts, and that the visually impaired and people with reading difficulties would not be able to enjoy special offers from libraries. Special offers made available by public institutions to the handicapped will not be affected by the proposal. In the light of this, the Danish Social Democrats have endorsed an amendment which ensures that special national schemes will not conflict with EU law.</p>
<p class="contents">In this way, it has been possible to secure a well‐balanced copyright law which both safeguards the rights of producers to their own output and protects the interests of TV and radio stations and consumers.</p>

The June Movement regards free access to information as the very cornerstone of democracy. Without opportunities for individual citizens to obtain knowledge and information, the democratic process would become confused.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, we would have liked to support the report in order to protect the interests of artists and safeguard their rights in connection with the exploitation of their work. Because most of the amendments which we had hoped would safeguard the rights of artists were not adopted, and since most of those which we had either tabled ourselves or endorsed and which would have ensured free access to information for the handicapped and others were also rejected, we chose to abstain on the report as a whole.

Apart from the aspects which imply a radical change in the way our societies are organised, there are still a number of questions about how our legislation and our legal tools are going to have to change in future in this area. I would therefore like to congratulate our President, José Maria Gil Robles, and Roberto Barzanti for having responded so rapidly to artists" concerns that their work is too often being used illegally on the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">While it is relatively easy to draw up a report and protecting the concept of copyright is the least we can do, it is not easy to legislate at European level to provide proper protection for the ‘victims" of this plagiarism. This is an area where we need to show imagination in establishing effective legal protection. To do this, I believe we must promote measures which are appropriate for the different forms of dissemination and piracy. Following the example of existing broadcasting legislation, should we not also introduce a user charge levied when compression tools such as MP3 or MP4 are sold?</p>
<p class="contents">However, we have to be realistic, since we have to find common ground with all parties concerned, and in particular with the United States and the producers of this type of software.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, while I agree on the whole with the rapporteur"s concerns, I question the distinction that is made between analogue copying and digital copying. In my opinion, digital has already won.</p>

We believe that the report creates a good basis for further discussion of the protection and exercise of the privileges of rightholders. If we cannot endorse the report, it is not because we wish to remove the advantages enjoyed by rightholders with regard to the exploitation of their work, but because the proposal adopts an unnecessarily restrictive approach to the definition of rights, which in the worst case would deny artists the right to negotiate for themselves both the scale of payment and what rights they transfer to a producer.</p>
<p class="contents">The Scandinavian countries have a long tradition and great experience of solving difficult copyright issues with the help of licensing agreements. We think that this traditional Scandinavian model involving collective agreements ought to be retained. At the same time, we take the view that publicly funded institutions which are open to the public, such as museums, libraries, archives and so on, should have the opportunity to participate fully in the development of the information society. Taken to the extreme, the contents of the report would mean that copyright legislation would prevent them from fulfilling their non‐commercial, educational function.</p>
<p class="contents">If the report is adopted in its current form, without taking into account a number of proposed amendments, it will for example no longer be possible to record radio and TV broadcasts for short‐term use for the inmates of care homes, hospitals, prisons and so on. We believe that a move in this direction, which does not sufficiently take account of the general public's need for and right to free and equal access to information, would be disastrous in terms of social development and democracy.</p>

This is true of the field of taxation, where the Internet is changing basic concepts such as the tax frontier, tax territory and the tax base.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also true of the field of artistic and literary property. Two principles are in conflict here: the right of the author to protect his work and his right to a fair income from his work versus the freedom of the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, the European Union is all the more contradictory as one of its fundamental principles is precisely that of free movement. However, where there is freedom of movement, there cannot be protection, and vice versa.</p>
<p class="contents">In literary and artistic works, the Europe of Brussels is finally discovering what it has spent 40 years refusing to see with coal, steel, textiles, cars and agricultural products, namely that freedom of movement prevents real protection.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to give the field of culture what we have denied our farmers by reducing customs duties and the common agricultural levy, and we wish to do so by means of an exception. This is good, but it must be applied across the board.</p>
<p class="contents">In itself, the draft directive that we have been looking at includes entirely acceptable elements which are designed to protect authors" ethical and financial rights. If we take music, for example, there is no doubt that digital compression technologies, such as MP3 or the new VQF standard that has appeared recently, represent a potential danger to the record industry, even if no scientific study has as yet been undertaken to confirm this. In France, we have seen only a slight drop in the sale of singles but this may be a mere coincidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Another danger that is equally real lies in the solutions that might be introduced. It would be tempting to place the information society under supervision, then we could control everything. The European Union makes no secret of its ambitions for the Internet: to transform this information area, this tool of cultural and personal development, into a mere shopping arcade.</p>
<p class="contents">In France we have seen the success of Canal+, where a broadcasting monopoly was effectively created. But nobody pointed out that Canal+ developed without any competition. In France the state has a monopoly on broadcasting. By penalising the pirating of Canal+ decoders, we effectively created a monopoly on reception. And some people would like to do the same with the Internet... the best of all possible worlds!</p>
<p class="contents">The solution is not only to be found in a directive inevitably restricted to the European Union. Taking into account the level of market penetration, it is above all American authors who are protected. European authors, on the other hand, do not have the same sort of guarantee as in the United States, for example. The concept of copyright is much more restrictive there than in France, for example. In order to effectively protect copyright and related rights, a better solution would be an international conference on the subject, where sovereign states could defend their own industries and agree to protect other countries" in accordance with the principle of reciprocity.</p>
<p class="contents">A balance must be struck between freedom and ownership. For the first time in history, freedom is being played against art.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a novelty for the artists. They had been taught by the Left to be defenders of freedom. Today they are pleading against it for the sake of their right to ownership. The Internet really is changing everything, even the most firmly entrenched roles.</p>

<p class="contents">In the last few years we have seen open and flexible legislation designed for an increasingly developed world of technology and computers on the one hand, and on the other, old and outdated rules, as in Italy, where the matter is governed by a law going back 60 years.</p>
<p class="contents">While there is absolutely no question of challenging the sacrosanct right of authors and editors to have their work protected, we think it is crucial, in regulating individual Member States' exceptions to the right of reproduction, not to dance to the tune of large record multinationals, for example, to the detriment of small and medium‐sized European recording companies. Article 5 needs rewording to avoid <span class="italic">de facto </span> restriction of access to the network for independent operators.</p>
<p class="contents">There still needs to be a right of reproduction for scientific and cultural works which are educational rather than commercial, together with a flat rate payment if more than 20 % of the book is reproduced.</p>
<p class="contents">This would also make things easier for small craft companies involved in reproduction, and indeed for their clients, almost always university students forced to buy very expensive textbooks even when they only need one chapter, thus feeding an often unregulated lobbyist market obviously speculating on comparative prices.</p>
<p class="contents">Until standard criteria which meet the needs of the market are finally established at Community level there is a risk that Member States may embark on different and even divergent paths, seriously prejudicing the much‐trumpeted achievement of the single market.</p>

Adopting the text for Article 5(1) as proposed by the rapporteur and approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs means that quite unjustified authorisations will be required for making technical copies from the Internet, which will simply have the effect of extending the supremacy in distribution of the great American recording multinationals into the digital world. This is an extremely restrictive measure for European operators, in clear and paradoxical contradiction to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act just promulgated in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, two different legal frameworks are being constructed as regards Internet accessibility. In the United States operators' freedom of access is recognised, while in the European Union, under pressure from the large multinationals and with the pretext of combatting piracy, the scope which authors and independent groups have to express themselves is being reduced. As the procedure provides for a second reading, considerable efforts are needed to promote an approach that gives greater weight to the legitimate principles of expression and right of access for European operators, who are excluded today.</p>

<p class="contents">Notwithstanding certain objections and reservations we may have, the report of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens" Rights is a positive attempt to tackle this problem. It also calls for already existing Community legislation to be brought up to date, by providing legal protection in areas such as reproduction rights, public broadcasting rights and distribution rights, and by providing legal protection against piracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Extending such protection to cover not only authors, composers and performers but also producers of CDs and CD‐ROMs and radio stations, while positive and logical in principle, must be examined to determine whether all these rights can be regarded as the same. Perhaps it would be better to examine such protection separately to avoid the danger of misinterpreting the term ‘intellectual creation" and the definition of composers and performers.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the most important, and perhaps the most intractable problem is that of the distribution of artistic works and, more generally, intellectual property via the Internet, and the possibility of reproducing such works using digital technology. Although the report attempts to tackle this problem, we feel that it can only be solved if we address the more general issue of electronic copying, especially at an international level, and if we combat the new forms of piracy and forgery which are springing up and going unpunished.</p>

It takes account both of the user"s need for access and of the market conditions for the media suppliers and for the producers of the required technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">We endorse the rapporteur"s endeavour to define the directive more precisely by giving precedence to copyright as the main concept. That decision was justified not only by the subject matter of the directive. Authors" rights are the weakest in terms of the requirement of market and industrial freedom and therefore most in need of protection, given that they relate to works that can only be treated as products to a limited extent.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumer and producer protection have their place within this primary aim in that the consumer receives free access to the desired transmission of a work while at the same time the rightholder obtains fair compensation, and the producer receives full protection against piracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the fact that the Commission has largely incorporated Parliament"s position and therefore very much regret that it has rejected Amendment No 25, in the form of a new recital, which deals with the treatment of cultural works not protected by copyright, as not relevant to the subject of the directive.</p>

However, we are not sure that the Commission, in its proposal, is going the right way about it. In our view, the fairest way would be for citizens to pay tax where they reside. Accordingly, we wholeheartedly support the idea of an exchange of information between states, rather than a model based on a minimum rate of taxation. Prior to the present proposal, we would have preferred to be able to adopt a position on an exchange of information, as opposed to a minimum tax rate. Now that this is not possible, we have decided to support the amendment that advocates the highest minimum rate of tax.</p>

Until now, people have been able to avoid paying tax on savings deposited in other countries. This has led to unreasonable incomes and distortions in the market, and has favoured banks in Luxembourg, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has just approved a twin‐track approach which means that a minimum percentage of interest income will either be withheld in the individual Member State or that banks and authorities will exchange information across borders so that tax can be collected. Banking secrecy could therefore be maintained if the first option is used. The Danish Social Democrats do not see the proposal in any way as a move towards tax harmonisation, but as convincing evidence that the EU can put a stop to the extensive tax speculation in Europe.</p>

<p class="contents">We all acknowledge that a guaranteed minimum effective taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments in EU Member States other than the investor"s country of residence is an ideal way to prevent harmful tax competition between the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from helping to reduce the distortions that are still widespread in the internal market, this widening of the tax base will allow Member States, if they so wish, to reduce the excessive costs that burden labour income and sometimes seriously handicap our businesses, subject as they are to international competition in an increasingly global economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a directive that we are discussing today is certainly not the last word in capital taxation regimes. On this point I agree entirely with the rapporteur that a great deal remains to be done in order to achieve an ideal capital taxation system and, in particular, that we need the broadest possible discussions on the issue with the EU"s major partners in the capital markets: the US, Japan and Switzerland.</p>
<p class="contents">While we are working on such an agreement, I, like many others, believe that this proposal for a directive is certainly an important step in the right direction. I would even say that it is the progress we have been waiting for for a number of years. The Commission has certainly done some excellent work here.</p>

<p class="contents">I am particularly delighted that my amendment to reduce the level of withholding tax from 20 % to 15 % has been adopted, for three reasons. Firstly, too high a rate would harm investment, and therefore also growth and employment. Secondly, the rate of withholding tax applied in international tax agreements only rarely exceeds 15 %. Thirdly, too high a rate would make all attempts to limit capital flight completely futile. The aim of the directive is to prevent capital flight to EU Member States where rates are higher. So how can we prevent capital from seeking out more favourable tax environments? From this perspective, choosing a rate of 25 %, as suggested by the French Government, would be an economic error that would run counter to the objective of fighting harmful tax competition.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect I am delighted with the proposal by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy to begin negotiations with neighbouring countries on fiscal matters. It has also been suggested that these discussions could then be extended to include the OECD members. This being the case, it is good that the European Union is not making the outcome of these discussions a precondition for implementing the directive on taxation of savings. There are enough stumbling blocks already without adding others...</p>
<p class="contents">I will therefore vote in favour of the resolution and the proposal for a directive, provided that no amendment is adopted to modify my proposal for a withholding tax of 15 %.</p>

First there was harmonisation of VAT and excise duties. Since then, the European Commission has been dragging out its plans to harmonise corporate tax and above all to harmonise taxation of savings, especially as the single currency has heightened the distortions between many tax systems, with all the risks of relocation and competition between them.</p>
<p class="contents">Being a poor loser, the Commission has tried to guard against the fiscal dumping that is inherent in free movement by means of its European Code of Conduct, which is in fact only a cartelisation code for tax authorities in order to maintain the oligopoly. It is against this background that we have the Pérez Royo report on the proposal for a directive of 4 June 1998, which clearly aims to set a ceiling on taxation of savings income in order to counter the Luxembourg tax haven.</p>
<p class="contents">There would be a dual ceiling: either the application of a 20 % rate of taxation on interest payments or the supply of information. Taxation or information. The choice would be between paying the withholding tax and being subject to taxation in the Member State of residence. This is what we call the model of coexistence: the coexistence of states that apply the withholding tax regime and states that do not.</p>
<p class="contents">But that does not solve the problem of globalisation. Capital moves around, even beyond Europe. The problem exists for Eurobonds, which may be underwritten by investors outside Europe. Hence the proposal from Professor Pérez Royo for a multilateral agreement with Japan, Switzerland and the US. This shows how outdated Europe is: the tax village is becoming global.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of capital, globalisation is complete. European taxation is therefore obsolete. It can only apply to taxpayers whose residence is fixed and localised, with the glaring injustice that we all know so well. Europe without frontiers overtaxes labour income to make up for not being able to tax capital income.</p>

<p class="contents">1.This is a first but important step towards putting an end to the tremendous fiscal injustice in this world whereby multinationals and large volumes of capital use tax havens to escape the tax net, a real scandal, whilst individuals and SMEs are condemned to a tax hell, contributing the bulk of national budgets. The final aim should obviously be neither offshore nor onshore. The aim should be ‘all‐shore", an open, flexible, transparent, efficient, liquid and coherent financial market on a global scale, with the same rules for everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">2.With the implementation of Economic and Monetary Union and the advent of the single currency, the disappearance of exchange risks will tend to make taxation on savings a rather undesirable factor in competition. This represents an absolute minimum of tax harmonisation. So far it only applies to individuals, but in future it should also apply to companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Differential treatment for non‐residents has been a distorting factor. Maybe some people have an aversion to the word ‘harmonisation". But fiscal coordination and coherence are an absolute minimum requirement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Stability Pact and the desire for transparency currently prevalent in Europe will in practice lead to fiscal convergence. The current situation, with the withholding tax rates on earnings from capital ranging wildly from 0 % to 60 %, is a major factor destabilising the whole Union.</p>
<p class="contents">3.The withholding tax level of 15 % approved by the Parliament seems reasonable to us, but in order to avoid a massive flight of capital from the European Union, we must reach immediate agreements with other OECD countries, especially the USA, Japan and Switzerland, to coordinate policy on taxing capital earnings. This will make the international financial system equitable and more stable, striking a balance between national and international liquidity.</p>

However, these proposals as currently drafted are flawed and against the interests of employment in Europe's financial services industry.</p>
<p class="contents">The timing of the introduction of a withholding tax directive is crucial. Unilateral European Union level action runs the genuine risk of creating an outflow of capital to third countries‐ for example, Switzerland. Should this happen, then jobs in EU financial centres will be lost to third countries as capital leaves. In addition, there will be no benefit to exchequers as the taxable interest payments will be outside the 15 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not appreciated that Eurobonds or international securities are included within the scope of the directive. Such a move would also run the genuine risk of relocating the whole Eurobond market outside of the EU and in particular, the City of London. British Labour MEPs are acutely conscious of the New York experience of imposing a unilateral tax on such financial services. For many years, Eurobonds were almost exclusively traded in New York. The introduction of a unilateral tax regime saw their near total relocation to London. As currently drafted therefore, this directive poses a direct threat to between 10 000 and 110 000 jobs, mainly in London's financial services, depending on whose analyses you believe. Indeed, there are already clear indications of Swiss preparations for any new opportunities that may arise as a result of EU action.</p>
<p class="contents">British Labour MEPs will be supporting calls for a multilateral policy development with the other OECD financial centres to tackle this important issue of tax evasion, and for the exclusion of Eurobonds from this directive.</p>

It is premature because it lacks a global approach towards tax harmonisation. Harmonisation of taxation of savings is just one specific aspect of a harmonisation operation that must encompass a number of other areas, of which company taxation is one of the most important. Harmonising only one part of the tax system is potentially more harmful than maintaining the different fiscal regimes that currently exist. As a result, the true merit of a directive on harmonising taxation of savings can only be appreciated once the overall plan has been drawn up and approved.</p>
<p class="contents">The text is <span class="italic">immature</span> because all of its components are largely controversial and their effects on the European economy are not known. The European Commission and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy set out the principles on which agreement could be reached in time: a withholding tax, coexistence, a common rate of withholding tax. But the practical application of these principles requires more careful consideration and, above all, solutions must first be found to many specific problems: the definition of a realistic minimum rate of withholding tax; coexistence, yes, but without the additional untransparent complications of a system of certificates and reimbursements, paving the way for problems in the system; imprecise definitions of the ‘beneficial owner" and the ‘paying agent"; potentially negative consequences for the European financial markets if Eurobonds are included in this directive without exemption, and so on. None of these problems has as yet been resolved and as a result this proposal for a directive can at the very most be considered as a preliminary draft that still requires intensive work.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of Parliament"s amendments are a step in the right direction, without necessarily touching on the fundamental problems: the rate of the withholding tax has been lowered; the role of certain neighbouring countries, which will be the sole beneficiaries of the directive in its current version, is mentioned; the usefulness of a certain degree of <span class="italic">fair</span> tax competition and the subsequent beneficial reduction in fiscal pressure is underlined. Otherwise, the report remains too close to the Commission text. Even though the explanatory statement is not part of the legislative text, it contains several opinions with which I do not agree: reducing the problem of Eurobonds to a purely British problem and, above all, the rapporteur"s ideal vision, according to which ‘an ideal (fiscal) regime should be based on the principle of supply of information to the fiscal authorities, i.e. on the elimination of banking secrecy for fiscal purposes".</p>

<p class="contents">The first three lines of the rapporteur"s explanatory statement thus crudely reveal that the objective being pursued is to combat the pernicious yet entirely predictable effects of the creation of the euro on certain capital movements.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of the introduction of the euro in the single market, the tax differentials between the various Member States are causing significant capital movements, and attempts are now being made to curb these, for example by introducing a minimum rate of taxation on income from capital invested by individuals.</p>
<p class="contents">It is astonishing to note that the effects of the euro on capital movements were not properly understood before it was introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the report itself, the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations has voted in favour of the amendments spelling out the need to harmonise the basic principles of taxation with OECD members. If we introduce harmonisation that is limited only to the Member States of the European Union, it is highly probable that we will witness the flight of capital to third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the minimum rate of taxation of interest paid, our group voted in favour of the amendment by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, which lowers this minimum rate to 15 % from the 20 % rate proposed by the Commission; a minimum rate that is too high could result in the flight of capital to third countries.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Theonas </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL), </span> <span class="italic">in writing. – (EL) </span> EMU and the euro demand the harmonisation of fiscal policy within the European Union and the shaping of a single taxation framework for economic activity in all Member States. This attempt at equalisation pays scant regard to the different growth levels of each country, to the repercussions that a single tax policy will have on national budgets, to growth and social expenditure and, above all, to the incomes of working people. Its aim is to increase hard‐hitting tax measures at the expense of working people and to lighten the tax burden on businesses and capital markets, thereby increasing their profits.</p>
<p class="contents">The fiscal policy which is taking shape, little by little, within the European Union, a typical example of which is the proposal to tax income from savings that we are debating today, will strengthen even further regional and social inequalities. It will make big business even more unaccountable and strengthen the divisions in economic life.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal favours tax havens of all kinds and the multifarious exemptions that exist in the system for taxing large corporations. It taxes the interest on the savings of the small investor and the small saver and eases the tax burden on companies and large conglomerates. This is happening at a time when, in the name of social security funding or the reduction of public deficits, proposals are being elaborated or ideas are being put forward to further increase the burden of indirect taxation, which blights the lives of the ordinary person in the street, and to further reduce the public social provision of health and pension cover, because of the high costs involved. It is clear that those who rule the EU believe that the enormous profits and revenues which can legally avoid any form of tax burden through a series of exemptions and derogations which are provided for in national tax laws, such as revenues from financial products, cannot and, what is more, must not play a role in achieving these aims. The people and the workers will bear the costs, and the profits will go to large companies and the capital markets.</p>
<p class="contents">We regard as unacceptable and at the same time revealing of the intentions of the EU and EMU the fact that the proposed directive only covers physical persons, when we know that the vast majority of those entitled to hold foreign accounts or cross‐border bonds – government or not – are the large institutional investors. Indeed, it is extremely telling that the amendments which called for the directive to be extended to cover legal entities were rejected. It is incomprehensible to us that taxes should be instituted which exempt companies. Such a regulation is a harsh blow to employment and growth, as it encourages capital to be kept in banks or to be converted into bonds or other financial products rather than into investments in production. This is not taxation. Working people are being penalised for doing their utmost to save money. This regulation is simply paving the way for the corruption of economic life, the exploitation of working people and the creation of brass‐plate companies, which are set up solely to avoid taxation. It is also creating the conditions – and this is made easier by the convergence of interest rates – to transfer accounts to a country other than the country of residence, or to strengthen the cross‐border market in bonds at the expense of the domestic market. The aim is to circumvent tax legislation for ‘residents" and to avoid paying tax. In particular, this regulation makes it easier to use zero coupon bonds as a way of laundering money, as they can be sold before their due date to people who are not covered by the directive and are therefore not subject to tax.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a directive that we are examining is part of a package adopted by the Council in December 1997, and we wish to reiterate that we wholly disagree with the logic of packages which aim to ward off any genuine objections which may arise and to allow decisions to be made which hurt the weakest countries. This is exactly what is happening with the proposal for a directive to tax the interest earned by affiliated companies, which directly hurts Greece as it is an importer of capital.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking advantage of the opportunity provided by the relevant forecast in the draft directive, and bearing in mind that the start of a new round of multilateral negotiations is approaching, we urge the Commission and the Council to take the necessary actions to institute, at international level, a means of ensuring that interest on bank deposits and revenues from bonds of all kinds and other financial products are taxed. Such actions must be targeted at large international institutional investors and, more generally, at legal entities. A way must also be found to tax all kinds of cross‐border capital movements which are carried out for profit, in order to put a brake, albeit in a limited way, on the increase in the volume of parasitic, speculative capital.</p>

Unfortunately, the opinion is representative of the fact that the right, particularly the PPE Group, is working to ensure that Parliament becomes an obstacle to third‐country nationals enjoying the rights to which they are entitled while in the European Union. A common set of rules defining the rights of third‐country nationals and their freedom to travel and reside in the Member States is a precondition for all citizens being able to move around freely. In this context, it is regrettable that the PPE Group and others are trying to restrict these rights and opportunities. Not only is it detrimental to the rights and opportunities of a number of third‐country nationals, but it also makes it more difficult to achieve the goal of the free movement of persons.</p>
<p class="contents">We should like to make it clear that we are opposed to the ranking of people seeking work in a Member State in the following order: citizens of the Member State itself, citizens of the Union and third‐country nationals, as set out in Article 7.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor are we able to agree with the view expressed in Amendment No 43 tabled by Mr Nassauer of the PPE Group, in which he calls for the age limit for family reunification to be lowered to 16.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we welcome Amendments Nos 44 and 45, which place partnerships on an equal footing with marriage in terms of family reunification, although we are concerned that the wording of these amendments to EU rules detracts from the possibility of them being applied effectively in all the Member States.</p>

Different criteria must be applied to those wishing to enter the European Union on economic grounds.</p>
<p class="contents">The key issue now under debate is whether we should have a strict or a relaxed admission policy. I would argue that if the European Union admits third country nationals for the purpose of servicing the specific needs of individual Member States' labour shortages then it would be repulsive to adopt a ‘revolving door" policy by taking no responsibility for the tangible economic input of workers from third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would further argue for a strict rather than a relaxed admission policy so as to protect the rights of third country nationals by outlining clearly the necessary criteria for admission.</p>
<p class="contents">Harmonising Member States' visa policies with regard to third countries is, in my view, essential as a major step towards improving the safety of travel documents. The mutual recognition of travel documents is paramount to implementing EU policy on the admission of third country nationals.</p>
<p class="contents">From an Irish perspective, the influx of refugees, asylum seekers and immigrants is a relatively new experience for us as a nation. Mistakes have been made in dealing with this evolving problem by successive governments. I have to say I am angry at how some of our citizens treat these strangers.</p>
<p class="contents">We can at times hide behind the provisions of the Dublin Convention, which states that the first EU country that an asylum seeker enters must process their application for asylum. Ireland is seldom the first port of call for prospective asylum seekers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Irish Government should be bold and courageous enough to bring in an amnesty for existing refugees and asylum seekers in Ireland. It should then introduce new and uniform rules to deal with new applications in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The Irish people must show some compassion on this issue. We, more than most nations, have benefited from the generosity of spirit and kindness of other nations in our history, most notably Britain, Australia and the United States of America.</p>

However, the Amsterdam Treaty which is to be implemented in the near future obliges us to broadly review the current status quo with a view to implementing new immigration measures.</p>
<p class="contents">All this will very probably lead to numerous problems, in view of the current inflow of persons and the inability of the European Union to become an outlet for world poverty. One of the major difficulties will consist in making the distinction between foreign nationals who have already been resident in the European Union for several years, and those who have just arrived. Hence the importance of new provisions in the Amsterdam Treaty which differentiate – with a considerable degree of humanity – between short‐term and long‐term residence, and immigration and temporary asylum policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In the face of the numerous political conflicts currently taking place throughout the world – including on our continent – we cannot close our eyes and just turn away asylum seekers saying that they are not our concern. Significant progress has been made with regard to the idea of collective responsibility of a group of nations. European legislation must therefore act as a very strict barrier to foreseeable inflows of persons. The same applies to ‘economic" immigration, the criteria for which must be laid down very clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has always ardently defended very strict international rules that can be applied in practice. Controlling our migratory inflows is becoming a major issue, particularly on the eve of enlargement when a number of third country nationals will soon become full citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore approve the second Lehne report because it takes into consideration the realities of the world today without being too liberal and causing harm to our own nationals, but leaving the door open to integration that is controlled in terms of the number of immigrants and in terms of time. The European Parliament needs to find the right balance. Immigration must not constitute an obstacle to European cooperation programmes, but for all that we cannot refuse positive immigration, nor can we reject agreements with third countries.</p>

As regards common rules for granting visas, we think there are two aspects to be borne in mind. On the one hand, the rules should make it possible for everyone residing within the Union to move around and, on the other, they should be applied in a spirit of generosity that will enable third‐country nationals to travel and reside, so far as is practicable, in the Member States. We do not foresee any conflict between these two aspects. In this respect, we welcome the committee's draft report, since it emphasises the need for more latitude in the rules relating to visas.</p>

However, this text, which has clearly been carefully negotiated by the Council, has been damaged by the European Parliament"s amendments. At any rate, it is affected by a structural defect which calls for serious reservations on our part: possible revision would be practically out of the question.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, Article 42 provides that the Council shall unanimously decide on any amendments to the Convention, which might seem logical given that the text will have been adopted unanimously. However, this provision poses a problem because if unanimity governs the adoption of a text, it ends up being ultraconservative and even intransigent when it comes to its revision. In fact, the proper rule which should be laid down is that when a text has been adopted unanimously, the failure of one Member State to give its support – by requesting that it be revised – must automatically lead to improvements being made to it.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a hypothetical question. It is currently being raised in France in relation to the 1979 directive on the conservation of wild birds. It could be raised tomorrow in relation to the Convention on rules for the admission of third‐country nationals, for example, if a signatory country requests amendments to the rules on family reunification. Nor is there anything extraordinary about this question: no text can remain unchanged forever, and it is normal to provide the means to make changes to it in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, an additional problem arises in the Convention we are dealing with today: if a country which had not managed to successfully renegotiate a text wanted to be withdrawn by democratic means from part of or all of the text, it would be difficult to see how this would be possible when – as provided for by the Amsterdam Treaty – it would not have the right to re‐establish unilaterally certain checks at its internal borders.</p>
<p class="contents">We may therefore find it quite strange that governments are pursuing such conventions without having resolved problems as serious as these beforehand and without having taken all the necessary precautions.</p>

The rapporteur"s original idea – like that of Mrs Lindeperg, whose report results from the same logic, despite the fact that they belong to different political groups – is that in view of the present difficulties in these areas, the policies can no longer be dealt with at national level alone. The draft Amsterdam Treaty should therefore allow the simultaneous harmonisation of visa policies, without which the free movement of persons, implementation of a fair asylum policy, harmonisation of immigration rules, action to combat illegal immigration and effective checks at the external borders would be jeopardised.</p>
<p class="contents">The report has undoubtedly been produced within the context of the ratification of the draft Amsterdam Treaty. It establishes a provisional regulation, the Commission having already undertaken to submit a fresh proposal – in the form of a directive – as soon as the amendments agreed in the Amsterdam Treaty enter into force. However, in the explanatory statement of the proposal for a Council Act, the Commission considers that current economic factors and the situation on the labour market make it impossible to do away with selective admission policies formulated by the Member States for the purposes of paid employment or independent economic activity. Nevertheless, it persists in believing that it is Europe"s duty to adopt a global approach with regard to immigration policies.</p>
<p class="contents">What about the problems experienced by immigrant populations integrating into societies which already have difficulty defining structures for human and social relations, both internally and with other societies? What about the economic and social cost of such measures? What about the checks I mentioned at the Community"s external borders which we know do not actually exist or are ineffective in certain regions? How much flexibility will the Member States have to react to special situations, in view of a safeguard clause providing for an exception whose duration is limited to what is strictly necessary, and taking into account the interests of other Member States which the state keeps closely informed as well as the Commission?</p>
<p class="contents">All these questions remain unanswered today. Too much is at stake for us to venture into the unknown in this way. The road to hell is paved with good intentions. This maxim is too easily applied to the spirit of Mr Lehne"s reports. Politics is the art of reality, not of utopia. The generations of this century have been paying too high a price for this since 1917 for us to transform the European Union of tomorrow into a vast Yugoslavia in the name of false generosity.</p>

In fact, the Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951, signed by all the Member States of the Union, provides for this status to be granted to individuals persecuted in their country of origin on grounds of race, religion, nationality, membership of a social group or political opinion; the European Parliament thinks this is too restrictive. In particular, it would like a broader definition of the recognised causes of persecution – to include gender‐specific causes, for example – and of potential persecutors, whose definition would no longer be confined to state bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to a less restrictive interpretation of the definitions of the Geneva Convention, which would open up the way for a complementary refugee status, a temporary protection scheme for displaced persons is being set up at the same time by the European Union, in order to offer a full range of legal structures for reception to all individuals or groups of persons wanting to flee their country of origin for one reason or another.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal which the European Parliament is making with regard to this complementary status seems to me to be completely typical of how it usually acts. It is announced that the new status will grant rights, without taking the trouble to say which ones and merely giving the impression that they will not be subject to a time‐limit. No attempt is made to ascertain how many new refugees there will be as a result – directly or indirectly – nor how much all of this will cost the taxpayer. Of course, there is no mention anywhere in the report of what the citizens of the Member States might think about this.</p>
<p class="contents">For our part, we consider that this is a completely irresponsible way of doing things. Of course, the countries of Europe must show concern for the welfare of foreigners who have been persecuted, firstly by scrupulously applying the provisions of the Geneva Convention. However, this solicitude can take very different forms, one of which being residence on our territories for an unlimited duration, which we would have to reject more or less outright.</p>

We abstained in the vote on this report and I think that I should give you an explanation as to why we neither voted in favour or against. This is particularly important since an issue such as this is perhaps one that requires us to take a particular stance, which is what the Spanish delegation in the PPE Group is doing. We are naturally in favour of harmonising complementary forms of protection so that refugees who do not meet the conditions laid down in the Geneva Convention yet who truly deserve protection, will receive it.

We think there is good reason to focus attention on the serious deficiencies that exist in the Union's reception procedure for asylum‐seekers. The report deserves praise for the way in which it discusses the measures that will be required to create a workable common refugee policy in which compassion, solidarity and generosity play a major role in determining the Member States' responsibility for accepting refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the amendment tabled by the GUE/NGL Group relating to Abdullah Ocalan, we do not believe that the matter really comes within the ambit of the present discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, we note from the amendment tabled by the rightist UPE and PPE Groups that the difficulties which the Council had in reaching agreement on a common refugee policy are also reflected in the narrow attitude displayed by these groups in the European Parliament. The way in which this matter has been handled shows, yet again, the ideological divide that exists between the right and left in Europe in their approach to a humane and generous refugee policy. We regret that the same ideological differences have served to deprive Amendments Nos 1 and 2 relating to persecution on the grounds of sexual proclivity of the support they warranted from the European Parliament.</p>

There is a need for European cooperation on refugee questions. The first step towards a common refugee policy was taken with the adoption of the Geneva Convention. The next step should be some common rules for people who are not covered by the latter. These are people who are not being persecuted individually by the State for political reasons, but who need asylum on other humanitarian grounds. The Member States should have a uniform interpretation of how these people can be assured of proper protection. It is time for us to start discussing a common definition of <span class="italic">de facto</span> and other humanitarian protection. There should be certain minimum standards with which all the Member States are obliged to comply.</p>

Many of them do not fall into the category of ‘refugees" as defined by the Geneva Convention. However, the European Union cannot refuse these persons entry into its territory. In fact, sending them back to their country of origin without further ado would put their lives at risk, or would at the very least jeopardise their moral or physical integrity.</p>
<p class="contents">Harmonisation of the policies pursued by the Member States is necessary in this area, and this will be possible as soon as the Amsterdam Treaty has entered into force. Within this framework, we need to set up an instrument to harmonise the forms of protection complementing refugee status.</p>
<p class="contents">I broadly agree with the rapporteur on all these points.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, I believe as she does that the European Union must grant a specific status to persons who cannot claim refugee status within the meaning of the Geneva Convention. The debate is mainly concerned with the definition of the categories which are eligible for this complementary status. It seems to me that a number of points still need to be clarified.</p>
<p class="contents">One example will illustrate my view: whatever we think otherwise of the death penalty, can a person who at the end of a fair trial is sentenced to death for crimes and offences under civil law, having exhausted all the possibilities of legal redress, really enjoy the specific status I mentioned – as the rapporteur seems to suggest – under the pretext that capital punishment has been abolished by the Member States of the European Union? If so, on what terms? Can a condemned person be given the same status as, for example, a woman fleeing her country of origin because she has fears of being subjected to sexual violence, or inhuman or degrading treatment? This type of question is at the very least worth taking time to discuss in depth.</p>
<p class="contents">Complementary status is essential. I just think that the dossier is not ready yet. I am therefore voting against this report and urge that the debate be continued.</p>

The Lindeperg report is more humane than the policy which the civil servants and justice ministers are planning. But, for the record, we should not forget to point out that it should be for the Member States themselves to decide on immigration and refugee policy. We do not want any supranational cooperation in this area because refugee policy is improved if the people have the opportunity to endorse it.</p>

I sincerely hope that the amendments tabled by the Conservative groups are not adopted. They would only detract from the quality of the report, as the aim of those political groups is not to make life easier for refugees and asylum‐seekers.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, I hope that Amendments Nos 1 and 2 relating to homosexuals tabled by the ARE Group are adopted by the House. The matter should be taken very seriously, since homosexuals are persecuted in many countries. Some countries mete out a range of punishments, including the death penalty, for a person's sexual predilections. Freedom from persecution or harassment because of one's sexual predilections is a basic human right. It is essential that this should be taken into account in the discussions on asylum legislation, as well as with regard to protection for homosexuals.</p>

In my opinion, this belongs solely at national level. Of course, individual countries are morally and politically obliged to comply with whatever international conventions there may be in this field, both in letter and in spirit. The rich democracies in particular are obliged to take a lead where the protection of the persecuted people of the world is concerned, which includes providing asylum themselves for those who are being persecuted. However, my rejection of the report on grounds of political principle should not overshadow the fact that Mrs Lindeperg clearly deals with an important matter in a proper and humane way. An example is her highlighting of the problem that there are people today who in reality are refugees, but who are not recognised as such according to the definition of the term contained in the Geneva Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out, however, that it would be a grave mistake for the EU to set about creating an alternative definition of refugees. That would be contrary to the principle that refugees are protected by an international convention, agreed under international auspices. At the same time, I could well imagine that an EU agreement on a different definition of refugees would not be seen as an addition to the Geneva Convention, but as a step towards depriving the Geneva Convention of its substance, so that many more people could be turned away – with a clear conscience – at the EU's external borders. The general impression of the EU, and not least of its Member States, is not that they want to expand the definition of refugees, but on the contrary that they wish to restrict it. The Danish Prime Minister said before the Danish referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty that ‘a yes to the Amsterdam Treaty will mean fewer refugees in Denmark.'</p>

However, the following comments are in order.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years, Europe has tightened its asylum policy. As a result, the number of asylum‐seekers has fallen dramatically, despite the fact that there has been no improvement in the human rights situation in the world. A more repressive asylum policy has led to an increase in the number of illegal immigrants. Those who smuggle human beings and illegal organisations with Mafia connections make a great deal of money unlawfully and gamble with the lives of the asylum‐seekers whom they bring into the EU. The overcrowded, leaking boats which cross the Mediterranean under cover of darkness only too often end up at the bottom of the sea. Those who succeed in entering the EU illegally then have to endure a miserable existence. They have to live outside the legitimate community and have no entitlement to even the most basic rights. The children cannot go to school or to the doctor when they are ill because their parents rightly fear that they will be found out and brutally returned to their country of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not share the rapporteur's view that harmonisation is the best asylum policy, especially since the process, which was begun in 1996, has consistently made the asylum system more restrictive.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I agree with him that women should have their own refugee status as stated in paragraph 15 of the report. The same should also apply to homosexuals.</p>
<p class="contents">At present there is a legislative gap between the provisions in the Geneva Convention and the rules on temporary protection, which only apply in crisis situations or when there is a mass flow of refugees. It is the duty of all the Member States to increase their share of the responsibility for accepting refugees, especially those countries with lower refugee quotas than Germany, for example, which is very responsible in that respect. Our job is to ensure that human rights become a reality which is enjoyed by everyone, and not just those who are fortunate enough to be born in prosperous Europe. After all, seeking asylum is a basic right!</p>

That is something totally different.</p>
<p class="contents">Everybody knows that just a few percent of asylum seekers in Europe can justifiably invoke the recognised international conventions on asylum. If the hundreds of thousands of asylum cheaters who arrive every year to benefit from social security in our Member States were systematically and effectively sent back over the borders, then there would be no asylum problem at all in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">You may be shocked by the use of the term asylum cheater. Yet it has the benefit of clarity, highlights a reality and contains no human condemnation. There are only two possible approaches here: either you play at being Santa Claus and say ‘all foreigners are welcome in Europe and can be supported by us", or you must apply the existing agreements to the letter, in which the case the asylum cheaters must be sent back to their own countries: not just because they put the whole asylum system at risk and thus harm genuine asylum seekers, but also because in Europe itself there are many poor and underprivileged to whom we first owe an obligation before we can take all the suffering of the world on our shoulders.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Lindeperg clearly opts for the Santa Claus policy. But she is playing Santa Claus at the taxpayers" expense. If her proposals for a further undermining of asylum regulations were to become a reality, the final barrier would be down and we would risk being swamped by fortune seekers from all over the world.</p>
<p class="contents">This is therefore an irresponsible report – yet another to come before Parliament – that we will not be approving.</p>
