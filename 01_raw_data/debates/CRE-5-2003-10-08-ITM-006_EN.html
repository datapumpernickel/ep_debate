This has the advantage of allowing us to deal with this oral question under a slightly more ‘prominent’ section of the agenda rather than in discussions in the small hours. I am grateful that things have turned out this way. In fact, this oral question relates to a very important matter, namely the fact that over many centuries the Member States of the European Union have developed liberal professions, which are expected to fulfil certain specific roles. For example, lawyers are required to administer justice, and a notary’s duties include the drawing up of public instruments, while some professions have to obey very specific professional rules, as is the case with medical practitioners, pharmacists and many other liberal professions, where comparable rules and special structures exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say that we in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market have been somewhat concerned by certain developments in Commission policy on the liberal professions over the years. I am thinking of the debate, for example, that we held some years back on the money-laundering Directive. We always have the impression that the Commission includes those who would like to apply to the liberal professions all those rules that hold for, say, supermarkets. That will not work, though, precisely because the professional structures all have their own particularities and these professions also have special public duties. They therefore require different treatment to normal market players who either buy or sell a given product on the market.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of recent developments – one being the study by the Vienna Institute for Advanced Studies, which came out some months ago – we would like to know how the Commission plans to address this issue in future. We have actually heard that the Commission intends to undertake a broad consultation of all the sectors involved in the question, and we would naturally also be interested to hear what steps the Commission plans to take after the consultation exercise. The questions we have tabled focus on this aspect, and I think it would be very helpful if Commissioner Monti could also take a clear position on this subject today in his answers to this oral question. This could put an end to a lot of the uncertainty among the liberal professions and provide clarity.</p>
<p class="contents">In our discussions on the agenda, Commissioner, we have already agreed that, in the next Strasbourg part-session, we also want Parliament to do what we did a few years ago, and approve a resolution to this effect. That should then give you some kind of yardstick for judging the views of this House on the very sensitive question of the liberal professions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission certainly believes that the undoubted competence of the professions and their ability to establish relationships of mutual trust with their clients are vital factors in the success of members of the liberal professions, and engender a high level of satisfaction amongst their clients in Europe. It is with this in mind that the Commission has adopted a number of initiatives designed, as has already been mentioned, to ensure that the general interest is fully protected and, in particular, to guarantee a high level of independence and of professional ethics in this sector. The recent Wouters judgment of 19 February 2002 and the issue of safeguarding customers’ rights are also relevant here.</p>
<p class="contents">In March 2003, we initiated an evaluation process with a view to forming an overall picture of regulation of the liberal professions and its effects across the countries of the European Union. This exercise takes two aspects into account: firstly, precisely because the liberal professions have a key impact on the competitiveness of other sectors, it is important to consider the economic consequences that regulation may have on production and on efficiency, price levels and employment; secondly, as the authors of the question have implied, it is vital to take into account non-economic aspects and accordingly to accurately assess the justification for various types of regulation. If the result is that some of this regulation goes beyond what can be objectively justified in order to guarantee high-quality services, on the one hand, and to protect consumer interests, on the other hand, the Commission, and also, I am sure, the members of the liberal professions themselves, will have to do everything in their power to ensure that these forms of regulation are reviewed. We are in the process of analysing the contribution of the liberal professions and of consumers to this assessment exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lehne, on 28 October 2003, a hearing of interested parties will be held – the hearing that you, yourself, referred to – and we trust that, on that occasion, we will be able to pull together a wide range of views from all quarters. Of course, if any Members of the European Parliament wish to take part, they will be more than welcome. I am sure that the debates will be of a high quality, and that they will enable us to gain a better understanding of how the professions operate. Your opinions, if you wish to participate, will certainly add to the quality of the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, I would like to remind the House that, in response to a proposal from my colleague, Commissioner Bolkestein, the Commission, on 7 March 2002, adopted a proposal for a directive on the recognition of professional qualifications, the main aim of which, in view of the decisions of the Lisbon European Council, is to consolidate the 15 existing directives in this area and to increase the mobility of skills. This proposal is currently before this House at first reading. Without addressing the issue of professional qualifications, which remains an area in which the Member States have primary competence, the proposal aims to facilitate the provision of services to clients in any other Member State by members of the liberal professions with a qualification from a given Member State. At the same time, the Commission is exploring - in a wider context and in line with the strategy for the internal market in financial services - a coherent approach to overcoming the persisting obstacles to the provision of cross-border services, with the exception of those related merely to recognition of professional qualifications. Of course, if the Commission were to bring forward a new proposal in this area which also covered cross-border services provided by members of the liberal professions, it would take due account of the general interest objectives at stake and, especially, of the particular importance of independence and of professional ethics for these professions.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, while reiterating its commitment to respecting the regulation and the restrictive self-regulation that apply to the liberal professions, and which can be justified on grounds of general interest, the Commission believes that it has a duty to increase its endeavours to create a level playing field for qualified professionals, so as to increase cross-border mobility and promote healthy competition, in the interests of both the professions themselves and consumers. If I may use your own expression, Mr Lehne, we are all aware that supermarket rules are neither appropriate nor sufficient here. This is a very special sector which we do, however, consider could benefit from a critical review of its existing regulatory framework. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you know, Mr Lehne, Mr Zappalà and other Members have been working in my committee for over a year on a directive on professional qualifications, and we are, therefore, very familiar with the specific, exceptional nature of the liberal professions.</p>
<p class="contents">Members of the liberal professions offer an independent service based on an extremely high level of knowledge on which it is difficult to place a value. For this reason, professional activities are regulated by an ethical code covering relationships between professionals, between professionals and their clients, and between professionals and society as a whole. The behaviour of professionals is governed by an ethical framework covering their precise duties and the requirements of the service determined by professionals themselves, and this ethical framework therefore represents the first step towards regulation in terms of interpretation and application.</p>
<p class="contents">A sociologist from the United States, Fredson, demonstrates in his work that the system of the professions corresponds to the work ethic, which has to strike a fair balance – and I agree with Commissioner Monti on this – between profit and the implementation of rules, which are the hallmarks of the market and of bureaucracy. This, in itself, is exceptional. Members of the liberal professions need to be granted a special status in order to maintain this delicate and difficult balance, not just in their own interest but also in the interest of society as a whole. Furthermore, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, in Article 5, freedom to choose an occupation, stipulates that everyone has the right to pursue a freely chosen or accepted occupation, and freedom to choose an occupation is different from free enterprise.</p>
<p class="contents">As stated in the Treaty, Commissioner Monti, the general interest mission of the liberal professions may also justify certain limits to the rules of competition. For this reason, legislation and the ethical regulatory framework may provide for exemptions from competition law in specific cases: in relation to professional fees, which may be mandatory, being set by the state; as regards an integrated approach to exercising the profession; in relation to advertising, where ethical codes may rule out the possibility of professionals passing judgment on each other; as regards membership of social insurance institutions; as regards mandatory membership of pension funds, which is accepted; and as regards exclusive rights for certain regulated professions.</p>
<p class="contents">When all is said and done, Mr President, the rules that are necessary for each specific profession to ensure that profession's impartiality, competence, integrity and responsibility for funds are not considered to be constraints on competition. The activities of the liberal professions should, therefore, ensure that professionals and the services that they provide help to offer positive solutions to the challenges that we face, thus protecting the general interest of society at large. The standards drawn up by professional associations under their own responsibility, with a view to safeguarding the quality of service provided, guarantee that such rules are observed in accordance with the conventions of professionalism and professional ethics.</p>
<p class="contents">I accordingly believe – and this reflects Commissioner Monti's statement – that, in this way, and solely by virtue of the delicate balance that we have to strike between profit and ethics, a fair relationship can be established between the free market, competition, regulation and ethics in general. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Medina Ortega (PSE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, the previous speakers have highlighted the special characteristics of the liberal professions and the need for differentiated legislation. Well, as Commissioner Monti has stressed, this differentiated legislation must be produced within a free market, in which clients normally have the possibility of choosing their professionals and furthermore can expect certain standards of behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">We should prevent one danger: that of maintaining professional organisations in the field of the liberal professions as a kind of medieval body, which it is very difficult to join, and above all that this type of professional organisation should prevent the free movement of people within the European Union. In other words, the two objectives, that of free access for clients or users to the liberal professions in any country of the Union, furthermore with the right to a system of a general nature, and also the right of access for professionals of one country to another country of the European Union, must be guaranteed. And within this context, the specific regulations for the liberal professions should be aimed, firstly, at guaranteeing discipline within those professions. In many cases, this is not the case. And it would be rather unfortunate for the Commission to imagine that the functioning of the professions is guaranteed by the professional organisations, if we then discovered that, in many cases, the ethical standards of the professions in question are not truly regulated within that profession. And many of us are aware of examples in all the liberal professions.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the Commissioner has made a very balanced analysis and furthermore I must congratulate him on his initiative to hold a hearing with the participation of people from the different sectors, but I hope that they are not just members of the professions, but also representatives of various sectors – industrial sectors, users, consumers – so that all aspects may be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, I believe that a new regulation will be required, a rather specialised regulation, for the liberal professions, but that regulation must not run counter to the general rules of the European Union. As Commissioner Monti has said, we are not talking about a supermarket <span class="italic">–</span> one cannot go into a supermarket to buy the services of a doctor <span class="italic">–</span> but, within a market context, clients also have the right to benefit from the possibility, for example, of competition within a sector in which there are more professionals than there is demand for them. The supply and demand mechanism can also act as a selection factor, in that clients will normally go to those liberal professionals who offer them the best conditions, including prices. But if we establish an excessively closed regulation, if the conditions for access for clients are too strict, the clients will find themselves trapped as a result of the existence of these organisations and the prices they set, and they will not even have the opportunity to take action against them.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the Commissioner has dealt with the problem very well: we must seek a balance so that the special requirements of these professions <span class="italic">–</span> for which we all want very high ethical standards, for which the main responsibility falls to the liberal professionals themselves by means of their organisations <span class="italic">–</span> do not prejudice the client, the consumer or the user. The client must have the right of access to legal rules and judicial and administrative bodies, with the aim of guarantee that services are protected as far as possible and that, within the context of the requirements indicated by Mr Gargani and Mr Lehne, we can guarantee free competition, both within each of the countries of the Union and across the Union's borders. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When the liberalisation of a sector that provides a public service is discussed, people say that the sector in question is of a specific nature which needs to be taken into account and which means that the market rules applying to other economic and industrial sectors cannot be applied to this particular sector. The same goes for the liberal professions: all the professions have their own specific characteristics. But the hallmark of the liberal professions in Europe, and, particularly, in some countries such as Italy, is that they are the least liberalised of all.</p>
<p class="contents">You see, Commissioner, when people say that there is a need to strike a balance, I am quite happy to agree, as long as we recognise that, at present, there is no balance at all, that today, in Europe, the so-called liberal professions are in actual fact based on closed professional associations that exercise a collective monopoly defending profit and creating obstacles for young people wanting to enter those professions. By way of example, let me mention the journalists' association. Very recently, a well known French journalist with a wealth of professional experience came to Italy when his publishing house bought several Italian newspapers, and he was appointed editor of one of those newspapers. Italy's journalists' association was up in arms, and made sure that this person, a Frenchman, was unable to do the same job in Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">The liberalisation of professional services, as demanded by Italy's antitrust authority, is needed to help make many of Europe's industrial sectors more competitive – the sectors which are most dependent on the need to have a skills base and to be competitive on international markets.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the October hearing, as long as, and let me repeat this, it is clear that balance can only be achieved in Europe today if we succeed in weakening the closed shop and monopolistic stranglehold that the professional associations represent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karas (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, President of the Commission, Commissioner, this debate reminds me a little of the debate we held on so-called services of general interest and competition law. Although the liberal professions are clearly not a supermarket – and although a supermarket as a <span class="italic">de facto</span> market is not a service of general interest in this sense – the two do have some things in common. In the case of services of general interest, we agreed that competition law, the subsidy rules, and the internal market, meant that there was room for exceptions, to which subsidiarity would apply on the grounds that they can be shown to possess features from and be defined in terms of different identities and cultures. I think that the basic principle of subsidiarity – looking at different cultures and identities and the historical background of a given situation – can be applied here too.</p>
<p class="contents">As supporters of competition law, and not just of Commissioner Monti, we also, though, have to remain consistent. I therefore feel that the application of EU competition rules to the liberal professions is reasonable and should be supported, provided that the particularities of this sector of the market are taken into account. I am therefore very pleased to see that the Commission is not questioning the existence of professional organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">This, though, brings us to the heart of the matter. Liberal professions – lawyers, notaries, engineers, architects, doctors and auditors – are very specific in character and have undergone very specific historical development. They require high levels of qualification and a special relationship of trust with clients. However, they are also distinguished by the fact that the consumer does not have access to the same information as the service providers themselves. These characteristics have to be borne in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think that the Commission cannot be allowed to make the mistake of interpreting professional codes of conduct as a barrier to the freedom of movement of services. I do however entirely agree with the Commission that self-regulation cannot be used as a shield against the market and should not put consumers at a disadvantage. Nevertheless, we must not oversimplify matters. The primary aim of such self-regulation is to guarantee service quality by means of professional ethical standards and to prevent conflicts of interest and misleading advertising.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in order to guarantee service quality that professional groups take responsibility for drawing up codes of conduct, and these lay down certain standards to ensure that professionals adhere to the rules and guarantee professional ethics. I see professional codes of conduct as essential for guaranteeing the impartiality, competence, integrity and responsibility of the members of each professional body and for protecting consumers. Parliament and my group support the liberal professions because of their high ethical standards, the security they provide for consumers, their competence, impartiality and integrity, and we would ask that this special status be adequately taken into account when considering competition law so as to create security for all.</p>

Firstly, I was the rapporteur for Parliament's report on the proposal for a directive referred to by Commissioner Monti. Secondly, a great deal of alarm has been caused in Europe, and particularly in my own country, by the Commissioner's various initiatives in terms of a series of research studies, of statistical data on charging structures and behavioural methodologies.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us talk about the professions then. I believe that we all need to consider just what the word ‘profession’ means and its impact on the public. Generally speaking, professionals – of which there are several million in Europe – have daily contact with almost everyone in the world. In some ways, they safeguard safety, health and freedom. There is a great deal of confusion in general between different types of professionals: intellectual professionals are quite a different kettle of fish from professionals in general.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards competition – and I am afraid that I do not have time to go into the detail I would like in some areas – competition in general means arguing about a price. When it comes to issues like safety, freedom and health, however, professional services mean having qualifications and levels of education that are certainly out of the ordinary and, in any case, not within everyone's grasp. Certainly, when we talk about competition we cannot talk in terms of prices but we should talk in terms of quality. Quality is something altogether different, because it is quality that ensures health, freedom and safety. This does not mean, as I see it, that we can disregard the question of competition, but we simply need to consider what kind of competition we are talking about. For example, there is absolutely no way that you can compare two different items of handcraft with two different operations by thoracic surgeons.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, Mr President, I do not believe that one should make sweeping generalisations. Professional associations are by no means simply closed shops; they have a function as regards training and lifelong learning, which provides consumers with certainty. Poor, badly functioning legislation that often forces professional associations to act in undesirable ways should not be used as an excuse to abolish the associations themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">All the speakers have pointed out, with different emphases, that the liberal professions are well-rooted in history – Mr Gargani spoke eloquently on this subject – and that we need to strike a balance between sets of contrasting concepts: self-regulation and public regulation; the market and non-market considerations; specificity and, notwithstanding, endeavours to generate greater mobility in Europe. It has been pointed out, as I said, that we need a balance: this may be where the emphases differ, for some – like Mr Medina Ortega and, to an even greater extent, Mr Della Vedova – believe that the current balance may not be a proper balance and that a great deal more progress needs to be made; others, who are more cautious, call for the specific nature of the liberal professions to be given greater consideration and, therefore, for the current balances to be seen as not so unsatisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">Another thing which appears to have emerged from the debate is that we need to know more, we need to increase our knowledge. This was precisely the reason for the evaluation exercise, based on the study commissioned by the Commission from the Institute of Higher Studies in Vienna, which I believe adds to our knowledge in that it looks at the current systems in the 15 Member States for five different categories of liberal professions and attempts to make comparisons. On this basis, indeed, we believe that the hearing, the Conference of 28 October, in which, as has been pointed out by Mr Medina Ortega, in particular, representatives of clients as well as representatives of the professions will take part, may be useful. In this regard, we must not forget that the clients of the professions are made up of both private individuals and companies: the impact of quality, of course, of standards of conduct and also of prices is therefore significant in terms of the real level of income, the citizens’ standard of living and the production costs of companies.</p>
<p class="contents">The situations in the Member States differ, as has emerged from this study. In this regard, Mr Karas, I feel that the comparison you made between this issue of the liberal professions and the matter of services of general economic interest – <span class="italic">Daseinsvorsorge</span>, to put it more succinctly<span class="bold"> </span>–<span class="bold"> </span>is extremely interesting. Indeed, in both cases, we have to recognise demands that go beyond purely market considerations and, in both cases, I believe there is room, with due regard for those demands, for attempting to increase competition and efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that the Commission is taking a very balanced approach to this task. I note, as you did, Mr Zappalà, that some alarm has arisen in a number of Member States. I would like, if I may, to take this opportunity to stress that such alarm is unfounded, for two reasons: firstly because – to use your expression – nobody is trying to lump everyone together; on the contrary, the study on which our evaluation exercise is based distinguishes, as I said, between five professional categories and 15 Member States, precisely in order to avoid lumping everyone together under the same umbrella. In a preliminary press debate in a number of Member States, the European Commission was said to be intending to opt for uncontrolled liberalisation. Irrespective of the fact that the Commission has a tradition of a certain prudence in its initiatives, we believe that, particularly in this field, it would be rather silly to start from the assumption that there is nothing that needs changing, although none of us sees uncontrolled liberalisation as an option.</p>
