At this point, since a large number of Members are present in the chamber, I should like to repeat that the only reason why I was able to perform my task as rapporteur so effectively was the work that was done with me and for me by the marvellous secretariat of the Committee on Budgets, which has worked extremely hard throughout the year, putting in many, many hours, including weekends. The members of the secretariat of the Committee on Budgets, whether they work front stage or behind the scenes, have been very, very cooperative and highly competent. I wish to convey my sincere thanks to them and I call on the House to show its appreciation with me.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I should like to announce a few fairly minor technical adjustments very briefly. We shall have modifications to Amendments Nos 171, 187 and 21 in Document 12. Since the legal bases now exist for the programmes we adopted with the Council, the money will be brought forward in these cases from the reserve to the budget lines in question.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe my honourable colleagues will all subscribe to these modifications. The programmes involved are the action programme for equal opportunities, the MEDIA programme and the action programme against discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">The last announcement I have to make relates to Amendment No 197. This amendment concerns MEDA. We intend to keep the remarks we adopted at the first reading for the second reading as well. I think that is all I have to say for the time being. I am sure the House will endorse these decisions.</p>

But I believe the Commission deserves a special word of thanks, particularly the Director-General, whom Mrs Haug did not mention. May I now rectify that oversight.</p>
<p class="contents">I have fallen victim to the new software program, which grieves me greatly, since I am an engineer by profession. But I do depend, of course, on the assistance of our services. With regard to Amendments Nos 34, 38, 35, 36 and 78, the computer has jumbled up the figures. I therefore ask that technical adjustments be made here. It is a matter of restoring what we said at the first reading. This is not a fiddle. It is the computer that has cooked the books here. The Members of Parliament have been the soul of propriety, as ever. I therefore ask for your support and trust on this point. We shall make hand-written amendments, using 19th-century methods to overrule and outmanoeuvre the technology of the 21st century. That will set everything to rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I fear that we may have a situation on our hands which is not dissimilar from the American re-count. Having read what was in the papers this morning in my country, I have to say that not only was the French Presidency mistaken about Poland’s and Spain’s vote weighting, for which the President has, in fact, offered his apologies, but problems have emerged which are both numerous and embarrassing. I quote: annex 3 of the draft treaty stipulates that the majority threshold, which rises as and when new Member States accede, should constitute 73.4% of the votes once all Member States have joined. That translates, therefore, into 253 votes in the Council of Ministers. However, that also means that the blocking minority – and that is, after all, what this is all about, that is what the Nice Agreement was about – amounts to 93. But only one sentence down from this, the number of votes are 91! You do realise that it is difficult for us to discuss a treaty if it contains mistakes such as these. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although it is likely that they will consider the number 23 428 far too low, they will nevertheless be pleased with the room for growth provided to them. This agreement forms part of an initiative by means of which Switzerland and Norway will increasingly take on the guise of EU Member States. The only difference is that they do not pay a contribution and do not have a right to vote. As a result, their governments can continue to reassure a critical population of their on-going independence, although that is less and less the case.</p>
<p class="contents">However, far more important is the fact that this agreement will generate a great deal of extra freight traffic on the roads. After Austria, the Alps barrier is now also disappearing in Switzerland. That country had previously opted for discouraging road traffic and improving rail connections for freight transit traffic. Allowing an increasing number of larger lorries on the roads will force Switzerland to invest more in motorways. I am not at all convinced by the fact that large Swiss environmental organisations have been sweet-talked into this with the argument that the revenue from levies will benefit the expansion of rail. This agreement is attractive to a number of companies but detrimental to the environment and democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For the Portuguese Socialists, the Cohesion Fund is a mainstay of the economic and social cohesion policy, which was launched by the Single European Act and substantially strengthened by the Maastricht Treaty. Since it was set up, the Cohesion Fund has had a considerable impact on two areas of great Community interest – the environment and trans-European transport networks; it has been effectively implemented in the Community budget and has had one of the highest implementation rates in the entire Community budget.</p>
<p class="contents">As our comrade, Mário Soares, stated at the investiture of the current Prodi Commission, the most negative point in its programme was the abolition of the Service Directorate for this Fund and its removal from the name and directory of the former Directorate-General XVI. This abolition, which began to take place in the middle of last year, as we had anticipated, resulted in a dramatic fall in the speed with which projects were approved and payments made, to the point where the annual implementation of authorisations of this fund at the end of June 2000 was less than one per cent.</p>
<p class="contents">In its proposal to Parliament to cut EUR 360 million from the 2001 payments, the Commission was showing worrying signs of a lack of interest, motivation and will to fully implement the financial package agreed upon by the Berlin European Council. After this proposal, the Portuguese Socialists decided to vote against the budget at its first reading if it did cut EUR 360 million from the draft budget, agreeing to vote for the budget only when this position was changed to place this money in reserve.</p>
<p class="contents">In the face of the joint efforts by the representatives of several governments in the Council, particularly the Portuguese Government, and members of various Parliamentary groups, in which it is fair to highlight the Portuguese Socialist members, the trialogue held between the Commission, the Council and Parliament decided to reinstate the whole of the funding laid down in the first Council reading for the Cohesion Fund payments, and Parliament has just ratified this position. We are delighted with this decision and now commit ourselves to remaining vigilant over the implementation of the Cohesion Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to make up for the delayed start in the implementation of the Cohesion Fund in this programme period, the beneficiary Member States will have to redouble their efforts and their care and, most of all, the Commission will have to give it top priority, especially by increasing the human and financial resources allocated to monitoring the fund. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As we pointed out at first reading, aid to the Balkans by no means justifies a revision of the financial perspective, and nor does it mean, spuriously, that the fisheries agreements with Morocco should be challenged, by entering EUR 130 million into a reserve. We are delighted that this has now been acknowledged.</p>
<p class="contents">The most significant event to have occurred since our previous budgetary debates is, of course, the “mad cow” crisis. Whilst France must now take satisfaction in the fact that the European Union has finally adopted France’s position in the field of prevention, we remain concerned about the appropriations that these new political choices will require.</p>

<p class="contents">The EUR 60 million for the former and the EUR 360 million earmarked for the latter will not be enough for 2001.</p>

This paragraph is a perfect <span class="italic">carte blanche </span>for the effective closure of the Secretariat-General of the European Parliament in Luxembourg.</p>
<p class="contents">In Edinburgh in 1992, the Heads of State and Government decided that the European Parliament had three official seats: Strasbourg for 12 plenary part-sessions a year, Brussels for committee and group meetings and short plenary part-sessions and Luxembourg as the seat of the Secretariat-General.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Edinburgh Summit, the Heads of State and Government were undoubtedly aware that three official seats generate travelling and subsistence costs, so it is not up to the Members of the European Parliament to raise the issue of our official seat in order to press for cuts in administrative expenditure. We can certainly call for reduced spending in general, because each of us could list examples of savings that could be made, and these would far exceed the travel expenses of the officials who have to travel from Luxembourg to Brussels or Strasbourg. I should also emphasise that it costs far more to travel to Strasbourg from Brussels. Many people will be blissfully unaware of the fact that this is actually an indirect attack on Strasbourg too.</p>
<p class="contents">Back in July, Parliament decided by a narrow majority that, during the 12 plenary weeks when we would have to meet in Strasbourg in the course of 2001, the House would only sit from Monday afternoon until Thursday, the Friday sittings being discontinued, a decision which was, in itself, a first tilt at Strasbourg.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps the French have even resigned themselves to this, if we are to believe the report in a German newspaper on 13 December, according to which President Chirac, in a piece of out-and-out horse-trading, is supposed to have promised the recalcitrant Belgian Prime Minister (who is now being hailed as the hero of Nice) that in future all summit meetings, as well as an additional week of plenary sittings of the European Parliament, would be held in Brussels. This was allegedly the price for the 'hero of Nice' agreeing to accept fewer votes in the Council than the more populous Netherlands under the system of qualified majority voting.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of this paragraph will undoubtedly coincide with the re-emergence of the paper produced by a Vice-President of this Parliament who wants to shift all the services and the Directorate-General from Luxembourg to Brussels. According to his plan, Luxembourg will continue to house no more than a handful of technical services such as the print shop and the translation service. This would clearly violate the letter and spirit of the aforementioned decisions taken by the Heads of State and Government regarding the seat of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The advocates of this relocation of the Secretariat-General from Luxembourg to Brussels are naturally unconcerned about the social and human implications of such a move for the officials and their families, many of whom have lived in Luxembourg for decades and have bought houses there; our officials have children at school there and spouses who work there.</p>
<p class="contents">Here in Parliament we take every suitable opportunity, as well as some unsuitable opportunities, to adopt resolutions about the reunification of families. Yet we want to tear the families of our own officials apart, especially those in the D, C and B grades, who cannot afford expensive removals and all the other financial burdens such moves entail, on the basis of the spurious argument that we have to cut costs in this particular way. We cannot and must not allow this to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">This also means, of course, that the Government of Luxembourg is once more being called upon not only to be vigilant but also to guarantee compliance with contractual agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The budget will allow the EU to implement its priority activities whilst, at the same time, maintaining budgetary discipline. The EU’s budget for next year is one of the smallest relative to the size of the Member States’ GDP.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget for 2001 is largely based on a compromise between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, which we support. Parliament has succeeded in driving through a number of important prioritisations – including increased efforts in the struggle against unemployment and poverty, a number of important environmental and equality issues, etc. We have voted against the right’s attacks on the LIFE programme and the European Women’s Lobby.</p>
<p class="contents">We have thus found the funds required in order to be able to provide strong support to the reconstruction and democratisation of the Balkans, including now in Serbia. However, the need for a long-term solution for future budget years remains.</p>
<p class="contents">We are critical of the scope and orientation of the EU’s agriculture policy. This needs to undergo more extensive reform in the future, partly so as to provide room for the enlargement of the EU. The EU’s agriculture policy is far too expensive. Moreover, we are highly critical of the over-production of agricultural produce and of the use of information funds by the EU to sell this surplus. We are also very critical of the extensive support given to tobacco production which, in our opinion, directly conflicts with the EU’s heightened ambitions in the area of public health.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also like to emphasise how important it is that the implementation of the EU’s budget is made more efficient, so that we can get a grip on the problem of the substantial backlog that exists in certain areas. The budgetary system, along with the methods for openness, auditing and political control, need to be improved and modernised quickly. We Scandinavian Social Democrats have also succeeded in driving through a proposal for increased support to local and regional cooperation in the Baltic region, which now amounts to EUR 16 million. Parliament has also increased the budget for twin town cooperation, which we consider to be an important programme for promoting local cooperation within the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If budgetary moderation is to be accepted, it must apply across the board.</p>
<p class="contents">The conciliation meeting of 23 November enshrined the use of all the sums available under the flexibility instrument, totalling EUR 200 million, for Serbia, and this is to be welcomed, even if we must deplore the fact that Parliament has had to reverse the decision it took at first reading, which favoured MEDA. In addition to the EUR 200 million of emergency aid deducted from the 2000 budget so that the Serbs are able to get through the winter in as tolerable conditions as possible, following the trialogue held in October, EUR 240 million will be provided in 2001 under aid for the Balkans, whilst the “Prodi” proposals ought to enable us to dedicate some EUR 2.2 billion to getting this region, particularly the Former Republic of Yugoslavia, back on its feet over a period of years.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is thereby now conceding, admittedly rather late in the day, the importance of substantial aid to the Republic of Yugoslavia, which is at a low ebb, and of doing so whilst respecting its borders. The size of the allocation that has been earmarked for Kosovo does not mean that there are not legitimate questions as to the real capacity of this region of Yugoslavia to absorb the EUR 350 million that were initially earmarked to be given to it in 2001. A precise and thorough assessment must therefore be carried out of all reconstruction needs in the various regions of the Former Republic of Yugoslavia. We must also recognise Belgrade as our only legitimate partner in dialogue, for all future actions; otherwise, the European Union will run the risk of appearing to support and encourage the separatist and terrorist movements in the region.</p>

<p class="contents">The liberalisation of postal services is one of the fundamental dossiers connected with the concept of services of general interest and, more generally, with preserving the European Union’s social and territorial cohesion. In addition to the technical but necessary vision of what we wish to preserve in the field of universal service and of what we would like to open up to competition, there is the implementation of the “European social model”. How far must liberalisation be taken? Why should we try to speed up the process, which is what the executive Commission and Commissioner Bolkestein wanted? Why should we try to dismantle services which are useful and appreciated by our citizens, by denying them adequate financial resources and by making them dependent on an obsolete and punishing system of subsidies?</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot, of course, undermine the principle of the adaptability of public services, which is what the Commission suggested, since this lies at the very heart of the history of most of our countries and which we consider to be very important. I do not think that this is at all reasonable and, fortunately, we were to put things right during the vote in the parliamentary committee.

It is easy for the supporters of qualified liberalism to be satisfied with a text that waters down Commissioner Bolkestein’s ultraliberal proposal, which is founded entirely on ideological reasoning.</p>

In the report now adopted, just a fraction of postal services would be liberalised and no final date has been set for that liberalisation. We Members who were in the minority would have liked the final date of 2007 to have been agreed upon. By that time, more than 17 years will have elapsed since this matter was first discussed at EU level.</p>
<p class="contents">A fixed date would act as an incentive for the post office to develop and modernise its services and would make planning and market investment easier. Now that Parliament has failed to set a date the imbalance that exists between national post offices will continue, as some markets will be open and some will not. As with other markets, traditional, national frontiers in the postal sector have now lost their meaning. It is impossible to struggle against this inescapable development and, for that reason, we should start to prepare for it as soon as we can. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This support, however, has been conditional on the preservation of a high quality universal service. This is indispensable, especially for rural, remote and sparsely populated areas and even for certain parts of towns and cities too. In such places, postmen perform what I might even describe as a socio-cultural function, a function that I sincerely hope we can afford to maintain in our affluent society.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs I tabled a number of amendments to the Commission proposal. All the amendments relating to the recitals were adopted, but then, all of a sudden, along came a number of my honourable colleagues, some of whom were not members of the committee, and agreed to coordinate their votes, which resulted in the rejection of the amendments to the articles corresponding to the amended recitals. This naturally produced an utter shambles, which prompted a majority of the committee members, quite rightly, to reject this half-baked document. For that reason, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs was unable to formulate an opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore particularly grateful to the rapporteur of the lead committee, Mr Markus Ferber, for having produced an acceptable compromise which largely takes account of the letter and spirit of my amendments. I can live with this, especially since</p>
<p class="contents">- it does not contain a new definition of special services, and</p>
<p class="contents">- the price and weight limits are set at reasonable levels, with weights of up to 150 grams remaining the sole preserve of the universal service, linked with a price ceiling of four times the public tariff.</p>
<p class="contents">The limits of 50 grams and two and a half times the public tariff are truly too drastic and would have had dire consequences for the providers of universal postal services. This would also have been the case if outgoing cross-border mail and express services had been entirely liberalised, which the Luxembourg postal service in particular, because of our country's size and geographical situation, could not have withstood. The compromise takes account of my amendment to this effect, which means that I can endorse the report with a clear conscience at this first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I repudiate the insinuations made by those who advocate forced liberalisation with no regard for the loss of people's quality of life and jobs, who seek to present me and the honourable Members who share my view as acting on behalf of the post-office lobby which is intent on preserving its monopoly. I emphatically reject such insinuations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They will keep the pressure on, and they are strengthening their position with the revenue they are generating from delivering mail above 150 grams. The debate on the future organisation of the postal services has not entered the home straight by a long chalk.</p>
<p class="contents">We have known that the extreme liberalisation proposal brought forward by the European Commission had no chance of survival since rapporteur Ferber made a few critical proposals with regard to further research, meticulousness and deadlines. The situation became even more clear-cut when Christian Democrats and Social Democrats concluded a secret deal on a compromise solution between liberalisation and non-liberalisation which was to be defended jointly by the two groups. The 50 and 350 grams weight scales were divided, 150 grams being the dividing line. That translates into 100 popular grams gained by the Right and 200 less popular grams going to the Left.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Social Democrat and Christian Democrat compromise had been the main issue from early on in the debate, it would not have received my support, because the drawbacks of any liberalisation outstrip the benefits. Although the present outcome constitutes a defeat for Commissioner Bolkestein, I believe I must remain faithful to that guiding principle and I therefore adhere to my no-vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rejection of that proposal from the outset reflected a generalised feeling of mistrust and was a sign of strength for countries like Portugal against the liberalising tendencies of the Nordic countries and the Commission itself, which tried, absolutely in vain as we have seen, to impose a position that the majority of Member States did not agree with. It was thus made clear that an exclusively competitive approach does not satisfy the interests of their populations.</p>
<p class="contents">The social function of public service must not be forgotten, and that is something I have fought for. Today, postal correspondence is still the means by which part of the Portuguese population chooses to keep its family ties alive. In addition, it still performs an important economic and social role, both in receiving payments for public services, such as water, electricity, telephone, etc., and in paying out retirement pensions, disability benefits and subsistence allowances. It is not possible to make a suitable transition to a totally open market without providing for a continuation of these services. Furthermore, if approved, the drastic changes in weight and price limits for mail proposed by the Commission would have extremely detrimental effects on the Portuguese postal service, resulting in significant market losses and quite negative social implications.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that we have voted on this report in the December session is extremely important. This is a codecision process which, as well as highlighting the importance of Parliament’s role, will also strengthen its position at the next meeting of the telecommunications Council still to take place this year, on 22 December. Parliament is thus sending the Commission a strong signal regarding its reservations on the total liberalisation of the postal market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The following observations have played a role in the outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">In an economy where competition is cut-throat, digital information must be able to offer quality. When considering what can and must be offered in terms of digital content, the principle of technological neutrality forms part of the European policy – and rightly so. Accordingly, rules and regulations on printed information also apply to digital information. This aspect has not been sufficiently highlighted in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms forms a framework delineating the content for the sake of consumer protection. Pursuant to Article 10, freedom of expression goes hand in hand with duties and responsibilities which can result in conditions, restrictions and sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this, regarding digital content, governments must, among other things, act in the interest of preventing criminal offences (discrimination), protecting public health (for example, provision of badly controlled medicines via the Internet), public decency or the rights of others (copyrights). We must avoid lending any support to content which goes against the said interests. The report fails to point this out.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the report takes an approach to linguistic and cultural diversity which is too negative. Amendment No 8 reduces these to barriers to industrial development. This is said to be in conflict with respect for national identity (Article 6(3) of the Treaty on European Union). Legislation is different in each Member State so as to accommodate this national identity in terms of society, language and ethics, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">It would, therefore, be useful if the EU Member States were to ponder the question as to whose legislation should apply at European level. In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, Community activities must focus on those areas where activity at Community level offers added value. A lack of resources at Community level should not be the reason behind spurring Member States into action, as is the case in the draft report.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, digital information offers candidate countries with an ailing rail and road infrastructure possibilities for economic development. It is not enough to spread expertise, however. Flanking policy is vital if we are actually to benefit from the knowledge society. This may comprise organisational and technical structures, as well as training. The report does not give sufficient consideration to this aspect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This programme is part of the <span class="italic">e</span>-Europe initiative, “an information society for all” by the European Union (EU), launched by the Commission in December 1999. It will cover a period of five years, from 2001 to 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">The four main objectives of this initiative are: firstly, to create favourable conditions for the commercialisation, distribution and use of European digital content in the global networks in order to encourage economic activity and to increase prospects for employment. Secondly, to encourage the exploitation of the potential of European digital content and particularly of public sector information. Thirdly, to promote multilingualism in digital content on the global networks and to increase export opportunities for European content companies, particularly the SMEs, through linguistic customisation. Finally and most importantly, to contribute to the professional, social and cultural development of the European Union’s citizens and to facilitate the economic and social integration of the citizens of the candidate countries into the information society.</p>
<p class="contents">We can only be delighted at such an initiative knowing as we do that the value of European digital content represents 5% of the European GDP and provides four million jobs. Furthermore, the digital media sector could achieve 20% annual growth over the next decade. Our businesses must be able to benefit from this growth. We must put them in a position where they can compete with the United States, which dominates this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I must reiterate the fourth objective, which is designed to ensure that the information society benefits everyone, both men and women. The danger of a digital divide being created is indeed considerable, but even though the truth of this statement cannot be denied, the European Commission is not proposing any measures to prevent this divide being created. I find this unacceptable. I therefore backed the amendments that seek the adoption of specific actions. As rapporteur on universal service and the new communication networks, I think it is crucial to guarantee all our citizens access to the new information and communications technologies. I shall personally do my best to ensure that this happens in the report that I have been asked to produce. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Europe is clearly in a position to respond to the challenge of the markets, due to its advantages in economic and employment terms, and, of course, due to its cultural wealth and linguistic diversity – which are shown clearly in the concept of linguistic minorities and regional languages – over the monolingualism that characterises much of the “Web”.</p>
<p class="contents">The variety of languages and cultures – particularly if we also take account of the potential offered by new Member States – also allows us, especially where the SMEs are concerned, to facilitate exchanges and to export Europe’s cultural values, and to do so in multilingual forms characterised by an increasing interaction with translation systems.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be emphasised that linguistic minorities, rather than being overwhelmed by the globalisation brought about by the Internet, have discovered that it opens up new cultural and economic horizons.</p>

<p class="contents">What the text says about the necessary linguistic and cultural customisation is, however, sometimes frustrating: the encouragement to produce programmes on regional languages and on the “ethnic minorities” that are represented in the Union is a decision whose predictable consequences are the gradual erosion of national identities.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of digital information, the linguistic vehicle holds a competitive advantage, a style of reasoning and a legal position that favour those in whose mother tongue it appears. In these circumstances, it is in large part the coherence and the unity of the United States that have guaranteed that country its pre-eminent position in this market of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">And what are we going to do to counter this American dominance? We are going to “balkanise” our cultural products!</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with this situation, the ‘bluecoat’ will find nothing but a stream of inward-looking Indian tribes who will take it upon themselves to communicate with the outside world in the only common denominator: their master’s voice, whose insidious totalitarianism gives the impression of having been liberated from the most immediate control. We have already heard vivid examples in this Parliament of separatist Members who would rather speak in English than in the official language of their Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Leaving aside the technical problems that will arise when, in order to respect the text, we will need to find a system for switching from Kurdish to Breton… The most serious aspect, however, is that these measures are an attack on the linguistic unity and therefore on the whole unity of the Member States: citizenship is underpinned, in almost all of Europe’s nations, by several pillars, of which acceptance of one official language in the national community is one of the most important. Some Member States, who practise linguistic partition on a daily basis, know that this inevitably leads to political partition and the collapse of a sense of nationhood.</p>

<p class="contents">Institutionalising the laws of the jungle, according to which the strong endeavour to destroy the weak, would inevitably lead to the institutional cobbling-together that we saw at Nice. The only thing that reins in the European Union’s four main powers from imposing their joint domination on Europe is the fact that they also see each other as rivals.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth noting that apart from the British exception on taxation, or the French exception on cultural products, every major state managed to protect the aspects that its elite considers important. Therefore, in the social field, it was the United Kingdom, whose legislation is the most inadequate of all the large countries, who proposed the British exception. No Member State, however, proposed the social exception to preserve the aspects of its own social legislation that are the least unfavourable to workers or to oppose the privatisation of public services.</p>
<p class="contents">This proves the point that workers and the working classes can expect nothing better from the European Union than from their own national state, in other words, equality to a lower common denominator, weaker social protection, the destruction of public services and a drop in their standard of living. I therefore voted against this resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a result, the balance of power in the European Union is on a reasonably even keel. The European Union is now ready for the candidate countries to join. Had no agreement been reached, the European Union would have been plunged into deep crisis from which it would have been difficult to emerge. In this light, we should be positive about this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">National interests play their part in determining the balance of power. That is inherent to the problem and does not bear witness to a short-term vision, as Paragraph 5 of the resolution suggests. In this respect, the tenor of the common resolution is far too one-sided.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution is also one-sided in that it takes it too much for granted that the extension of power and authority for the European institutions is, by definition, beneficial. What matters in Europe is that different peoples are able to co-exist in peace and cooperate, where necessary. The European institutions play a key role in this. The European Commission acts as guardian of the general European interest, and the European Parliament as a counterweight to Commission and Council. However, this role does not mean that their authority should be extended ad infinitum. The Community method is suited to tackling cross-border issues but is no miracle cure to solve all problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, I cannot back the extension of authority provided to the Chairman of the European Commission, who gains too much power in this way. This completely lacks legitimacy. I cannot be upbeat about the declaration of the Charter either. This Charter only has symbolic value and that is detrimental to the actual protection of fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither will I deny the fact that there is room for negotiation with regard to the outcome of Nice. The European Union could have displayed more democracy and transparency. The fact that this did not happen is a missed opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can only welcome such a move.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we are much less enthusiastic about the rest of the institutional negotiations. The Heads of State and Government locked themselves into short-term haggling, without any great vision of Europe’s future. They “patched up” the Community machine in order to prolong its lifespan in the face of enlargement. They may have succeeded in this, at least for the moment, but at the cost of serious problems, such as greater supranationality, less democracy and greater German influence in the decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the form of the Council, we note that it ended at dawn on the fifth day of negotiations, amid general exhaustion and uncertainty as to the exact shape that many of the decisions would take. The delay in the publication of the written conclusions – which are still not officially available, four days later – is a good illustration of the difficulty in clearly drawing up decisions taken in a state of confusion. Once again, in the haste and improvisation of the last night of the Council, very wide ranging measures that had not previously been discussed were adopted, such as the appointment by qualified majority of the President and the members of the Commission, which was not even mentioned for information only in the summary distributed by the Presidency before the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish to state once again that this method of decision making is completely unacceptable in democratic countries. The solution, however, is certainly not, as the federalists propose, to have the IGCs prepared by conventions such as the one that drafted the Charter of Fundamental Rights, because this would simply increase confusion, one-upmanship and a lack of realism. On the contrary, future IGCs must now deliberate on a more solid basis, an agenda consisting of proposals adopted by a minimum number – for example, a third – of national parliaments. This is the only way to refocus the discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the substance, we can decipher, from the tangled web of commitments, at least two tendencies that have been superimposed on one another. These are firstly the advance of supranationality to the detriment of national democracies and secondly the advance of German positions in the supranational decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the first tendency, the main aspect to highlight is the immediate or soon to take place extension of qualified majority voting on major issues, such as asylum and immigration policy, international agreements in the field of services and copyright, or even the appointment of Commissioners. Despite a slight increase in the threshold for qualified majority voting, the scope of which remains to be seen, this extension is bound to mean that the gap will increase further still between the European institutions and national democracies. With regard to the trade negotiations mentioned earlier, for example, national parliaments will lose their last rights of ratification, and if a country is in a minority in the Council, it will no longer be able to say ‘no’ if negotiations threaten its interests.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we should not be under any illusions about the apparent retention of parity in France and Germany’s votes in the Council: this is a trick of the light, because the new “demographic net” rule – the creation of a blocking minority representing 38% of the population – will automatically favour Germany, which alone will hold almost half of this minority following enlargement to 27 members. Germany will therefore find it easier than the others to reach the blocking threshold, by adding a few smaller countries to its sphere of influence. At the same time, the discrepancy between the number of German Members of the European Parliament and those from other countries such as France is increasing even further, which will have certain consequences in the context of the decision-making powers acquired by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Some people may consider this development to be perfectly legitimate, because it tends to transpose the weighting of each country into the institutions according to the size of their populations. This method of calculation, however, is based on the implicit assumption that there is a single European people, which is not the case. The only way of preventing dangerous conflicts in future is to adhere to the traditional concept, according to which Europe is founded on mutual respect between national communities. For example, the new method of appointing the President of the Commission, which is by qualified majority in the Council and simple majority in the European Parliament, leads straight to appointing office-holders who may not enjoy the support of all the countries, whereas they will, almost out of necessity, enjoy the support of Germany. Have we properly considered the upheavals that such measures could cause to the philosophy of the European institutions, and the misdeeds that they may produce? The French should also ask themselves whether this new method of appointing the President of the Commission, together with the increased power of that position, is in complete accordance with the Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Can this new Europe last? Theoretically, it cannot, because it will, of its own accord, increasingly become cut off from national democracies. In practice, however, its proponents have had the skill, by making enhanced cooperation more flexible, to introduce a degree of flexibility, which will make it easier for the shock of enlargement to be absorbed. In time, however, this will not be enough, because the ultra-federal hard core will make the democratic deficit in Europe worse. That is why we urge the French Parliament to prevent a serious crisis arising in Europe’s future by refusing to ratify the Treaty of Nice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For us it was crucial in the entire process surrounding this Intergovernmental Conference that the last formal barriers to the enlargement of the EU be removed. This aim was achieved in Nice, and seen in this light the summit was a success. A number of members of the European Parliament argued in very strong terms for the agenda to be expanded. We warned against this on repeated occasions and the events in Nice show with all the clarity one could ask for that a substantially broader agenda could have resulted in no result whatsoever being achieved this year, with catastrophic consequences for enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also always believed that a balanced solution between small and big countries should be found in connection with the composition of the Commission, voting rights in the Council of Ministers and the composition of Parliament. On this point, too, we believe that a satisfactory result has been achieved. However, we note that the formal opportunities for achieving qualified majority voting have been restricted and that qualified majority voting has been introduced only in a limited number of areas. There is thus a real risk that it will become more difficult to implement essential legislation on the environment, consumer protection and the working environment, and we strongly recommend the states to demonstrate responsibility and to make the decision-making procedures in the Council more efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with the new Treaty of Nice it was decided that preparations should be commenced for the next Intergovernmental Conference. We believe that it is important to take plenty of time and find a form worthy of modern, practical EU cooperation, and that a power game such as was played out in Nice must not prevail. It does not help to encourage public support for cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Everyone today agrees that this Treaty will be mediocre and that it will fall considerably short of the expectations of the European Parliament and of “true” Europeans! The debates in Parliament have made this quite clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Without wishing to deny some positive points of progress that were made, it would be no exaggeration to say that the Treaty of Nice will not guarantee Europe’s institutional and political future.</p>
<p class="contents">Should the blame for this be laid at the door of the French Presidency? I say, quite clearly, ‘NO’! That would be too simple!</p>
<p class="contents">The mediocrity of the Nice conclusions is the sad outcome of the lack of European ambitions of ALL the Member States, and of the stubborn defence of their “private domains” and their last illusions of power.</p>
<p class="contents">Given these circumstances, the absence of “great European voices” did the rest and that is why I think that the Nice agreement is a lesser evil and certainly the “least bad” outcome that could have been achieved in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">We must now focus on the results that have been achieved and, above all, rely on the commitments that have been given in order to relaunch European ambition whatever the draft treaty may be and the future that the European Parliament has in store for it.</p>
<p class="contents">We still have a few months to work on this until the end of 2003 in order to save the European project. Today I voted in favour of the resolution.

Each Member State, big and small, had its own priorities, its own objectives. That is natural. The fact that an agreement was reached on very difficult issues should not be underestimated. It was a huge task. The basis for the future enlargement of the European Union has been laid down. The negotiations were tough but the strength of the Union was shown in the fact that there was a determination to find solutions agreeable to all. In the spirit of compromise, a way forward was found. The resolution on Nice, voted today, does not reflect this. I abstained on the final vote as I believe Parliament fails to recognise the achievements of Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">The tone of the resolution is negative. It does not reflect the positive outcome of the summit. The Charter of Fundamental Rights was proclaimed. Such rights are already very well safeguarded in Ireland's own Constitution. Important decisions were taken on social and economic issues, the establishment of the European Food Authority and the impact of the BSE crisis was considered.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of the intervention of Ireland's Prime Minister, the Commission has been mandated to analyse the situation now confronting beef producers and will make the necessary proposals as soon as possible to find a way to compensate beef producers for the fall in prices.</p>
<p class="contents">The Applicant States were reassured of our determination to advance the enlargement process.</p>
<p class="contents">The text says the Heads of State gave priority to short-term national interests rather than EU interests. I do not agree. What was agreed was agreed in the best interests of Europe and the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Opting now for a Convention or a European constitution is premature.</p>
<p class="contents">A balance was found at Nice and the Heads of Government and State must be congratulated on this. This was one of the most protracted issues and difficult elements of the negotiations. Despite the successful efforts of the Nice Summit in this area, the resolution expresses dissatisfaction with the new extension of the scope of qualified majority. In other words, what Parliament wants is control over taxation and social security issues. The Nice Summit properly reflects the interests of the Member States in this area.</p>

Those who see their power strengthened are the large countries, especially Germany, France and the United Kingdom, which, in practice, can wreck any decision by forming a blocking minority. This situation is exacerbated by the extension of decision making by qualified majority, under which, in certain circumstances, only 14 countries can make decisions on behalf of the 27 or 28, thus, in practice, eliminating the right of veto on policies that are highly important for Portugal, such as the Structural Funds or commercial policy agreements. In addition, Portugal also loses members in the European Parliament, because, although the 700 barrier will have been passed for a European Union with 27 Member States, the number of Members per state will be reduced, and this will affect certain countries, including Portugal in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly a mention of social policy, which France had backed when it opened its Presidency, but which ended up amounting to very little, apart from the declarations of intent and the titles of documents with very vague contents which clearly did not match up to the existing problems and the enormous discontent, of which the workers’ demonstration in Nice was also a major expression. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, neither the adoption of a Charter of Fundamental Rights on the cheap, nor the extension of qualified majority voting in areas of lesser importance, nor the on-going liberalisation of public services, nor the increasingly widespread use of enhanced cooperation in the field of defence will persuade the European public that Europe is heading in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">The Nice Summit is a failure for the French Presidency and, more particularly, for European social democrats. But could it have been any other way when we see dossiers such as the Tobin tax, tax havens, maritime safety or even the fight against unemployment and job insecurity unable to progress beyond being declarations of intent or virtual projects, which have neither the resources nor the agenda to be implemented?</p>
<p class="contents">We could have led Europe in another direction, largely by taking account of the demands made through the demonstrations and the forums which have been held in parallel with the “Acropolis” Summit. The governments, however, remained deaf to what the public was saying. The French Government preferred to resort to force and violence rather than hold democratic debate. This attitude is unacceptable, as was the closure of the French-Italian border or the many arrests of demonstrators, whose immediate release we are calling for.</p>

What the Heads of State and Government delivered at the weekend is totally inadequate. Neither the 'significant added value' nor the 'route map to enlargement' for which Romano Prodi had hoped were achieved. On the contrary, the people of Europe and their Parliament have experienced a 'regression from Amsterdam'. These Council decisions, cobbled together in late-night sessions, do not constitute solid foundations; they are riddled with holes large enough for concepts such as transparency, the creation of a European identity, more democracy, popular participation and reformism to slip right through.</p>
<p class="contents">The information currently at our disposal suggests that there were some successes, such as intensified cooperation, the party statute and the declaration of intent on eastward enlargement, but the compromises that materialised were mostly minimal. As at a Christmas market, Member States set out their stalls on which various national interests were displayed with price tags attached. Moves towards greater convergence were blatantly obstructed.</p>
<p class="contents">I was bitterly disappointed by the French Presidency of the Council before and during the negotiations. The prompting from the chair was half-hearted; the active contribution of the presidency consisted in proposing a deluge of compromises with only one thing in common, namely their inability to attract majority support. This was domestic politicking for the sake of a forthcoming election. The engine of European unification was left idling in this very country which, for all its specific national interests, has invariably acted as a <span class="italic">grande nation</span> in the service of the European ideal. The <span class="italic">amitié franco-allemande</span> [friendship between France and Germany] has always been the linchpin of the European Union. It is sorely missed today.</p>
<p class="contents">Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, who is noted in Germany for his brusque manner, for bringing discussions to an abrupt halt with the word <span class="italic">Basta! </span>('Enough!'), a graceless and uninterested player on the European stage, omitted to consult his neighbours from the Seine in good time. Instead, he trumpeted his intentions through his favourite mouthpiece, the media. The high public profile of his call for more German influence in the Council, in other words for more votes than France, which has over 20 million fewer inhabitants than Germany, totally devalued its substance, making it appear like a bargaining chip in a thinly veiled tactical manoeuvre.</p>
<p class="contents">Unanimous decisions, and hence an inherent incapacity to act, remain largely the norm in the Council. Qualified majority voting has been extended to more than 30 additional provisions, but these provisions cover matters of minor significance. In the really important areas such as taxes, public levies, social policy, asylum and immigration, the old order has evidently survived. We are further than ever from generalised qualified majority voting in the Council, which would have led to codecision rights for the European Parliament. In the realm of structural policy, which accounts for three quarters of the total volume of the Community budget, Parliament is totally excluded from the legislative process!</p>
<p class="contents">Decision making in the Council has become more complicated. A threefold majority must be achieved before decisions can be taken, and the required quotas of votes have been increased. Not a single iota of transparency in sight! I believe there is an urgent need to revise the system of Intergovernmental Conferences where the participants endeavour to hold each other in check and acclaim the assertion of petty national interests as great triumphs. These conferences should be replaced by a convention, similar to the one that was established to draw up the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Under the excellent chairmanship of Roman Herzog, the convention held open and constructive meetings, involving national and European parliamentarians; non-governmental organisations, business and labour organisations and interested individuals were not sidelined but actually felt involved and knew that their opinions were valued.</p>
<p class="contents">All that remains for us now is to subject the details of the summit agreements to careful scrutiny over the coming weeks. In the post-Nice process, major changes must be achieved in the decisions as they now stand. The people of Europe deserve a substantially improved outcome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, no other summit has ever had to face the prospect of such a vast expansion as this. We must therefore see its conclusions as the result of a compromise in which nobody was entirely the winner or entirely the loser.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the Fifteen managed to agree on certain institutional changes that are indispensable if the Union is to function with a substantially higher number of members. Two changes that stand out are the commitment that each Member State will retain the right to appoint a commissioner and the adoption of better rules for access to the closer cooperation mechanism. Other positive aspects of this summit are the fact that the unanimity rule has been kept for decisions on both the Structural Funds and taxation, key areas for countries like Portugal which still need the solidarity of the European Union and the use of the tax system for a policy encouraging investment and saving.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot, however, ignore the fact that the solutions found for the complex decision-making system in the Council and the corresponding vote weighting increase the gap between the more and the less highly populated states, which is something we regard as less positive because of our concept of a Europe of sovereign nations.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution that was approved in this Parliament does not reflect these positions and concerns of ours, and even sends out an appeal for the current method of Intergovernmental Conferences to be abandoned in future. In our view, for as long as Europe is what it is, questions of a constitutional nature or of fundamental interest for the States, such as those that were debated in Nice, should not be resolved by any other means; that is, they should require unanimity. That is why my vote on this matter was negative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is obviously a political pretence: the true democracy of Europe is what happened there and not what was artificially planned by a majority in this House which is out of touch with the feelings of the peoples of Europe. It is the same pretence which accompanied the earlier debates and which explains this resounding ‘failure’. The ‘failure’ arises basically from the unrealistic way in which they represent the process of building Europe. I refuse to recognise that this Parliament has some higher legitimacy; instead, I recognise in the Heads of State and Government of the Fifteen meeting in Nice the full democratic legitimacy of representing their respective peoples and nations, resulting from high-turnout elections. Thus, notwithstanding reservations about the Treaty, I above all oppose the sentiments expressed by the majority of this House, which, unfortunately, has still failed to learn from the facts and instead insists on approaches that will simply lead to more frustration.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The spectacular growth of air traffic over the past couple of years is the direct result of the proportionately lower price which consumers pay for this mode of transport. Not only reduced staffing levels and other cuts, but also government policy have brought the prices down. From a taxation point of view, air traffic is given preferential treatment compared to land-based transport. If those effects had been foreseen in the year I was born (1944) when the Chicago Convention was concluded, it is unlikely that tax exemption for fuel and other aircraft necessities would have been agreed upon.</p>
<p class="contents">The growth of air traffic is at the expense of rail traffic and the environment. It would be desirable if aircraft were no longer used for relatively short distances up to 1 000 km and if air traffic were restricted to intercontinental transport. I am indignant at the largest group and its attempt, within the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, to keep taxation on air traffic out of the equation as much as possible at a time when other groups were under-represented, because this did not do justice to the actual relations within that committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As there is no such thing as zero risk, scientists – or at least politicians – should apply the criterion of proportionality, consider there to be risks and assume their responsibilities. It goes without saying that citizens must, in any event, be fully informed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
