This report is not about who you should accept as a refugee, and I remind Mr Schmitt of that, but about how you decide which claims are valid.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a great fallacy to assume that if you give asylum seekers less help in making their claims, they will somehow disappear and cost less time and money. Governments in search of populist headlines about the number of applications rejected from so-called bogus asylum seekers should tell the truth. The truth is that cutting corners early on in the procedure ends up costing a lot more in administration, court time, lawyers and the cost of food and shelter. I fear that Mr Schmitt did not understand this truth and has somehow misled Members of his group. I appeal therefore to those moderate Members of the Conservative/Christian Democrat Group to join the majority in this Parliament in strengthening the guarantees in the asylum procedure, because investment in high quality initial decisions including such matters as assistance with interpretation, legal advice, proper interviews and reasonable time limits, is a good bargain.</p>
<p class="contents">Then on the question of fair treatment I would like to stress in particular the use of the safe third country concept. My group accepts the use of this concept as a guidance, but it must be one which is capable of being rebutted in an individual case. It is perfectly fair that an asylum seeker from, say, Canada, will have a greater job convincing the authorities that asylum is justified, compared to someone coming for example from Iraq. But it should be possible to make that case through individual assessment, not with a blanket dismissal of the claim. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to add: humanity, respect for human rights and equality before the law. So, within that context, I welcome much of the report now presented by Mr Watson: That perspective however, also explains why my group will not be supporting amendments proposed by the PPE-DE Group which we rejected in committee and which we believe seek to restrict the rights of asylum seekers.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly welcome some of the amendments proposed by the committee, which state that the right to refugee status should be recognised rather than granted: refugee status is a legal right, not the gift of a benevolent regime. I also welcome the recognition that there are forms of persecution which are not included in the Geneva Convention. We debated such an issue in this House only last night, that of female genital mutilation. My group believes that we should be building on the Geneva Convention and that hopefully a common asylum policy will eventually do that. We also welcome the fact that the gender dimension is now recognised in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">We also welcome the recognition of the need for the interviewing and assessment process for asylum applications to take place in the applicant's own language. This is crucial as the outcome of such procedures can literally be a matter of life or death for the applicant. How can we expect an individual who has suffered torture, humiliation or sexual degradation to express that in a language in which they can just get by.</p>
<p class="contents">My group, however, rejects the concept of a safe third country. When we look at the huge variation between Members States of what they view as safe we can see the problems raised by this concept, especially taking new forms of persecution into account. As Baroness Ludford has said, every application must be dealt with on its own merits. We need the highest standards possible, and in that respect, this report has made substantial improvements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hear quite a few people talking about a common European asylum policy. Indeed, that might well be a very sensible idea, but I want, for my part, to say that the prerequisite for my being able to support it is that it should be a sound policy. The rapporteur originally tried to word this report in such a way that it restricted asylum seekers’ rights and opportunities in our countries. What the committee finally agreed upon was to require that we should end up with a policy which, if anything, amounted to the status quo. I think it would be a good thing if the European Parliament could send out a clear signal now that, if there is to be a common asylum policy in the EU, it must in no circumstances be a policy that provides asylum seekers with poorer conditions than those under which they are at present living in the Member States. I very much hope that the result of the vote we are to hold this afternoon will be to send out such a signal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One is that we are erecting a ‘fortress Europe’ where foreigners are no longer welcome and where we do not take the slightest notice of the rest of the world. That is not what we want, nor is it in line with international obligations. The EU Member States must look after refugees, and not only refugees at their own backdoor, but also refugees elsewhere. Although the Commission’s proposal is not related to this, I still believe it is necessary to draw attention to the many refugees in camps. They too deserve support and attention, often more than they are receiving now. That is why the UNHCR must be given a huge financial boost.</p>
<p class="contents">No fortress Europe, therefore, but there is also another risk. That is that Europe might be turning into a kind of playground to which almost everyone can gain easy access to enjoy the many benefits it has to offer. That is not want we want either. It places too heavy a burden on the facilities of the European states. In this day and age, when evidently many find the money and the means to come to Europe and seek asylum, asylum procedures must be strict and straightforward. Otherwise, life in the refugee camps will be in even starker contrast to this ideal. The Commission proposal is now a sober and realistic document which generally strikes the right balance between straightforward procedures and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the amendments tabled by this Parliament with regard to the Commission document often lack the necessary balance. That is why I cannot support the majority of these. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berthu (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, the proposal for a Council directive on procedures for granting refugee status, which, as defined in the Treaty, is supposed to be binding on the Member States as regards the outcome to be achieved, whilst leaving it to the national authorities to decide what procedures and means to employ, is in fact an extremely nit-picking document. For example, it goes into inordinate length and detail on the definition of an unfounded application for asylum, in Article 28, of a safe third country, in Article 22 and in Annex I, and of a safe country of origin, in Annex II. As if the Member States were babes in arms and as if their officials had never processed a single application for asylum in their lives. But what is most extraordinary of all is that this proposal manages to be both nit-picking and lax at the same time. Because there are not many provisions motivated by the concern to grant so-called high-level guarantees to asylum seekers that are not also – and we must not overlook this point – low-level guarantees for the citizens of Member States. Let me quote just one example amongst many, Article 25, which stipulates that if the applicant's declarations are not proven but appear simply to be probable, he should be given the benefit of the doubt. This may seem to be a generous gesture in principle and indeed it is, but in the context of the troubled times in which we find ourselves today it fails to take account of other interests at stake, and above all those of the European public.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we believe that the text before us today should just be the first part of the final directive. Following this first part, which is devoted to the protection of asylum-seekers, a second part needs to be written, which will be devoted to the protection of the European public, who at best will foot the bill for this policy and at worst will be the victims of it. I say that because we should not forget that at least three-quarters of applications for asylum submitted nowadays ultimately turn out to be unfounded. And please do not tell us, Commissioner, that those texts will follow later. They should be presented to us at the same time so that we can take an overall view.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I can scarcely bring myself to mention the amendments proposed in the report from the relevant committee of the European Parliament. I will come back to those in my explanation of vote. Let me just say at this stage that they are so rash that in the end the rapporteur himself ended up resigning and having to be replaced in fairly disastrous circumstances. All these texts, both the directive and the amendments, remind us, against the background of our recent debates on security, that it is extremely unhealthy in times like these to authorise 400 000 to 500 000 asylum-seekers a year to enter our territory, given that the majority will ultimately be turned down, but as they are not expelled, will remain on a semi-clandestine basis. This floating, unchecked population is growing every year and adding to other sources of clandestine immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe, Madam President, having seen the documents before us today, that the European institutions are still a long way from giving priority to the public’s safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is easy to talk about the right to asylum pure and simple, holding it up as a sacred principle, and it is all the more clearly sacred at this sensitive moment when the world is shaken by such dramatic events; solidarity and goodwill are the feelings that we all, in our bewilderment, feel we want to appeal to so that we can build new, better structures between people, worlds and cultures. It is also clear, however, that, right now, we must not deviate from the objective of achieving tangible situations and establishing practical prospects that are closely linked to reality. In the proposal for a directive, as Mr Schmitt has already mentioned, there are some – in our view – complex concepts that conflict with the direction we had embarked on in our work last year and open up certain political problems that, in our opinion, are quite serious. Is it right, for instance, to accept that a third country that is considered safe should always be so regardless of the tangible fact that links it to the asylum seeker? Or that a manifestly unfounded application should, even so, always give rise to a complicated, expensive verification procedure? It goes without saying that certainty on this is in the clear interests both of those who have serious grounds for seeking protection and of the host country itself.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to go into the legal and philosophical concept of what constitutes being manifestly unfounded, but on matters which are now more sensitive than ever such as that addressed by the Watson report, we must show our determination to build without putting up obstacles, and to help without negative or even destructive effects on our social systems. Therefore, when we look at the wording on the extension of the right to asylum, the fast-track procedure and the appeals procedure, I think that, on careful analysis, my doubts will be widely shared. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Schmitt, there is absolute agreement in my group that the three different groups of people arriving in the Union should be dealt with differently. So much so that we supported the Wiebenga report with regard to the first group that you mentioned, with a view to creating regulations on reception for temporary refugees, who come in massive numbers fleeing from conflict, which is something the European Peoples’ Party did not do.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to asylum and refuge, we agree that we should treat asylum seekers as a group of people seeking protection and who want to enter for humanitarian reasons on an equal basis with those seeking reunification with their families. The problem is, Mr Schmitt, that my group cannot renounce, despite what you claim Mr Shily, the German Interior Minister, says, the idea that refugees are individuals and that each case must be treated individually in accordance with personal circumstances and not nationality, as well as the safe non-EU country they have reached, for example. A non-EU country may be safe for one individual but not for another, but do not force me to give examples, since these are always odious.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot relinquish this idea and furthermore, at a time when the European Union is going to produce the first harmonised legislation on refugees, we want to send a clear signal that we are in favour of this common legislation but not in order to reduce levels of protection and rights of asylum seekers, a field in which the European Union has been an historic example and has greatly assisted organisations such as the UNHCR and others.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issue of asylum and immigration, there is no doubt that we agree that immigrants are not refugees. But the problem is that we lack the courage to create clear immigration laws, which would allow the legal entry of people which our society and our labour market can absorb, without destroying the asylum system in the process, which has been the only open door for many years. We are in absolute agreement on this. This is our position and it seems very clear to me. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The increasing flow of refugees in recent years shows the need for a common refugee policy both within the EU and globally.</p>
<p class="contents">The various Member States’ more or less panicky reactions faced with people’s desire to find sanctuary and a new life in Europe have struck a very discordant note, given the humanitarian values the EU stands for. There have been many tragedies on the EU’s borders, involving vessels that have gone down, desperate refugees who have hidden in containers and refugees who have tried to swim their way to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">On many occasions, I have felt depressed by quite a few of the proposals from the Member States and the Commission whose main aim seems to have been to stop, impede, deport and expel. Those who have spoken of an EU that is developing into a fortress Europe are, unfortunately, not completely mistaken.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, this proposal for a directive is along the right lines. The rights of the individual are emphasised, and repressive measures do not dominate. It is certainly true that common asylum rules are needed within the EU, but there also needs to be scope for individual Member States to make more generous assessments. The committee has guaranteed this scope. The committee also strengthens the rights of the individual under the Geneva Convention in relation to the position of children, the ability to hold refugees in custody, greater knowledge on the part of those who have to deal with matters relating to refugees and reasonable periods within which applications are to be processed. Quite simply, it is a question of increased legal certainty.</p>
<p class="contents">I am nonetheless a little uneasy about the Council’s future handling of these issues. We must safeguard the absolute requirement under the Geneva Convention that every refugee shall have his case examined individually, just as Baroness Ludford said.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, there are no safe countries. If, as Europeans, we are not completely to forfeit our good name, a different refugee policy based upon respect, openness and legal certainty is required. It is not countries such as Nauru that can be expected to assume responsibility for people fleeing from barbaric regimes such as that in Afghanistan. Empathy and humanitarianism are required even more now, a week after the tragedy in the United States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I feel that he has succeeded in reconciling various points of view. I personally see this report as complementing both the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Geneva Convention. As the Commission wanted, I believe that we finally have a good basis for discussion. We all know that there was a very wide disparity between the various Member States’ approaches to accepting refugees. We also know that the steps involved were complex and difficult. This report enables us to go somewhat further. And it also enhances the aid and support that we can give to refugees. I am also satisfied that our committee has taken into account the new forms that persecution can take. A few decades ago we were welcoming Chilean and Soviet refugees fleeing from dictatorships and persecution at the hands of their own governments. Nowadays there are certainly forms of repression, which force us to change our mindset and to take into account practices such as the sexual and genital mutilation of women, and new forms of persecution associated with terrorist groups and fundamentalists, and I believe that we have certainly taken that into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">I would even go further and say that it is time that we considered asylum on health grounds bearing in mind that a disaster like AIDS is ravaging a continent, and similarly we should consider accepting child soldiers when they are at the mercy of arms dealers. I believe that it is also important for this report to be adequate in terms of the fight against discrimination. I shall conclude by saying that in recent weeks, in view of the terrifying attacks committed on the United States last week, the fear of attacks against Afghan civilians has become a real one. At present, there are 600 people in the camp at Sangatte who are firmly committed to opposing terrorism. They are asking to be accepted here. I think that if we were able to accept them, this would not only be a way of breaking the perceived link between terrorism and Islam, but that these people would also be solid allies in the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Watson, let me take the liberty of suggesting that we could ascribe that phrase from Camus to you, when he said that his revolt was also the revolt of others. Thank you for your report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This proposal guarantees rapid and reliable procedures for genuine refugees – who account for around 10% of all those who apply for asylum – and also ensures that unsuccessful applications will be rejected quickly. This applies to around 90% of asylum seekers who apply for reasons other than genuine persecution. That is better than being forced to wait for years before being informed of a negative decision. This proposal also puts an end to ‘asylum shopping’. However, we also need supplementary measures. These include the Dublin Convention, Eurodac, and rules on safe third countries and safe countries of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">The European People’s Party therefore supports the Council's proposal. However, on behalf of the PPE-DE, I should like to make it clear that asylum law must not now be exploited for political purposes through all the amendments and proposals put forward here and used as a pretext for immigration on many different grounds. This ignores the reality. We must use these new European instruments for immigration, asylum or short-term help when refugees come from war-torn regions. We must not adopt any unrealistic measures. In future, it must be guaranteed that the right of asylum will be reserved for those who are politically persecuted and will not be extended to groups who some people might want to bring here for political reasons but who do not comply with the provisions of the Geneva Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Our aim must be to guarantee reliable and prompt support for genuine refugees, as well as follow-up measures to assist them with integration. At the same time, we must make it clear to everyone else that there will be other new instruments governing economic immigration into the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is extremely necessary, but because it is necessary, it is also very difficult. Sadly, we now have to begin yet again to dismantle prejudices against people seeking asylum. These prejudices result from fears which are largely unjustified but which must nonetheless be taken seriously. Now in particular, I think it is important that we no longer engage in lengthy speech-making but take action.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that those people who, in the wake of the recent outrages, shouted for the military to intervene must admit that as politicians, we bear responsibility now more than ever and that we must prove that we are not responding in blind panic but are capable of acting responsibly to deal with the difficulties we face. For this reason – and I say this to the Members on the Conservative benches – we are not acting as if we are in fundamental agreement with Mr Schmitt or Mr Pirker because we like them as individuals. There are reasons why we are changing our voting behaviour and voting differently from our group on a number of amendments. The background is as follows: although we are delighted that the Party of European Socialists in this House is doing everything possible to grant refugees more protection and rights, which we greatly welcome, we have a problem as German Social Democrats. We cannot accept an agreement or decision if it does not conform with the German constitution. At present, the German Basic Law does not permit us to accept around 17 of the proposed amendments. For this reason, we have to adopt a different voting behaviour from our group on a number of these amendments. This does not imply that we have different objectives. Our objectives are the same. However, we have to consider the credibility of our policies in Germany. We cannot disappoint our citizens and accept a decision which is impossible to implement at home. This is why we will be adopting a different voting behaviour today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission's proposal meets this requirement. I particularly welcome two provisions proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 3(3) states that Member States may decide to apply the provisions of this Directive to procedures for deciding on applications for kinds of protection other than that emanating from the Geneva Convention for persons who are found not to be refugees. This means that persons fleeing from fundamentalist violence – as in Algeria – or rape victims can be granted asylum. The UNHCR has been calling for this provision for some time. Unfortunately, it has not yet been adopted in practice in my own country, for example. Annex 1 sets forth the three criteria which must be met for a country to be defined as a safe third country. If these criteria are applied in future, some of the deportations from EU countries will no longer be permitted.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the Commission's acceptable proposal has been improved by the Committee responsible and not watered down as the original rapporteur Mr Schmitt intended. As it now stands, the Directive is an important step towards a more humane asylum policy in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is the spirit, and also the letter, of the Tampere agreements and the Treaty of Amsterdam, although we should discuss the legal basis of the common asylum procedure and uniform status. I would very briefly like to mention to the Commission certain reservations of a technical nature that arise as a result of the proposed directive we are analysing.</p>
<p class="contents">The first relates to the extension of the minimum rules for asylum procedures. I believe that the proposal puts excessive stress on regulation and that a common asylum procedure is never intended to be a single procedure or the same procedure for all States. I am afraid that the Commission may have gone beyond what was agreed at Tampere.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reservation relates to the Commission’s interest in regulating time limits, because I am wondering: is a long procedure a factor in the rejection of asylum seekers? That does not mean that we are in favour of a long procedure. However, from a practical point of view, European countries with long waiting times – more than two or three years – have greater numbers of asylum seekers, and countries such as Spain, with much shorter waiting times, have far fewer. Harmonisation of these waiting times is acceptable if it is due to a concern for the legal correctness of the procedure, but I fear that it may be inefficient and instil fear for both material and political reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">The third and final reservation is of a conceptual nature. I believe that the difficulties in homogenising decisions stem more from the definition of a refugee than from the procedure for identifying one as such. Concepts such as ‘safe third country’, ‘third party persecution’, ‘persecution in the event of conflict’ or ‘state or non-state persecution’ are examples of some of these problems. Perhaps, as I said before, we should deal with the definition before the procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, I believe we should make it very clear that this is a very important first step towards a common European asylum system which, in the long term, will be valid throughout the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I believe that we must not now forget that what we are doing is no less than fulfilling one of the objectives agreed at the Tampere European Council, where respect for the right to asylum was reaffirmed in a completely unconditional way.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, despite possible discrepancies between parliamentary groups on certain points of the proposal we debated, we must not forget that, in reality, we are providing all the European national systems with a structure that may operate efficiently in accordance with the Geneva Convention on the status of refugees. I believe that the European Union, from this Parliament, cannot look the other way and fail to implement the instruments that Europe is developing at this moment. We must remember the Charter of Fundamental Rights which this House recently approved and that, if it is to be borne in mind in this particular field, it must always be with a view to implementing that which was agreed in the Geneva Convention and never to reduce it. For one reality we cannot forget is that, since the second half of 1996, the number of asylum seekers in the European Union has increased considerably, while the resolutions which recognise and grant that right have diminished alarmingly.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons I believe that the amendments that we have adopted in committee and which we are presenting to Parliament today have substantially improved the Council’s proposal and have highlighted certain very interesting questions, especially with regard to the safeguards for asylum seekers, the principle of non-return and also certain essential minimum requirements throughout the process of taking decisions on the recognition of this status, which require that each case be studied individually. These asylum requests cannot be resolved collectively. Despite the Commission’s misgivings, I believe that we will have taken a great step forward with these amendments, if they are also adopted today in Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some speakers have shown that they are not quite aware of the limits between humanitarianism and permissiveness or between necessary controls and unnecessary torture, but, above all, many have shown they do not understand that laws are not made of rubber – they are not as elastic as some would like, that is – but they have certain fixed points, certain cornerstones, beyond which one cannot go. The reason why I think this document should be rejected is that it is not balanced. It all too clearly favours the position of the asylum seeker, exaggerating the values I have just summarised, and places the Member States and competent bodies in a really difficult position to make a serious assessment of asylum seekers’ applications.</p>
<p class="contents">Another reason is that this seems to be a purely theoretical text, clearly divorced from the reality on which it is necessarily and inevitably based: the everyday reality of countries – particularly (but not only) my own, Italy – that have to grapple with the problem of uncontrolled immigration on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Another reason for rejecting this type of formulation also derives from the lack of uniformity in the assessments made by Member States in their procedures for granting refugee status. One can thus find cases of secondary migration; that is, refugees enter via the most permissive State and then transfer or move on internally to another, more restrictive State.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal is not even clear on the distinction between the three different groups of asylum seekers either: those suffering political persecution as defined in the Geneva Convention, which has already been mentioned; refugees from war zones; and economic and occupational immigrants. It is unacceptable that three categories of asylum seekers that are so different from each other should be dealt with under the same rules. The Commission, furthermore, seems even to want to streamline the asylum acceptance procedure, extending it also to people whose cases do not come within the spirit of the Geneva Convention or the openings of the Tampere Council or even the updates on this issue to Title IV of the Treaty of Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="contents">What makes the Commission’s proposal and also the Parliamentary Committee’s draft legislation inadequate is that they do not correspond to reality. An ordinary piece of legislation is proposed for a severe emergency situation. Come and see what has been happening every day for the last ten years along the Italian coastline; come and see the conditions under which we are working to receive the people, not to put them in prison, and you will realise how inadequate these proposed guidelines are.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said at the beginning, here we must not confuse humanitarianism with strictness: the two things can go together. If you think that 300–400 refugees arrive in Italy every day, 1000 yesterday alone, you will realise that certain precautions are necessary or even inevitable. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, there is no need for long laments of pity such as I heard just now. There are no cases of inhuman treatment, nobody is held in temporary prisons; the refugees are received and fed, and then they are identified and classified to sort out the illegal immigrants among them, who are rejected, from the genuine ones, who are helped to stay, and also to try to identify underworld infiltrators.</p>
<p class="contents">There it is, then: strictness, yes; permissiveness, no. That is why our group will support all of Mr Schmitt’s amendments that aim to restore the original text of the report, that which lays down fairer rules, especially for the Member States that find themselves in this difficult situation. In short, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen: once they have got through the door into Italy, thanks to Schengen you will find all kinds, genuine ones and unwelcome ones, in your own countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Reding,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Thank you, Madam President. I have to say that having been a Member of the European Parliament myself for ten years, it is little short of a miracle to hear you say that I have time to speak!</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission very much welcomes the in-depth consideration that Parliament has given to this proposal. I would like to tell Mr Watson how much we have appreciated his work. Furthermore, the number and quality of the amendments are bound to add to the debate, and this comes at a crucial point in the process of creating a common policy on asylum.</p>
<p class="contents">I would first like to put this proposal in its proper overall context. The Tampere European Council actually wanted to create a common European asylum system and it agreed on a two-phase approach to achieve this. Firstly, the adoption of minimum common standards in the areas laid down in Article 63 of the Treaty, and then the development of a common procedure and uniform status for persons under international protection. The achievement of the first phase was dependent on the Commission adopting a certain number of legislative initiatives, which did indeed take place with the adoption on 12 September of a proposal for a directive on determining the status and forms of subsidiary protection. So this cycle is now complete. Furthermore, in its communication of November 2000, on which this House, Madam President, will give its opinion on 2 October, the Commission proposed moving on to the second phase by means of a special methodology. Its intention is to present this methodology in this communication and to draw lessons from the first year's work, and it will make proposals for new directions in the run-up to the Laeken European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal that we are discussing today is one of the most important and most sensitive aspects of this system. It was prepared chiefly on the basis of information drawn from a wide-ranging consultation process based on a working document presented in March 1999. The European Parliament had an opportunity to give its views in June 2000 and the Commission took on board many of the recommendations brought forward at that time.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, today’s resolution comes at a turning point in work in this area. I say that because the Belgian Presidency, with the support of the Commission, intends to use the coming months to make significant progress on asylum matters. This dossier, like immigration in general, should be one of the key aspects of the interim balance sheet of the implementation of the Tampere decisions and will therefore be prepared by the European Council by the end of this year. Against this background, the Council of Ministers is due to hold an exploratory debate on 27 and 28 September and the outcome of that debate will determine how ambitious we are in our overall approach in this area. We need to remember that our objective is to approximate national arrangements on procedures. I would add that this work will also extend to the two other proposals, one on reception conditions for asylum-seekers and the other on the determination of the Member State responsible for examining an application for asylum. What is more, these three texts are interlinked. They need to be seen as a whole and I believe in fact that this House has always seen things in that light. I would like to take the liberty of encouraging the European Parliament to give its opinion on these two other initiatives as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">With particular reference to procedures, there is no denying that there is a great disparity in a number of key areas. And I do not believe that that should come as a surprise to us, because this initiative deals with a great many technically complex issues, which in itself is not so difficult, but they are also politically sensitive, which in the present political climate is a real problem. Furthermore, the Council’s technical bodies have not yet completed the first reading, which means that the Member States’ delegations have not yet had an opportunity to express their views on certain key provisions. This is one of the reasons, Madam President, why it is difficult at this stage to comment in a definite way on this House’s amendments on appeal procedures, because we are still waiting for the Council to analyse and examine this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the discussions in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and the content of the excellent draft legislative resolution presented by Mr Watson confirm the feeling that there is at present a clear divergence – as you know and as was evident this morning – between the expectations of the European Parliament and the capacity of the Council to reach unanimous agreement. So the Commission is to some extent between two stools, as it were, but it intends to take on board your opinion, and the guidelines that may emerge from the discussions at ministerial level, as a basis for preparing an amended proposal so as to facilitate a possible consensus. In this context it seems vital to maintain the balance sought in the original proposal between, on the one hand, the desire to consolidate the rights of asylum-seekers, with due respect for international instruments, and in particular the Geneva Convention, and, on the other hand, the need for efficient and swift procedures and the need to achieve a degree of convergence so as to prevent ‘asylum shopping’. That is why, and I wish to repeat this and make it very clear to your rapporteur, the Commission has a great deal of sympathy for the general approach that emerges from the draft legislative resolution. However, it will not be possible for the Commission to adopt some of the suggestions made in that resolution which would undermine the achievement of these dual aims, and which would ultimately undermine the adoption of a text which we all wholeheartedly wish to see. For example, the distinction between the normal procedure and the accelerated procedure, which is actually practised, in theory at least, in the Member States is a cornerstone of this. If we were to accept the amendments seeking to eliminate this, this would involve seriously compromising the chances of getting the proposal adopted. On the other hand, Mr Watson, the Commission is certainly ready to take into account either the spirit or the letter of certain amendments that aim to improve the applicant’s protection without undermining the fundamental distinction, which I mentioned earlier. By the same token, the Commission shares the concerns reflected in various amendments which seek to further improve the quality of decisions made, whilst enhancing the situation of applicants and aiming to improve the efficiency of the national authorities which implement the procedures. Nevertheless, the legislative route is not necessarily the best way of achieving such an objective, which in many cases may be done by improving and approximating administrative practices. It is more likely that these standards will be achieved by implementing other means of cooperation, such as the open cooperation method which the Commission will in coming weeks be proposing should be extended to asylum matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, certain of the amendments would fit better into your resolutions on the communitarisation of the Dublin Convention and on the definition of refugees to which I drew your attention just now. Other proposals will have to be taken into consideration. The Commission is accordingly in favour of strengthening the connection between this directive and international or European human rights instruments. In particular, compliance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union needs to be clearly stated and guaranteed. Similarly, it is important to be aware of the effect of adopting a text of this kind in the context of enlargement, and of its impact as regards updating the international protection agenda. I have in mind in particular the global consultation process launched by the United Nations High Commissioner’s Office for Refugees on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Geneva Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the Commission does of course agree with your desire to see a more systematic follow-up to the implementation of this directive. A measure of this kind is indeed vital to support and speed up the changeover to the common procedure decided upon at Tampere as the ultimate objective for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, to conclude, the Commission reiterates its appreciation of the quality of the draft legislative resolution before us today. It agrees with the general spirit of this resolution, but must nevertheless clearly inform this House about the difficulties that exist. We need to take account of the constraints on the preparation of our amended proposal, and, furthermore, we hope that the Laeken European Council will give the European Union the necessary impetus to finally put into practice the aspirations declared in 1999 at Tampere. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
