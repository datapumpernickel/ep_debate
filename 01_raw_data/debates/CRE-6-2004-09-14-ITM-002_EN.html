<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">President. –</span></span>   Ladies and gentlemen, I should now like to address you as President of the House.</p>
<p class="contents">I will begin by saying how honoured I am that you have decided to place your trust in me and choose me as President of Parliament. At the time you elected me, I said I would wait until this plenary sitting to outline my strategic vision of the first half of this legislature to you.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, this does not entail presenting a political programme or putting forward my own ideas on the building of Europe. As President, my aim is simply to describe the priorities on our agenda and place them in context.</p>
<p class="contents">As I do so, I should like to share with you my pride in belonging to this, the greatest of all multinational parliamentary institutions. It stands for peace and democracy whilst respecting diversity. Although many Europeans are not sufficiently aware of the fact, this House is a forum for debates and decisions affecting our daily lives and the future of the world we are to live in.</p>
<p class="contents">Our shared pride must go hand in hand with a sense of responsibility. It is incumbent on us to be responsible as we exercise our powers, determine our stance on international affairs, and ensure the smooth operation of this enlarged Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union’s legitimacy springs from two sources. One is to be found in this House and flows from the citizens of Europe it represents. There is no reason why it should always be in line with the other, which flows from the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament now brings together 25 parliamentary traditions. It expresses itself in 20 official and working languages, with the consequent expense and complexity. Even this large number of languages does not reflect the whole of Europe’s linguistic diversity, as I am often reminded.</p>
<p class="contents">I have had occasion to discharge the aforementioned responsibility during the last few days of the summer break. It has been my sad duty to issue a series of statements on behalf of the House, condemning unequivocally those terrorist attacks and actions inflicted on different parts of the world in a most cruel and savage manner.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament is therefore at one with all democrats in expressing its sadness and solidarity with all of those families so unfairly cast into mourning by that brutal scourge that unfortunately no country is now free from.</p>
<p class="contents">I approached the 25 Heads of State or Government of the Member States of the Union with a view to expressing this feeling in the most solemn and collective manner possible. I suggested all schools across the Union should join us, the representatives of the citizens of Europe, in a minute’s silence today in memory of the child victims of the Beslan school killings and more generally, in memory of all other child victims of terrorism. I am happy to say that several countries have already agreed to participate, thus allowing European citizens to express their feelings on these terrible events.</p>
<p class="contents">This House condemns and rejects all terrorist acts because, regardless of its affiliation or the country where it takes place, terrorism negates the very values on which the European Union is based. The people hope a united Europe will be better able to combat this threat, which is one of the main causes of concern and insecurity in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">I am bound to say that expressing the horror we feel is not enough. When condemnations follow each other in quick succession, our words of anguish come to reflect frustration and impotence. There can be no excuse or reason for events as ghastly as those we witnessed towards the end of the summer or for what took place on 11 September in New York, or on 11 March in Madrid. Terrorism of all kinds is to be condemned. The debate currently taking place at world level, however, especially in our western and developed world, concerns how to combat terrorism in all its forms, rather than condemning it. Obviously, suicidal fanaticism will not be brought to an end by reasonable arguments put forward by cultured and intelligent individuals. On the other hand, one cannot expect to eliminate all its causes through the simple and indiscriminate use of force, taking revenge on other children for the harm inflicted on our own and triggering an unbearable spiral of violence.</p>
<p class="contents">The war on terrorism will not be won if terrorism is perceived as a conventional war. This House should develop the area of freedom and security. It must actively promote an anti-terrorist strategy based on international cooperation involving the police, the judiciary and the intelligence services. International cooperation is also needed to tackle the underlying causes breeding murderous and suicidal fanaticism.</p>
<p class="contents">No analysis equates to justification. Parliament’s debates and resolutions should never be interpreted as justification for terrorist violence. The fight against terrorism requires us to consider its causes in order to combat it more effectively. Parliament must continue to debate with full freedom of conscience, as it has done to date. In particular, it must consider the situation in Chechnya, in Iraq and in Palestine, regardless of the angry reactions that may follow.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, a further source of concern and insecurity in Europe has featured in the news this summer. I refer to the increasingly common decision to transfer companies’ economic activity within an integrated economic area, in order to benefit from a more favourable fiscal and labour situation. This has become known as relocation.</p>
<p class="contents">You will have noted that this phenomenon produces a defensive reaction in certain Member States that can impact on the Union’s solidarity policies. It certainly makes very clear the conflict of interest between economic competitiveness and social cohesion. These two aims ought to be complementary for us. Both are vital to the building of Europe and to the Lisbon Strategy in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">This is all more complicated than it appears. A simple numerical comparison of labour costs is probably not the only explanation of the phenomenon. The debate is bound to be of particular interest to those Europeans hoping Europe will prove to be a solution, not a problem. It should therefore feature prominently in Parliament’s work, and mainstreamed in the many issues filling our agenda. I shall refer to these later.</p>
<p class="contents">I venture to remind you first that the primary duty of the House is to contribute to the optimum performance of the enlarged Parliament. Romania and Bulgaria will soon be represented here too. It is important for Parliament to bear in mind that it is an institution in receipt of public funds facing new challenges of size and efficiency. I shall myself chair a working group tasked with ensuring that the size of the House does not detract from its effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Two issues are particularly significant in this connection, namely the Statute for Members and the language regime. I stated earlier that the Statute would be a priority issue. Accordingly, on 8 September, I met with Mr Balkenende, President-in-Office of the Council, who assured me that he would make contact as appropriate with representatives of the governments that were unable to endorse the draft Statute, and establish what alternative measures they had in mind. I should remind you that Parliament was never informed of the reasons why certain countries were unable to agree to the draft.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that the consensus reached in the House should be jeopardised until this information is received. I would like to reiterate, however, that we remain fully prepared to enter into dialogue and open to any suggestions made by the Council or the Member States best placed to promote an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the language regime, I must remind the House that its implementation is governed by provisions laid down by the Bureau of the previous Parliament, through a Code of Conduct on Multilingualism. I appeal to all Members, especially to the committee bureaux and coordinators, to make every effort to ensure correct application of the Code, bearing in mind the scant interpreting and translation resources available. It will be some time before the situation improves. I urge you all to make a sustained effort to adjust the language cover for working meetings to the resources available.</p>
<p class="contents">In the previous plenary certain Members argued for the right to express themselves in their mother tongue, even when it is not yet an official Union language. In this regard, I must point out to them that the language regime is authorised by Council agreements. A unanimous decision in Council is required. Until the relevant decisions are taken, the Presidency must insist on compliance with the Rules of Procedure, regardless of its personal views on the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to emphasise that if and when the Constitutional Treaty is ratified, the European Parliament will come of age. It will then have a framework in which its roles and responsibilities are defined once and for all.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, if it is eventually ratified, the Constitution will not come into force until 1 November 2006. In the meantime, one of the main tasks before the House is to stimulate a wide-ranging debate on ratification of the Constitutional Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Between 29 October, the date when the Constitutional Treaty is to be signed in Rome, and 1 November 2006, when it is due to come into force, my Presidency will be dominated by the ratification of the European Constitution in the 25 Member States. Ratifications are set to take place at the rate of roughly one a month. In most cases, the procedure will involve a referendum. My home country, Spain, will be the first to hold its referendum, in February 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">This two-year period will be an excellent opportunity for Europeans to learn about the Europe they wish to create, as it is defined in the text. It will be a chance for the citizens to assess what such a Europe could mean for them and why it is important for them.</p>
<p class="contents">Members of this House are called upon to be at the service of the citizens. Creative ways of communicating with the latter and establishing helpful positions for them must be found. A report drafted by Mr Corbett and Mr Mendez de Vigo and debated in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is to be adopted before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament must strive to become a genuine European assembly. It must become a model of open, plural and democratic debate. It must not be dismissive, hypocritical or claim a monopoly over European spirit or logic. Nobody can claim ownership of the one true idea of Europe. The debate is bound to be complex due to the range of identities and ideologies, and the different ways in which the various parties understand the notion of Europe we want to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the key issues in the draft Constitution must be dealt with in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, in major debates. I have asked the Chairman of this committee to forward me specific proposals on which to base the parliamentary debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate itself is not as important as the way it is perceived by the citizens, however. The latter need to be informed on the nature of the Constitution, on what it does and does not actually contain. It is crucial for them to vote on the text of the Constitutional Treaty itself, and not in response to the political situation in each of their countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Once Parliament has formed its opinion, it must ensure that its view is known and taken into account in the ratification process. It is most regrettable that the latter will not be more genuinely pan-European, close to the people, and that it will not take place in all countries!</p>
<p class="contents">Our main challenge must be to Europeanise the debate and ensure internal political issues do not impinge on it, as was the case in the recent European elections.</p>
<p class="contents">The House will liaise with the national parliaments. It already worked closely with the latter during the Convention. In addition, I shall personally chair a working group tasked with promoting the Constitution as a political project that will be the subject of the most significant debate Europeans have engaged in since they set out together to journey into the future, leaving behind the devastation of war. I invite you all to play your part.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament needs to deal with some more pressing issues beforehand. The first of these is the investiture of the Commission. Certain press reports have alleged that this is merely a formality. There are those who believe that the outcome is a foregone conclusion, and that the House will simply go through the motions, and not provide any added political value. You know that is not the case, ladies and gentlemen. The House must prove it to the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Members are entitled to their views on the Barroso Commission. Nonetheless, its investiture presents a splendid opportunity to make the main guidelines of its programme known. It is also an opportunity to become acquainted with the personal and political talents of the men and women who make up the incoming Commission, and to become aware of what Parliament’s political groups are demanding of it. The Commission is, of course, the engine of the Community’s government.</p>
<p class="contents">At the start of my address I referred to two major issues currently causing insecurity in Europe, namely terror and the social factors affecting employment. The new Commission’s statements and proposals on these two subjects are eagerly anticipated, as are its views on reform of the Stability Pact. The Prodi Commission’s initial response is already known, and it is also known that the Commissioner concerned will remain in office.</p>
<p class="contents">There will also be an opportunity to continue debating the proposed reform of this Pact, which has such considerable bearing on the Lisbon Strategy. Mr Barroso has placed it at the top of his agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Questions must be asked concerning how the Commission intends to make Europe a model where environmental issues, sustainable development and development aid are concerned. The Commission’s views on the concentration of the media in Europe, and on how it might react to this problem, also need to be ascertained.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to establish the Commission’s approach to the relationship between Europe and other continents and with the Islamic world, and also its approach to the development of the Euro-Mediterranean relationship and reinvigorating the flagging Barcelona process.</p>
<p class="contents">We are eager to learn what kind of relationship the Commission intends to forge with this House, and how it envisages its relationship with the Council’s High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy during this transitional stage.</p>
<p class="contents">All these issues will be raised. An effort will also be made to ensure that hearings are livelier, more spontaneous and less rigid than in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Once the Commission has been invested, in my capacity as President of this House, I shall call on it to increase its presence in the European Parliament. I shall ask the President of the Commission to hold regular meetings with the presidents of the political groups. I shall ask the Council to do likewise, particularly Mr Solana, the European Union High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The House must continue its usual legislative work, in which the Reach Directive on chemical products stands out. In addition, however, there are three important matters to be discussed before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Given its strategic importance, I shall mention Turkey first. The Conference of Presidents is due to receive the Prime Minister of Turkey, Mr Erdogan, on 23 September, as we hoped. Mr Erdogan will therefore visit Parliament prior to the Commission tabling its report, as was our wish.</p>
<p class="contents">In theory, Parliament has no say in the decision on whether or not to open accession negotiations in December. Consequently, the House is not required to express its view on the matter. It would, however, be inconceivable for us not to make our voice heard at the start of this long journey because at the end of it, whenever that might be, the agreement of the House will be required. It should be borne in mind that the important thing about journeys is not their length, but where they lead.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the House should prepare a report on the accession of Turkey before the December European Council, so that we can make our views known to the latter.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, issues such as Turkish accession serve to justify Parliament’s existence. They are an opportunity for the House to become involved, and cease to be a mere spectator. Decisions of this nature could be times when the two sources of legitimacy do not coincide. Governments may come to a different conclusion from the people. It is certainly an excellent opportunity to debate the nature of the Europe we hope to create, and the consequences of going about it in one way rather than another.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very much to be hoped, therefore, that the Commission will produce an objective report. This would enable the House and the Council to form a political judgment in full awareness of the consequences of a decision one way or the other. I refer to the implications of Turkey’s accession for the Union, and the implications its rejection could have for our relations with the Islamic world. The same applies to acceptance or rejection of the Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament needs to free itself from all preconceived ideas and unfounded reactions as it engages in this debate. The debate should be seen as part of the strategic perspective, with a view to the medium term.</p>
<p class="contents">This is because the House needs to be aware, as I am sure it is, that the most important challenge facing the Europe of the future is its relationship with the Islamic world. That relationship involves Iraq, Afghanistan and Palestine.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a relationship underpinned by a new neighbourhood policy, the Euro-Mediterranean partnership and the integration of immigrants into our cities. There are 10 million Muslims in Europe and 1 000 million in the world. Regardless of the decision taken, it is incumbent on us to prove to the Islamic world that we do not set our borders according to the clash of civilisations some are determined to bring about.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of contribution to our debate, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to inform you that I have received a report drawn up for the Commission by an expert group including three distinguished Members of this House. The report has kindly been made available to the European Parliament. Allow me to suggest that it is well worth reading.</p>
<p class="contents">The House will also need to take a decision on the financial perspectives before the end of the year. The Commission has completed its initial draft and we are due to receive it shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the Union’s financial resources need to be in line with our ambitions and allow the expectations enlargement has raised in many citizens to be met, whilst taking account of the concerns it has raised amongst others. The 2007-2013 financial package contains more than budgetary proposals. It is much more than a budget. It is a reference framework for a whole range of legislative proposals on financing the common agricultural policy, the Structural Funds, youth programmes, Trans-European networks and so on. The final shape of the reference framework approved will determine almost all of our legislative tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">The House will have a vital role to play in the adoption of a legislative package. Its role in the adoption of this package composed of over 50 proposals will be essential, as it will have to be adopted by the codecision or assent procedures. This will be another excellent opportunity to show Parliament is not simply a talking shop, but a body that actually takes decisions on specific issues with far-reaching consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">It will in fact be a unique opportunity for the House to promote its political priorities. The citizens of Europe cannot fail to take this on board if we contrive to translate our jargon into their everyday language.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, I have suggested to the Conference of Presidents that a temporary <span class="italic">ad hoc </span>committee be set up to launch the debate, bringing together all the points of view from which it should be approached. The plenary is to decide on this today. The budget is the hub where all the spokes of the European wheel come together. All its details need careful consideration. That is why I believe that an <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> committee, possibly chaired by the President of Parliament, would send out a clear message on the importance we attach to this task.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential to keep in mind that the financial perspective links in with other aspects of our policies the citizens are constantly hearing about, though I suspect they fail to grasp their full implications. I have in mind the Lisbon Strategy and the Stability Pact. One might well wonder what is supposed to be stabilised, and if it is prices, why only them.</p>
<p class="contents">By 2005, five years will have elapsed since the Union decided to set itself the aim of becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth, with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion. Does the House not think all this is beginning to ring rather hollow, and that the significant political implications involved were not accompanied by the democratic debate needed to generate the spark required for growth?</p>
<p class="contents">It has to be recognised that the Lisbon objectives are not being met, and that it seems unlikely that they will be between now and 2010. It is incumbent on Parliament to sound a note of concern regarding this vital objective for the future of the Union. It keeps being restated, like a mantra, whilst insufficient thought has probably been given to how best to attain it. Mr Kok will be invited to present the report he is charged with drawing up, concerning the shortcomings of the process and its prospects for the future. I believe debate in the House should centre on this report.</p>
<p class="contents">The objectives set out at Lisbon were extremely ambitious, and were established against the background of the economic prosperity enjoyed in 2000, shortly before the start of the crisis that was later intensified by terrorism. This must be admitted, as should the fact that the objectives were the subject of an intergovernmental process relying on the good will of the Member States for their implementation, through a coordination procedure in need of strengthening.</p>
<p class="contents">It is well known that throughout this period investment in technology has been low in comparison with the United States, and that the latter is still draining off our best brains. This probably calls for a focused debate. Human capital is not being developed as was decided at Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon Process goes hand in hand with the increased prominence given to environmental policies. Like the Maastricht criteria, Kyoto will put pressure on Europe. Our society will be forced to change its methods of production and consumption in a way that the citizens may not yet be sufficiently aware of. We are in favour of this, but will have to consider what it means and fulfil the ensuing obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the proposed reform of the Stability and Growth Pact, I believe Parliament should make an effort of political imagination to make it work for the Lisbon Strategy, even though the House only has limited competence in this area. More generally, I feel Parliament should endeavour to bring more democratic debate to bear on the main guidelines of European economic policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate must take place in this House, with the involvement of national parliaments, so that they feel part of European decisions with consequences for budgetary debates in each country.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I welcome the arrival of Mr Juncker, known as Mr Euro. It is certainly true that we did have a problem in Europe regarding the call for greater coordination of economic policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It will of course be necessary to study the role played by the European Union at world level. Special attention must be paid to transatlantic relations. I think the time has come for the House to demonstrate the maturity and responsibility of its parliamentary diplomacy by working more closely with the Commission and the Council on the international scene.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is a role model for the rest of the world. The founding fathers had a vision of a united and reconciled continent. That so-called European dream has now come true. Unfortunately, it has lost its democratic magic in the process. It no longer has the power to stir wills and engender active consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to set you a challenge, ladies and gentlemen. Dare one dream a different European dream, a dream of a more pluralistic Europe? Dare one dream of a Europe that differs from the one the founding fathers and the six founding Member States had in mind? Is it possible to fashion an ideal for a civilisation based on inclusiveness, which would help combat intolerance, the rejection of immigrants, ethnic conflict and religious intolerance?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe Parliament must engage in this endeavour. After all, most of the citizens it represents realise, at least intuitively, that none of their countries will be able to cope with globalisation on their own. No single country will be able to deal with environmental imbalances either, or with the emergence of so-called Continent States, terrorist threats, poverty or the resulting immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the time has come for the citizens of Europe to make their voice heard. I want to work shoulder to shoulder with you, and hope we can succeed in mobilising the peoples of our continent and in breathing new life into its societies, so that this new European dream can come true.</p>
<p class="contents">Good luck and thank you very much for your attention.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, let me, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, thank the President for his speech. It is, I think, clear that this House as a whole can endorse the broad outlines that you have sketched out, and we will support you in your effort to strengthen the hand of the European Parliament, in so far as we are able to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">You spoke as the representative of what is one of the most important institutions in the European Union, if not the most important. Let me say, in the presence of the Vice-President of the Commission, that I very much regret – and this is not a criticism of the Dutch Presidency, but of the Council’s General Secretariat – that the Council is not present on this important day. That is something that will have to change.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In the past, too, we have heard Presidents of the Commission outline their strategic programmes, which are about making laws, and that is what Parliament and the Council of Ministers exist to do, yet even then the Council was not present! I call upon the General Secretariat of the Council to ensure in future that the Presidency of the Council is represented in this House, for that is the General Secretariat’s function – to ensure that the most important institutions are present.</p>
<p class="contents">You take up office, Mr President, at a time when we have Members from the twenty-five countries of the European Union here, and you were right to address the language issue. What distinguishes us is our commitment to Europe’s unity in diversity, and that is why we have all the languages of the European Union here in the European Parliament. I see the main task facing us – facing you as President and us in the groups – as being to have respect and high regard for each other and for all our national and personal backgrounds, whilst nonetheless being aware that, at the end of the day, we are, men and women, Europeans together, seeking to work together to make this Parliament stronger.</p>
<p class="contents">You spoke about our relationship with the Commission. Everyone here in this House knows that our group did, of course, support José Manuel Durão Barroso as President-designate of the Commission; that does not mean, however, that the healthy tension that exists between the Commission and Parliament has thereby been dissolved. Instead, even before the whole Commission gets our vote of confidence, we must get the President-designate of the Commission to make important concessions to us in this House as to how the European Parliament can be given greater powers in relation to the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, our group has submitted a list of ten points that we want to see put into practice before we give the Commission as a whole our votes and put our trust in it. We want the Commission to consult with Parliament when considering how to formulate its strategic policy programme, we want the Commission to take the subsidiarity principle into account when proposing legislation, and we want this to result in a reduction in bureaucracy in Europe, with the Commission giving us prognoses in this regard when submitting its proposals for legislation. We also want to know what it is all going to cost.</p>
<p class="contents">You referred to REACH, which is not just about reshaping chemicals policy. That is something we will have to argue about. In essence, it is about us maintaining jobs in the European Union and creating new ones, and the European Union must not, through its own legislation, contribute to the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs, for example as a result of chemicals policy. That is why we must join together with the Council – which is why I find its absence regrettable – in getting the relationship between the environment and the economy right.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me tell you what our main task is. When we talk about Europe’s ability to compete, this is not something abstract to do with businesses; it has to do with workers in the European Union being in jobs and with businesses not taking themselves off to America or other parts of the world and the jobs being lost to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the core points our President addressed – and this is something I welcome – was terrorism. Terrorism can never be justified, and we must fight it with all the strength and determination at our disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Likewise, though, the need to fight terrorism must not mean that we jettison human rights. We have to value the life and dignity of a European as much as the life of a Palestinian; we have to affirm that the life of an American is worth as much as that of a Chechen and that of a Muslim as much as that of a Christian or a Jew.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">That is why, necessary though it is to combat terrorism, we in this House – without regard to the ‘reasons of state’ that governments invoke – must always speak up for human rights throughout the world. Whether it is convenient for us or not, whether the regimes we are dealing with are left-wing or right-wing or of any other description, we must always defend human rights in the world without deferring to reasons of state.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I hope you will not mind if I conclude by saying something about the Members’ Statute. We want one, but the ball is now in the Council’s court. We have done our work; now it is the Council’s turn, and if the Council of Ministers does not want the matter to go any further, then it has only to say so. We have done our work, and we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wish you, Mr President, every success in yours. If you stand up for Europe as a community – and I have no doubt that you will – then we will always be by your side.</p>
<p class="contents">The best of luck to you!</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schulz (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I warmly thank you, Mr President, for your speech. You addressed the points that we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament regard as fundamental to the future that we face, and so we are glad that you have spoken about them. I am not able to follow up all the points you raised, nor would I wish to do so, but I would like to revisit a number of the keywords that you used, because they determine the direction in which this House must develop.</p>
<p class="contents">In your speech, you made frequent reference to the two sources from which the European Union derives legitimacy, the Council being one and Parliament the other. The Constitution speaks of a Union of states and peoples; the states are represented by the Council, and the peoples by this Parliament, and that is why it is right that this House should represent the diversity of Europe’s peoples. For our group, that also means, for example, that this House’s language arrangements are not some sort of burdensome and necessary evil, but that they must guarantee the diversity of Europe’s peoples and enable it to be – in the truest sense of the word – articulated. For that reason, I am grateful to you for referring to your establishment of a working party to arrange matters efficiently, which should also, however, continue to make it possible for any man or woman in the European Union, irrespective of their school or university education, to have the opportunity of being elected to this House and working in it. That involves ensuring that they are understood, which I see as an important aspect of stabilising European democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">You also spoke on behalf of this House in repudiating all those who believe that the only way to combat terrorism is with the language of force, and for that I am very grateful. Those who go to war claiming to be the bringers of freedom, democracy and human rights and sow the seeds of chaos, disorder and imported torturers cannot be surprised if their actions help to foster terrorism. Those who seek to respond to terrorism by reintroducing the death penalty are countering violence with violence. Undermining democracy in order, allegedly, to make a better job of combating terrorism is not the right way to go about matters. Terrorists understand their own language; that is why, wherever they themselves use force, force – legitimate force on the part of the state – is the response that is needed to restore order. What society needs, though, is open dialogue and the unconditional and fearless acceptance of whoever is the ‘other’ in that situation. It is the clash of civilisations that gives rise to continued terrorism; dialogue, of the kind you have described, could be a way out of the terrorism trap, and so I thank you for addressing this point in such clear terms.</p>
<p class="contents">You spoke about the accession of Turkey and about the decisions that now have to be taken. This morning, I read in one of the major German daily papers that the debate on this cuts right across group lines in this House, and that all the groups in this House present a diverse picture. That comes as a surprise to me, as I had always had the impression that only one group was united on this and that the picture in all the others was a varied one. As of this morning, we know that there is a diversity of views in every group in this House. At the end of the day, every individual Member will have to weigh up for himself and herself the benefits involved in seizing a short-term political and economic opportunity as against taking long-term, indeed geostrategic considerations into account, in particular as to how different cultures are to be integrated into this Union, but you were right to point out that it is we who have to take that decision, and that taking it without the European Parliament is unthinkable.</p>
<p class="contents">On this issue, then, this House will have to take up a position, and we in the Socialist Group will make our contribution to this debate, a contribution that – as is perfectly clear – will not be uniform, for there are quite different views in our ranks too. It is in any case true that one thing we must not lose sight of when discussing our policy on Turkey is the need for Europe’s actions to be underpinned by reliable statements and promises made on the international stage. I can scarcely imagine that one can, over a period of forty years, make repeated promises to a country and impose more and more new requirements on it, which it then meets, and end up telling it that the entire process had been of no avail and that all their efforts had been in vain. Whatever criticisms one might – and must – make of Turkey’s domestic situation, it is a self-evident fact that, over the past three years, the prospect of accession has made possible more reforms in that country than the forty years of discussions that preceded it. That, too, is something we must not lose sight of.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Members’ Statute and increased efficiency, you said what had to be said. You have our backing for the strategy you described, and, if you take it further, you can count on our absolute support. I would like to conclude by saying something about your comments on the audition of Commissioners. We in the Socialist Group will use this occasion to make it clear that the incoming Commission must take seriously your statement that ‘competition and social cohesion are two sides of the same coin.’ Those who believe that all Europe needs is competition and that social cohesion is not that important destroy Europe’s basis, for it has been the social model that has made Europe stronger. It is for this social model that we in the Socialist Group will contend; we will defend it, even against those elements in the Commission who tend to highlight competition to the exclusion of all else. That is why, when examining every single Commissioner, we will emphasise the project of the social Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by saying that, no matter who it is that turns up and presents himself, we will judge him by his policy statements, and not by his political past. The fact is, Mr Poettering, that if Lazlo Kovac had not been Secretary of State to Gyla Horn, then Germany would not have been reunited. It was the Hungarian Government, in which Lazlo Kovac served, that made German unity possible. I welcome Lazlo Kovac as a European – let me say that right at the outset – and so let it be understood by those who seek to make the Commissioners’ hearings into a battle of ideological principles that they have not seen anything yet.</p>

When you speak impartially for this House, when you are a credit to its standing and a defender of its prerogatives, you can count on our backing.</p>
<p class="contents">The stature of this Parliament is growing, and the stature of its Presidency must grow with it. You have inherited a House larger by some eight dozen MEPs and richer by nine new official languages. It is a machine of four and a half thousand parts, speaking twenty languages, a million words a week. The parts must move in time, the machine must stay in motion. You must make sure that it does.</p>
<p class="contents">Benjamin Franklin once said of the Vice-Presidency of the United States - before the days of Dick Cheney - that it was a position so lacking in influence and stature that its holder should be addressed as 'your superfluous excellency'. The European Parliament cannot afford a superfluous excellency, because you will be our voice; you will speak for us in the Council; you will be the will of this House: you will be our resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Every one of us carries the burden of building the legitimacy of this House and thus European democracy and the work that it does - but none more than you. In your opening remarks you spoke of two sources of legitimacy. This House indeed has a particular duty to stand up for the rights of European Union citizens. Sometimes that means defending their rights from encroachment by the Union's Member States. I think, for example, of the nine million stateless Roma or the citizens of Cyprus and also of the people of Gibraltar, now represented in this House for the first time, thanks to a judgment in the European Court of Justice. I am proud to be one of Gibraltar's representatives here, because only in Europe can Gibraltar look across the line at La Linea, or at the British battleship in the Bay of Algeciras and finally see no contradiction. This House is the manifestation of the belief that we are better than our histories and more than our nationalities and it must be manifest in its President.</p>
<p class="contents">In two areas of your mandate you can expect aggressive backing from Liberals and Democrats. The first is in reform of this House. An enlarged Parliament means a reformed Parliament. We welcome your emphasis today on reform of the Members' Statute. The package agreed at the end of the last session is not an end but a point of departure. We cannot hide behind it. We must call the bluff of European governments and go straight back to work, because for our voters the price of legitimacy is open and ambitious reform, nothing less.</p>
<p class="contents">The second area is the defence of the European Constitution. Here we expect you to lead a concerted campaign across the continent. So renew your frequent flyer package: Europe has never had a more important product to sell.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Liberals and Democrats in this House urge imagination and we expect ambition. Political institutions rise and fall by the respect that they command. For a quarter of a century this Chamber has gathered powers and asked European citizens for respect, for trust. We must wake and work and sleep as if that trust must be won anew every day. In wishing you well in your term of office, Mr President, I would say that we expect nothing less from you.</p>

There will certainly be plenty for both us and you to do over the coming years, but we believe that the most important challenge for this Parliament is to overcome Euroscepticism and, as Mr Watson said as well, to show that we are not superfluous.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want not 40% but 80 or 90% of our citizens to take part in the elections in 2009, there are three things that we have to do better than we have done in the past, and to do them we must go beyond our political differences and try to resist the trend that can already be seen here in Parliament today, which makes it a kind of Council appendage in which the parliamentary groups are increasingly an expression of the power relations among the various national delegations rather than independent and truly European political bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this Parliament has to produce better laws; it has to demonstrate in practice that it is possible to make democracy work at a supranational level and to let the people see that it works; and it has to act as the eyes of the international community on matters where there is no place for hypocrisy or double standards, such as the protection of human rights and decisions on peace and war.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to our role as co-legislators, we must not forget that for years the European Parliament has had to fight hard to gain the Council’s and the Commission’s respect for its powers. Even now there are still at least four unresolved issues, which we call on you to place on the agenda for the trialogue with the other Institutions as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">First, there is the ever-present temptation to somehow bend the rules to prevent Parliament from being able to fully exercise its powers. Examples of this are the PNR case – the agreement with the United States on passenger details – and the comitology procedure on GM organisms, but I could mention others. This is a real political issue that you, personally, must raise.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the review of access to sensitive documents. Here, too, the Commission and the Council make our life difficult as representatives of the people. One example out of many is that of the infringement procedures. The Commission has stated quite clearly that it wants to reduce its influence on this matter and we have no access to these procedures, which very often prevents justice from being done. We think that your role as President of this Institution is absolutely crucial with regard to this matter as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must set up an interinstitutional agreement on trade, seeking in part to bring forward the rules to be determined by the Constitutional Treaty. The other speakers have already mentioned the Members’ Statute, and therefore I do not need to expand on it too much.</p>
<p class="contents">We certainly have to make great improvements in-house. We are against hurried legislation pushed through at first reading and deals on legislation struck only between major groups, as often happened during the last part of the parliamentary term, while we are in favour of the more systematic, more political and more effective use of our power to initiate legislation – a power that we ourselves forget we have.</p>
<p class="contents">I have spoken of this Parliament as a laboratory for supranational democracy. We are convinced that we must be involved in the Constitutional Treaty ratification debate, but we must, however, avoid making the mistake of campaigning too one-sidedly and shutting the door on those who do not think that this Treaty is the best solution for tomorrow’s Europe. I believe we have to win them over as well, by trying to convince them.</p>
<p class="contents">I reiterate that Parliament must also act as the eyes of the international community. Mr President, we are genuinely convinced that the re-establishment of the Subcommittee on Human Rights may enable this Parliament once again to be a place where we can fight realistically and get results in the area of human and personal rights, rather than the declamatory forum for wishful thinking that it has become in recent years. We hope we can count on your support to ensure that the subcommittee can work completely independently to rebuild its vast network of contacts and collaboration with those who uphold human rights around the world, giving them a voice and legitimacy and maybe, in the long term, becoming a full committee in its own right.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wurtz (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I am in broad sympathy both with most of the main themes of your address and with the approach that underpins them, and, on behalf of my group, I thank you for what you have said. It reinforces our conviction that we can build up a very constructive and cooperative relationship with you.</p>
<p class="contents">You mentioned company relocations, and, likewise, as regards the work of lawmaking that awaits us, I do not want to conceal from you our group’s profound disquiet at the Commission’s draft directive on the deregulation of services, the so-called ‘Bolkestein directive’, which, in effect, proposes to replace the current law of the host country with that of the country of origin. To put it another way, it aims to allow businesses providing services to apply in all countries the social security regulations of their countries of origin. Such an arrangement could be, as one can well imagine, a recipe for social dumping.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also welcome, in due time, the measures envisaged under Tampere II. As for the mid-term review of the Lisbon Agenda, to which you also referred, and which, in the year 2000, promised us that by 2010 we would have full employment and the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, we should not wait until March 2005 before getting down to it. Right now is the time for us to make our contribution to the debate in the form of thoughts derived from the last four years, which have been an enlightening experience.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite apart from our legislative work, there are certain great issues concerning civilisation with which we have to get to grips in order to raise at the European Council the issue of what sort of role the European Union should be playing on the global stage. You mentioned some of them in your speech: our approach to the fight against terrorism and to defending global security, for instance; or the issue of our relations with the countries of the South, and, in particular, those on the southern shore of the Mediterranean. I am also thinking of the ever more worrying problem of global warming, and of that of media concentration, which is a very live issue in many countries of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">All these things featured in your speech. Obviously, there are still other issues, such as the need to take action to combat such scourges as Aids, tuberculosis and malaria, from which, last year, six million people died across the world. Anyone here could add to the list of subjects that absolutely must have a place on our agenda. You are right to say that discussion of these issues is among our responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, if you will permit me, I would like to address a transversal subject that you also mentioned: the European Constitution. I am glad that you said, as you did, that the European Parliament will have to transform itself, by organising an open and pluralistic debate, into a great <span class="italic">agora</span>. I do not actually think that this House should limit itself to telling our fellow-citizens, when the time has come – if I may use an expression of which Mr Giscard d'Estaing, the former President, is fond – what is the right choice to make, particularly given that such an injunction would probably have little effect on those who wonder what direction European integration is taking, and who, in one way or another, represent the majority of the EU’s citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Contrariwise, far from fleeing problems or opposition, we will in fact have to initiate a real democratic, pluralist and open debate on civil society, without relying solely on quasi-institutional partners in dialogue at summits, a debate on the nodal points of this treaty, which has ambitions to be a constitution, and more particularly on those by which the EU’s citizens actually judge it, that is to say on its policies and its functioning as derived from the Single European Act and from the Maastricht Treaty, which the draft Constitution is intended to put on a permanent footing.</p>
<p class="contents">In itself, political courage of this kind would be, perhaps not the new European dream to which you, Mr President, have aspired, but at least an encouraging innovation, a positive message addressed to our fellow-citizens and a good start not only for this new legislature, but also – with more personal reference to you, Mr President – for your own term of office.</p>

<p class="contents">It is not difficult to foresee the European Parliament approving the Constitution by a large majority. It will give more power and influence to us here in this House. The EU will be able to make decisions in 15 new areas. We shall be given majority decision-making in 40 new areas in which it will be possible for the national parliaments to be voted down. It will be much easier to achieve qualified majorities with the new rules, and the European Parliament will be entitled to table many more amendments to the laws that are to apply in our countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The democratic problem is, however, that the national parliaments will lose much more power than the European Parliament will gain. Most of the power will pass from the electorate to 300 working groups in the Council of Ministers and 3 000 in the Commission, none of which operate transparently or are subject to the influence of citizens. Democracy is being restricted in our countries, and the electorate will end up losing out the most.</p>
<p class="contents">What is reassuring is that we are now to have referendums in ten countries. Would that this development could also extend to the majority of other countries, the outcome being referendums everywhere. How can power be taken from the electorate without asking them whether they are in favour of shifting influence to officials and ministers with very little feeling for a very distant European Parliament?</p>
<p class="contents">We are now debating whether the EU institutions should adopt a special communications strategy to convince the electorate of the Constitution’s merits. The EU institutions have one single task prior to the referendums, and that is to make the draft Constitution available in different languages and reader-friendly editions. This is not something they have been able to do. It is, in actual fact, my office that has published reader-friendly editions on the website www.euabc.com. The Council has only managed to print a number of unreadable versions containing neither indices nor the minority opinion that we in the Convention were expressly promised would be included. The European Parliament could take over the task that the Council and the Commission have not carried out, in spite of their wealth of resources. The various groups’ opinions could be appended to the official texts so that the voters might be provided with different recommendations and the opportunity to adopt positions themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Referendums and constitutions belong neither to governments nor to parliaments, but to the electorate. The voters in our Member States must be given a guarantee that free and fair referendums will be arranged everywhere so that, once the decisions – whether in favour or otherwise - have been made, everyone can say that things were done fairly. The voters have spoken. We respect their decisions.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Crowley (UEN).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, I too would like to join my colleagues in congratulating you on your election and in thanking you for your address earlier this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">Rather than lay out a wish list of every new policy or new idea, I want to touch very briefly on some of the points you raised and try to re-emphasise those within our role and work here in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">First and most importantly of all, you mentioned the massacre at Beslan and in particular the slaughter of innocents that took place. It is incumbent on us, because of the institution that we are part of, because of the moral authority which we have in this Parliament as the democratically–elected voice of the people, we should stand up and resist all violence against people. We should be a beacon of hope and tranquillity for those who wish to have their viewpoint heard.</p>
<p class="contents">You mentioned in your speech that you do not see the issue as a clash of civilisations. Some years ago, the Chief Rabbi in Britain, Jonathan Sachs, wrote a book called <span class="italic">The Dignity of Difference</span>. If there is one thing that the European Parliament and the European Union have achieved, it is that ideal of respecting the dignity of difference. There are things that make us different, but they need not divide us if we can show tolerance, respect and understanding for them. Over the next five years of the mandate of this Parliament, we should be striving to ensure that, in every aspect of our working life, we can give that respect and tolerance to differing viewpoints. We may not agree with them and may not ascribe to them ourselves, but we should respect the right of Members of this House and other elected representatives to hold those opinions and try to bring them forward. We will be faced with this even more now because of our recent enlargement and the reunification of Europe. There are now people in this Parliament who know what it is like not to have freedom to speak, not to have the freedom to use their own language and not to have the right to teach their own history and culture to their children. They want to make sure that those rights are never taken away again. Some in this Parliament and other places may use Members' passion for and belief in protecting the cultures and diversity of languages within the European Union as a way of attacking such Members. We should understand the reasoning behind this approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, you rightly say that the question of language should be dealt with by the Council with regard to what is and is not appropriate. We should also have a bit of leeway within Parliament: for opening remarks in a Member's maiden speech or for other important occasions during the Presidency, people should be allowed to use their own language, even though it may not be an official working language, on condition that they give a translation to the services before they make their speech.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point is that this House must be seen around Europe as a House to be treated with respect and honour, because we have a mandate and we bring the voice of the people as close as possible to the heart of what the European Union is. There must also be respect for the Members of this House in their work and for the style in which they work. If we are not willing to give respect to ourselves within this Chamber, if we are not willing to work within the rules and the laws as set down by our own Rules of Procedure, invoking our rights and powers under the various treaties and under the new constitution – if it is adopted – then no one outside this House will have respect for us. I am looking to you, in the light of our previous conversations and the work you have already done in this regard since taking office, to give leadership in ensuring that the respect and dignity of this House is protected at all times. The rights of individual Members are foremost within that protection.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, here is a short quote, which could best be described as an ancient Irish poem. I will not use the original Gaelic: 'Who shall speak for the lonely and the oppressed? If not you, then who? Who shall speak for the downtrodden and the unjust? If not you, then who? Who shall speak for you? If not you, then who?' We are given the authority to speak on behalf of those who do not have a voice and to give leadership to those who should be shown what the true way is.</p>

<p class="contents">I too should like to congratulate you on your election, both on my own behalf and on behalf of my colleagues in the Non-attached Group. Just as the spectrum of colours adds to the beauty of a painting, I believe that the spectrum of political parties in the European Parliament guarantees that the decisions taken by this House will not serve just a certain part of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to return to the speech made by Commission President Barrosso in this Chamber, in which he clearly stated that the Union must have a strong and independent Commission. I also believe that Europe needs to have a strong and accountable Parliament. We must respond to the will and expectations of our voters. In order for us to be able to uphold their interests, we must have the appropriate conditions for our work here. Mr President, please allow me, at the very beginning of our term of office, to remind you of our requests for the removal of the discrimination which we are experiencing in the Non-attached Group.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the other political groups have better staffed secretariats, for example the Union for Europe of the Nations Group has 27 members and 34 officials. We have 29 members but only 11 employees to take care of our work in the secretariat. Our meetings are not interpreted into our mother tongues despite the fact that many nationalities are represented here. The financial support allocated for the political groups is not audited until after it has been used, whereas we have to apply for resources and explain in advance why we are asking for them.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, all of us here today have been elected in democratic elections to represent our voters. The European Union safeguards its prosperity through agreements and compromises and we must do everything to ensure that discrimination is eliminated in this Chamber. I am therefore asking you to resolve these problems and not just put them to one side. I have a feeling that the economic pressure on the Non-attached Group of members may be the reason why we have become politically integrated.</p>
<p class="contents">In your statement, you made mention of the problems with interpreting. We are now looking at further discrimination being perpetrated by the European Parliament. In the past, during the period when our status was that of observers, interpreters from the candidate countries did not enjoy a position of equality. In particular, they suffered discrimination in the area of social security, with respect to their rights and benefits. Since the accession of the ten Member States, that is, since 1 May 2004, their status has changed somewhat, but they are still suffering discrimination in comparison with their colleagues from the old Member States. In the past, interpreters have never been recruited at A8 level owing to the demanding nature of their job. The difference between old and new interpreters is more than EUR 1 000.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I apologise for talking about economic and financial problems from the very beginning. But in Slovakia we believe in clearing the air. The EP needs to resolve all financial matters for all members so that status is not an issue, so that there is no virtual frontier between the old and the new. I therefore beg for the justice which lies in your hands. In return, I can offer you honest hard work. Members in the Non-attached Group will draw attention to injustice but we shall always strive to seek compromise and to resolve the important problems raised.</p>
<p class="contents">You are faced with trying times. So I wish you well in coping with your difficult job and I also wish you strength in succeeding in it. Not every politician is given the opportunity you have been given. Prove that you are worthy of this historically very important job and that you are President for all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for your attention.</p>
