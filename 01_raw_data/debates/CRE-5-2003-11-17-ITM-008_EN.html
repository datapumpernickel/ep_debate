<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Read for her reports on eTEN and IDABC, which strongly support these programmes. Mrs Read has been very committed over the years to the IDA Programme. The Commission would strongly support a vote in favour of these reports.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me start with the eTEN programme, which was formerly known as TEN Telecom. This programme will play a key role in achieving the objectives of the eEurope 2005 Action Plan.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme has been reoriented to the objectives of eEurope 2005. The focus has been fixed on services in the areas of eGovernment, eHealth and eLearning.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme has shown, through a number of validation projects, that there is high potential for the deployment of such services. However, the current 10% limit of Community financial support has proved insufficient to overcome the barriers to deployment at a trans-European level.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has proposed raising the maximum level to 30%, since both research and experience in other programmes show that this is the level needed to encourage deployment successfully.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as a former budget Commissioner, I should like to reiterate that the budget for the programme will nevertheless remain unchanged. The funding will concentrate on fewer but more focussed projects, thereby making the programme more effective.</p>
<p class="contents">The scope of the new IDABC Programme will be broader than that of the present programmes. IDABC provides a more comprehensive coverage of pan-European eGovernment services. The benefits resulting from the cooperation between public administrations across Europe extend to citizens and businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">IDABC supports, initiates and manages the delivery of pan-European eGovernment services with a view to giving business and citizens easy access to cross-border information and transactions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission fully supports the report of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy as submitted to the plenary session today. The Commission can accept Amendments 1 to 5.</p>
<p class="contents">Considering that the Council is expected to reach a political agreement on the IDABC Programme on Thursday, the Commission hopes that the very good cooperation with Mrs Read and the European Parliament will allow a second reading and final adoption before the parliamentary elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn now to the third element of our debate today, which relates to the implementation of the telecom regulatory framework.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Clegg, for the thorough job he has done, and Parliament for its interest in the Eighth Report. I particularly welcome your involvement in the ongoing issues of the transposition and implementation of the new regulatory framework in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Eight countries have now succeeded in adopting legislation: Denmark, Spain, Ireland, Italy, Austria, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has opened infringement proceedings against those Member States that have failed to notify measures. We will pursue these proceedings vigorously.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Council on Thursday, I will be urging those Member States that have not yet transposed to make renewed efforts to complete the task with the minimum of further delay.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, in a few days the Commission will adopt the Ninth Implementation Report, addressed to Parliament and Council, which sets out in more detail the state of play of transposition as at 1 November.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the situation in the electronic communications market is concerned, the report will identify some encouraging signs on the market after the difficult financial conditions of last year.</p>
<p class="contents">The number of mobile subscribers is anticipated to grow at a greater rate than in 2002, despite the high penetration rates already achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if competition in the broadband market is still weak, the number of fixed broadband lines increased by nearly 80% in the year to October 2003. Unbundling, in particular, has developed significantly, with over 1 million new unbundled lines between October 2002 and October 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the key issues we are examining in our assessment of transposition measures include the role of national regulatory authorities, and the putting in place of measures to avoid over-regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Accession countries will need to adapt their laws to comply with the new framework by May 2004. Parliament is being kept fully informed by way of the recent Comprehensive Monitoring Reports, which contained a chapter on the telecommunications sector.</p>
<p class="contents">We will continue to monitor the situation closely and to assist the authorities in accession countries. The situation regarding transposition and implementation there will be fully covered in the 2004 report.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, with renewed effort by all Member States to complete the process of transposition and market review in the coming months, we believe we can do our share of the work to help the market stabilise further and to maintain its growth, so that consumers can continue to benefit from competitive prices and the development of broadband services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Read (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, I am delighted to present these two reports to you. I will deal with the easier one first, the eTEN programme, which the Commissioner has outlined with admirable clarity. I want to recommend to Parliament that it accept the Commission proposal. I was interested that the budget blood still runs in the Commissioner's veins. He was quite right to point out that this proposal is a reallocation of an existing budget and is not about raising the total budget. However, if the 10% ceiling is raised to 30%, it will mean the deployment of fewer but more focused projects in the future. The Commissioner again is quite right that when the potential for deployment of a product is recognised, the main barriers it faces are financial ones. There are difficulties which we well know in obtaining private capital for initial investment in this area. To raise the ceiling in this way is a proper use of funds in the eTEN budget programme. I hope that the Commission proposal is accepted and I have not tabled amendments, nor have other colleagues, which is the right thing to do.</p>
<p class="contents">The IDA programme is more complicated. I had hoped that we would get a first-reading agreement on this but this proved not to be possible. In some ways, for very good reasons, the Council showed a good degree of diligence in its considerations of this proposal. What we are looking at here is extending the IDA successes in cross-border cooperation and communication between public administrations. This will build on that and also extend this cooperation to citizens and to businesses. However, there are also important changes which relate to the procedure, which has been streamlined and simplified. It is good that lessons have been learned from previous IDA work. The Commissioner knows that I was the rapporteur on two or three separate IDA proposals and I note with some wry humour that this was long before the phrase 'eGovernment' was widely used or even invented.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the proposal can and will have real benefits. The Commission estimates that for every euro spent on IT infrastructure, the public sector can gain up to EUR 1.8. The annual cost of the TESTA programme, the part of IDA that deals with infrastructure, is EUR 4.6 million. The benefits are estimated to be EUR 8.6 million across the public sector: a genuine multiplier.</p>
<p class="contents">The new programme will be called IDABC. I will read to you what it means because it is sometimes easy to forget: Interoperable Delivery of pan-European eGovernment Services to Public Administrations, Businesses and Citizens. Although it is a real mouthful, we can point to the IDA successes as bringing real benefits to European Union citizens in ways that really touch their lives.</p>
<p class="contents">IDA is currently working in the following areas: agriculture, humanitarian aid, the internal market, statistics, environment, trade, employment and education. I pulled out here, and in my explanatory statement, five or six specific projects: the Solvit network, which provides a mechanism for people who come up against barriers to the internal market to raise the issue with the Member State concerned; the Euphin programme, which enables authorities to exchange data on public health issues, including communicable diseases in a fast and secure way; Ploteus, a portal that supplies information on learning opportunities around Europe; TourNet, a system for linking tourism administrations so that they can share information about their own particular areas; and finally Transcards, a more local and focused programme, which allows citizens living on the French-Belgian border to use the health facilities of either Member State, regardless of which country they live in. They are all good, quotable examples of tangible benefits the IDA way.</p>
<p class="contents">This new proposal will bring not only tangible benefits in the IDA way, it will also bring benefits to European citizens and businesses. It will facilitate the free movement of people, goods and services by making eGovernment applications more accessible across national boundaries. I very much hope that Parliament supports the Commission proposal in the way that I have amended it and I commend it to you.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like to make a very brief comment on the report by my colleague, Mr Clegg. I will not go into the detail. He has done an excellent job here and is quite rightly using very specific language about some of the shortcomings of Member States. The Commissioner indicated his seriousness as regards addressing those Member States which did not meet the due deadlines: the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy made it clear that it would back him if he wanted to take the action he has outlined. I am confident that Parliament will also support him in this. We are already getting some indications that the accession countries are saying that they do not have enough time and need more breathing space. It is difficult to resist those arguments if existing Member States, which should be well able to transpose and implement, have not done so.</p>
<p class="contents">I commend my own two reports, and that of Mr Clegg, to the House.</p>

Seeing so many friendly and familiar faces here this evening, however, I am also reminded that we perhaps make up in sheer intelligence and talent for the lack of numbers that we are able to muster this evening, merry gang of telecoms specialists that we are.</p>
<p class="contents">On a more serious note, I would like to thank many colleagues here this evening for their support and cooperation in producing this report, which really was a collective effort. I know that all parliamentary reports are collective efforts, but this one very much represented a collective effort by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy as a whole, including the shadow spokespeople. This was reflected in the unanimous vote in our committee.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not an exaggeration to say that this report represents a welcome new development in the way in which Parliament is working, in the way in which we are increasingly not only promulgating and amending legislation, but also developing a highly welcome preoccupation about how that legislation is subsequently implemented. It would be irresponsible for us as legislators not to pay due attention to what happens to our worthy texts once they are adopted as legislative texts. This is a model example of not only cooperation across parties, but also cooperation between institutions in ensuring implementation is properly and fully pursued.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to isolate four points which are of particular significance. First, in urging the Commission to take action against those Member States that have not yet implemented the telecoms legislation in good time, and welcoming any action already taken, it is important to remember that we stress in paragraph 3 of this report that we also believe the Commission should continually look at innovative ways of not only forcing implementation on those reluctant Member States, but also encouraging implementation by benchmarking and comparative analyses. The Commission can produce these in order to urge the laggards to take a good example from those Member States who are perhaps more advanced.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, our comments in this report on the regulatory structure and the European Regulatory Group are important. In paragraph 22, we put it on record that we feel that the existence of the European Regulators Group – the ERG – and the Independent Regulators Group – the IRG – is increasingly illogical because there is so much overlap between the two. Whilst many of us here understand that the Commission cannot take a formal position on this, it is worth stressing this evening that we feel there is absolutely no logical reason why these two bodies should coexist as is currently the case. A merger between the ERG and the IRG is desirable.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to see more proactive input from the Commission as regards the accession countries, and the degree to which they are abiding not only by the old framework but also looking to adopt the new framework. In our discussions with the Commission on this report, the Commission explained that it would be too onerous and complicated to meet an initial demand made by myself and others for specific reports on the implementation of telecoms law in the accession countries. In the end we urged the Commission to collate more information on the state of play in the accession countries. However, it is important that it should be taken seriously. If one looks at the monitoring reports issued recently by the Commission, there are only about two or three paragraphs on the telecoms sector in many of these countries. That really is not good enough. As they approach their own date of entry into the European Union, it is essential that we monitor that situation more closely than perhaps has been the case hitherto.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to draw special attention to the importance of paragraph 9 in our report, which stresses once again that notwithstanding the emphasis in all the regulatory activity in recent years on increasing access-based competition, our long-term goal has to remain facilities-based competition. That is sometimes obscured by all the battles we have about local loop unbundling, bit stream access and so on. At the end of the day, what we want for the benefit of European consumers, let alone European telecoms operators, is sustainable, robust, facilities-based competition. It is to that end that I hope this implementation report has made some contribution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Many of us worked as rapporteurs or shadow rapporteurs on the electronic communications package of legislation over two years ago and it is important that we continue to show our political support and sustained engagement. After all, we all put a lot of work into it. We know it is in the implementation phase now, but it sends a clear signal that this Parliament is extremely interested in what we regard as one of the most important pieces of internal market legislation and one that enhances competitiveness. Competitiveness is absolutely crucial to the current agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight one or two points that the Committee on Legal Affairs considered in relation to our work on the universal services and users' rights directive. Firstly, we thoroughly endorse the Commissioner's opening statement about avoiding over-regulation. One specific measure in the universal services directive is aimed at ensuring that Member States do not intervene directly in the retail market to try and cap prices unless they have exhausted remedies at the wholesale level. They must be asked to keep that in mind and act on it.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is a practical one: we have put a lot of work into our directive on tariff transparency and publication, to encourage Member States particularly to address the issues of tariff transparency and comparison for private consumers and for small businesses. Unfortunately I have not seen a great deal of evidence that Member States have really taken that on board and I hope that will be picked up in the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We would encourage you, Commissioner, and your team to pay close attention to this whole transposition, to make sure that we get the maximum benefit from this very important piece of legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The committee adopted both of Mrs Read’s reports by a large majority, without us having to make major changes to them. This means, Mrs Read, that I can keep my comments relatively brief. Our group unreservedly endorses the Commission’s intention, which the committee has also approved, namely to increase the upper limit for aid granted for trans-European electronic networks from 10% to 30%. Although the overall framework is no bigger – which means that fewer projects can be supported – we were persuaded that the 10% limit was too low, so we support this motion, and you can rely on our unconditional support for the first report.</p>
<p class="contents">In the second report, your concern is to introduce greater flexibility into pan-European <span class="italic">e</span>Government services, which are capable of being used in every conceivable way. In it, you express your desire to do away with the Commission’s distinction between ‘projects of common interest’<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>and ‘horizontal measures’, thus allocating resources, totalling EUR 59.1 million for 2005 and 2006, and EUR 89.6 million for the period from 2007 to 2009, in a more flexible way. We support you in this concern, too, and I believe that both your reports, in which you describe the problems in great detail, will enjoy the support of a broad majority in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to conclude with an additional observation on the trans-European networks as a whole, a topic that has been on our agenda for many months, indeed for years. Up to now, the problem has been that these great projects – whether in transport, telecommunications, in the energy infrastructure, in research and technology – have suffered from insufficient financial resources. The consequence has been that the implementation of the Essen resolutions, which first sought to promote the trans-European networks, has been very slow, very sparing and very incomplete. A group of experts under Mr Karel van Miert conducted a mid-year study of the transport infrastructure. The Commission’s new initiative for growth, the sixty-two projects in which are expected to be signed off by the Summit, deals precisely with this area. Even though we are, today, discussing only funding and total budget, I can tell the Commissioner that the approach of promoting and extending trans-European networks is the right one if we want, not only to free up markets, but also to make Europe fit for the future and thereby move a bit closer to achieving the goal we set ourselves at Lisbon.</p>

I am very pleased that she realises, as we all do, the added European value of telecommunications for all of the Lisbon agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, on the trans-European networks, when I arrived in this Parliament, the talk of the town was the Delors White Paper, one of the main planks of which was European networks. I am delighted that the Commissioner and his staff have been adaptable enough to recognise that if the proposals put forward are not working as originally designed, the best thing to do is to, for example, concentrate on fewer projects in a more focused way and to increase the Commission contribution, since the 10% clearly was not stimulating the sort of initiatives we wanted. I strongly support their flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I also support, of course, the IDABC Programme as outlined by Mrs Read. I believe that one of the neglected parts of the Lisbon agenda is greater social cohesion, which the IDA Programme will contribute to greatly, as well as, of course, the knowledge-based economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The word 'interoperability' is appearing increasingly frequently. We are a continent comprising many small countries with different traditions. If we do not ensure that our systems can be brought together and work in an interoperable way, we are doomed to be less successful than continental blocs such as the United States. Therefore I strongly support the interoperability aim of IDA and its support of community policies as outlined by Mrs Read, those that are traditional – agriculture, employment statistics – and those that are newer – civil protection, humanitarian aid and justice and home affairs. I am also interested in making our citizens feel safer and, of course, I am also interested in the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to Mr Clegg's report, I would again like to congratulate him. He and others on the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy have been very vociferous in saying that it is simply not enough to pass directives and to put in place legislation if Member States then feel free to transpose that legislation according to some personal timetable which does not make Europe more competitive or promote social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I am glad that in your eighth report you bring out some of your tough instruments and make it clear that you will instigate infringement proceedings against those Member States which fail to transpose. This should be done far more frequently in a whole range of Community policy areas, because there are some Member States that take advantage of the markets created by those Member States that do transpose, while not playing fair themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with Mr Clegg that accession countries should be looked at.</p>

<p class="contents">The main aspects of the Commission’s proposals and of the reports have been highlighted, but I would like to insist on the aspects which appear to me to be fundamental. Firstly, the slowness of the process implemented on the basis of these proposals, which are very positive in terms of relaunching and achieving operational unity in the major communications networks and which, as the Commissioner has quite rightly stressed, within the context of enlargement, are very necessary. There is therefore an essential need to respond to this reality and at the same time to fulfil the Lisbon commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">But, unfortunately – and we see this in practice – there are obstacles to fully attaining these objectives, some of which – as has been pointed out – are highlighted in the White Paper by the former President of the Commission, Mr Delors.</p>
<p class="contents">There are basically two of these obstacles; the lack of discipline and commitment on the part of the Member States, a significant obstacle which distorts the market in these fields and, in particular, in the telecommunications fields, which is the issue dealt with in the report by Mr Clegg; and secondly, the financial difficulties in supporting and developing these major networks of communications, telecommunications and electronic services, in the case we are now considering.</p>
<p class="contents">Overcoming these two obstacles will clearly be the competence and responsibility of the Commission, but in this task it has the support of this Parliament and the Liberal Group which I represent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nick Clegg is saying that it only has to be provisional and I am saying that it must be permanent and firmer than the current regulation. I would have liked Nick Clegg to give greater consideration to the analyses of distinguished economists from Oxford and Cambridge, who stress that if competition policy is <span class="italic">ex post, </span>then the regulation has to be <span class="italic">ex ante</span> to meet the economic, social and environmental aims. The rapporteur stresses that incumbent operators must give way to competition and, although this is true, it will not automatically be efficient, nor will it even be effective where competition is limited.</p>
<p class="contents">The European telecoms sector has just come through a disastrous period in terms of investment and employment and has frittered away its lead with the GSM provision. A UMTS regulation would have allowed the use of infrastructure to be shared, instead of investors duplicating them and getting heavily into debt by doing so. Furthermore, the discrepancy between the ‘price’ criterion and the ‘quality’ criterion forced the UK regulator to impose greater quality obligations on British Telecom.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the social and territorial cohesion objective, the Commission report is particularly weak. Is there really universal access? We do not know. Does it need to be extended with effective territorial coverage for mobile phones with access for everyone to a fast Internet connection? There again, there is no opinion. Generalising the call for tenders procedure could favour all the pressures for eliminating universal service. As regards the issue of calculating the costs for special financing, the answers vary significantly depending on the choice of the relevant territory. All this becomes all the more important in the context of enlargement. Who will dare to say the liberalisation will be enough to ensure that private capital is invested <span class="italic">en masse</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">I will therefore speak strongly in favour of more stringent European regulation. There is no evidence to support the idea that the national regulatory authorities should simply be independent and regulate themselves. These authorities must be part of a legislative and regulatory framework in the public interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will, therefore, endeavour to be positive by saying that the three reports, despite everything, form part of a policy intended to prevent the digital divide and, from this point of view, I will not just thank the two rapporteurs for their work, but the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will also support these three reports.</p>
<p class="contents">I will go back over Mrs Read’s proposals in a little more detail because as regards these very technical subjects, which are, however, of financial interest to the European territorial authorities – and I am speaking as someone from the Auvergne, moreover – these proposals help to ensure that the information society is not left in the hands of one or two monopolies. There is not just Bill Gates in the age of computers, and that is just as well. I will, therefore, make every effort to concentrate more specifically on thanking all those who told us beforehand what they were doing, so that we could clearly follow the amendments that were being prepared.</p>
<p class="contents">The <span class="italic">e</span>TEN programme is a decisive implementation tool alongside the general rules for granting Community financial aid in the area of trans-European networks. This is provided for until 2005. The objective is to raise the aid ceiling to projects in the telecommunication sector from 10% to 30% and this proposal is not insignificant because it will probably enable the Lisbon objectives to be backed up and therefore <span class="italic">e</span>Europe to be developed in the area of services of general interest. This is precisely what we are interested in; that this is known as universal services or services of general interest, and that this service will in any case ultimately apply to all citizens and will be a tool that is strengthened for the good of all.</p>
<p class="contents">This concept of services of general interest is perhaps even truer, moreover, with the IDABC programme for the period 2005-2009. Indeed, we the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are as you know pro free software and have found that it is backed up because it is included in the idea of interoperable delivery of pan-European <span class="italic">e</span>Government services to administrations. We therefore support these projects. I will say, to conclude – because it is interesting news – that the town of Munich for example, apart from the example that was set with IDA, has switched to LINUX, to free software, and I hope that other administrations will take up the same challenges. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We will give our full support as regards expenditure, so much so that, for my part, I have sent a letter signed jointly by myself, as Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, and the Chairman of the Committee, supporting the Commission’s proposal on the IDA programme as regards raising the maximum funding level. What is the reason for this? We feel that 10% is only a symbolic gesture whereas raising the figure to 30% is a tangible action, which will show people that Europe is close to the citizens rather than far away, particularly where TENs are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur for this subject, however, I would like to speak about TENs in general. I feel that raising the maximum level is important for trans-European networks in general. We started with 10%, we raised the figure to 20% at first reading and now we are talking about 30%: this is significant. In addition to this, however, I feel that we need to amend the report on TENs so that it provides the possibility of introducing a subsidised system, with regard to all the networks included in the TENs in all sectors, including telecommunications and including IDA, in order to give the States the option of doing all this on the ground where they have problems with local authorities. I believe this is something that could streamline the procedure and provide an increasingly smooth channel for funding to reach the territory.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I must mention what is known as <span class="italic">e</span>-rewarding, which we already see as a comparative document and which should, in the future, reveal the good States and the bad States and, above all, make it possible to intervene where it is necessary to use the funds in question. Lastly, I would state that we certainly do not support what is known as the quick shortlist, in that it runs counter to the procedures of the Treaties. That area is not the responsibility of the Commission but the responsibility of the Council and Ecofin, on the one hand, and the European Parliament, on the other. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Tomorrow we will see that this report will not meet with resistance; quite on the contrary, it will be adopted with a great degree of consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">We are particularly advocating a competitive and open market. Why do we do this? Quite simply because we, in Europe, want to become more competitive. When competition is on a global scale, telecommunications are urgently needed as a key to the future, and our telecommunications need to be highly competitive. It is therefore of the utmost importance that this be implemented as quickly as possible, not only in the candidate countries, but also in the Member States. We do not want distinctions to be drawn; we want the regulatory authorities to make public the progress achieved in the various countries, so that benchmarks and best practice may show us how to advance more rapidly where broadband is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that there are, at present, a number of difficulties associated with the introduction of UMTS, because the auctioning of frequencies had an inflationary effect. I therefore think it makes a lot of sense for certain Member States to decide on tax incentives in order to get these new technologies up and running as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Reference has already been made to the overlap of work between regulatory authorities. It is indeed necessary to bring the national and European levels together, even though, of course, the main work should be done in the Member States, with the European level intervening only when absolutely necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">It is particularly important that these institutions should be independent, and I believe that, in the future too, we should take care to ensure the functioning especially of the technical interfaces in order to guarantee the systems’ interoperability. It might therefore make sense for the regulatory bodies to give some thought to the question of in which areas we need Europe-wide standardisation and in which mutual recognition, for it is, in the final analysis, targeted technical standardisation that can guarantee competition, it being of the utmost importance in terms of competition that interfaces should work and that the different systems should be capable of being used alongside each other.</p>
<p class="contents">We are of course all aware that businesses and entrepreneurs are tempted to create monopolies and keep technological innovations to themselves, but we must nevertheless guarantee the existence of a functioning market with technically well-executed interfaces.</p>

<p class="contents">Speaking mainly on Mr Clegg's report, one of the greatest obstacles to investment and competition in the telecoms market throughout Europe has been the lack of consistency and application in regulation. The differing requirements, and consequently the differing costs, have deterred new operators from starting up operations alongside existing ones. As a result, it has stifled the market and reduced competition. Therefore, I welcome this new regulatory package as it proposes changes by generating a consistent approach with the aim of liberalising the telecoms market. It provides a unique opportunity for all the governments to set the standards in a developing market and to finally begin fulfilling the goals we set at Lisbon, which have been all too slow to be realised.</p>
<p class="contents">Today's buzzword in the telecoms arena is 'implementation'. This is the key issue, more so now than before, as the sector is showing positive signs of stabilising. However, I fully support the rapporteur in questioning the Commission as to why it is that only five Member States have met the deadline for the transfer of the new regulatory package this year and why the Commission has been very slow in responding to this. What exactly is it proposing to do? The Commission needs to be tougher. We need action from the Commission, not just words, because delays not only penalise both new entrants and incumbents, but also put up barriers to the National Regulatory Authorities and the collation of information from the market players. We have to move on and we need proper market analysis on which we can base further action.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also extremely disappointed at the slow development of broadband. I have been contacted by numerous people in the West Midlands who have expressed their concerns about this moving at a snail's pace and the need to address that, especially in some rural areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This position is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect concerns increasing the maximum funding level from 10% to 30% of a project’s total investment costs at implementation stage, but without increasing the overall budget, which is a problem, because this means that fewer projects will be taking part at a time when a balanced development must be guaranteed. In other words, the countries with the greatest shortfalls must not find it more difficult to get projects funded. Consequently, this increase of the maximum funding level must be accompanied by an increase in the overall appropriations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In this regard, forgive me if I leave behind telecommunications and comment on the planned South-East European high speed railway, where it is surprising that the Vitoria-Irún-Dax Atlantic branch, with a link to Bilbao, has been removed from the Commission’s final report, according to the requirements of the European Council, despite the fact that the Basque Government has made a financial commitment to this line and has been prepared to build it since February 2001. Furthermore, this project can be in operation from the outset linking the French and Spanish States, via Irún, since there is already an international European gauge track throughout the French network as far as that point.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, the fact that this Vitoria-Dax branch is not included is not comprehensible either strategically or politically and I would call publicly on both the Council of Transport Ministers and on the Spanish Commissioner, Mrs Loyola de Palacio, for it to be reinstated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall now just concentrate on the report by Mr Clegg. The topic he deals with is now extremely important because the Commission is for example calling for the swift implementation of the new European regulatory framework in all Member States. Mr Clegg quite rightly criticises Member States which, despite pressure from the Commission and the sector, have not done enough to adopt the new legislative package as part of their own legal system. If Europe wishes to create a genuine Internal Market for the telecommunications sector as well, it is particularly important that we ensure that harmonised legislation is implemented. We must keep to what we have decided.</p>
<p class="contents">With circumstances as they are it is dangerous to start proposing measures to remedy the market situation before the telecommunications package has even been implemented. Given that eight Member States have not made the package part of their own legislation, it is nothing less than a scandal.</p>
<p class="contents">Point 34 in Mr Clegg’s report is not the correct way to proceed in the situation as it is now, since in my view it conflicts with the Universal Service Directive. Can we have the operators pay for these reforms in the infrastructure? As a list of obligations and remedying actions has just been launched on the market it is sheer madness to confuse the issue by adding new public service obligations or imprecise notions regarding a monopoly, which are oddly combined with perhaps some quite interesting business concept, which is to say the European service number idea.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole information and communications technology sector has to be regulated until the markets are fully competitive. That is only fair for everyone. Let, then, the new service concepts come about in a commercially competitive market where business developers skilled in their field will certainly do their work well. That is European innovation. Let us also do our work: let us enact laws that last. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have a few comments. Interestingly, a couple of studies have been carried out recently which compared levels of productivity growth and development in the EU and in the United States. One was conducted under the leadership of Professor van Ark of Groningen University. There, they have studied the industrial and service sectors, trying to spot the areas in which the gaps between the EU and the US have been narrowing and widening. The communications sector is one area in which Europe has done better than the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest issue of the Harvard Business Review came up with the same conclusion. Even though only two reference countries were used – France and Germany – productivity growth in Europe has been about 15% faster than it has in the United States over the last five years. Therefore, the liberalisation of telecommunications within our regulatory framework has provided a real boost for innovation and competition. I am also sure that investment into research and development has been very helpful. All this shows that the right pressure for competition and a push for innovation also boosts productivity growth, which is a major benefit for the whole sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, on future issues, I agree with Mr Clegg that in the long term, facilities-based competition encourages investment. The big challenge in applying these regulations will be how to build a bridge from service-based competition to facilities-based competition. The only way to do it consistently is via the opening-up of legacy networks, which have hitherto been financed under monopoly conditions. Where the opening-up of networks will require future investment and may involve risks, these risks must be properly assessed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Herzog made a very interesting comment. It is very clear that we need both ex ante and ex post regulation. Ex ante regulation should be used in cases such as universal services, when there is strong public interest, but once markets are fully competitive, then reasons for broad ex ante regulation will essentially diminish. Regulation is not the purpose here. The purpose is high-quality services for the citizens at competitive prices.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mrs Gill, as far as our measures on the implementation of the regulation are concerned, the Commission is extremely strict when it exercises its role as guardian of the Treaties. The infringement procedure has three phases. The first is the letter of formal notice, which we have sent out. We are waiting for the reply. When we have received it, we will produce a letter giving a reasoned opinion. If we are not happy with the reply we will take the Member State to court. We will be extremely cool and objective in applying these principles, so there is no reason for concern in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I also noted the comments of both Mrs Read and Mr Clegg on the accession countries. I am ready to have another look at this and will be happy to discuss that issue another time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
