<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Algirdas Šemeta, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Madam President, honourable Members, ten years after the events of 9/11, the risk of terrorist attacks remains real and aviation is still a preferred target. Airport security scanners are a valid alternative to existing screening methods because they have good detection performance, in particular to deal with the major risk from non-metallic threat items.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s draft measure does not impose the deployment of security scanners at EU airports, but allows Member States and airports wishing to do so to deploy security scanners at EU airports under strict minimum EU operational safeguards and detection performance conditions. It only allows the use of non X-ray security scanners. Failure to adopt the rules at European level will mean unilateral actions, and very possibly the US standards being imposed.</p>
<p class="contents">Where privacy and data protection are concerned, the use of security scanners raises important issues of privacy and data protection. The Commission fully agrees with Parliament’s objectives in this regard. Our draft measure imposes strict conditions for the use of scanners. These conditions are in line with the advice given by the Fundamental Rights Agency and the European Data Protection Supervisor, and provide all the necessary safeguards for the protection of fundamental rights, privacy and data protection. Passengers must be fully informed about the technology and of the conditions of the security scanning.</p>
<p class="contents">Hand searches, which are performed today to detect threat items, are perceived by many to be quite intrusive. The Commission’s draft measure aims to offer passengers and staff an alternative, by going through a security scanner. Two types of scanners currently exist. Both systems ensure compliance with security standards and respect fundamental rights. For example, security scanners shall not store, retain, copy, print or retrieve images.</p>
<p class="contents">One type of scanner, which is currently more common, makes use of a human reviewer to determine where possible threat items are to be found. To protect personal data in the use of such scanners, our proposal stipulates that no image can be seen at the security screening point, but is instead remotely analysed by a security officer located elsewhere. In addition, the image cannot be linked to the screened person and must be blurred or obscured to prevent the identification of the face of the passenger. The human reviewers analysing the image cannot see the screened passenger, nor do they have any access to personal data identifying the person. These safeguards address fundamental rights concerns by protecting the person’s dignity and privacy, and guarantee the protection of personal data. Moreover, these are minimum conditions and Member States can impose stricter ones.</p>
<p class="contents">The second type of scanner is able to recognise threats automatically. These machines do not produce a real image, but a stick figure which is marked with possible threat items. The Commission shares the view that automated threat detection is the preferred method. It is therefore committed to working closely with the industry and Member States to make sure that, as soon as possible, only such scanners are used. However, if today’s scanners were limited to models using stick figures, the market would be severely restricted, giving undue advantage to a few manufacturers.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, regardless of the type of scanner used, the draft measure gives passengers the possibility to choose not to go through a scanner. No passenger will be forced to use the scanner, as Parliament requested.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the procedure, while we understand your interest, the Commission does not believe that this draft measure should be adopted through the ordinary legislative procedure. Amendments to the methods of screening fall within the scope of the comitology procedure as established in the existing framework regulation on aviation security.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me recall that before presenting this draft, an open and transparent consultation process with all parties involved was conducted, including a public consultation and an impact assessment. The Commission exchanged views regularly with Parliament. We waited for Parliament’s resolution on aviation security of last July before finalising this draft. The current draft measures reflect Parliament’s opinion to the greatest extent possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, in a field like aviation security, decisions need to be taken quickly to respond to a security threat. This is in the passengers’ interest. The ordinary legislative procedure would not be appropriate to achieve this objective. The result would be that Member States would take national measures. The role of the European Union in aviation security, and the ability to set common EU standards, would be diminished.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important now to move forward on this file. Parliament, passengers, Member States and the aviation industry have been waiting for a clear position for a long time. A common EU approach to the use of this equipment is the only way to ensure both the highest level of aviation security and the best possible protection of EU citizens’ fundamental rights and health. Common EU rules also overcome the existing fragmented situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Later, in the same terms, the report that I myself presented to the Chamber was approved by a comfortable majority, with a great consensus and with the effort of the Commission and the political groups.</p>
<p class="contents">What were the reasons behind Parliament’s change of mind? Undoubtedly, seeing that all the requirements involved in accepting the use of these scanners were fulfilled, including the preservation of fundamental rights and, among these, in particular, the passenger’s dignity and privacy, non-discrimination, protection of personal data and protection of health.</p>
<p class="contents">In this way, we established what type of scanners were suitable for guaranteeing passengers’ security, on the one hand, and preserving their rights in full, on the other. The scanners will not use ionising radiation, they will not be mandatory for Member States, nor for citizens, and they will all protect the rights described above.</p>
<p class="contents">True, the Commission has captured all of these concerns in its proposed legislation but, in addition to scanners that use stick figures, it includes the possibility of another type which, whilst guaranteeing the same catalogue of rights, permits the inspection of an image of the passenger, albeit blurred.</p>
<p class="contents">We accept the reasons why it has proven necessary to include this alternative as an authorised method of control. Parliament also defends the need to guarantee fair competition and thus avoid any monopolistic temptation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, today we call on the Commission to retain all the precepts that we defended in my report, all the guarantees of preservation of fundamental rights. Moreover, we encourage it to work with industry and the Member States in order to ensure that in the near future, only automatic protection scanners are used and that no inspector is needed to view any image. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, you said that in this case, this proposal largely meets all Parliament’s demands. In my opinion, that is not the case, and also in my opinion, it is not the case either that all the privacy rights of passengers have been safeguarded. That is why we have just tabled an oral question on this.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, as Mr de Grandes Pascual stated, we had a report in which we discussed and set out what form scanners should take where these are permitted to be deployed as an additional security measure at airports. In this report, we also said that people must have a free choice as to whether or not they go through them. Health and human dignity must be protected; data and privacy must also be safeguarded.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, what has now been proposed is exactly what we did not want. We did not want to have scanners that show real images – whether or not these are blurred. I am familiar with these images; I have been to the US and have seen such scanners. I do not want something like that placed in Europe’s airports. These scanners do, in fact, allow quite a lot of a person’s body to be seen. To me it makes no difference whether or not the person looking at them is in another room and does not see the people in real life. It is a violation of privacy and intimacy, and we expressly discussed the fact that that is exactly what we do not want.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, the Commission’s proposal now states that something along these lines is to be permitted in order to implement our decision. Naturally, we are upset about it. That is why we are asking you to reconsider. There is the option of having simple stick figures, as they are known – in other words, schematic illustrations; either a green OK or a stick figure with red dots – showing, for example, that an arm should be investigated because something suspicious is indicated there. That really is something that we would like, without images being stored. That would protect people’s privacy as well as protecting data.</p>
<p class="contents">We are astonished, and we are not happy that something different is now being proposed. If the installation of something that is actually quite different is being considered, then we need a legislative process. We are talking about the citizens of Europe and that is why the representatives of these citizens need to be involved in a proper procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is no disagreement between the Commission and Parliament on the inclusion of body scanners as an additional security measure in the fight against terrorism. However, I still have some concerns about the way we are moving forward. We know that technology is already available which addresses the health, privacy and data protection concerns of screened passengers and would avoid passenger exemptions, yet the implementing measures produced by the Commission have failed to specify that the body image must be in the form of a stick figure, which colleagues have already raised, nor does it specify that backscatter radiation equipment is unacceptable to this Parliament, especially when there are effective alternatives.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, Commissioner, we need to raise our game in the areas of cross-border intelligence, counter-terrorism measures, the use of central reservation systems and, not least, passenger profiling in order to identify potential terrorists before they even reach our airports.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that we find a more sophisticated way forward in the fight against terrorism. To achieve one-stop security, we must have uniform rules applied in a harmonised and coherent manner across Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to begin by thanking the Commission for its statement and for the solid progress made on this matter. You will be aware that, three years ago, Parliament staunchly opposed the introduction of rules relating to the use of body scanners because, at that time, you were actually asking for a <span class="italic">carte blanche</span> in order to do what the Member States wanted without going into detail.</p>
<p class="contents">Much has happened in the meantime. Tests and trials have taken place at a number of airports. The technology has evolved enormously, and discussions have also taken place between the Parliament and your departments. You will be aware that we adopted a resolution a few months ago in which we summed up our conditions. You have taken them almost entirely on board.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that the introduction of body scanners in airports should not be compulsory. It is to remain optional. It is still possible for people to refuse to be scanned and to opt for an alternative screening method. Account has been taken of our demands concerning public health: scanners with ionising radiation are being prohibited. Strict conditions regarding privacy are also being attached. I am thinking, in particular, of the fact that security personnel are not allowed to make eye contact with a person going through the scanner, that images may not be stored, and that they are blurred. We would have preferred stick figures – that is a small nuance that does make a difference – but overall, we feel that we are able to support these proposals and that we, Parliament, must be consistent. You have taken account of our viewpoint. Let us now move ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is thanks to the European Parliament that X-rays have been banned from body scanners and that passengers have a free choice of whether to pass through a body scanner or not.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet we also clearly argued against the use of photographs and against there being security staff, male or female, sitting further up the chain looking at photographs of naked passengers. These arguments were not accepted. Why were they not accepted? The reason is that commercial interests come before private interests, before privacy. It is a little strange to know that the technology exists to use this equipment entirely without photographs but that privacy has been sacrificed because we apparently do not want to price certain companies out of the market. It cannot be right that our privacy and our freedoms should have to give way to companies which apparently are not innovating enough.</p>
<p class="contents">I would very much like to hear from the European Commission as to why it has chosen to bow to these companies. As I see it, the world has turned upside down. We could still do something about it, but no, the European Commission has decided in all its wisdom that these are merely technical measures and that legislation on this matter is not needed. Body scanners at airports is just the beginning. There are already body scanners at the Supreme Court in Paris. Who can tell us that companies or institutions, such as large museums, will not introduce such equipment in the future? How do we guarantee that citizens, visitors to museums, passengers at airports and train passengers will not be stared at by somebody further down the line? It is not necessary, we should not be doing it, and I would appreciate it if you would respect our wishes in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If you look it up in Wikipedia, a placebo is a sham medicine that contains no active ingredient and thus has no pharmacological effect. The fact is that a ten-month test phase in Germany, for example, showed that body scanners resulted in a lower level of security than conventional methods and were therefore a failure. Sweat stains were signalled as a security risk, tissues as a danger. There were false alarm levels of up to 100%. No body scanner in the world can analyse body orifices or inside the body. Objects hidden there cannot be detected. We should not suppose that terrorists are more stupid than they are. Where body scanners were used regularly, it was not the success rate that went up, but rather the abuse rate.</p>
<p class="contents">Take a look at the US: a woman there had to remove her breast prosthesis to prove what it was, and that was after scanning. In the UK, two women refused to be scanned for religious or health reasons and were not permitted to fly. The most embarrassing body checks exist as alternatives in various countries. The risk of abuse is likely to rise further in the future simply because the Committee on Transport and Tourism has decided, as stated previously, that real body images are possible. That means being able to see the actual outlines. There have already been cases of offensive remarks having increased and that is a human rights problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The word placebo comes from the Latin and means ‘I will please’. The only ones this will please are the market leaders in body scanners that make and sell this rubbish. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, they not only reveal what is hidden beneath a person’s clothes, but their whole body. I believe that body scanners can only be added to the list of authorised screening methods if, and I stress if, an independent body carries out a comprehensive, scientifically based impact assessment. This assessment should take into account immediate and delayed effects and the long-term cumulative impact on human health, as well as risks to personal data, individual dignity and privacy. I propose that we should once again seriously consider alternatives to the use of body scanners. We must use less invasive technologies which are completely reliable and do not infringe fundamental rights or pose a danger to human health. Specific rules should be laid down for especially sensitive or vulnerable passengers, such as pregnant women, children, people with disabilities or with specific illnesses making this type of check unadvisable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the points I would make is that when anyone uses airports, they do so of their own free will, they do not have to do so; so they do actually voluntarily give up part of their liberties. It has been said that, to protect us all, some of us have to give up part of our liberties. I do, however, support the view that alternatives – such as searches – should be available.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue has flummoxed this Parliament and the Commission for some time. In 2005, while this Parliament was completely opposed to body scanners, the European Union spent EUR 725 000 on six body scanners that have never been used and are sitting in a car park in Brussels. They are now obsolete, but you pay a yearly maintenance. This is another example of you saying one thing and asking people to do another. This should be a matter for Member States.

<p class="contents">Following the failed attack on a plane on 25 December 2009, more effective protection and detection technology had to be sought. Scanners at airports increase levels of security but they present problems, especially in relation to the protection of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council and the Commission accepted Mr de Grandes Pascual’s proposal that security scanners should not use technology based on ionising radiation. Now it must be decided whether the exploration mechanism will use real passenger images or stick images, which are the most appropriate option in order to protect the intimacy, privacy, health and dignity of passengers.</p>
<p class="contents">However, stick figures present a problem in terms of free competition since today, only one company has that technology. Although other companies in the sector have announced that they can introduce the algorithms needed in order to adapt the scanners, the machine configuration time could work against them.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the Commission should examine the timeframe for implementing the rules relating to body scanners, avoiding a possible monopoly situation and supporting decisively Parliament’s report and the report of Mr de Grandes Pascual, which are one and the same thing.</p>

The Commission proposal has, in fairness, taken into account much of the Parliament’s position, apart from the point which was our insistence that stick images be used. The Commission proposal does allow for body image technology to be used, but the image is to be blurred and obscured and, of course, the images will be remote. I have seen for myself in UK airports such as Manchester how that remote image technology works.</p>
<p class="contents">However, when passengers are given the choice to refuse to go through a security scanner, they will be subject to alternative security procedures. These must be proportionate and must also fall within what is deemed to be proportionate measures. The proposal does give us, however, an EU-wide framework; it does set minimum standards. It will also prevent situations such as passengers being told that they cannot fly if they do not go through a security scanner at all, and it will ban the use of X-ray security due to serious health concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">But the S&amp;D reiterate the request made in July that common rules on the use of security scanners must be revised on a regular basis and, when necessary, adapted to improve the protection of fundamental rights, health, privacy and personal data in line with technological progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But we are united. I thoroughly agree with what Ms Meissner has said and agree with some other people, like Ms Foster, for instance, from the ECR Group. It does seem to be a major missed opportunity that the Commission has failed to advance best available technology. It may well be that, at the moment, there is only one supplier of stick images but, as has been said, once the regulations are set, you can be absolutely sure that other suppliers will pile into the market.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I find the Commission decision frankly incomprehensible on both privacy and, indeed, technological grounds. We can have effective and more sophisticated security scanners that fully meet the privacy concerns, not only of the Parliament but the European Data Protection Supervisor, the Fundamental Rights Agency and so on. You are still going to capture a naked body image. Whatever is said about blurring or the reviewer being distant and so on, that is the fundamental problem and potential assault on both privacy and dignity. You have got the possibility of stick images with no human intervention. Why has the Commission missed this big opportunity to secure both technological advance and privacy?</p>

I want to start by saying that I do not want to be seen as somebody who upsets Liberal unity, but I would remind Ms Ludford that these proposals have actually come from a Liberal Commissioner. Members will be aware of the positions taken by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, both in its decision to agree with the Commission’s recommendations in regard to security scanners, and in the excellent work done by Mr de Grandes Pascual in his much wider report on aviation security.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe there is a need for a harmonised system – that is EU-wide – to put an end to different security measures being taken at Member State level, leading to anomalies that are confusing, inefficient and discriminatory. If you look at both the de Grandes Pascual report and the Commission’s proposal, you will see that 90% of what this Parliament demanded has been incorporated into those Commission proposals. The one outstanding issue is the one relating to the image shown by the machine and this issue, in my opinion, has detracted from the fundamental issue, which is that of aviation security. Yes, Parliament would prefer stick figures; but the question we have to ask is: are we as a Parliament prepared to throw out all the good things that are in that report purely on this issue? In my view, that would be wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">Members from other committees may feel that individual liberties should take priority over security – and that is their right. But for me, there is no greater civil liberty than for people to fly safely and securely without fear of being blown up, without fear of terrorist attack, which is why I am happy to agree with the Commission’s proposals.</p>

This is because it is a perfect example of a parliamentary debate that loses sight of the general picture when it becomes bogged down in technical issues or minor detail.</p>
<p class="contents">We have just heard Mr Simpson make a point of exceptional demagogy: ‘there is no greater civil liberty than for people to fly safely and securely’. Mr Simpson, there are various civil liberties and it is not just up to the Committee on Transport and Tourism to decide which of these actually matter and are of greater importance than the others.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I also believe that there are concerns about privacy and health issues here, but they are unlikely to be the last word on the question of body scanners because ultimately, even once these privacy issues have been successfully dealt with, there will remain yet another problem: these body scanners are expensive. It is going to be expensive to introduce these body scanners into airports throughout Europe and, despite what Mr Simpson says, that will not overcome people’s security concerns because, in five or six years from now, there will be new security threats and new types of equipment. In addition, there will always be terrorist threats outside planes, and we have the right to feel safe on trains, in shopping centres and in schools as well.</p>
<p class="contents">What I am trying to say with this is that there is no cost-benefit analysis in this debate (neither in the Committee on Transport and Tourism nor in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs) that will tell us: is it the citizens of Europe who are asking for this? The answer to this is no. The citizens of Europe are asking for jobs, education and health care. They are not asking for millions to be spent on body scanners.</p>
<p class="contents">That is something we are forgetting. We are forgetting all about this cost-benefit analysis and we are forgetting all about this part of the debate concerning the real world. That is why this debate is making me sad.</p>

Every day, however, lobbyists from the scanner industry were knocking on the doors of Members of the European Parliament to tell us: our scanner meets your concerns about privacy very well, but each one costs EUR 150 000 and we are going to fill every airport in Europe with them.</p>

However, I fail to see the purpose of this unprecedented rush to adopt body scanners when their effectiveness is disputed and, at the same time, the time required for passengers to go through security controls will certainly increase. Moreover, in addition to the high price that will doubtless need to be paid, they do not resolve the problem of how to protect passengers’ dignity and, more importantly, their health.</p>
<p class="contents">On the health issue, it is encouraging that the Commission has sought the opinion of the special scientific committee on new health risks. This was something that we proposed back in March. However, it is a pity that this opinion only relates to one type of scanner, rather than forming part of a more detailed study into the safety and suitability of scanners.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the question of fundamental rights, if the Commission’s decision to give passengers the right to opt out translates into an obligatory body search, as has happened in the United States, then I fear that this provision will prove to be even more problematic than the operation of scanners themselves.</p>

<p class="contents">The proposal carefully balances considerations of privacy, health and public security. I recall once more that scanners are voluntary; they are voluntary for the airports that use them and, what is of particular importance, they will be voluntary for passengers. This means that if a passenger does not want to be scanned, he can opt for another form of screening.</p>
<p class="contents">There was a question as to whether we put much thought into this issue; I think in this proposal – which was developed after very careful analyses and attempts to find a balance between privacy issues and security issues – that the right balance has been found.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider it particularly important to have harmonised EU rules in this field, because if we do not have harmonisation, then Member States or airports will start doing this on their own. We could have a much more chaotic situation without harmonisation, as each Member State and each airport could take any decision they like. I think that harmonisation is key in this particular area.</p>
<p class="contents">As it will be approved under comitology, adjustments that would better preserve passenger rights can easily be made following, for example, technological developments. In my introduction, I said that the Commission is also in favour of moving as fast as possible from the present situation to that of stick figures, but it takes time and we have to preserve competition on the market. By having comitology procedures, action could be taken very fast. When we look at developments in this area, changes in the rules could be made rather quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, we consider that the proposal is well-balanced, carefully thought through and I think that with this proposal, we will ensure both the privacy of passengers and – what is also extremely important – security.

It is undoubtedly very important and essential to guarantee aviation security, but we must ascertain the impact that measures created to ensure this security have on our health, fundamental rights, privacy, dignity and data protection. In the resolution it adopted on the impact of body scanners, and several times during discussions, the European Parliament has expressed concern over the possible infringement of the human right to privacy, the impact of radiation on health and the reasonableness of the cost of acquiring special equipment. Thus, before using body scanners, we must know exactly whether these technical security measures will guarantee effective protection of individuals travelling by air and whether they really will be safe, effective and sound. Furthermore, I would like to draw attention to the fact that, when applying new technical measures aimed at achieving a high level of airport security, it is also crucial to set boundaries between human rights and security itself, because those measures are not just about protecting citizens, but also about the impact on their health, rights and freedoms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
