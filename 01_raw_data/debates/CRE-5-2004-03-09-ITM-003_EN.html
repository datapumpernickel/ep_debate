<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, this proposal for a directive on the enforcement of intellectual property rights represents one of the main elements of a Commission action plan of November 2000 to combat counterfeiting and piracy, and complements the recent customs regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Counterfeiting and piracy are on the rise. They harm business, society and governments, as they are detrimental to innovation and creativity and can be very dangerous to public health and safety. Counterfeiters and pirates undermine legitimate business and culture as they copy end products that have involved considerable investment. Consumers and rights-holders are not the only ones to suffer. Member States are deprived of considerable amounts in lost taxation, and employment suffers when the business world is not flourishing. There is also a genuine threat to public order. Counterfeiting and piracy carried out on a commercial scale are nowadays believed to be even more attractive than drug trafficking, and its perpetrators are linked more and more to large-scale organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposed directive is the Community's answer to this threat. It is not an easy proposal since it touches upon issues which involve many interests, sectors and different ministries in Member States, for instance culture, trade and industry, economy and justice. There has been some very sensitive, sometimes emotional, lobbying both for and against this directive, and I appreciate the sense of responsibility that Parliament has shown in the face of this pressure. However, the need for action is clear and not in dispute.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that, with the text agreed by Coreper on 16 February, we have reached the right moment for a positive decision. The compromise text constitutes an appropriate balance among all interests involved, including rights-holders, commercial users, consumers and intermediaries. This balance has been achieved in a different way from that in the Commission proposal, but it has been achieved. The proposal constitutes a considerable degree of harmonisation and it will provide us with an effective level playing field on sanctions and remedies. This will be essential for creating a business environment where legal players are not disturbed by counterfeiters and pirates.</p>
<p class="contents">This fulfils the commitments made by both the Commission and the European Parliament in a communication of November 2000, which resulted from consultations carried out in the context of a Green Paper in 1998. It also contributes to the achievement of the Lisbon agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the safeguarding of the necessary balance and effectiveness of this proposal, the Commission supports the text on the table today, as proposed via the compromise amendments jointly tabled by four political groups. The compromise text is thus the result of joint and very intensive efforts from all three institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to thank the European Parliament as a whole for the interest it has shown in this important piece of legislation and its very constructive contributions, many of which can be found in the text before us today. In particular, I would like to thank the very competent rapporteur, Mrs Fourtou, the shadow rapporteur, Mrs McCarthy, and the chairman of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, Mr Berenguer Fuster, for their very professional and efficient guidance within their institution.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the Committee on Industry, and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market have given the issues at stake great thought, the fruit of which now lies before us in the form of amendments to be voted in this plenary. Consequently, the Commission endorses the amendments that go along the lines of the agreed compromise text: Amendments Nos 1 to 52 and 56 to 100. Amendments Nos 53 to 55 and 103 to 113 deviate from the text and must be rejected. The Commission feels that these amendments would not contribute to the balance and effectiveness that has been achieved in the compromise and, in particular, would not be in conformity with the horizontal approach. The directive should apply to infringements of all intellectual property rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In recognition of the harmful nature of counterfeiting and piracy, time should not be lost. The Commission would encourage the European Parliament to vote favourably on the Council compromise text so as to avoid any delay that would otherwise arise and would only serve the purpose of those trying to profit from illegal practices. Time will not improve this text. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would remind you that the Commission presented its text in January 2003. This initiative had been expected ever since 1998 when the Green Paper was published. Parliament demonstrated its determination to act against counterfeiting and piracy on a number of occasions, notably by voting unanimously on a resolution on this Green Paper and by signing a written declaration.</p>
<p class="contents">Being aware of the need to which I have referred, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market adopted on 27 November 2003 the amended report on the respect of intellectual property rights by 28 votes with 3 abstentions. Time is of the essence. On the eve of enlargement, there is also an urgent need to establish harmonised legislation so as to ensure respect for intellectual property rights, innovation and creativity in the 25 Member States. Accordingly, an original procedure was used.</p>
<p class="contents">At the behest of the Presidency of the Council, an informal three-way discussion was established to seek a compromise. The discussions took three months. In addition to the Council and the Commission, your rapporteur, the draftsman of the opinion, the Chairman of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and the shadow rapporteurs also participated in this process. I would like to thank them for their help and for their diligence. The Irish Presidency’s extraordinary commitment made it possible for this agreement to be reached in advance of the deadline, and I would like to extend special thanks to them. I am also grateful to the Commission, which did everything in its power to offer us continual assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments tabled today on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group reflect the text of the Council compromise in every detail. The text is extremely balanced, equitable and proportionate, reiterating our stance on the importance of intellectual property law, taking account of the concerns expressed by Parliament on behalf of a range of sectors, and now containing many safeguards to protect the interests of both right-holders and consumers. In accordance with international agreements into which the Community has entered, the scope of the application of the directive is broadened to cover all infringements of intellectual property law.</p>
<p class="contents">From now on, however, only acts committed for commercial purposes will be regarded as punishable. The definition of commercial purposes excludes acts committed by consumers acting in good faith who do not gain direct or indirect economic or commercial advantage. This extension of the scope of the application does not undermine any of the sectoral directives already adopted on copyright, electronic commerce and computer programs. The exception made for private copying is actually strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">The other important points of the text relate to the need to take account of the rights of defence. Notably, Article 8 on the provisional measures guarantees the right to defence by imposing a time limit, thus limiting the entitlement to institute legal proceedings, and by<span class="bold"> </span>providing for the defendant to be compensated.</p>
<p class="contents">The protection of personal data is strengthened. All measures taken must be justified and proportionate. They must not create barriers to legitimate trade or to competition. The judicial authorities must assess the specific features of each case. They must also assess whether or not the infringement was intentional. All measures envisaged are civil and administrative sanctions. Providing as it does for revision of the directive, especially in line with changes to Community legislation, this is a forward-looking compromise. </p>
<p class="contents">If you support the proposed compromise amendments, this directive can be adopted at the first reading, within the life of this Parliament. This will show how efficiently the three institutions can work. It will send out a positive message on integration to the enlarged European Union. It will strengthen confidence in the internal market. This is what is needed to meet the challenge of the Lisbon objectives. It is what is required to ensure that Europe’s economy, characterised by its innovation, can become the most competitive economy in the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And perhaps you are not aware of this obvious fact because I am doubtful whether, in this case, the European Parliament has fulfilled its duties properly.</p>
<p class="contents">I will explain. In December, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market voted for a text, which is not going to be approved today, but rather certain amendments are going to be approved which differ radically from what was voted for in that meeting of the committee. Why was there this disparity? Because what the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market voted for responds to the honourable Members’ will, while the ultimate paternity of the text we are going to approve today corresponds to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Please do not imagine that what I am saying is in any way a criticism of the rapporteur; far from it. Mrs Fourtou has done good work trying to reconcile positions, but in the end she has been faced with an inflexible position on the part of the Council, which has said ‘if you want the Directive to be approved, you must approve what we say’. And since we are aware of the need to approve the Directive, what we have carried out – and Mrs Fourtou in particular – has been an exercise in responsibility. But sometimes we should ask ourselves whether we also impose this exercise in responsibility on the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">There can be no doubt that this Directive is necessary, but nevertheless, it is doubtful whether the text approved will resolve the problems which have been raised. I believe it is no mistake to say that the text approved is going to be the laughing stock of commentators and is going to cause many difficulties for the Member States when it comes to incorporating it into their internal law. The Council’s desire to prevent the European Commission’s initiative from containing, for example, criminal law provisions, has created such confusion between civil sanctions, administrative procedures and administrative sanctions, that I cannot imagine what the Member States are going to do when it comes to applying it.</p>
<p class="contents">We are clearly going to approve this text, but with great scepticism. At the same time, the Spanish Socialists at least are going to support certain amendments in order to reflect the fact that the Council, with the enforced cooperation of the European Parliament, has completely undermined what was originally a very good Commission initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sure that it was really not easy to reach agreement on this complex dossier not only between the groups but also with the Council and the Commission. The text now before us, which is to be voted on tomorrow, is a good compromise that we should all accept.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all familiar with fake, cheap Rolex watches, Lacoste shirts, with the cheap imitation Levi Strauss jeans, Louis Vuitton bags, and many other products besides. Music and films on CD and DVD are being pirated. When you see everything available on the market, you might well think that product piracy is a trifling offence. But it is not, ladies and gentlemen, far from it: counterfeiting and product piracy certainly are not minor offences. They cause losses running to millions in Europe every year and they are consequently a threat to our economy and above all to jobs in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The object of the directive is to create uniform ground rules for combating product piracy. On the eve of EU enlargement, it gives the right signal at the right time. What is the directive intended to achieve? It is of course intended to have a deterrent effect on product pirates and counterfeiters. The directive provides a process-based framework here. It does not actually introduce anything new, but it attempts to provide a new framework in terms of process, so that we can take action against product pirates across Europe in accordance with uniform rules.</p>
<p class="contents">What should the directive not be allowed to do? It should not of course be allowed to criminalise or stigmatise young people who occasionally download some music from the Internet, but the directive has also made provision for this. The criminal penalties originally included in the draft have been taken out again – also thanks to the pressure exerted by our rapporteur – and the directive stipulates that sanctions should only be applicable in a fair and proportionate manner. There are provisions that go beyond these mechanisms in order to prevent young people from being criminalised. The directive makes this clear and it will not come to that.</p>
<p class="contents">One point that Mrs Fourtou also mentioned, and with which I agree, is that the directive should not of course create any barriers to competition. It is not acceptable for competitors to be kept out of the market by relying on alleged infringement of copyright. A recital has been specially included in the directive to the effect that this should not be the aim of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive, including the amendments we are to vote on tomorrow and which I hope will be accepted, provides a good, fair compromise between the interests of all the parties involved, and I urge you to support the line taken by the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">McCarthy (PSE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, we all know that counterfeiting and product piracy has reached epidemic proportions. The lack of harmonised enforcement rules means that counterfeiting is a low-risk business where for a low investment counterfeiting pirates are guaranteed enormous profits. The UK's Anti-Counterfeiting Group has estimated that as many as 4 000 people lose their jobs as a result of this trade and that the GBP 1.75 billion lost in VAT alone could build four new hospitals a year.</p>
<p class="contents">Clothing and footwear companies suffer the greatest losses and consumers are the victims. Their health and safety is put at risk with fake medicines, foodstuffs, toys coated in toxic lead, flammable children's clothing and fake alcohol containing high levels of methanol which has led not only to people being hospitalised but also, in one case in Scotland, to the death of a woman.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own region, north-west England, trading standards intellectual property groups' seizures of counterfeited pirate goods is on the increase. Here is one example: this is a Manchester United football shirt, coveted by many youngsters. It is a fake, but was sold to consumers on the high street at full price. Far from a bargain. This is a packet of Viagra, now available over the Internet. 50 000 such packets were seized at a house in Oldham. They are imported from Thailand and distributed by a vast network of counterfeiters across the region.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a more sinister side to this counterfeiting and piracy. The Organised Crime Task Force in Northern Ireland has reported that nearly half of all organised crime groups are involved in IP crime. Two thirds of these groups have links to paramilitary organisations, so the draft law we are voting on today should be seen in context. It is not as ambitious, radical or draconian as many opponents would like to portray. Nor is it a panacea for rights holders. It is a first modest and cautious step in an EU-wide commitment to fight counterfeiting and piracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate the Irish presidency for having agreed a text which is balanced and proportionate and whose actions are focused on tackling genuine and serious acts of infringement. <span class="italic">Bona fide</span> consumers engaged in acts on a commercial scale have nothing to fear from this new EU law, as consumers acting in good faith are excluded from its scope.</p>
<p class="contents">A further safeguard is that commercial scale is defined as acts resulting in commercial and financial gain. Moreover, action can only follow, as a result of a justified and proportionate request by the claimant, on the authority of a competent judge or court and only for intentional infringements on a commercial scale.</p>
<p class="contents">Contrary to the hysteria and misrepresentation spread by certain sections of the EU press, there is no question of dawn raids on teenagers in their homes. The law has no criminal provisions. It is restricted to civil and administrative remedies. There are no double damages. The directive reinforces judicial discretion and ensures that remedies are fair, equitable, proportionate and justified.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an enforcement directive and one that cannot write IP law. Nor can it rewrite it or change e-Commerce law, in particular the responsibility of ISPs as defined in Articles 12 to 15 of the e-Commerce directive. It cannot undermine the right to private copying as provided for in the Copyright directive, and in fact reinforces that right and protects the right of privacy. The actions taken must guarantee compliance with data protection laws.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 23 provides for an assessment of the impact of the directive and Parliament will take that seriously. The intention is to show that it is applied in a balanced and proportionate way and it should be stressed that the directive must not be used to abuse the right of legitimate competitors to enter the market place, in particular that for generic medicines.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her willingness to compromise, and the Irish presidency for its determination in forcing all parties to come to agreement. We must today take the bold step of voting this law onto the statute book. We must send a signal to counterfeiters and pirates that we are serious about closing the enforcement loopholes that they exploit. We must give judges and courts in the enlarged EU the option of a range of enforcement tools. It is time for the EU to get tough on counterfeiting and piracy. It is time we stopped allowing counterfeiters a free ride at the expense of consumers, legitimate businesses, EU jobs and the EU's competitiveness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market took a rather different view, but, ultimately, I think that this compromise is a start, and indeed I hope that it is adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">We finally have recognition of intellectual property rights throughout Europe. Although there were already various directives and laws in existence, for example regarding copyright, e-commerce, and software, there was no discussion – or at least insufficient – of enforcement, and as a result we in Europe find ourselves with a hotchpotch. In that regard, it is good that we now have a kind of umbrella legislation for harmonised implementation, throughout the EU, of all the directives already in existence in the field of intellectual property rights.</p>
<p class="contents">As many have now said, counterfeiting and piracy within Europe are growing hand over fist. We are seeing criminal organisations switching from drug trafficking to counterfeit goods because the chance of being caught is minimal and there is just as much money in it, if not more. I think that we must call a halt to this. I think that we need a harmonised approach, not only because criminal organisations are earning money illegally from these goods, but also in order to protect our economy, to achieve the Lisbon objectives, and ultimately, in particular, to protect consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Why so? We are not just talking about pirated CDs, as some people think, but about a broad spectrum of products that are being counterfeited. I shall take toys as an example. I have seen toys that contain cadmium. Under the Directive on cadmium, this substance is prohibited in toys manufactured in Europe, but counterfeit products can still contain it, as they are illegally imported. Medicinal products are another example. There are examples of painkillers that contain talcum powder, and I think that this is unacceptable. Much money is to be made from it but, in my opinion, consumers must be protected. Even aircraft parts are being counterfeited, because there are large profits to be made from this. It is a good thing that something is being done to put an end to this.</p>
<p class="contents">I was the one who, at the Green Paper stage, suggested including a reference to criminal law. The reason for this is that we would not buy a stolen bicycle, because it has been stolen – our principles would not allow it – but we would like a counterfeit Breitling watch or other counterfeit product, because it is cheap. If this is included in criminal law, and possession of a somewhat dearer counterfeit product becomes a punishable offence, there will no longer be a market for this, and there will no longer be an incentive for organisations to produce counterfeit goods.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a shame that certain strict rules have not been included, as my colleague Mr Berenguer Fuster has already remarked, but I nevertheless welcome the compromise that has been reached. A large number of ambiguities that lobbyists have been using up to now as arguments for voting against it have been removed from the proposal. It is my opinion that this proposal is the beginning of the end of counterfeiting, and I hope that this will develop into a fully-fledged directive with fully-fledged means of monitoring compliance with it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not want them all to be put on the same footing.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, as regards consumers, I regret that the Commission proposal has not been kept as it was. I regret it has been broadened rather too far, in that it holds consumers, as – shall we say – citizens, every bit as responsible for piracy as industrialists. This is my first point on consumers. Treating all European citizens as consumers in this way seems simplistic.</p>
<p class="contents">The second very important point is this: If this directive seeks to combat something that exists now, how will things turn out in the future? Over the last few years, discussions concerning intellectual property and industrial property have highlighted the difficulties relating to borders. Some say that intellectual property is the oil of the twenty-first century. They may be right. If intellectual property really is the oil of the twenty-first century, then of course it is important to talk about it. Nonetheless, the fact that this House has discussed such matters as the ability to patent living organisms or free software suggests how important the issue of borders will be in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if this problem has not yet arisen, it definitely will in future. Not everything can become industrial or intellectual property. It is essential to raise this issue, but in a sensible manner. Borders will certainly be an issue in the near future and thereafter even if they are not yet one today.</p>
<p class="contents">This leads me to speak on behalf of, or to speak for, those who use acronyms. I am of course talking about artists. Are artists happy to be equated with industrialists? As a member of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, I do my best to listen to all those sectors. From what I have read and from what I understand, we would do well to take account of artists’ views on intellectual property. If we take account of the views of industrialists and consumers, should we not also consider artists, especially as they are always referred to in connection with the need to combat piracy?</p>
<p class="contents">As regards artists, authors’ rights and intellectual property do not appear to be the only problem, and that – as music and music piracy are talked about so glibly – young artists and creative artists would like a different approach. It may be necessary to defend these artists appropriately in this regard. I do not believe that the House should allow all these various parties to be dealt with in the same way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Right from the start all the shadow rapporteurs were involved in the discussions and also in the trialogue. That is something I have rarely experienced in this House. And she did that long before her family circumstances were seized upon by the press. I do not wish to comment on that now, I shall leave that to my colleague. So much for the form.</p>
<p class="contents">There are problems, however, as has already been mentioned, particularly by the previous speaker. That this directive is needed is something on which everyone – including Members of this House – agrees. So do the players in the market, ranging from the telecommunications industry to consumer protection organisations, from the pharmaceutical industry to generic drug manufacturers, from artists to content producers. We need a good directive. I believe, though, that the compromise that we have negotiated has not entirely succeeded in addressing these many and diverse needs and concerns in a single directive.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two specific policy areas where reasonable agreement is important. One is that we wish to limit the scope of the directive somewhat, to use for commercial purposes; the other area is that of patents. There is certainly scope for debate about patents and also about common practice in Europe. But it remains a fact that we do not have a European-level patent, and we do not want to use the implementing directive to pave the way for one through the back door. This needs to be discussed very carefully; it is not such a simple matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore urge you to give a large measure of support to these two amendments on patents and the scope of the directive. I believe that this directive, this compromise, will then have been sufficiently improved for us to jointly adopt it as a compromise before the end of this parliamentary term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a good reason why the conciliation has its rules and its methods of proceeding: in order that a large number of MEPS, and Parliament itself, might be involved in the debate and in clarifying the uncertainties in the text that little by little takes shape. This also means that it is not, then, four or five representatives from political groups that commandeer the procedure to achieve a compromise text a few days from the vote, with orders for MEPs and individual MEPs in the groups to toe the party line and not to touch what four or five MEPs have decided in this early conciliation. I, contrary to Mr Imbeni, do not consider this to be a good procedure. We then notice the implications in connection with this report. It is not true that this compromise clearly limits the scope. If this were the case, if this were also your intention, then you would, for example, be able to adopt Amendment No 101 – which we tabled with some other Members – which explicitly limits the scope to intentional infringements for commercial gain. The truth is that, even though criminal sanctions have been removed from the compromise, preventative measures remain that are very dangerous regardless of the outcome of the inquiry and the procedure. The risk is adopting a system which thus makes it simple, and even partly up to private companies themselves, to search, confiscate goods and take preventive measures that risk putting the market in a situation of uncertainty and instability, where those who are most organised in having lawyers and legal consultations – large corporations – will best succeed in scaring and blackmailing small and very small businesses and also the end consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not true that private copying is excluded from the scope of this compromise, because it is not excluded from preventive measures. Why all this? Why was it necessary to do all this and to devise this type of special emergency legislation? Perhaps because the laws on intellectual property are laws that have been superseded to a large extent by digital technology. The risk is that you, the very people who want intellectual property to be respected, in the same way as physical property – and this is also our concern – end up adopting laws that cannot be respected. It is not with policing measures and private policing that the desired objective is achieved. Such measures achieve the opposite, that is to say they delegitimise the power and value of the laws. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to achieve framework legislation, I believe that a lot of work will have to be done in this Parliament’s next parliamentary term. I must congratulate my colleague Mrs Fourtou because I believe that she has put together the best of the possible compromises. As with any compromise, however, I did unfortunately find some shortcomings in this report. For example, even providing for potentially effective instruments to combat activities such as peer to peer or fair sharing, does not allow for the content provider to be fully protected, a situation which risks seriously compromising the reliability of any library. The report is directed solely at crimes committed on a commercial scale and not more generally at infringements of intellectual property rights regardless of how or by whom they are committed. A lot of attention clearly needs to be given to this point in order to find a point of balance. This was a long task that lasted many months. I do, however, remember that, from the outset, the objective in terms of protecting copyright was to combat and stop the phenomenon which, alongside counterfeiting and piracy, allows material protected by copyright to be used illegally to the detriment of the work of all content providers who are legitimately building up the value chain for the use of audiovisual products.</p>
<p class="contents">Particularly in future, we need to reflect further on the issue of the amount of private use that has increased exponentially thanks to the impetus provided by digital technology via broadband or any other advanced technological platform. This will cause a significant and quantifiable commercial prejudice for all the content providers that base their operating model on the legal distribution of content, subject to contractual agreement with the parties entitled. In this area, too, we need to consider the consequences of the new legislation on telecommunications. In fact, not only does the wording of the proposal for a directive lose sight of some important aims, but it does not even constitute an effective deterrent against infringement because, in the long process in which the various proposals were made, the possibility disappeared of compensating for the two-fold<span class="bold"> </span>prejudice in the form of loss of profit and loss suffered. I confirm that, in the short term, to obtain an effective instrument, we need to give maximum support to the rapporteur, Mrs Fourtou, and that, in future, we must do a lot of work in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two final remarks, one relating to Recital 22. This states that prohibitory measures can be taken against intermediaries whose services are used by third parties only to infringe industrial property rights and not, as provided for in Articles 10 and 15, intellectual property rights. Such a discrepancy between the text of the regulation and that of the Recital is not without importance, because it signifies an intention to support an interpretation whereby the term intellectual property contained in the text of the articles actually refers only to cases of intellectual property. I therefore call on Mrs Fourtou to table an oral amendment in which ‘industrial property right’ is replaced by ‘intellectual property right’. In this regard, I am thinking about Italian producers protected by geographical indications, who, in a situation of this type, could not obtain an injunction in other European countries against, for example, traders, carriers or advertisers who sell, transport and publicise counterfeit Italian products.</p>
<p class="contents">A final comment on Article 16. I think that it is really important that the final phrase of Recital 23a is reintroduced as a final paragraph of this article. In the absence of such regulatory specification, you might think in many countries that if – after the person in possession of counterfeit goods in good faith has paid compensation – the judge waived the prohibition of the sale, and exclusion from the commercial chain, of these products, they would be authorised for any commercial use. If we think, for example, about the whole medical field, this becomes totally unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some people tell us that Mrs Fourtou has achieved a wonderful compromise and others tell us that the big political groups have behaved like a kind of steamroller. We have heard speeches from Members of the different political groups, including the big ones, expressing very different opinions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Fourtou has tried to speed up the legislative process with what we could call ‘<span class="italic">a proto-conciliation procedure</span>’, but I believe we should assure Mr Imbeni that the procedure remains in place. The problem is that the current procedure for approving legislation in the European Union, before the adoption of the European Constitution, is a truly elaborate, complicated and difficult procedure. The recently signed Interinstitutional Agreement intends to eliminate these difficulties, but we know that that is going to be very difficult to achieve in practice. And this is because if there is no clear identification of a legislative body – which I believe must be as unified as possible – we are condemned to continuing to adopt this type of legislation in which there are great contradictions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Berenguer Fuster said that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market reflected the views of the Members of Parliament. I disagree with that, because the majority of reports approved – including by a great majority in the Committee on Legal Affairs – are usually then rectified in plenary. In other words, as a result of its composition, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market does not currently reflect the will of the whole House. Mrs Fourtou has tried to achieve an agreement which does not reflect the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. I do not know if she will achieve that agreement, because we do not yet know what the result of the vote will be.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about a report with many amendments, with enormous amendments, and which, theoretically, should not affect substantive law. We are talking about a right relating to the application or implementation of the substantive content. Mr Berenguer may be right about the confusion between civil, administrative and criminal enforcement procedures, but it appears that the attention has been to eliminate criminal enforcement or, at least, the possibility of criminal proceedings, and this is due to the European Union's lack of competences in the criminal field.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the scope of the directive has been extended – or it is intended to do so – so that it also includes the field of patents, which is a field in a degree of turmoil.</p>
<p class="contents">My impression, Mr President, is that this first reading is going to produce a text typical of these Community institutions: a kind of camel – that is, a horse designed by a committee – and that it will probably only be the beginning, but I believe it is preferable for us to adopt this proposal for a directive as quickly as possible, at least so that we may have a departure point to work from, firstly in the second reading and then, no doubt, when further legislative proposals are needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We shall thus escape a second or third reading.</p>
<p class="contents">Reference has been made many times already to the adverse consequences of counterfeiting in all kinds of fields, and to the risks to public health and innovation. The situation has worsened over the past three years, and all kinds of product are now found, even current consumer goods. The extent of the phenomenon is becoming increasingly alarming, and organised crime is increasingly involved. An initiative at European level is urgently needed, therefore, particularly as these phenomena are largely based in the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The positive points in the report include the fact that the Directive is to apply to all infringements of<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>intellectual property rights. Member States must also ensure that any serious infringements of intellectual property rights are classified as criminal offences punishable by criminal penalties. It is well-known that creativity and innovation are the key trump cards in our European economy, and so they must enjoy sufficient protection. I should like to appeal for support for the rapporteur in her fight, therefore. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I, therefore, strongly support the idea of introducing a directive of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I do not agree entirely with Mr Byrne when he claims that a balance has been struck. That is not what we hear from the Generic Medicines Association, which is very fearful that extension of this set of remedies to patent law will damage its interests and thus the interests of the health services of Europe and beyond. A balance has not been struck. Patents must be excluded, and the point about the commercial scale must be extended to the whole of the directive, not just to some parts of it.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I say with great personal sympathy for Mrs Fourtou that this case shows up a gap in our rules about declaration of interests. The issue of familial interests needs to be included. I say that without any personal discourtesy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not specifically about the digital world. It is about the future of the European economy and about the ability of any manufacturer who has intellectual property rights, whether protected by patent, copyright or registered design, or indeed by any other form of ownership, over a creative work or design that they have genuinely originated, to be able to protect and sell their products in a legitimate way, reap the profits and create jobs within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about the procedure and timescale because we all know that as from the enlargement of the European Union on 1 May there will be major concerns about the inability of intellectual property owners to enforce their rights across the enlarged European Union. Many of my colleagues have given graphic examples of the problems associated with the counterfeiting on a large scale of physical goods that are being shipped into the European Union and essentially sold illegally, thereby depriving people of their legitimate livelihoods. Let us put matters into perspective, since this is the nub of the issue and is why we have supported Mrs Fourtou in her work with the Council aimed at reaching a genuinely balanced compromise that will be in place on 1 May, thereby ensuring we do not have to wait another six to nine months to deal with this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in the real world now, and this is not some theoretical piece of legislation but something that will actually protect jobs in our constituencies. As we move towards a world in which more and more goods are coming into the European Union from countries, such as China, that are new members of the World Trade Organisation and where intellectual property enforcement is at best very weak, we have to be able to protect ourselves in a legitimate and balanced way.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what is at stake, and those of you who are contemplating amending this proposal with the result that it is not in place on 1 May will have to answer to manufacturers in your constituency when a container load of counterfeit goods from China arrives through an accession country on their doorstep in June. You will have to answer for the impact this will have on local jobs and local manufacturers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Copying on a small-scale for personal use will then be left alone. We have no need or means to interfere when it is a matter of copying by private citizens. In the information society the invasion of people’s privacy is a most dangerous and mostly ignored problem. The counterfeiting of food products has risen by 75% and that of CDs by 15 000%, which is almost half of all musical recordings. Approximately 20 000 jobs are lost each year. It is important, however, that a distinction is made between conscious and unconscious infringement of copyright. This is also important because it safeguards product development in small companies by guaranteeing some sort of protection in the sea of patent legislation. I am happy that there will therefore no longer be interference in criminal law, an area which lies within the competence of the Member States. The different practices and laws that exist in the Member States would make it an especially awkward task. After all, the same package deals with patents and copyright. Piracy, the result of commercial crime, takes away jobs. Nevertheless, we should not interfere in the private lives of the innocent. Let us make additional improvements to the next directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After all, there is already a directive in force regarding the harmonisation of copyright, and, besides, there is the Directive on e-commerce, which regulates, among other things, the rights and obligations of service providers. This new Directive threatens to cause disruption on account of the obligation to monitor what users are doing. The present compromise explicitly stipulates that previous directives remain fully in force, therefore, and that is the way it should be: why else do we make legislation here? We do not want a US-style situation in which legislation is made according to the misconceptions of the day. This new Directive on enforcement officially declares people making illegal copies to be thieves, but everyone has known for a long time that pirating of software, CDs and DVDs is a punishable offence. We certainly do not need a new directive to do this, and especially not one that fails to define the scope of intellectual property rights. We in Europe have different criminal justice systems with different penalties, and we cannot harmonise legal systems with a single directive, particularly without a proper debate in this Parliament. I can say that I am pleased that the compromise now restricts the scope of the directive to piracy for commercial purposes, as copying for personal use must continue to be permitted. Nevertheless, I shall be voting against the Directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are voting on a very important report, one that has a wide-ranging impact on economic affairs and on the citizens of Europe. How are we going to explain to the citizens of Europe that Parliament’s rapporteur, the person most directly involved with this dossier, happens to be married to Mr Fourtou, the chairman of Vivendi Universal? Let there be no confusion. I certainly recognise that every man and woman has the fundamental right to hold political office. Mrs Kinnock is a Member of the European Parliament but she does not get involved with subjects relating to the portfolio held by her husband, Commissioner Kinnock. Mr Rovsing, a member of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, has interests in the media, but he refrains from voting on media issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The credibility of the European Parliament is at stake here. I appeal to the President of Parliament and to the Chairmen of the political groups to find a solution to this problem by noon. Parliament’s honour is at stake.

In fact, creativity, which is one of the main factors of competitiveness in our economic system, is being prevented by counterfeiters because they are affecting the industrial and intellectual property rights. These rights ensure that creativity is adequately rewarded. Often, counterfeiting and piracy also end up affecting consumers, who are forced to purchase goods of a quality inferior to the original. The damage that they cause not only affects the individual holder of the right but the whole of society. The directive on the application of industrial and intellectual property rights is therefore an important instrument in combating the phenomenon and must be quickly adopted before the accession of the new countries, where counterfeiting and piracy are particularly widespread.</p>
<p class="contents">The text negotiated with the Council, which Parliament should widely agree to, is a balanced compromise that should enable the directive to be adopted in just one reading. The current European and national legal framework on industrial and intellectual property is being respected. The conditions to effectively protect it and to more actively combat illegal trade are being created. The compromise rightly provides for the most important provisions of the directive to apply only to commercial practices. We cannot, indeed, plan to punish those who download music from the Internet just for personal use. A request for information from the alleged counterfeiter by the person declaring that a product is counterfeit must be justified and proportionate and should only be made by order of the judicial authorities. Furthermore, the directive does not influence the rules on confidential information and the treatment of personal data or the right not to testify against oneself. It specifies the administrative and civil sanctions that, directly affecting any illegal economic activity, have direct consequences on prohibiting counterfeiting. These sanctions should indeed be dissuasive but should also be gradual and proportionate to the crime committed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the fact that certain Members of this House have family relatives – and I would be grateful if Mr Turmes would remain in the House – does not prevent them from acting in it, particularly since what we are discussing, this Directive in the field of enforcing intellectual property rights, does not exclusively affect right holders, but all consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also we consumers who have to ensure that the protection of intellectual property rights is guaranteed, because we want the products we buy to be original and authentic and we do not want to be deceived by people who violate intellectual property rights. I therefore believe that to try to use Mrs Fourtou’s relatives to discredit her work is not worthy of a Member of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two aspects which have been fully debated this morning. One of them relates to commercial purposes. It is true that we have modified the Commission's proposal, which was restricted to acts carried out for commercial purposes. We need to go a little further; I believe that the rapporteur’s proposal and the compromise amendments are balanced, and that we had to ensure that anybody carrying out any act against industrial or intellectual property could be prosecuted, whether that act was for commercial purposes or not.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to Mr Fiori, who spoke before me, the inclusion of industrial property is important, and in the case of Spain in particular, since the Spanish legislation in the field of trademarks and patents is considered industrial property rather than intellectual property. The definition has therefore been extended to both.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the procedure, mentioned by Mr Cappato and Mr Berenguer, what we intended is something very important: to obtain a directive which could enter into force before 1 May 2004. It is therefore true that Mrs Fourtou has had to make certain efforts to reach agreement and that the proposal we are voting on today in this Parliament is not exactly the same as the one voted for in committee. Nevertheless, many of the aspects which were approved in the committee are included in what we are voting on today, apart from the two points I have referred to: commercial purposes and patents.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many other aspects that we have revised from the Commission's initial proposal, such as, for example, the reduction of procedures and costs for the applicant, in order to speed up and guarantee respect for their intellectual property rights; the simplification of the guarantees to be provided by the applicant in the event of defending their industrial or intellectual property rights; the establishment of compensation in the event of an infringement of industrial or intellectual property and, finally, considerations relating to the destruction of objects used for counterfeiting or the counterfeit objects themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">These are other aspects of the Commission's proposal that we have modified and which, as the Commission has said, make this directive sufficiently balanced for the times we are living in. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
