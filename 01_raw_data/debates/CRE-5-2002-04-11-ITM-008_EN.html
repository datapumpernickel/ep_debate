This question remains unanswered, despite the way out of their misery that the Americans are providing by offering to receive them. Unless this question is answered, we are only treating the symptoms while the problem continues to spread insidiously.</p>
<p class="contents">This evil is, quite simply, the Vietnamese government’s multiple disenfranchisement of ethnic minorities, whom the present resolution calls Montagnards, extending even to the persecution of the latter. This disenfranchisement is social, religious and economic in nature.</p>
<p class="contents">The ‘Kinh’, the so-called real Vietnamese, consider themselves superior to the indigenous peoples of the central highlands. With the help of the country’s Communist leaders, they have, in their capacity as migrants, simply robbed the indigenous people of the central highlands of their land over the past fifteen years. We have also indicated the way in which the Montagnards have been deprived of their rights on a social and economic front.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the Montagnards, there are a relatively large number of Christians, specifically Protestants. Their churches refuse to join the government-controlled Protestant unity church and are therefore deemed illegal. This renders the Protestant Montagnards additionally suspicious in the eyes of the already strongly anti-religious authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Add to this the element of the Montagnards’ foreign religious contacts, and their efforts to achieve more self-determination, and it becomes clear why the Vietnamese government considers the central highlands a risk area and treats it accordingly. Let us face it; this Communist government is as terrified as ever at the thought of any groups or opinions taking shape independently.</p>
<p class="contents">Is this, therefore, a hopeless situation for the Montagnards? They can rely on an alert security service in their vicinity. Representatives of foreign donors and Vietnamese NGOs cannot travel freely in the area where they live. It is therefore extremely difficult to set up local development programmes. Meetings of representatives of indigenous peoples are either not allowed or are monitored by the security service.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, insiders in the shape of Western development workers in the central highlands, detect a glimmer of hope. Within the Vietnamese government services, there are also opinions circulating which show some understanding of the legitimate religious, political and social demands of the Montagnards.</p>
<p class="contents">In their contacts with the Vietnamese authorities, I wish the Council and the Commission much wisdom and patience in treading a path that will put an end to the intolerable disenfranchisement of the indigenous people of the central highlands. The present resolution should provide a welcome boost for them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, then, of course, our task to ensure, as partners rather than as guardians, that universal human rights really are applied throughout the world. It is precisely because South-East Asia is an important and valued partner for us in economic and strategic terms that it is also our right and our duty to intervene in order that these universal principles be adhered to there.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are at present witnessing is a vicious circle. Ethnic minorities and the various peoples of the Vietnamese highlands are oppressed, with some of them fleeing to Cambodia and being accommodated in camps. For this we thank the Cambodians, who had great problems of their own with expellees and refugees, and who are poor and are in this instance practising solidarity – that too is a sight to behold. The Cambodians, though, of course send people, for all sorts of reasons, back to Vietnam, where they are again persecuted and oppressed, and there is another flow of refugees towards Cambodia. A vicious circle indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to break this vicious circle, which is imperilling the stability of the entire region, we must press, firstly, for Cambodia to continue to discharge its international obligations and perhaps do so even more than hitherto. Secondly, though, and this is of the essence, we must insist that Vietnam should at last treat its ethnic minorities and national communities with respect and protect them as it should, that it should not carry out settlement programmes to the detriment of the minorities, and that faith communities should receive proper protection. We stand up for the rights of all faith communities without discrimination, but, just as Muslims stand up for the rights of Muslims throughout the world – something for which I have a high regard – we should show an increasing commitment to the Christian minorities throughout the world, and it is not least because of them that we are under a great obligation.</p>

There is a major problem with the Cambodian authorities who are reluctant to grant political asylum to them. They wish to close the refugee camps and to force the occupants to seek asylum in third countries, particularly the United States. The decision by the Cambodian and Vietnamese governments to attempt to implement the repatriation agreement bilaterally has to be of great concern, as is the refusal by the Vietnamese government to permit the UNHCR monitoring teams to visit the villages of potential returnees. The withdrawal of the UNHCR from the tripartite agreement means that asylum-seekers are exposed to even greater risk of being influenced, intimidated and coerced into returning to Vietnam.</p>
<p class="contents">The Cambodian government must uphold its obligations as a signatory to the 1951 Geneva Convention, in particular by ensuring that any repatriation is conducted on a voluntary basis, and by guaranteeing that asylum-seekers arriving in Cambodia are not denied their basic right to asylum. We must stop the Vietnamese persecuting people who, it seems, have been forced to go back against their will. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I thank them all the more, because in our somewhat beleaguered position, we non-attached members find it practically impossible to table motions, which is why we particularly welcome initiatives such as this.</p>
<p class="contents">Next Monday, in Geneva, at the Human Rights Commission, the leader of the Montagnard Foundation, Mr Kok Ksor, will speak for the first time in defence of the rights of his people. The situation is, I think, extremely serious, not just for the hill tribes but for the entire Vietnamese population.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a number of reservations on points 4 and 5 of this resolution, because I think that Mr Poul Nielson’s overall concept of cooperation needs to be challenged. Helping the Vietnamese authorities fight poverty has not achieved anything, especially in terms of democratising Vietnam: there is the very serious problem of the hill tribes, but there is also the problem of freedom of worship for the Christian minorities and even for the Buddhist majority. The patriarch of the Unified Buddhist church, Thich Huyen Quang, has been incarcerated for the last twenty years, as has his number 2, Thich Quang Do, who has been incarcerated in his pagoda for several years now.</p>
<p class="contents">Such is the situation in Vietnam. The European Parliament has stressed time and again that Poul Nielson’s policy has not brought about any improvements in Vietnam, despite massive funding from the Commission. I do not think that the inefficiency of Poul Nielson’s policy surprises any of us, but we do need to remind ourselves of it whenever we can.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also long-standing ties with the Communist International in the region. Mr Hun Sen, whose history with the Khmer Rouge is often glossed over, clearly still has close allies in Hanoi, which explains this connivance in the hill tribes affair, which I think we have a duty to condemn. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have always recognised that complex events were behind the instability which started to take hold in the central mountains of Vietnam at the beginning of 2001. Like you, we have watched the exodus of the hill tribes from the region with concern and have supported efforts by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, working with the Vietnamese and Cambodian governments, to guarantee suitable conditions under which those wishing to can return.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore sorry to see that the tripartite agreement has been broken and, given the circumstances, we welcome the positive decision by the Cambodian government to allow Montagnards currently living in the refugee camps in Cambodia to return to the United States under the plan coordinated by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. However, we feel that this measure does not offer a definitive solution to the problems at the root of this exodus.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall therefore continue to encourage Cambodia to face up to its international responsibilities. It is subject to the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees and should continue to offer aid, asylum and temporary protection to asylum seekers. At the same time, we share the views expressed by the members in their resolution that Vietnam should continue in its efforts to improve protection for civil, political and religious rights. In the case of the hill tribes in particular, the Vietnamese government can obviously only deal with these problems at a local level and that is where they must be dealt with.</p>
<p class="contents">These issues tie in generally with the need for pro-active reform in Vietnam; the Vietnamese administration needs to get used to the idea of pluralist opinion and the virtue of a political regime which brooks different points of view at all levels, which is not necessarily the case at present. Vietnam also needs to extend its legal reforms and ensure that the constitutional rights of all its citizens are applied fully and fairly.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the Commission’s position. With all due respect to Mr Dupuis, may I close by reminding him that our policy in Vietnam is not the policy of Poul Nielson, it is the policy of the Commission, the policy of the Council of Ministers, the policy of the European Parliament, in short, the policy of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the Sudan Sharia has even been used against Christians, which is contrary to Islamic teaching.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not talking here of the death penalty as such, which remains legal in international law and is still practised in a number of democracies, not only the United States, but also Russia, India, Caribbean islands, Japan and Singapore to name but a few. Indeed, in my own party in the UK the death penalty remains a matter of individual conscience with many, myself included, in favour of its restricted application for the most heinous of crimes, such as child murder and serial killings.</p>
<p class="contents">Tens of millions of European citizens also share this view. Nevertheless, in Nigeria we have the terrible spectacle of women being executed for simple adultery by a barbarically slow and painful method. It is always difficult to interfere in the customs of others, but it is important that, as a parliament, we transmit our abhorrence at this practice without delay to the Nigerian Government. Furthermore, I recently heard that Afghanistan has no plans to abrogate the Sharia Criminal Code, including stoning to death for adultery. I am of the view that, given the fact that the EU is the largest donor to the reconstruction of this country, to the tune of over EUR 1 billion, we should make aid conditional on the cessation of these unacceptable practices.</p>
<p class="contents">Both Nigeria and Afghanistan are members of the international community and signatories to various international conventions guaranteeing human rights. I, like most Members in this House, believe that such Sharia punishments are totally unacceptable at the dawn of the 21st century. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Guilty of having given birth as divorcées and condemned to the most horrible of deaths, by stoning, Mrs Hussaini and Mrs Abubakar are guilty of being women in a region which fundamentalist Koranic or Sharia law has stripped of all semblance of humanity. The citizens of certain regions of Nigeria bound and gagged by obscurantist customs are the victims not just of moral regression but also of the regression of civilisation itself.</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard the voices of these victims. Thanks to us and because the entire international community has been moved and motivated, the authorities and national courts in Nigeria have pardoned these two martyrs to religious fundamentalism. But how can we possibly think that these efforts suffice, when these precepts of times gone by, which victimise and condemn millions of citizens from the day they are born, continue to apply?</p>
<p class="contents">The federal state of Nigeria condemns these practices and these courts through its constitution and its international undertakings. Now it should prove that actions speak louder than words. In doing so, it could take on the role and set the example which the calibre of its democracy and its transition to democracy have conferred on it within the African and international community. If it effectively restores the rule of law and demonstrates intransigence in the face of ethnic, sexist or religious intolerance, Nigeria should be able to continue to benefit from Community aid. If all Nigerians recognised the primacy of human rights, and of course women's rights, over any religious precepts or principles, the European Union would respond by providing full support in a spirit of solidarity for the democratic and economic reforms under way in Nigeria. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Nigerian Government must abide by the international conventions on human rights which it has signed, as tangible proof of its intention to institute a process of democratisation and the rule of law, guarantee economic and social dialogue and foster dialogue between communities.</p>

The ethnic, religious and political infighting which has cost thousands of people their lives, and the restoration of Islamic or Sharia law in the 12 states of the country in which there is a Muslim majority.</p>
<p class="contents">World public opinion was shocked recently by the sentences of death by stoning passed on women accused of adultery while, under this extremely fair law, the men of course get off scot-free. The international outcry and the action taken by the European Parliament, civil society and the media may have saved their lives at the eleventh hour, but the issue of violations of women's rights and blatant discrimination on the basis of sex remains. And the case of Amina Lawal, sentenced by the Islamic court in Bakori, is still pending.</p>
<p class="contents">But the Islamic courts and the interpretation of Sharia law apart, there are other examples of the unequal, unfair and inhumane treatment of women, such as sexual mutilation – around 60% of women in Nigeria are estimated to have suffered this gruesome practice – or the recognised right of men to mistreat women with impunity or the organised trafficking in and sexual exploitation of women.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to send a very strong message on all these points to the federal government of Nigeria from this House today, calling on it to ensure that the country's courts operate in accordance with international law on human rights and the Charter of Human Rights, which has even been included in Nigeria's constitution. Above all, we must make clear not just to the Nigerian government, but anywhere else where Sharia law applies, that the best defence against intolerance is to strengthen the secular aspects of the state and legitimate democratic order. We also need to send out a message that no religious or other tradition or practice can take precedence over respect for fundamental human rights and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we call on the European Commission, in the run up to the elections in Nigeria in 2003, to provide any technical assistance Nigeria may need in order to strengthen its legal and democratic structures and for lawyers and the police to be educated within the framework of the Cotonou agreement and the resolutions passed by the Joint ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now, I do not feel we can continue – although we must do so – to discuss these massacres. We must demand that Nigeria, which is preparing for democratic elections and must therefore be supported by the European Union, not merely – as has been mentioned in the context of the Cotonou Agreement – consolidate pluralist democracy and social and economic justice, but that it put an end to these violations too.

In countries where the death penalty still exists we call for recourse to this practice to be gradually eliminated and insist that it be applied in accordance with minimum standards. We are all in the habit of lobbying for moratoria.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all particularly worried, both in the Union and the Commission, by the cruelty of the punishments and executions practised in application of Sharia law in a number of countries. A hanging in January of this year put an end to a de facto moratorium on the death penalty in Nigeria. We were involved in Union representations to the Nigerian authorities on this issue in February. We also intervened on several fronts in the case of Safiya Hussaini, especially when President Prodi launched a direct appeal to President Obasanjo.</p>
<p class="contents">We are currently closely monitoring the case of Amina Lawal, mentioned by Mrs Ainardi, Mrs Karamanou and Mrs Ghilardotti, which has now gone to appeal. Now with regard to the impact of all this on relations between the European Union and Nigeria, the framework for which is laid down in the Cotonou Agreement. One of the fundamental elements of this agreement is respect for human rights and, in this context, equality between men and women is one aspect of the same issue. We welcome the fact that the Nigerian minister of justice has officially declared that the federal states must revise their criminal legislation in order to exclude punishments which fly in the face of the civil rights guaranteed under the Nigerian constitution. The federal government would also appear to be worried by the incompatibility between the penal application of Sharia law and the international conventions signed by Nigeria.</p>
<p class="contents">We have funded a Nigerian study into Sharia law which indicates that Sharia law is poorly drafted and does in fact contradict other federal laws. It is also applied in a somewhat incoherent manner because judges are inadequately trained. We feel that the solution for the time being is still to be found in dialogue, especially on Nigeria’s compliance with its undertakings within the framework of the Cotonou Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">As you and we both know, this agreement makes provision for procedures which can be applied if human rights are not respected. This is the point we need to evaluate together so that we can exert the necessary pressure but avoid imposing sanctions on all the federal states of Nigeria indiscriminately or compromising the creation of an environment conducive to change because it is this change which will, in fact, be the outcome of our collective pressure and efforts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The time has come for Parliament to add its voice to those of other human rights defenders, trade unionists and religious leaders working with the indigenous communities to ensure that these peace programmes move forwards and do not stagnate.

<p class="contents">A few days ago I read an article, written by a Central American liberal, that I believe is relevant today. He said that Central America is an area of natural disasters, situated on a fault line, that every now and then knocks down cities and buries entire populations. It seems, however, that the region is also under threat from another kind of fault, one of moral order, where impunity appears to protect certain heartless individuals.</p>
<p class="contents">A 2001 report by Transparency International, a German NGO that monitors and condemns government corruption worldwide, states that Guatemala is in a situation in which the democratic system is discredited to the point where its institutions are in danger.</p>
<p class="contents">We in this House today condemn human rights violations in Guatemala, which are on the increase and, as Mr Pomés has just pointed out, affect workers, journalists and politicians, amongst others. We regret the abuses committed by certain economic agents, who see nothing wrong in using arms trafficking, drugs trafficking, money laundering and even kidnapping to increase their wealth.</p>
<p class="contents">We in this House would ask the Guatemalan government to monitor and sanction clandestine groups, to guarantee citizens’ safety and to allow justice to be done, by investigating crimes that have been committed for some time now. Impunity will only be brought to an end when the judiciary is independent and free, when international pressure is increased and when punishment is universal so that crimes do not go unpunished. In this way, democracy will also be strengthened. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make a very specific condemnation with regard to an issue that appears very peculiar to many Latin American countries, such as Guatemala, Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador and other countries that are still living under a colonial regime. There is a white Creole minority that continues to dominate and marginalise millions of indigenous people who, in spite of being the majority, are completely ignored by the State. These States are not democratic and, in order to maintain the traditional privileges of ownership, they dominate and marginalise the indigenous minorities, and create dictatorial regimes that torture and murder if these minorities should dare to rebel.</p>
<p class="contents">In this way, this minority controls the judiciary, ownership, the police and the army, and I believe that, in these Latin American countries, until there is genuine democracy – as has happened in South Africa – until the indigenous minorities have power and until they are truly able to create their own State for themselves, there will be no solution to this problem of human rights violations in these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">On many occasions I compare countries that are very close to our own – the Spanish states in particular – with African countries: these are very often in a state of poverty and have dictatorial regimes, but one day they will become democratic regimes governed by the previously marginalised majority. In Latin America the problem is much worse and we have to be aware of this in order for Europe to be able to help in the construction of truly democratic regimes, governed by the majority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am not talking about being tired of having to deal with this subject, but about being tired at the lack of results, despite constant pressure from this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Many hopes were raised when the Guatemala and El Salvador agreements were signed in 1996. We have been talking about the need for dialogue in Colombia. The problem, and the issue that we must deal with here in Parliament today, is that these agreements have not been honoured, and it is this factor that is frustrating the hopes of the majority of the population in places such as Guatemala, where, as Mr Nogueira rightly stated – a large proportion of the population is indigenous.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the best way of remembering Monsignor Gerardi, the author and person responsible for this extraordinary document of historical clarification, which should today be the guide for the majority of Guatemalan judges talking about crimes committed during the civil war, is to demand that agreements be honoured, for there to be true agrarian reform, which has not taken place to date, for there to be respect for the large majority of the Guatemalan people – a respect that currently does not exist, because these people continue to live in abject poverty – for there to be an end to the increasing violence against the people and their representatives, defenders of human rights, farm-workers’ representatives, trade unionists, religious leaders and people involved with the rights of the majority of the population. Unfortunately, until now the majority of human rights have not been respected in Guatemala. For this reason, I believe that what we should be calling for is for the European Union, with all of its available resources, to use its influence so that these agreements, to which it contributed so much, are honoured. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We, like you, are most concerned at the increase in cases of intimidation in Guatemala, not just against human rights protesters but also against representatives of civil society, political leaders and members of non-governmental organisations and the clergy.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the Commission’s main priorities as regards relations with Guatemala are as follows: first, to support the application of the 1996 peace agreements and then to encourage the modernisation of the state and set the management of public affairs on a firmer footing. These priorities are set against a background of wholesale implementation of the recommendations set out in the Commission report on historic clarification which Mrs González Álvarez referred to and which is of crucial importance. In this respect – and in line with the resolution on human rights in Guatemala which you adopted last June – the Commission has decided to take additional measures.</p>
<p class="contents">First, during the course of political dialogue, the Commission and the Member States of the Union regularly and tirelessly remind the Guatemalan authorities and local public institutions of the importance of discouraging any form of violence and of systematically examining any obstacles to respect for human rights and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, in a joint declaration published at the end of the meeting of an advisory group on Guatemala held in Washington in February, the Commission and the Member States insisted on the need for much more consistent progress in the peace process than has been seen recently. We are calling – and we shall continue to call – on the government of Guatemala to take regular, consistent measures to follow up the conclusions and commitments made in the advisory group. That is the first measure.</p>
<p class="contents">The second measure is to exert pressure on the government of Guatemala, within the framework of our cooperation, to comply with the 1996 peace agreements; as you know, we are funding specific initiatives in this area, especially measures to reinforce and modernise the national constabulary. The purpose of this programme is to encourage the Guatemalan authorities to take the measures needed to prevent any undermining of the rule of law and step up efforts to make the country much more democratic and fair. This initiative will be relayed over coming months in a new programme of cooperation for the benefit of the judicial system in Guatemala.</p>
<p class="contents">Between 2002 and 2006, which is the time scale for the Union's cooperation strategy with Guatemala, we intend to step up action on human rights and the fight against intimidation and impunity. Guatemala is, almost by chance, one of the main beneficiaries of the European initiative on democracy and human rights for the period from 2002 to 2004, when we shall be concentrating on proper management of public affairs, the rights of the indigenous populations, the death penalty and the fight against impunity, the very points which the parliamentarians themselves identified a while back. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since last November, rail-freight services at Fréthun, near Calais, have been severely disrupted by the illegal activities of migrants. I have already raised this matter on two occasions on the floor of this House, on 4 February and 11 March, and our urgency resolution reflects the desperate seriousness of the continuing crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">On 19 March, the French government replied to initial queries from the European Commission, stating that immediate steps had been taken to carry out new security work at Fréthun and to provide 24-hour police coverage. However, on 27 March, along with some 150 parliamentarians, rail-freight operators, officials, police, media and others, but with the noticeable absence of any British or French government ministers, I visited the rail-freight terminal at Fréthun. We were amazed to see illegal migrants clambering all over trains in broad daylight before our very eyes. The situation was clearly out of hand and it has got no better, in spite of undertakings by SNCF to achieve a normal service from 2 April.</p>
<p class="contents">Only this last Tuesday, some 100 migrants broke out of a freight train at Dollands Moor in Folkestone. This train had apparently waited virtually unguarded at Calais for 24 hours. This situation is unacceptable. Besides the human tragedy in the situation, I am concerned that British businesses and some 8 000 jobs are directly at risk, as a result of the state of affairs, including in my own area of the East of England. There are also very serious environmental and other consequences. It makes a mockery of the idea of the free movement of goods across the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the lack of action by the British and French governments on Tuesday, I took a deputation to meet the European Commission: Lord Berkeley, Chairman of the Rail Freight Group and Mr Alan Roberts, a constituent of mine from Hertfordshire, whose family rail-freight organising business has been very hard hit by the crisis at Fréthun, went with me to see Commissioner Bolkestein. He was very sympathetic and expressed frustration at the lack of government action. I now implore the Commission to take the necessary further action, including legal action against the French government, as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">Businesses require urgent financial assistance in order to be able to continue trading, as well as compensation in the longer term for the losses that they have sustained because of the lack of effective action by the French and the British authorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rail-freight operators and dependent businesses want a response which concentrates on the immediate and long-standing need for sufficient security to keep the freight moving. They are perfectly justified. Businesses should not be the fall-guys of government failure to cope with asylum-seekers. Businesses need fences at Fréthun, but that is also crucial to stop migrants dying. That is the responsibility of the SNCF and French government. I am shocked that the Socialist Group refused to put that in the motion. I call on them, especially British Labour MEPs, to back Amendment No 2 on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 6 by the Socialist Group is hopelessly weak, letting governments off the hook. Businesses adversely affected also need finance and they need immediate support and compensation from the two governments. I will also be shocked if Labour MEPs vote against that.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 1 is an ELDR Group amendment, which calls for the strengthening of the current inadequate intervention powers of the Commission to clear obstructions to the free movement of goods. I am told the Conservatives are reluctant to support this, but I hope it is not true.</p>
<p class="contents">The second response required in the Calais area is to address the asylum question in a humane and practical way. My group cannot support Amendment No 5 by the Socialist Group because it attributes the situation at Fréthun purely to pressure people feel to migrate from their home countries. Obviously that is the broad context, which is why the resolution in a paragraph I drafted says the long-term solution must be found in a concerted, European asylum policy. There is also stress on the need for a sensitive humanitarian approach.</p>
<p class="contents">In the immediate future, the British and French governments must reach a practical agreement to process asylum claims on-site at the Sangatte centre, not close it – that would be counterproductive. But the Socialist Group amendment, probably deliberately, ignores the responsibility of the SNCF and the government to deal with the asylum pressures. This is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The rail-freight operators are on the brink of collapse. Eight thousand workers could be out of a job. I urge support for the motion and for Amendments Nos 1 to 4. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What exactly are we talking about here? Are we talking about Eurotunnel’s loss of earnings and the disruption to traffic under the Channel or are we talking about what should be the subject of this afternoon’s debate, human rights and, in this particular instance, the rights and the human tragedy of the Sangatte refugees? The refugees in Sangatte are not illegal immigrants. They are living in a centre opened by the French government, managed by the Red Cross and subsidised by the French state. The refugees are Kosovars, Kurds and, nowadays, mainly Afghans. All the people who feature in today’s headlines are flooding into Sangatte. If we want to talk about human rights, then let us do so and stop talking about money and the safety of traffic under the Channel. There is something obscene about confusing the two. This centre was opened thanks to important work by the associations who wanted to respond to the emergency, and to close it would be a humanitarian catastrophe. We know what Calais and Sangatte are like without the centre. We have seen the refugees risking their lives to get to Great Britain, wandering the streets of Calais with their children in the pouring rain, with the associations doing their best to get food to them every day. Is that really the sort of situation we want to revert to in a debate on human rights? Frankly, this debate has got off to a very poor start, which is why the Greens do not support this motion and call on their fellow members to do likewise, because there is something improper about it. The Group of the Greens, having taken the view that the French Government was demonstrating a measure of bad faith regarding the right of these people to demand asylum in France, supported the publication of a document, in collaboration with the associations, which is in huge demand among the refugees in Sangatte. What does this document say? It simply tells the refugees how to demand asylum in France and what rights asylum seekers have in France. This is the road we should be going down, obviously in the long term, with our sights set on a European refugee statute, in order to deal with this situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This situation is caused by the distress of thousands of refugees and displaced persons, who have had to leave countries in which they are politically, economically or socially oppressed and in which wars and conflicts are raging, often against their will and sometimes at the cost of their life.</p>
<p class="contents">We need proper refugee centres, otherwise it is all down to the local authorities and they can no longer cope. They do not have the human resources, infrastructure or funds needed to respond to this distress.</p>
<p class="contents">So what we have to do is find a satisfactory long-term response to these problems and adopt a humane approach in terms of asylum and immigration policy. We cannot continue to close our eyes to these problems. We cannot continue to bury our head in the sand. That way we are heading for a catastrophe.</p>
<p class="contents">If serious problems persist at the entrance to the Channel Tunnel despite the joint efforts of the French and British governments to stop refugees trying to cross illegally, it is because we have no joint asylum policy at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Every country in the European Union is affected because the difficulties we face stem from the fact that we have no harmonised asylum procedures in Europe. We therefore need to adopt a package of measures to implement a European asylum policy post haste. We need to all join forces and examine the problems facing us. The European Union needs to demonstrate its determination to take fast decisions on various instruments, on minimum standards in refugee centres and on procedures for granting and withdrawing refugee status in the spirit, lest we forget, of the Tampere European Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Very few people outside my region appreciate the seriousness of the situation. The regular stoppage of freight transport is now reaching crisis proportions. Businesses are unable to ship their produce, the transport infrastructure of the southern English counties is clogged, the single market is violated as the circulation of goods is impeded, the police forces of Kent and Sussex are over-stretched and the influx of illegal migrants is placing a serious burden on local authorities and their ratepayers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is all very well to demand greater security at the Calais-Fréthun freight terminal but this is to address the symptoms of the problem, not the cause. If we are serious about bringing the situation under control, we must stand back and ask the question: what is making tens of thousands of people so desperate to get out of France? France after all is not a country that persecutes its citizens. On the contrary, it is one of the oldest and freest democracies in the world. In short, it is hardly a country from which we would reasonably expect people to claim political asylum and yet, night after night, hundreds of people are risking their lives in order to enter Britain through the Channel Tunnel.</p>
<p class="contents">The British Government must take primary responsibility for this state of affairs. The chief difference between Britain and France in this field is that when an asylum claim in the United Kingdom is refused, deportation almost never follows. Consequently, and quite understandably, illegal migrants are determined to reach the one EU State from which they know they will almost certainly not be repatriated. As long as this state of affairs continues, there will be a limitless supply of young people in the Sangatte camp seeking by any means to cross the Channel.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an international problem, but it has an essentially domestic solution. The British Government must amend its approach to asylum. It must cease to entertain asylum claims when the last point of embarkation is a manifestly safe State, such as France. Doing so will reduce the pressure, not only on the Channel Tunnel, but by extension on France's eastern borders as fewer migrants seek to make the journey. Without urgent action from the British Government, the strain on the south-east can only become heavier. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a human rights issue that we are discussing here. It is not an easy one and nobody should suggest it is. It has not just become urgent because of the economic effect on business or on the freight industry, for which I have great sympathy. It is a very serious and distressing situation which does nobody any great credit. It has concerned, as others have said, large numbers of people and governments – both in France, the UK and other countries – and local authorities. It is one that my committee in Parliament has also discussed on more than one occasion. People could go back and search for different reasons why there are numbers of people there. I reject the very simplistic and inhumane proposals from Mr Hannan. It is a situation that has worsened over recent years and the problem is much more extensive than he implied.</p>
<p class="contents">But just as Parliament must protect business and the freight industry, so Europe – but not exclusively the United Kingdom or France – has a duty to care for and protect those seeking refuge. These are desperate people. Some have fled in fear of their lives, and we should be able to offer them sanctuary and give them every opportunity to put their claim for asylum.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what the Dublin Convention, which we sought to review earlier this week in the Marinho report, is all about. We need a Dublin Convention that enables asylum-seekers to feel safe and secure, to put their claim for asylum in the first EU country which they reach. Earlier in the week the other side of the House tabled amendments suggesting that they should be informed of their rights in any language, not necessarily a language that they understand. That is not the way, and it explains why sometimes people move to another country.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not a question of who supports which amendment and who does not. I personally have no problem with Amendment No 2, which I was questioned about earlier. We have to get the system working for the sake of all of the people who are moving around Europe. We have to make it safe and working for the industries. We need to work towards a common European asylum system. Without that, Europe will not function and we will be coming back to these issues over and over again. We need to have a common European asylum system throughout the Member States that is understood and that works. I and my colleagues on this side of House and some others will be working consistently for that in the months ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">But, as this first debate was lacking, to say the least, our Conference of Presidents decided, in its wisdom, to arrange a second debate today on the same subject. Unfortunately, to judge by the motion which is to be put to the vote, this debate will be just as unsatisfactory as the first.</p>
<p class="contents">Without repeating everything I said on the subject two months ago, especially on the vanity of a harmonised asylum policy supposed to resolve all these problems, I shall merely point out that the simple truth has yet to be stated anywhere. At present, the life of the French population in the region is being ruined, economic activity is being disrupted at the expense of our British neighbours, the railway companies are collapsing under the weight of unwarranted security costs and all because of total negligence on the part of the French Government, which lets illegal immigrants congregate in public, 90% of whom have no right to stay and should be sent home.</p>
<p class="contents">If we fail to react to this new form of immigration, the situation will soon get out of hand and become uncontrollable. To top it all, on Tuesday the House adopted a text which helps enormously in resolving the problem. I refer to the Council regulation establishing the criteria for determining the Member States responsible for examining asylum applications, which was the subject of the Marinho report. The state responsible is of course the state of initial entry. And Article 12, which we adopted, stipulates and I quote, that the ‘Member State which has knowingly tolerated the unlawful presence on its territory of a third-country national for more than two months shall be responsible for examining the asylum application’. So in this case, it is not Great Britain, it is in fact France which is entirely responsible and the least we can do is to say so clearly in our resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lamy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, the Commission is obviously aware that repeated incursions by illegal immigrants into the transport installations between Calais in France and the United Kingdom are creating problems for security, the proper functioning of the rail transport network and freight traffic. This phenomenon, and I think the various interventions illustrated this, is the result of a combination of fairly complex factors and, in my eyes at least, demonstrates yet again that the Union needs a common immigration and asylum policy now more than ever. I agree with Mrs Ludford and Mrs Roure here.</p>
<p class="contents">This being the case, the Commission has, for its part, already taken the relevant initiatives by submitting, to the Council and Parliament, all the proposals needed in order to ensure some sort of equal treatment between the Member States on what are obviously difficult issues.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as political asylum is concerned, the aim of the Commission proposals is to create a fair, efficient and fast European asylum system. We proposed a Council directive on asylum procedures in September 2000. As you know, several Member States are opposed to binding deadlines for completing procedures. So we shall be submitting a revised proposal within the next few weeks, as instructed by the Laeken European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament is due to vote within the next fortnight on a proposal for a directive submitted by the Commission a year ago in order to harmonise the conditions under which asylum seekers are kept. The Council may reach a political agreement on this Spanish Presidency priority within the next few weeks. Of course, it would also help if Parliament took a stand. Another proposal for a directive adopted last September is designed to harmonise the definition of refugees and people in need of international protection and should be negotiated between now and 2003. The main purpose of all these proposals is to reduce what we might call pressure differentials between the Member States which motivate what it the bureaucrats have been agreed to call secondary movements due to de facto and de jure differences in asylum law. These initiatives all aim to guarantee that everyone who needs it has access to protection – and that appears to apply to a great many people in this case – in accordance with all the terms of the 1951 Geneva Convention on the status of refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission has also proposed a regulation on responsibility for examining asylum applications which includes, as Mr Berthu has just reminded us, a clause stating that a Member State which has knowingly tolerated the unlawful presence on its territory of a third-country national for more than two months is responsible for examining their asylum application. Negotiations on this subject are still under way, even though Parliament has also worked on them, and should be concluded during the Danish Presidency. So we are still drafting this text, Mr Berthu.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission subscribes fully to the objective of developing a global approach to the management of migratory phenomena, including their external dimension. This is one of the objectives of the common asylum and immigration policy laid down by the Tampere European Council. We shall be discussing the matter in general and the fight against illegal immigration in particular in Luxembourg next Monday and shall be launching an in-depth debate on the connection between development and immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the fight against illegal immigration is concerned, the Council adopted an action plan on 28 February, broadly based on our proposal and highlighting the importance of cooperation with countries of origin and transit. The fight against trafficking in human beings and illegal immigration gangs are obviously one priority and should be backed up by assistance for victims willing to help prosecute traffickers. And we intend to launch a very broad consultation procedure on this aspect of a global immigration policy very soon on the basis of the Green Paper on the policy to repatriate illegal residents which the Commission adopted yesterday.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and this testifies to the complexity of the matter, we are preparing a communication on guidelines on the integrated management of external borders.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the specific responsibility of hauliers, this is regulated by the Schengen Agreement and defined in a directive designed to harmonise the sanctions which apply here. Nonetheless, we are aware of the fact that there is more to the problem than that and we have taken various initiatives to sit down and discuss the matter with the industry, administrations and humanitarian organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards the specific situation at the SNCF Fréthun terminal, we have made representations to the French authorities under Community legislation, asking them to take any measures needed to guarantee the free movement of rail freight. The French authorities have told us that work to secure the Fréthun site has almost been completed and that work to extend the enclosure, install video cameras and various other devices is being completed. They have promised to complete the programme of work in time for traffic to get back to normal, pre-October 2001 conditions by June 2002. We have also been assured that security staff numbers have been increased on the SNCF site.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Transport Council on 26 March, the Commission, basically following a number of parliamentary interventions, put this item on the Council’s agenda so that the two ministers in question could state their opinion, and that is a euphemism I do not use lightly. On this occasion, the two delegations, the French and the British, intimated that they had agreed on the measures to be taken to ensure that traffic returns to normal under normal safety conditions. Armed with this agreement, the Commission now considers that it is up to them, given that the Commission has performed its duty of vigilance, to take any measures needed to guarantee the free movement of goods. You will notice that I refrained from addressing this aspect of the question, important as it is, before I had addressed aspects of asylum and immigration policy, which are of course the core points here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is true that the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Action Plan approved at the 1990 World Summit attempt to guarantee that children are able to exercise their fundamental rights, but unfortunately, there has been no improvement at all in the situation, and children continue to be the main victims of poverty and underdevelopment, amongst other things. The statistics speak for themselves, and we should not forget that behind each of these figures hides the face of a child, whose eyes are pleading for our help.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, the special session of the UN General Assembly on Children, which is about to take place, should result in a firm commitment to transform the obligations arising from the Convention on the Rights of the Child into real action, establishing control mechanisms to supervise the extent to which these obligations are complied with, especially with regard to the fight against abuse, exploitation and violence to which children are subjected and to guarantee children the right to education.</p>
<p class="contents">But also, and above all, the Assembly should lead to a commitment to adopt more coherent and more generous development cooperation policies and policies to combat poverty, in order to guarantee every child’s fundamental right to decent living conditions. And, since the family is the fundamental unit of society and bears the main responsibility for protecting and raising children and the monitoring of their development, it is crucial that we also promote family assistance policies that contribute to the creation of the human environment that is essential to a child’s development and to his or her being able, in the future, to become a useful member of the community to which he or she belongs.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament must give a clear mandate to the European Union in this direction. Therefore, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I would ask this House to support the joint resolution we are debating and the amendments we have tabled and which were already part of the text that this Parliament approved in July 2001 for this very sitting of the United Nations, which should have taken place in September; because, with this vote, we will make the cause of children our own, the cause of the European Parliament and the cause of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is family and relatives who, in the most basic way, can give children the home, and the childhood and adolescence, which they naturally require. I therefore wish also to emphasise how important it is for the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats to be adopted in the European Parliament. With reference to a resolution from 5 July 2001, we would emphasise that children are the first victims of the breakdown of family life. We would also point to UNICEF’s splendid draft final document emphasising that the family is the basic unit of society and bears the main responsibility for the protection, upbringing and development of children. We also want to underline what we said in the European Parliament last year, namely that a world fit for children must also be a world fit for the family.</p>
<p class="contents">The breakdown of the family and of family life are among the greatest and most serious challenges and threats faced by Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own country, Sweden, a leader of the country’s third largest political party openly pronounced the words, ‘Death to the family’ to the Swedish general public. The European Parliament has a quite different view and instead emphasises the family as the basic unit for providing love and care to the next generation. As we did in 2001, we can highlight these values. It is a message to the world that even so-called modern Europe still realises that the family is the basic unit in which love is given to the next generation. More than ever, we need the family and the appreciation of its importance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an expression mostly used by parents and grandparents, but we should henceforth also use this expression when we discuss the policy. Just as two-way communication has been established between parents and children, such communication must also be established between children and the policy in all areas. In this connection, particular attention should be paid to the fact that children have changed a great deal over the past few years. This is due to the fact that families no longer necessarily live together and the division of roles is no longer self-evident. The traditional family is no longer the norm. Children want to belong 100%, the age aspect is no longer an issue. It is a message which policy-makers must take to heart. Children must be treated as fully-fledged partners in the decision-making process. It is up to the policy to provide adequate procedures and consultative bodies in this respect. It would be of particular importance if the European Parliament were to take an initiative to offer children from the Member States, and also from third countries, a forum in the buildings of the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this sense, I am delighted that the resolution proposes creating mechanisms designed to control governments’ compliance with these undertakings in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this sitting will not be just another meeting. Children’s rights are flouted every day throughout the world, with access being denied to medical care and education, child soldiers, sexual exploitation, crimes against children, trafficking, child labour and malnutrition. Not to mention the particular type of discrimination to which little girls are prey in numerous countries; my fellow Member referred earlier to genital mutilation. Finally, children are the first to suffer in war situations and from poverty and social exclusion. Even in our own countries within the European Union, how many children fail to receive the care to which they are entitled or an environment in which they can flourish, quite simply because their parents are poor, socially excluded or immigrants with no papers?</p>
<p class="contents">It is time the international community reiterated its undertaking to put the welfare of children throughout the world at the top of the agenda. Putting this undertaking into practice means spending money. I believe it also means promoting women's rights as the <span class="italic">sine qua non </span>to advancing children's rights. Europe has a very important part to play. It needs to develop partnerships between European institutions and associations, NGOs, governments and associations in candidate countries. We also need to involve children in certain decision-making processes at appropriate levels.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would add that we need to be much more coherent in our ambitions. Insisting that candidate countries, where children already face severe difficulties, reduce public spending, which includes health and education, seems to me to be incompatible with improving the rights of the child. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Our action plan covers four major causes for concern: health, education, protection of childhood and AIDS/HIV, all of which receive special attention under development cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission feels that assistance and protection for vulnerable children should be set against the wider context of the fight against poverty and hence within the framework of the Community's development cooperation. Children, from this point of view, are an important target group for external aid, especially in sectoral policies such as education and health.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as education is concerned, we recently adopted a communication on education and training as part of the bid to reduce poverty in developing countries. This communication recommends improving the quantity and quality of the education aid we give these countries and reiterates, as many of you have just done, the importance of a rights-based approach.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as children involved in armed conflicts are concerned, aid is granted under a number of programmes managed by the Commission, especially the European initiative for democracy and human rights. In addition, the promotion of children’s rights was one of the priorities for allocating resources in 2001 and has been integrated into funding planned for 2002 to 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are also making children a horizontal priority in terms of action under humanitarian aid. This takes the form of specific projects, action to protect children deployed inside the Union and research conducted with a view to improving the humanitarian response of the international community. Our actions are in keeping with the wishes which you have just expressed and cover various dimensions of the Union’s internal and external policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
