<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schmitt (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the regulation creating a European Aviation Safety Agency was welcomed by all groups in committee. Basically, this regulation needs to take account of three points. First, and this has always been the most important point, once there is a liberalised air traffic market, which will give rise to new competitive pressures and the risk of using competition to cut costs, cost cuts must not be made at the expense of safety. That is why I say, loud and clear, that this regulation is a sign that we want to guarantee a uniformly high standard of safety in the EU Member States in future and ensure that it is identical in every state.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is also, I think, an important aspect to bear in mind, despite the fact that it often receives short shift in policy. There are also economic policy aspects to this regulation because, in it, we are creating an authority or, more accurately, an agency which brings all the licences and permits needed for the air travel industry under one uniform licensing procedure. That means that, in future, individual Member States will not need to repeat the entire procedure and everything will be taken care of by this standard agency in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">A third point also needs highlighting. We are creating an agency which is a very similar institution to the agency which already exists in America. We all know that the FIA has quite a lot of clout – even worldwide – because it represents a nation which is a strong economic power. We Europeans are obviously limping along behind because individual nation states have less influence than a closed unit, i.e. an institution which represents all the Member States. That is why I think that this is a step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal before us was discussed at several meetings in committee and we endeavoured, I will not say to improve certain positions, because that always sounds as if we think those who prepared it did a bad job; we endeavoured to lighten the Commission decision, to make the agency more independent, because we felt that the prime concern of this sort of agency should be to improve air traffic safety, so we tried to ensure that it has plenty of room for manoeuvre.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we all know that, under the current Treaties, a fully independent agency is out of the question. But we do feel that the Commission should give the agency enough leeway to carry out some sort of legal supervision and perhaps some sort of technical supervision in certain secondary areas.</p>
<p class="contents">We were therefore right in saying that we want an independent agency and I think it was also important that we said that the administrative board must be given a stronger remit, on the one hand, and that the executive director must be given a position that allows him a degree of independence as the head of such an agency, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another important aspect which I should like to make a point of addressing here. We endeavoured in committee to draw clear dividing lines between the various areas of jurisdiction. As Parliament, we deliberately avoided accepting the Commission proposal of a seat on the administrative board. Instead we said, we want it to be perfectly clear that Parliament lays down the basic specifications, the Commission is the contact for the corresponding implementing provisions and the agency has to ensure that the technical details are properly regulated.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, because I am running out of time, I think that this regulation is the right move. We are making sure that the European level takes action in an area which is of interest to a great many people and which a great many people worry about. And I say to you quite unequivocally that airspace and safety should know no bounds and this agency is therefore well placed at European level. I therefore call on the House join with me in voting in favour of this report tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Collins (UEN), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, the advent of competition in the air transport sector has certainly resulted in the lowering of prices of air travel for the 370 million consumers of the European Union. However, there is a growing dissatisfaction among air travellers with regard to the quality of service which they are receiving from many airlines within the EU. It is very important that air passengers are fully aware of their legal rights when problems arise with flights. These are matters which I am addressing in my report.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot deny that the issue of developing deep-vein thrombosis is not a serious concern for air passengers. I am calling on the European Commission as a matter of urgency to allocate more monies from the EU research budget to carry out an independent evaluation of the possible public health risks for air passengers travelling on long-haul flights. This includes the need to carry out a comprehensive study into the whole issue of deep-vein thrombosis. I am calling on the European Commission to carry out this independent research in consultation with EU airline companies and EU consumer groups. I believe that European Union airlines should not be afraid of addressing the issue of deep-vein thrombosis. The solution to this problem may not be as hard as some EU airlines may envisage. It is very important that passengers are fully informed as to what they should do to guarantee that deep-vein thrombosis will not develop.</p>
<p class="contents">European Union airlines, consumer groups and air crew workers must all work together to guarantee that all public health issues concerning air travel are fully addressed. Safer travel for air passengers in Europe must at all times be the ultimate objective for EU governments and EU airlines. I have nothing in principle against the implementation of voluntary codes of practice for European Union airlines. However it is very important that any codes of practice which are drawn up by EU airlines are fully evaluated and monitored to ensure that they are rigorously enforced. While voluntary agreements play an important role with regard to the whole issue of air travel, EU institutions and EU governments must not be afraid to intervene and legislate on issues to promote and protect air passenger rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In this report I am calling on the European Commission to bring forward specific proposals outlining how the charter of passenger rights in Europe can be marketed to a greater extent. This will help to guarantee that all air passengers in Europe are kept fully informed as to their legal rights with regard to air travel. This charter of passenger rights currently exists in European Union airports but many passengers are not fully aware of its existence or do not fully understand its provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">This report includes a proposal calling on European Union airlines to inform passengers of the percentage degree seat pitch available to passengers travelling in economy class. It is clearly the case that there is more room available for economy class passengers travelling with some airlines than with others. I am also calling on the European Union and the airlines to improve access for disabled passengers, children and the elderly and to prohibit European Union airlines from charging an extra fee for assisting persons who are immobile onto any aeroplane within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I believe that this report had the broad support of the political groups within Parliament's Committee on Transport. I am hopeful and confident that the European Commission will now bring forward the necessary legislative proposals to ensure that passenger rights for the citizens of the European Union are greatly improved as a matter of urgency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission proposal for a European Aviation Safety Agency comes in response to a long-standing demand by Parliament. The Aviation Safety Agency is our second agency in the transport sector; a third for the railways and rail safety will ensue. I think this strategy of creating European agencies is an ideal way of helping the European transport markets to integrate. The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has already proposed a number of important amendments for the Aviation Safety Agency, such as strengthening the agency, giving it more independence and extending its remit.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think it is important – and I speak here on behalf of Mr Kuckelkorn – that we accept an amendment proposed by the Committee on Budgets on funding. Come what may, we must ensure that we have efficiency, transparency and controlled costs. These two agencies give us the opportunity to take a clear line right from the outset. My group has also tabled a number of proposed amendments. The first concerns the composition of the administrative board. We are calling for employers and employees to be given a seat on the board.</p>
<p class="contents">Another proposed amendment concerns the creation of local offices of the agency, which have been suggested in order to allay the fears of a number of Member States about loss of sovereignty. We expect the Member State in which the agency is located to make a financial contribution. One purpose of this rule is to prevent a Member State from pressurising its agency, i.e. the agency established on its sovereign territory, into setting up local offices. Here too I am positive that this is a reasonable and legitimate concern on the part of Parliament and I therefore call on you to support it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Perhaps this is why the Committee on Budgetary Control has made a few suggestions for the creation of an Aviation Safety Agency, such as, for example, that we again adopt the model of control used by the two agencies set up in 1975, which are Cedefop, in Thessaloniki and the Dublin Foundation. According to this model, granting discharge to the agencies was the responsibility of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Between 1990 and 1997, nine agencies were created, but it could be said that creating an external agency gives the Council carte blanche to do what it likes. This idea is not borne out by reality, however, because the agency set up to deal with the issue of Kosovo in Thessaloniki in 1999 is a return to the model according to which it is Parliament, at the behest of the Council, that gives discharge to the Director and the board of management.</p>
<p class="contents">This is, I believe, in harmony with the form of governance that we are seeking to adopt on the Commission’s proposal and that would be beneficial to the Agency itself, because in this way, the external agency does not have to mean lesser control of Community funds, a control which is the responsibility of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We also emphasise, in the fourth amendment, the need to incorporate in its rules of procedure the requirement for periodical external assessments of the Agency. I must repeat that the external Agency will have freedom of action, but we would like to have an independent expert cast an eye over it from time to time to see whether the Agency is fulfilling the objective that has been proposed for it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It obviously supports the aim of creating a European Aviation Safety Agency. However, we realise that we somehow need to harmonise the legal framework within which such agencies are created. A great many agencies have now been set up: the Aviation Safety Agency, the Food Agency, the Agency for Medical Products. It is high time we had a clear legal framework for starting up these agencies. The two previous speakers have already commented on certain aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful that the Commission announced in its White Paper on European governance that it intends to take a somewhat clearer line here. Sparks obviously fly when these agencies are created because decision-making powers are transferred to external institutions even if, Mr Schmitt, the final decision does not, of course, always rest with these agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">It is especially important to us that the supervisory committees be made up of equal numbers of representatives from the various European institutions and for the European Parliament not to lose its rights of influence by outsourcing decisions. It is also important to us for the legal recourse created within these agencies' procedures to be in keeping with the European Treaties and the principles of the rule of law. Another particular cause for concern is that the powers of intervention created for these agencies need to be in keeping with the fundamental civil rights on which we agreed in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. We have tabled proposed amendments on these points and we are grateful that they are at least being accepted in part. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that it is not totally out of place to say this, and that it practically amounts to the launch of an appeal to the Council and the Commission, to make sure that the proposal comes to fruition as quickly as possible, for the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has, naturally, first ascertained the industrial interest in such an agency.</p>
<p class="contents">As you already know, we have an urgent need for the equivalent of the American Federal Aviation Administration if we want the Airbus standard to be commercially viable at international level, in particular the new A 380 programme. The Committee on Industry has been very sensitive to these issues. It has not dramatically increased the number of amendments and has made sure that we can proceed as fast as possible towards the effective creation of this tool that the European aeronautical industry has been waiting for with bated breath in the great international competition which places it, fairly regularly and not without controversy, face to face with its great American rival. This is why we are satisfied with the proposal, in the hope that the Council will prove to be generous enough in the assessment of the amendments that are presented to it.</p>
<p class="contents">My second important point concerns the problem of political control. We think that the concept of safety is formulated by specialists and technicians, but politics cannot be pushed to the sidelines. With each of the large-scale events and accidents that have recently taken place, for example with Concorde or the Mont-Blanc tunnel, we have requested answers from the public authorities. It is therefore necessary that this new agency be a technical tool for standardisation and certification primarily fed from the work of experts and manufacturers, but it should also be politically controlled. This is the reason for which we have put forward amendments requesting that the executive director of such an agency, or even the agency itself, can make itself available to Parliament or, at the very least, be heard by Parliament. There are those who even hope that it should have parliamentary representatives on the administrative board, for the administrative board is a body that is not technical but political in nature.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are hoping that, in the committees of experts, the greatest cooperation will be open to all parties concerned, notably in relation to the creation of the “single sky” or problems relating to air control. We think that this should be carried out in consultation with both sides of industry and workers’ representatives, otherwise we will be creating insurmountable obstacles to the objectives we are pursuing. So, ladies and gentlemen, these are the main conclusions of the Committee on Industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, of which I was the draftsman, was unanimously carried and we are delighted to see that many of our recommendations have been endorsed by the two rapporteurs.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to move on from the old excuses, the legal challenges mounted by IATA and the opposition to even modest voluntary agreements which we still hear on some sides. This is essentially a matter of the safety, as well as of the convenience, of the consumer. For that reason we particularly welcome the adoption of amendments on consumer health and safety in the Schmitt report's emphasis on the provision of information on health and safety requirements for airline passengers and the Collins report's adoption of the proposal that there should be an evaluation of health risk and research into matters like deep-vein thrombosis.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that passengers today suffer not merely from being dumped from airlines, from the problem of lost baggage, but from other things which are often not the fault of the airlines themselves. They principally suffer from a lack of information. If the new agency does one thing, like the food standards agency which we are about to set up, it must be open, it must be transparent. We need to see how its investigations work. We need to see how its personnel are selected. It must be done on the basis of merit and without any links to the industry. All of those are possible if we adopt these two reports.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope the House will give an emphatic welcome in the vote tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I fully agree with the rapporteur when he states that it is necessary – and I would say quite urgent – that we improve the current level of protection in cases of denied boarding, flight cancellations, unjustified delays which, in many cases, lead to connections with other flights or with other means of transport being missed and a long list of similar problems, which is growing every day, not to mention the fact that we Members of this Parliament are long-suffering victims of these inconveniences.</p>
<p class="contents">We must put a stop to this deterioration of quality before it becomes irreversible. I must thank the Commissioner for the efforts that her department is making to achieve this, but in order to achieve this, we must undertake a thorough and appropriate review of current legislation in this field and improve all aspects of it that will lead to greater and better protection of passengers’ rights. We also need to closely monitor the voluntary agreements signed by airlines, which are also designed to improve air transport conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mainly, however, what is essential is a form of vigilance that ensures total compliance with current legislation, which often appears to be nothing more than a useless piece of paper and as such, cannot serve the purposes for which it was intended.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the aspect on which immediate and effective action can and must be undertaken. To start with, we should firmly insist that a ‘Charter on Passenger Rights’ be properly marketed – as the rapporteur has already suggested. Precise, clear, intelligible and full information is necessary to ensure that passengers are aware of their rights and of how to exercise them and, of course, we cannot accept these posters being hidden away in obscure corners into which few people go in many airports.</p>
<p class="contents">This information must be sufficiently publicised and made available to all users and not only in airports but also at points of ticket sales, in travel agencies and also, as far as possible, in the media. Unless we ensure that passengers have access to information on their rights, which in many cases means that they cannot exercise these rights, there is no point at all in embarking on a legislative process whose outcome might also end up being nothing more than a useless piece of paper. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whatever the airlines promise and whatever agreements they reach among themselves to display splendid lists detailing the rights of passengers, in practice very little comes of it. Also from my own experience, it is clear that many things often go wrong. I should therefore wish to call for as many binding agreements as possible that are also laid down in legislation as well as for sanctions for failure to fulfil all kinds of promises to passengers.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, I wish to speak mainly about EASA. The setting up of EASA and the provisional definition of its responsibilities are an important step on the way to complete harmonisation of safety rules in civil aviation. This is necessary and desirable, given the growing importance of the sector at European level, of unambiguous competition rules and of uniform standards, and in view of the need to strengthen the EU’s influence at a global level. We have opted for a cautious start which, in the first instance, will only involve European certification of new types of aircraft, such as the A 380. That is quite reasonable because the Authority still has to find its niche alongside the national aviation bodies, which will, of course, continue to have a role.</p>
<p class="contents">Duplication must be avoided by efficient pooling of available expertise and capacity. Based on a certain timeframe, the mandate of EASA can then be expanded to include other aspects of flight safety, such as the human aspect, the quality of pilot training, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Legislation and the amendments too rightly cover the health and wellbeing of the passengers on board and of the environment, particularly the question of emissions. Our citizens are increasingly worried about these things. The work of EASA will have to help reduce these concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments by the European Parliament make it clear that the independence of the Agency has priority. It must be able to operate free of political interference and certification processes. At the end of the present Regulation, the inevitable comitology crops up. We continue to have our doubts, however, whether this will contribute to the efficient and independent functioning of EASA. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Safety, decisive action and accountability are the three benchmarks for my group. Is the Authority contributing to safety in aviation? In our eyes it is, certainly now that aircraft that are registered in third countries, but whose flights are carried out by a Member State, fall under this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I have submitted an amendment to define the Authority’s overall responsibilities more precisely. The Commission should come up with a proposal by the end of next year at the latest on what new tasks EASA can assume. The most important of these is the granting of permits for aircraft crew in the European Union. What matters is the increased safety of people in aircraft, both passengers and crew. It is not only a matter of the quality of the steel.</p>
<p class="contents">EASA must also be able to take decisive action and that depends on the structure, but also on the quality of the managers. That is why the board of management and the director must have relevant experience. As a ten-year term is quite enough, only one reappointment should be sufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, accountability. We consider it important that all these independent agencies should be accountable to Parliament. The best way of achieving this to ensure that the Commission has a place in the structure of these agencies. If we weaken the role of the Commission too far it will create serious problems of political accountability. We took the same line on these and other points with the European Maritime Safety Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">I also followed Mr Collins’ report with great interest because I myself was rapporteur for a comparable subject, namely liability in aviation. We can identify well with the final version. Many of our amendments have been adopted, for which we are grateful.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to mention two more things. Firstly, I consider it essential that passengers should be informed in good time. Finally, Mr Lynn submitted a number of amendments to stress the fact that airlines should to their utmost to alert passengers to the danger of aviation-related thrombosis, even on short flights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the limited speaking time I have, I want to focus on just one aspect and that is the health aspects of flying.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true to say that in the past the airlines have been woefully neglecting passengers' health. That is beginning to change but there is still a long way to go. I particularly welcome the fact that Mr Collins has devoted a clear section in his report to health and I strongly support his calls for the airlines to be far more proactive in giving information about health risks. We need far greater clarity. Information should be available when you book your ticket. It needs to be there in doctors' surgeries. There needs to be a health briefing in the same form as the current safety briefing on board, including advice on the preventative measures that can be taken. Of course life is not risk-free but there has to be a balance in that risk and if people know what the choices are, they are more likely to be able to make an informed judgement.</p>
<p class="contents">On deep-vein thrombosis for example, although for over ten years there have been reports of people getting blood clots after travelling by plane no comprehensive independent research has been carried out. According to a recent report in The Lancet by a London-based consultant, as many as one in ten people get blood clots of some kind on long-haul flights. Clearly serious health risks are very slight for the vast majority but for a few they are very real. We need to respond to that in terms of both research and the action resulting from that research. More space in aircraft, for example, and less emphasis in getting as many people on board, in as small a place as possible with as much profit as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">There was another example in the press this morning. A Canadian researcher was saying that as a result of air recycling in the cabin some passengers are at risk of catching diseases as serious as tuberculosis. His claims have been refuted by the airlines. The issue here is not the rights or wrongs of this latest allegation but the fact that this type of uncertainty will continue unless we have a new proactive strategy based on more and better research, appropriate action by the airlines and better information to the public. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The creation of a European Aviation Safety Agency, in place of the current informal collaboration between the fifteen Member States, would be the least that could be done to establish common rules in the field of aviation.</p>
<p class="contents">It would however have taken, according to the report, twenty years of bargaining for this measure of simple good sense to be taken. In spite of the euphemisms used, the report recognises that the length of negotiations is due to the difficulty of reconciling EU Member States’ national interests, and behind these the various, even opposing, industrial interests. Thus, the report brings to mind the principle of subsidiarity relating to the functioning of airports, and insists on the necessary confidentiality of enquiries made by the agency with regard to legislation on industrial property.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the differences in interests between the industrial groups concerned have not disappeared augers badly for the authority which will be granted to this agency to impose all the measures useful for the safety of passengers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But make no mistake: the real agenda of this proposal is further political integration. For, as the Commission so eloquently puts it in its own document, it intends to create the European Aviation Safety Agency through the gradual integration of national systems. That seems to me to be a driving force for the whole of the European Union – the gradual integration of national systems.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish that phrase could be plastered in massive letters on billboards around the United Kingdom so that my fellow subjects could really understand what is really going on. As Mr Duisenberg put it recently when he described the euro as a symbol of political integration, we have here yet another symbol – the European Aviation Safety Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">But what is particularly striking here, apart from the fact that we already have an independent intergovernmental agency in the Joint Aviation Authority, is the stark admission that continued intergovernmental cooperation is to be abandoned as it is developed and I quote from the rapporteur's report: "would have involved lengthy ratification procedures in the national parliaments of the states concerned . . ., which would not necessarily have been successful". How awkward and inconvenient democracy is. Rather like the Irish population when they run a referendum, you can never rely on it to behave. Much easier, therefore, to create another European institution and get rid of the whole messy business. Administratively convenient it may be, democracy it is not. But it is symbolic of the European Union's experience.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the aviation content here, and with due deference to the rapporteur, I can only conclude with a phrase that really will not translate from the English: "What a Messerschmidt".</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At last we can create a truly uniform European area of safety in the European skies. We hope that safety will be enhanced by strict and uniform controls. In this respect we support your proposal. The purpose of the amendments proposed by the committee, as Mr Schmitt rightly said, is to strengthen the technical independence of the European Aviation Safety Agency still further, without wanting to diminish your personal parliamentary responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">We trust that this agency will be able to start work in time to grant the symbol of the independent European aviation industry, namely the new Airbus A380, a joint project involving numerous employees, numerous engineers and numerous workers in European countries, the first uniform certification for European airspace. If it does, then I think we will have done both the aviation industry and safety a huge service. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to congratulate Mr Collins on his work and also the Commission on having presented us with this report on protecting the rights of air transport passengers.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an issue which concerns an increasing number of people, more Europeans, because the numbers of air passengers are increasing. Dissatisfaction is also growing, however, with regard to the transport available to us and with the conditions in which they are provided. The European Parliament and the Commission have the responsibility of protecting the interests of Europeans travelling via air transport. It is true that the problems faced by passengers are not entirely the fault of the airlines; they are also caused by the airports, and we must confront both of these situations. These days, airports feel like underground stations, in which the density of people is such that there is no degree of comfort and it is difficult to feel safe.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to transport, passengers demand safety but they also want to know in advance the conditions in which they will be travelling. I am grateful to Mr Collins for having accepted many of the amendments that we tabled to his report, because I feel it has been genuinely useful to include them. Passengers must know in advance and be able to compare the conditions that the transport offers them. Not only the prices, but also the conditions of safety, of comfort – the distances between seats, for example – and also conditions such as the air quality. One possibility that has been mentioned, admittedly, is for flights to become no smoking, but the conditions of safety against pollution have been reduced in order to reduce air transport costs.</p>
<p class="contents">We must confront this problem vigorously and I also wish to ask Commissioner Loyola de Palácio whether she still intends to table legislation in this field by the end of the year, and, if so, what will it be? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As aviation is the most regulated form of transport, I welcome the commitment by the industry, as agreed in Lisbon in May, to implement the voluntary passenger service commitment. This is undoubtedly the best way forward as over-regulation would be extremely damaging to the aviation industry Europe-wide, and in particular in the United Kingdom, and would result in our being uncompetitive. The report is explicit in saying that the desire to protect air passengers should not hinder competition, whilst at the same time the voluntary agreement is comprehensive and detailed in those areas which need to be improved. I hope the Commission will resist in bringing forward legislative proposals as it is only right and proper that the industry should be given sufficient time to implement fully this agreement. On one tiny point here from Mr Collins: the UK is the only country which has in place a minimum seat pitch requirement for safety reasons and I therefore believe that the European Union could follow that example.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the Schmitt Report, we should congratulate Mr Schmitt on clarifying and improving the Commission's proposals, although I still have deep reservations in a number of areas. Nevertheless I believe that there is general agreement that a pan-European body is required in particular in the area of aircraft manufacture, although there is still ambiguity in relation to ICAO rules, which clearly state that both individual certification of aircraft and design changes and modifications are the responsibility of states of registering.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally despite asking the Commission on a number of occasions, we are still unclear as to the future role of national civil aviation authorities, the JAA, as the proposed regulation does not define its parameters. In addition, I believe at this stage efforts should be concentrated on achieving uniform applicability of ICAO, JAA, and Eurocontrol standards that are already in existence. The EC should not seek to parallel and create unwilling distortions of the current ICAO-based safety framework. I look forward to the Commission's response. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The idea of new contract standards between carriers and consumers is not only welcome but long overdue. To be delayed is a nuisance. To be denied information as to the cause of the delay, with little by way of an apology or compensation, is unacceptable. Hopefully, with the support of the airlines and the work done by Mr Collins in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, things will now change for the better.</p>
<p class="contents">We can never take aviation safety for granted. Today my colleague Mrs Cerdeira told me of the tragic crash last week of an old CN-235, converted from military use, on a Melilla to Malaga flight, with loss of life. I extend the sympathies of Mrs Cerdeira and myself to the relatives of the victims.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the contributions of Mr Titford, I assumed he was speaking in a personal capacity. Only people with a bizarre outlook on life and a peculiar political perspective can downgrade the importance of aviation safety in the pursuit of their own nationalistic objectives. Safety should never be used as a political football. I condemn Mr Titford for so doing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to congratulate the rapporteurs, Mr Collins and Mr Schmitt, on their magnificent work and mention one idea that I feel is particularly important in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The passenger protection dossier is, together with the single sky, safety and protection of the environment, an important dossier for air transport, for passengers and also for the image of European integration in the eyes of the public.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware of the importance of this means of transport and also of the contradiction that exists between the Europe of the air and terrestrial Europe: whilst traditional borders are disappearing, we are seeing these borders persist in the air transport sector. Initiatives such as those that we are now discussing are, therefore, of great importance to the European public.</p>
<p class="contents">I come from the Balearic Islands, where dependence on the aeroplane is, as you all know, extremely high. I know what it is to suffer airport chaos or interminable delays. I therefore welcome the Commission’s intention to seek a balance between legislation and the voluntary commitments affecting airlines, airports and airport authorities, not to mention the tourist industry.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an ambitious communication, which seeks to achieve this balance between the needs to establish guarantees for passengers and to ensure that air transport is efficient and competitive. We must get the message across to users and make them fully aware of their rights, which are recognised by law when problems with flights occur.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret the impasse in which many initiatives in this sector are trapped within the Council and I hope that the appropriate agreements will be concluded so that we can move ahead without any further delay.</p>
<p class="contents">In the wake and in commemoration of the terrible accident that befell an aircraft en route from the Spanish city of Melilla, I should like to conclude by congratulating the Commission and Mr Schmitt on their work on the proposal to establish the European Aviation Safety Agency. Reports such as the one by Mr Schmitt will be able, if not to prevent, which is impossible, to considerably reduce the number of these terrible accidents. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The basic features of an agency such as this must be independence of action and efficiency, both of which apply in the present case.</p>
<p class="contents">However, having myself acted as rapporteur for a similar agency, the Maritime Safety Agency, which we recently debated here in the House, and having therefore addressed a similar issue, I should like to take this opportunity, without repeating the views already expressed, of endorsing the general view that similar rules should govern similar administrative mechanisms. This obviously logical precept does not always apply to European Union texts or to European Parliament texts because, as we all know full well, each final text depends on the circumstances at the time in the various debating fora, especially when it comes to the vote. For example, the proposal by our parliamentary committee which prevailed in plenary on the administrative board of the Maritime Safety Agency is completely different from the corresponding proposal in the case being debated today and amendments to improve it have, of course, been proposed. Similarly, the Commission proposals also differ.</p>
<p class="contents">Is there any justification for these differences? The same question could be applied to numerous points in many of our legislative texts. This is not something the relevant Union services, including Parliament, can be proud of. Having said which, I think the Commission could run a comparative check on these texts and then table proposals for similar provisions to be adopted for similar cases and existing unwarranted contradictions to be abolished. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Brenda Wilson is a Greater Manchester constituent of mine who is an active campaigner for the Aviation Health Institute, an organisation working internationally to improve air passenger health. Tragically her son Neil died of a deep-vein thrombosis after a short flight to Benidorm. He is one of an alleged 2000 air travellers who, according to some in the medical profession, die each year from deep-vein thrombosis, not just long haul, not just economy class, and therefore there is growing concern about the potential link between air travel and blood clots.</p>
<p class="contents">The research is ambiguous. The World Health Organisation is putting GBP 7 million into research and I am asking you tonight to give your commitment to a European Union study to look at potential links between DVT and air travel and preventative action. I am also asking the Commission to take up the idea in my amendment on improved health briefings and health warnings on tickets in advance of flying. This will allow passengers, as consumers, to exercise the choice perhaps not to drink alcohol, perhaps to take aspirin three or four days before flying or to wear these new compression socks which help regulate blood flow in the legs.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no need to be an alarmist. We know that air travel is safe but there is nonetheless a small risk for some passengers that they may develop blood clots. We owe it to our European passengers to increase our knowledge and science in this area. I would like your assurance that you will now respond to our call for research and meet as a matter of priority with the aviation industry to look at improved health warnings on tickets. We are in favour of voluntary action but if it is true that the airlines have known for 30 years about the risks of DVT then maybe we need legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One is of a legislative nature and concerns the creation of a European Aviation Safety Agency. The other initiative concerns Parliament’s report on the Commission communication on protecting the rights of air transport passengers.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to warmly congratulate both rapporteurs.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall begin with the initiative on the creation of the European Aviation Safety Agency. I should also like to congratulate Mr Schmitt, of course, on his work.</p>
<p class="contents">In proposing common regulations for the civil aviation sector and the creation of a European Aviation Safety Agency, the Commission has borne in mind the objective of achieving a high and uniform level of safety, which is an essential factor for air transport. It is also, perhaps the most fundamental passenger right. We want to achieve this high and uniform level of safety throughout the European Union and also greater environmental protection.</p>
<p class="contents">This system of common regulations will also have the effect of promoting the internal market and of improving the competitiveness of the European aeronautical industry. It is, of course, also an important factor for the <span class="italic">Airbus</span> project. From now on, a single certificate will be sufficient for a company to be able to supply its products to the whole European market, whilst access to external markets will be simplified, as a result of the conclusion of agreements that will facilitate the harmonisation and the mutual recognition of the certificates.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal under consideration today, therefore, represents a considerable step forwards, particularly if you take account of the objectives it is seeking to achieve. It also, however, represents a genuine innovation in the field of Community integration, if we bear in mind that, until now, the civil aviation sector has been greatly influenced by the sovereignty of Member States and by intergovernmental cooperation – an issue that the speakers have already raised. With regard to the implementation of Community objectives, the Commission is authorised to adopt the appropriate technical standards and administrative procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of creating this specialised Agency is to assist the Commission in implementing policy but the Agency will also have its own powers, since, in some cases, it will replace national administrations in issuing products with certificates of conformity with Community legislation – I repeat, this is crucial for the <span class="italic">Airbus</span> project, as Mr Jarzembowski said a moment ago – and, in other cases, will supervise the issuing of certificates by national administrations.</p>
<p class="contents">The parliamentary committees that have worked on this text have understood the importance of what is at stake and I thank them for their support for the Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the amendments that have been tabled, I can tell you that the Commission can accept most of them, because they improve and clarify our original proposal. In fact, many of them are very similar to the comments made by the Council itself and will, therefore, be adopted in the consolidated modified proposal, either in part or, in some cases, with minor stylistic changes. The Commission also unreservedly accepts strengthening the powers of the Executive Director, something to which the rapporteur referred in his speech, and the provisions on the Agency’s budgetary control.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we cannot accept some of the proposed amendments. I shall list them with their numbers and explain why. First of all, we do not feel that it is appropriate to include the revenue of the Agency and, therefore, its entire budget in the budget of the European Union. This decision would run counter to the flexibility of management that we would like this body to have. The Commission cannot, therefore, accept Amendments Nos 4 and 56.</p>
<p class="contents">Some amendments could cause a degree of confusion, could be difficult to implement or fall outside the scope of the proposal and must, therefore, be rejected. I am referring to Amendments Nos 3, 15, 17, 19, 28, 29, 54 and 65.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor can we accept Amendments Nos 5 and 62, which deal with the scope of the Regulation, as they stand, although, in this case and as a compromise, we can accept proposals being tabled in the year following the adoption of the Regulation, with regard to air operations and staff privileges.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the other areas, we cannot accept airports being definitively excluded. We can only accept proposals being tabled later on these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the publication of the results of inspections by national administrations, set down in Amendments Nos 24 and 30, the Commission does not consider this to be appropriate because confidential information, which could be the basis of criminal proceedings, is involved. Such action nevertheless, does comply with Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 on public access to the documents of the Community institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also take a stand on the amendments dealing with the Agency’s independence, specifically, Nos 21, 32, 42, 43, 45, 53, 64, 70 and 71. We all want this to be an independent body when it acts on technical issues, but this does not mean that it can be free from any kind of political control. We would like to see the Agency independent of individuals, or of the various lobby groups that, as you would expect, exist in this sector and which are very active. We do not want to see the Agency independent of the Community institutions because, I repeat, there must inevitably be some form of political control. Therefore, the Commission cannot accept the suggestions that seek to reduce its powers of control over the Agency. Nevertheless, Amendment No 36, which reflects Parliament’s will not to participate in the Agency’s Administrative Board seems quite appropriate, if that is what Parliament wishes.</p>
<p class="contents">The work currently being undertaken in this House, as in the Council, proves that we are moving towards consensus on all aspects of this measure, with the exception of that of the influence of the Member States and the Community on control of the Agency. It is, therefore, important that the Commission has the support of Parliament on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to congratulate your rapporteur once again and thank you for the excellent work you have carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Commission communication on protecting passenger rights, first of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Collins, on having produced a detailed and stimulating report, which I read with great interest. Having read the report, I have drawn the conclusion that Parliament and the Commission are, to a large extent, in agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Both institutions attach high priority to the protection of passengers and we agree that this protection must be guaranteed by two approaches, which are not contradictory, but complementary. The first approach is the voluntary agreements signed by the airlines and the second is laws that must be complied with.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I shall give a brief summary of the actions planned for the near future and which, as you shall see, fully address your concerns and your suggestions. Firstly, the monitoring of the voluntary commitments. We fully concur that these agreements must provide for a mechanism for ensuring compliance with them if we really want them to be effective and to work properly and, therefore, to have credibility in the eyes of travellers. Over the forthcoming months, we will be working conscientiously on these monitoring measures and on the out-of-court settlement of disputes. I have already held a meeting with the airlines, to whom I made it very clear that this is a key issue, and I think that we can reach solutions that are acceptable to everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, passengers need to be well informed at every step, from the time they plan their trip until the flight itself, as Mr Ojeda said just now. The airlines have given a serious commitment to provide better information, in line with their voluntary commitments. With regard to the consumer reports comparing the profits of the various airlines, we will soon be instituting an experiment to try out various methods then to review legislation in light of the experience we have gained. This is crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">Some passenger interests are so important that we must give them protection under the law. In practical terms, we intend to propose legislation to Parliament and the Council in two specific areas: denied boarding and flight cancellations. In relation to the first matter, we have drawn up a draft, which we are now fine-tuning, with the help of the comments of the various interested parties. The second matter concerns the contracts airlines have with their customers. At the end of this year we shall present a consultation document and, once we have received the reactions of those concerned, we will draft a proposal. In the document, we shall be paying close attention to the rights of the disabled, an issue that some of the honourable Members have also raised today. We also hope that Parliament and the Council will rapidly approve the regulation, so that the standards of the Montreal Convention on the responsibility of Community airlines can apply and so that these new standards may enter into force by the end of next year.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I shall refer to something that various speakers have highlighted, most recently by Mrs McCarthy and which concerns us all: the problems of passenger health. We feel it is crucial to undertake a thorough and exhaustive assessment of the risks of travelling by aeroplane. We are, therefore, financing research into cabin conditions under the Fifth Framework Programme and we are looking into how we can better support the studies into deep-vein thrombosis started by the World Health Organisation. I must tell you that I have written personally to the chairmen of every airline to highlight this issue and to ask them, with the information now available, to immediately adopt measures to improve the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, although both initiatives will take a while, they will provide a solid basis for policy making and we shall keep this House fully informed.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, I must say that I am delighted to see the degree of agreement between Parliament and the Commission. I must also tell you that on a flight with a certain airline, which was delayed by more than twenty minutes, we were informed that we had the right to a free flight with the same company for a period of one month, on the same route, just because there had been a delay of more than twenty minutes, in line with the conditions stated in their contract. I am telling you this because the concerns and the actions of both Parliament and the Commission are yielding tangible results for the public, for users and for consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would be very grateful for the Commission's response. It may not be possible this evening, but I would like more clarification on that area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some competences will remain with the JAA, such as staffing, for example but, with time, these will be incorporated into EASA. In other words, at a certain point, the two institutions will converge, but only briefly. In any event, I can send you the particular details of the matter, Mr Foster. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
