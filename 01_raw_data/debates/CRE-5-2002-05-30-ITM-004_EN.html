<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Howitt (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Madam President, the European Parliament first called for action on corporate social responsibility in 1999. We welcome the Commission's Green Paper and today we set out a series of concrete steps which will turn European debates into European action. Let me highlight four steps in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">First, rules for disclosure of basic information about the company's social and environmental impacts. Although some companies now produce voluntary triple bottom line reports, too many do not. Of those that do, the OECD tells us that two thirds ignore internationally recognised standards, avoid independent verification or disown responsibility down their supply chain. Such rights of disclosure would build on the new economic regulations law in France, similar legislation here in Belgium, and the occupational pension scheme regulation in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">For business, it is about levelling the playing field, reducing cost, simplifying procedures and industry representatives from British Telecoms, USF – even an old <span class="italic">bête noire</span> like <span class="italic">Chiquita</span> – have all said this must come in time. We ask the Commissioner to learn the lessons of her own excellent public consultation. Nearly half of the respondents challenge the basic definition of CSR as simply one beyond compliance. Legislation and voluntary action are not mutually exclusive. The prospect of legislation spurs voluntary efforts which in turn establish norms which legislation entrenches for future years. We must and should encourage both.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the European Parliament will today vote for mandatory social and environmental reporting by companies, for new corporate governance rules, including making board members individually responsible for the social and environmental performance of the firm, and we will reaffirm our call for a new legal base for jurisdiction over European companies operations world-wide.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to see CSR issues incorporated in the European social dialogue, but we support too the setting up of an EU multi-stakeholder CSR forum. This will allow others with a legitimate interest in corporate performance to have a voice. The forum should not replace or duplicate existing initiatives which will drive forward the debate of the EU level, and should be a forum which will not be all mouth but which will have real teeth.</p>
<p class="contents">CSR really must be built into all EU policies and programmes. It is quite breathtaking that the European Commission and the European Investment Bank commit billions of euros of European taxpayers' money each year to the private sector, through contracts, regional aid, investment promotion, yet we do not have simple contractual clauses to respect the basic labour and environmental standards nor clear monitoring and complaints procedures to enforce them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Dutch Government has shown the way by linking access to export credits to compliance with voluntary standards. The EU must follow suit. We want to encourage voluntary action by companies, including the excellent business campaign led by CSR Europe, but we must balance our praise for good practice by the best companies with the recognition that we live in a world where there is also corporate irresponsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Within Europe, we have the devastation of mass closures on affected communities or the difficulties of accessing capital in the poorest communities where it is needed most. Today the greatest public concern in Europe surrounds the abuses by European multinationals in developing countries. It is about the hundreds of people murdered each year for taking part in legitimate trade-union activity; two-hundred and fifty million working children world-wide; export processing zones set up specifically to evade minimum standards or the clothing sweatshops where they are simply ignored; slave labour on West African cocoa plantations or building oil installations in Burma; the victims of those killed in the civil wars in Angola or Sierra Leone, fuelled by the trade in conflict diamonds or corrupt payments to exploit minerals extraction; 1.5 million babies dying each year because their mothers do not breast feed misled by the marketing practices for infant formula.</p>
<p class="contents">European companies can knowingly or otherwise be part of these abuses and they can be part of ending them too. That is why the European Parliament will today vote to make CSR an active part of our trade agreements, development assistance, of our unparalleled network of delegations in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU itself must make a serious contribution to the implementation of the OECD guidelines on multi-national enterprise and should act as a champion of new global standards in international institutions, standards which put investor responsibility on an equal footing to investor rights. These are the elements that will truly forge a European framework for corporate social responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The purpose of the Green Paper is to clarify – and we agree here – that the correlation between economic activity and success must promote social responsibility which, in turn, will contribute to the ongoing success of the company and help revive the economy and society. So it is important to persuade companies, the two sides of industry and society as a whole to look on social responsibility as a long-term strategy, rather than an occasional activity. This strategy must be bound up with the quality of women's employment and women's professional integration and careers, because these are objectives which have been recognised as instrumental in achieving the strategic targets set in Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">So we believe that this policy should be based on information, increased awareness, voluntary action and a sense of responsibility. All the measures implemented must make provision for the law to be applied and for the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire </span>on equal rights for men and women to be incorporated; but they must also make provision for something more, which has to do with initiatives to help reconcile family and working life, to make sure women are fully involved in designing and implementing company policy and to enhance the image of women.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, we believe that the forum being proposed by the European Parliament should give serious consideration both to these issues and to involving women in its work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are only beginning, but globalisation is already here and it is obvious that companies play a major role in social matters. They have rights but they must also have obligations to contribute to a fairer society that is more in keeping with the defence of human rights in the world, improving the environment, combating discrimination and in favour of basic and fundamental working standards.</p>
<p class="contents">It is wrong to think that, as the Howitt report suggests, it would be a burden for companies to introduce compulsory social responsibility, councils that are open to participation from all, not only shareholders, but also what are called stake holders, and a social and environmental report, because those companies in the global society that act according to those rules will be more profitable and will be able to operate much more easily in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Paradoxically, the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, Mrs Lucas, withdrew her name from the opinion. However, the chairman of the committee cannot withdraw his or her name, so I am presenting it on behalf of the committee, but I am in fact in the same position as Mrs Lucas in that I am convinced of the need for the social and environmental report to be compulsory. I therefore fully support the Howitt report from the committee responsible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As he is aware, many of his colleagues have not been idle either and much of the work that we have done has been, as a result of the work of Mr Howitt, to try and unscramble or reshape his particular report.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly, in committee we have worked well together across the groups and have produced compromise amendments that some of us can live with, some more easily than others.</p>
<p class="contents">Our basic position is that, yet again, we see being proposed today, the standard Socialist solution to every problem: legislation. The irony is that on this particular occasion it is being offered as a solution to an area for which there is no problem in the first place. Corporate social responsibility is something that is very much on the up, it is very strong within Europe. Europe is giving a lead on this and that is to be encouraged and supported.</p>
<p class="contents">As a group, obviously we support the very concept of CSR, but we do not welcome legislation which would stifle the very initiatives that we are trying to foster. This represents not just the view of governments, but also of businesses across the EU who have supplied input to the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">We have tabled and re-tabled some amendments. Amendment No 1 is key and needs to pass if the group line will be to support the report. I hope that many of the other amendments which failed by one vote in committee, will also secure the support of the House today. We welcome the idea of some sort of stakeholder forum where companies can bounce ideas off each other and share best practice, but do not see this as a forum which will lead to the signing-up of agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I particularly welcome the position taken by the Commissioner and would thank her for the letter that she wrote to my colleague, Mr Pronk, last month which said that the Commission has stated that the CSR is essentially a concept whereby companies decide voluntarily to contribute to a better society and a cleaner environment. The Commission maintains this opinion which has been confirmed during the consultation process on the Green Paper. I trust you will note that the final report invites the Commission to bring forward legislation and I hope this is an invitation which you will very politely, but very firmly, refuse. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Modern companies have to take account of other factors, for example people and the environment. That is, of course, the basic view of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, but it is fortunately also the basic view of modern companies and, in actual fact, of modern investors too. It has found splendid expression in this report, and I find it annoying that the Group of the Europe People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will not accept that the tool in this context needs to be a mixture of carrot and stick.</p>
<p class="contents">Companies have to submit financial accounts at present but, in future, these financial accounts will, of course, also have to be combined with annual reports which tell the public what the companies have done to comply with their social responsibilities and their responsibility for the environment. The annual social reports must, of course, present a reliable picture of what has happened in this area, and that means that, in common with the financial accounts, they naturally must be subject to independent verification.</p>
<p class="contents">A couple of words, then, about the social labelling scheme. I hope that Parliament will support this today and that the Commission too will view the idea in a positive light, for the social labelling scheme will make it possible for consumers to choose products from companies which comply with their social responsibilities. Clearly, a series of common standards should be adopted for the social labelling scheme. Otherwise, the result will only be confusion, and consumers will not be given the opportunity to make their mark and to select the products they desire. The environmental label introduced by the EU could be a quite excellent source of inspiration. I also believe, of course, that the social labelling scheme enjoys the distinction of having a very broad appeal to the various political groups, for it is a specifically voluntary scheme and structure of incentives which uses a carrot instead of a stick. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has long been a part of European companies’ day-to-day practice to assume responsibilities – over and above those required by laws and regulations – for their employees, their surroundings and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">In Denmark, we have been working for a number of years on companies’ social responsibilities, particularly with a view to keeping people in work and getting excluded groups into the labour market. This has taken place in the form of very productive dialogue and interaction between companies and authorities. Another example I want to mention is the cooperation between thirteen major groups in Scandinavia which, together with the World Nature Fund, are working on developing a sustainable development programme. The key term for describing these efforts is the pursuit of excellence, rather than mere compliance with what the law requires. It is about acting from the heart and taking the company as one’s point of departure. In short, the key words are commitment and voluntarism.</p>
<p class="contents">It also jars with me, therefore, when many here in Parliament wish to regulate voluntary efforts and force companies to report on, and explain, their efforts. That is something I have fought against. On the other hand, I think it is a good idea to promote the exchange of experiences and ideas in this area and so support the efforts already made by companies and organisations to structure and standardise this work. I think the Dublin Institute is very well suited to this purpose, given the skills and the network already possessed by the Institute. Much thanks is therefore due to the Commission for having initiated the debate. We in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party are able, then, to support active efforts to develop companies’ social responsibilities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My group welcomes the progress made by a number of companies to examine and audit their progress and to make that information public, whether it is information, for example, on their environmental impact, the effectiveness of their equal opportunities policy, or their involvement in the local community. There are companies that have recognised the benefits of greater transparency and positive action and for them, it has been a win-win situation.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, a problem with the speed of take-up and we agree that social irresponsibility is still out there. That is why my group firmly believes that there is a role for foundation legislation, not total legislation – do not let us fall into the trap of believing this is the only way forward – but foundation legislation to provide a baseline for public reporting. This would help the public to know and to understand what information they should expect.</p>
<p class="contents">The inclusion of supply-chain responsibility for us is crucial. A company that will not ensure in its total delivery the highest standards it often claims in its annual reports, is hypocritical and endangers the lives of workers and the public. We have seen this in my own country, for example, in the railway and nuclear industries.</p>
<p class="contents">In looking at the wider responsibilities of companies based in the European Union and the Union itself, my group has tabled amendments requesting Council to include in its remit for the Johannesburg summit on sustainable development the proposal for the negotiation of a legally binding international framework on corporate accountability and liability. We hope that will be taken up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the Green Paper, the Commission mentions what is usually understood by social responsibility. This term is used to indicate that companies consider social issues and the environment of their own free will in the context of their company activities and in their relations with other parties. The Commission is right to point out that by assuming their social responsibility, companies do more than is legally required of them. This is exactly what has led to the biggest differences of opinion in this House. Listening to the rapporteur, one could be forgiven for thinking that the whole world can be changed not only by means of social responsibility, but especially with legislation based on this principle. Everything changes for the better, including child labour. I am surprised that volcanic eruptions have not been abolished.</p>
<p class="contents">This is, of course, far beyond the reach of this instrument. Social responsibility is what it is about. Legislation is only secondary; this only needs adjusting in certain cases when social responsibility causes problems. A great deal can be achieved with social responsibility, but if, on the other hand, you immediately resort to legislation, you end up on the wrong path. This is like going to the football World Cup in Korea and saying that you want to watch hockey.</p>
<p class="contents">Legislation in itself is not bad, and this is not what the PPE-DE is saying, but it does not belong in this report; it belongs in other reports. By using this term, you cannot suddenly introduce a whole raft of legislation. This must be done at the right time and in the right place. In my opinion, the Commission has borne this difference in mind at all times. Furthermore, I also think that it would not work, for if people think that by being socially responsible they are tied to legislation, this will not work as an incentive.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, pragmatic and principled, the report that is now before us, including our amendments, is the right one. Indeed, it is based on free will, and this is what we need to base ourselves on. We can then reach agreement with everyone involved and achieve all these fine goals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At that time, tackling from behind was still permitted. The great players did not have a chance. Intelligent adjustments were made to the rules of football. We are dealing with the very same thing in this area of CSR norms. We live in a different world. Small nation-states like Germany – not to mention countries like Austria, which are small-fry in global terms – can no longer raise sufficient taxes, perhaps not even to a reasonable amount, but enterprises have a responsibility, and one that they also want to take seriously, and if they are not bound by regulations, it is the ones who play fair who get penalised, because the foulers can carry on playing. This we must change. The crucial thing is transparency. That is why these requirements for annual social reports are significant and a matter of absolute priority.</p>

<p class="contents">If we look at the concept of companies, there was a longstanding economic concept that a company was an organisation of people, which, through controlling goods and services, had the aim of producing goods and services for a market. This is a purely economic concept. However, the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, which was recently enacted in Directive 2001/23, talks about a company as an organised group of people and elements enabling a business activity to be conducted pursuing their own objective. This is clearly a much broader concept which we could also relate to recital C of the report, which says that within companies and among investors a consensus is developing that they have a broader mission than simply making profits, and that the challenge for success lies in combining profitability with sustainability and responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that companies, whatever their format, however many staff they have or whatever funds they have, live in a global world in which their voluntary, encouraged and prompted contribution, and I realise what I am saying, I am not saying compulsory or imposed by law, to achieving a better society, has a new meaning. As it says in the Green Paper, although the main responsibility of the company is to generate profits, it can also contribute at the same time to achieving social and environmental objectives, and that should not be seen solely as an obligation or responsibility for particular types of companies or companies that operate in particular sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that this is a good instrument for fulfilling the Lisbon strategy: an economy that is as developed as possible, creating more and better jobs, which respects the environment and guarantees social cohesion. It will ultimately be a suitable instrument for establishing the European social model and it will also be good for companies, because profitability and social responsibility go hand in hand and cannot be separated from each other. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There was huge involvement in the consultations, as one speaker has already mentioned; over 250 people were involved and I should like, if I may, to comment on the substance of the agreement which has come out of this overall consultation. We have confirmed that we agree that, when we say companies' social responsibilities, we mean the basis on which companies voluntarily incorporate their social and environmental concerns. And they do so, of course, in a way which goes beyond current statutory requirements. Τhe incentive for companies to take this action must not of course fly in the face of the rules of the economy, which is why it is vital to make sure everyone is clear and knows that when companies implement social responsibility programmes, they improve both their profits and their consumer acceptance.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, as regards the debate on whether this should be done on a voluntary basis or enshrined in law, I would say that, for the moment at least, as we are just starting to coordinate at European level, it really should be on a voluntary basis, but that the initiatives and endeavours made should be such that the final result, that is, the maximum number of companies involved, should be the same as if it were a statutory requirement. What does this mean? It means we need government agencies and planning in the field of companies' social responsibilities at both national and European level dealing with, one: information and, when I say information, I mean that we need to publicise the fact that companies constantly and consistently involved in social responsibility programmes have improved their profits considerably, and two: coordinating these efforts, so that we obtain optimum social and economic results, and by this I mean coordinating small and medium-sized enterprises, transparency, one of the most important issues dealt with by the rapporteurs, the facility to verify what companies say and new structures to evaluate company profiles. This is an area in which there are differing approaches and views and the Commission will present its final proposal in July. And then, of course, there is the question of compatibility with existing international agreements, such as the guidelines of the OECD or the International Labour Organisation, so that we can also work with developing world countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like now to comment on a number of very specific points made in the parliamentary report. As I said, and this is clear from your report, transparency and the facility to measure and compare companies' social and environmental performance is absolutely vital; in fact, in some countries, companies are already required to provide some sort of information on their social and environmental impact. These statutory requirements in certain Member States could help enormously in increasing transparency and we could use a procedure between the Member States to see what the positive results of this approach are. Of course, I agree with Mrs Κratsa that the question of equal opportunities, as regards policy both within the company and outside, is one of the basic points. I intend to propose that a European forum on companies' social responsibilities be set up in order to provide a platform at European level for all the interested parties to consider practices and means in connection with companies' social responsibilities and, of course, to help with what we have said, that is, information and coordination both within the European Union and at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">This forum could also examine whether or not there is a need for the ombudsman referred to in item 51. Similarly, item 29 contains an important message on the need to mainstream companies' social responsibilities and I totally agree with this. What I intend to do is to propose that the Commission incorporate companies' social responsibilities in the European Union's policies and in Commission affairs, so as to ensure that there is support for the development of companies' social responsibilities. On item 30, I agree on the role of the public administrations, as I described earlier, and as regards item 36 on the need for special cooperation with third countries, there is a whole dimension to our proposal on the role of European companies outside the borders of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Companies' social responsibilities can obviously be expressed in the strategy on employment and we shall be looking at the open coordination method to see how we can present the best results and, of course, the social economy sector has a great deal of experience in social responsibility. These companies have a different basic approach and interests to other companies but can provide fundamental help, especially through cooperation and networks between the Member States. Finally, on item 53, I agree with what you say about core labour standards but, as you know, the Commission is already proposing to include core labour standards in bilateral agreements at European and international level and in all related policy areas of the European Union, that is, in trade, development, external relations and social matters.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like once again to thank Mr Howitt and all the MEPs who took part in what was a difficult debate and say that your report was the final and most important contribution to the dialogue and consultations on the Green Paper. I and my colleague Mr Liikanen intend to submit the final version of the Green Paper in June, once it has been approved by the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
