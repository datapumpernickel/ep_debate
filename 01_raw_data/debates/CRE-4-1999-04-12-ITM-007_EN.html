<p class="contents">The next item is the report (A4‐0174/99) by Mr Harrison, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 77/388/EEC as regards the determination of the person liable for payment of value added tax (COM(98)0660 – C4‐0705/98‐98/0312(CNS)).</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Harrison </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span><span class="italic">rapporteur. ‐</span> Madam President, the purpose of the Commission proposal to amend the 1997 Directive determining the person liable for payment of VAT is to simplify the current very complicated system. It is raised under the SLIM proposals, whose object is to make access to the single European market easier, especially for SMEs. The underlying principle guiding the Commission proposal is to identify the person responsible for VAT, where companies are operating in more than one EU state, as the person who performs the taxable transaction, irrespective of whether he or she is established within the country where the transaction takes place.</p>
<p class="contents">It should further be noted that the proposal is interim in nature. The Commission still fully intends to move to a definitive system of VAT collection and liability based on the principle of a single place of taxation. Also, attached to this proposal, is the separate, but very welcome, idea of tackling the problem of VAT tax avoidance related to the supply of continuous products like gas or electricity. Here it is proposed that tax should be charged on an annual basis where there are no pre‐established successive statements of account. So far, so good, but this is where the problems begin.</p>
<p class="contents">This delay of the definitive VAT regime is regrettable in itself but even more frustrating for the SMEs, which we want to be active participants in the single market, is the introduction of an interim system which seems as confusing as its predecessor. That is why I have asked the Commission, to no avail, to quantify the problem and, in addition, to set out a strategy and timetable for this interim regime before the definitive system is introduced. Why is the Commission so reluctant to do this?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as rapporteur, I am alarmed to learn from the Commission details of their consultation with the small business community on the proposal. Why, for instance, did the Commission consult SMEs from only seven Member States? Furthermore, was the Commission not concerned to learn that one in three SMEs thought the present proposal might lengthen, not slash, VAT red tape. Perhaps the Commission might reply to these points this evening, if it arrives on time.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the reverse charges system which keeps intact the principle of fraction payments should not in itself be over‐used or abused. Nevertheless, the abundance of exceptions allowed seems to deny the principle of simplifying, not complicating, the interim system. Incidentally, I have still not received an explanation from the Commission why lawyers, consultancy bureaus and agents concerned with the transport of goods qualify as exceptions able to use the reverse charges system. Why these and not others? I think we should be told.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the mutual assistance facility provided to SMEs to help them pole‐vault over some of the recognised barriers to the market has itself been found to be unused and hence ineffective. What has the Commission to say about this? Fifthly, I should like the Commission to clarify its position vis‐à‐vis NGOs which persistently lose valuable income because they are penalised by a system that frequently leaves them high and dry with irrecoverable VAT.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, is the Commission prepared to deal with the outrageous practice whereby SMEs operating in Belgium and in other Member States are obliged in fulfilling current requirements for identifying their VAT tax responsibilities, to lodge financial guarantees with local banks, thereby absorbing valuable resources which cause mortal cash flow problems and which inhibit many such SMEs from entering the market</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to pause here and thank my colleague Mr Rübig for his two amendments which I accept. They are aimed at helping the SME sector although I realise that we are adding to the exceptions I have already talked about.</p>
<p class="contents">This Commission proposal seeks to help business succeed in the single market. Its aspiration is fine but its application is suspect. I hope the Commission can reassure Parliament on all the concerns I have raised tonight in my report and I hope the Commissioner who has been unable to listen to the arguments I have set out – it seems rather purposeless when he is not here – will be able to respond to those specific points.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Secchi </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, I should like to begin by saying that our group broadly shares the arguments put forward by the rapporteur, to whom we are grateful for his work in this important field. We particularly welcome all the measures which facilitate the work of SMEs, in keeping with the SLIM exercise which lies behind some of the proposals now before us. We also welcome the pressure being brought to bear for a re‐examination of the question of NGOs, so as to devise rules better suited to their activities, rather than imposing on them a seemingly unjustifiable fiscal regime subjecting them to irrecoverable VAT.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group came out against Amendment No 7, and I should now like to explain why. In our opinion, the wording of this amendment is somewhat complicated: it covers various bodies, such as NGOs, which should have been handled separately. We also have our doubts about the call for a general strategy to improve the present transitional VAT regime while awaiting the definitive system.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, we are afraid that – although several references are made to the definitive system, which we wish to see introduced as soon as possible – to lay down rules facilitating the transition without establishing a precise timetable is in fact a kind of pretext for postponing again and again a decision which should be taken as soon as possible. The House, and Mr Harrison in particular, will recall that my own report on this subject called for a specific deadline: admittedly it was a little over‐ambitious, but it was at least specific. Unfortunately, the House rejected that proposal by just a few votes, most notably those of Mr Harrison and his group.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, our group will vote in favour of all the amendments, albeit with two recommendations: firstly, that the Commission should take up our line of reasoning, Amendment No 7 in particular, so as to streamline and clarify the text; secondly, that our request for a swift transition to the definitive VAT system should be reflected somehow, by setting a deadline or by giving strong arguments for the continued postponement. Amendments Nos 8 and 9, with which we agree – because there could be simpler ways of providing guarantees than those envisaged – would, for instance, become redundant if the definitive system were introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we can endorse all Mr Harrison's arguments during this interim phase; let us vow to move ahead as rapidly as possible, and then many of these problems will cease to exist.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Gallagher </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – Madam President, I want to congratulate Mr Harrison on the presentation of his report. The present system of VAT is so designed that the tax receipt is directly collected by the Member States on whose territory the consumption of the goods or services sold is deemed to take place. In order to ensure this direct allocation of the tax, complex rules have been laid down. Traders who wish to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the advent of the single market on 1 January 1993 usually perceive the need to fulfil tax obligations in several Member States as a barrier to the free movement of goods and services.</p>
<p class="contents">The internal market could not operate in a productive manner unless more user‐friendly rules were implemented at national and European level in the area of tax collection. In May 1997 the Commission proposed that VAT collection be included in the second phase of the SLIM programme. Following this recommendation the Commission undertook to introduce legislation to simplify tax representation. A panel of experts was also employed to advise the European Union on these various tax matters.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the efforts being made by the Union to simplify the tax regime in the area of VAT. The Sixth VAT Directive allows traders who carry out taxable transactions in a given country to be the person liable to pay tax to the appropriate authorities. However, the main features of the present legislation, as regards the determination of the persons liable for the payment of tax, are extremely complex and there is a wide difference in its actual proposed applications due to the many different tax options which are available to the Member States in addressing this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I support the broad thrust of these measures but there is clearly more work to be done in simplifying the area of tax across the Union.</p>

I feel that these points are of particular importance for small and medium‐sized enterprises. We already know that the VAT system has many different legal bases in the European Union. In my opinion Amendment No 6 is a typical example of how the system can be simplified, for instance in the case of goods installed, so that simplifications can also be made in this area.</p>
