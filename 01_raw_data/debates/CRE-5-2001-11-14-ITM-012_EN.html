Initially, the banks expressed objections, with good reason, and we have worked for years to accommodate those objections. We now have an international bank account number, the IBAN, we have a bank identifier code, the BIC, the reporting requirements to the Central Bank have been lifted when amounts up to EUR 12 500 are involved, and that coincides with the permitted maximum of the money-laundering directive. There is a format to transfer payments fully automatically. To my disappointment, this resulted only in ever more expensive transfers. At the end of 2000, Mr Bolkestein and myself were in this plenary when the Commissioner promised on that occasion that he would take measures if nothing had changed in the first six months of this year. In July, the Commission and Parliament established, each following their own extensive inquiries, that nothing had changed. Quite the reverse, in fact: the situation had deteriorated. The Commissioner kept his promise and presented his Regulation, and I realise that the banks have simply missed two opportunities. In November 2000 and even in July of this year, there would have been enough time to set up a substantial self-regulation scheme, something which all parties would have preferred to this wrap over the knuckles. The European Banking Association has made a manful attempt to set up a cheap payment structure, step one followed by step two, for which they also received praise by the European Central Bank in its 2000 annual report. I would endorse this, but would at the same time express my astonishment about the fact that only a very small number of banks have joined the initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Much to the delight of Parliament, the Council in Ghent expressed its approval of the Regulation, and we hope that this will impact positively on the Internal Market Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now turn my attention to the amendments. I am unable to support Amendment No 9 on self-regulation. As I have already stated, although we welcome the idea of self-regulation, the proposal should have been backed by all banks. It should be accompanied by monitoring, guarantees, sanctions, etc. However, the liberal amendment creates confusion about the date of entry into force and in strict legal terms, something like that cannot be provided for in this Regulation. The other new amendments are the result of the sound cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission. I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for this sound cooperation. I now have high hopes for the Internal Market Council reaching agreement on 26 November, something which the Ghent Summit called for. The changes I would propose with regard to the Commission position are as follows.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I have suggested changing the date of entry into effect from 1 January to 1 March, by which date all countries will have completed their transitional periods. Moreover, at this rate, we will not make 1 January with the notification in the Official Journal practically speaking. I would propose a few amendments, namely 10, 13 and 16 with regard to cheques. I do not want cheques to fall within the principle of equal costs as referred to in Article 3, because an increasing number of banks would actually like to do away with the cross-border cheque. Guarantees concerning cheques are very different in all countries. The cheque does remain within the scope of the transparency section of the Regulation, which is stipulated in Article 4.</p>
<p class="contents">Another proposal for change concerns the obligation to communicate with the banking country by using the IBAN and BIC codes. Some banks, such as the Postbank and Internet banks, have their own codes and should not, therefore, be forced to use the IBAN and BIC codes.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to turn to Mrs Torres Marques’ earlier amendment. Some Member States had difficulty coming to terms with yet another institution, and that was never our intention. We have solved the matter with a consideration for redress procedures and an article about sanctions, something which we happen to attach great importance to.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank Commissioner Bolkestein for his courage and for the fact that he kept his promise. His offices were always available for consultation, and all this could well result in this Regulation ending its march through the institutions on a positive note. Parliament is expected to provide broad support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have had research from Mr Caudron, we have voted on Mr Jarzembowski's report on port services and we have had shipbuilding courtesy of Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, but looking up at the people in the galleries I have to say that these may all have been important issues for the economy or for society, but in many cases it will have been nothing but gobbledegook to our listeners.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue is different. Last summer in Austria I, myself, unintentionally parked illegally and felt dreadfully guilty. However, my bad conscience about this parking offence was very quickly eclipsed by concern about how much it would cost me to transfer the 200 Austrian schillings for this parking ticket from Germany to Austria. I therefore went straight to the Austrian authorities and paid in cash because I was afraid that the bank charges might be more than the actual fine. This is an experience familiar to many people. What is decisive, and this is something which we should also always bear in mind in this House, is how Europe measures up when people encounter it in their everyday lives, and in many of the areas on which we are working it proves to be far from perfect.</p>
<p class="contents">On 1 January we will get the euro. There is a German word, '<span class="italic">begreifen</span>', which means to understand, but which incorporates a notion of grasping or touching. The public will be able to touch the euro and that is why confidence in the euro will grow from that moment on. However, we must also make sure that all of the appropriate arrangements are in place so that the public are able to treat payments within Europe in the same way as payments within their own countries. That is why this regulation is incredibly important, and I very much regret the fact that the idea of it has only just occurred to the Commission. I drafted an opinion once before, nine months ago. At that time I was still being told by the Commission that there were steep mountain tracks between the banks, and I said that if money could be made with mountain tracks it would be. If money can be made with motorways then it will be. We need motorways in the banking sector too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In 47 days the euro coins and notes will be available to everyone in the euro zone as a common currency, in my opinion, the greatest European Union project ever in terms of creating identity and fostering integration. The euro zone will be a domestic market within the internal market. We are all called upon to do all we can, not only in connection with cross-border payments, to bring down the barriers to the creation of this domestic financial market. The difference in cost between national and cross-border transfers in the domestic market stands in contradiction to our objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">A Commission study has shown that although these charges have been steadily falling since 1993, even today, at some banks, people are still having to fork out up to EUR 24 to transfer EUR 100 to another country in the EU. That is why this Commission proposal and the report are needed. Nevertheless, I wish to say on behalf of my group that we would welcome a genuine system of bank self-regulation, a system which is sustainable, comprehensive and credible. It is true that the proposals currently on the table are moving in the direction of a system of self-regulation of this kind, but we do not think that they go far enough. That is also why this report is being tabled here.</p>
<p class="contents">Should a credible and sustainable system of self-regulation be forthcoming then we would be prepared to vote against the regulation at the next reading, which would allow the Commission not to implement its proposal for a regulation. However, we are waiting on the banks. The ball is in their court. We must adopt this approach because none of the measures taken so far have been sufficient. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Parliament and especially its Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has for years been insisting on the need for banks to set up payment systems in the euro zone that would allow citizens to use the euro as if it were a national currency. Despite the existence of fixed exchange rates between the various currencies in the euro zone, cross-border payments are processed with the same charges as domestic payments. The citizens do not understand this: why are payments within the euro zone processed as if they were international payments? Is there or is there not a euro payment zone? The banks have perfected their credit and debit card and electronic purse payment systems at a national level, they have perfected their international operations, and they have forgotten about the euro area. Well, the euro zone is for us a region with a single currency which should have monetary rules in common that are easily understood by the citizens. It is just as well that when a recent Commission study revealed that, far from having fallen, transfer charges in the euro zone had remained high, it showed the need for the draft regulation that we are now examining. The regulation seeks, from January 2002, to equalise the charges for cross-border credit and debit card transfers that each bank performs in its own domestic market. The Commission proposes that the same should occur with bank transfers and cheques from January 2003 onwards.</p>
<p class="contents">The Party of European Socialists agrees with the rapporteur’s proposals, and therefore this draft regulation deserves our approval; we also hope that an agreement can be reached with the Council at first reading. Implementation of the regulation must not, in any event, cause domestic charges to rise. In fact, cross-border transfers only represent 1% of the total payments made by the banks, and they are electronic payments which entail an effective reduction in staff costs for the banking system.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus any use of this regulation to raise charges on domestic payments must be firmly rejected by the European institutions. The citizens have, in fact, already condemned and rejected it. Of the main amendments approved, we highlight the one concerning the penalties to be applied in the event of infringement of the regulation by any banking organisation, as well as an indication of the procedures to follow in other situations, so as to give some assurance to the citizens who use the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, with the approval of this regulation, Parliament will be contributing to a smooth launch of the new currency for the citizens, giving the euro greater credibility and strength, and easing the indispensable cultural and economic transition. We hope that, after the decision of the Ghent European Council, this legislation will be approved as quickly as possible. This political decision will be good for the euro zone, but most of all it will be good for the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A solution to the problem of cross-border payments is now really in sight, and that is surely something to be welcomed. Partly thanks to the tenacity of this Parliament, an arrangement will be put in place, and I think that the name of our rapporteur will remain inextricably linked with this. Her tenacity has largely resulted in the current proposal to do something about this problem. Consumers and businesses must be able to rely on efficient, safe and cheap services in the field of cross-border payments in the internal market once the new currency has been introduced. After all, this euro offers the opportunity of bringing Europe truly closer to the citizen, as was stated a moment ago, and of making Europe tangible. That is why it must be possible to use this currency as European currency without obstructions or excessive costs. Not one citizen will understand why the remittance of euros from one country to another involves such high costs. The banks are responsible for this, for that is where the problem lies. But, needless to say, it is not those banks, but we as politicians, who ultimately get the blame. After all, we have launched the euro, so we are saddled with the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is not just our problem, it is also the problem of the banks. In the first place, that is why the conversion must be as smooth as possible and it is therefore a good idea to concentrate all our efforts on that event. Banks must be able to give their full attention to the successful introduction of the euro notes and coins at the beginning of next year and after that, the euro zone can, in terms of payments, develop into one country with one market. In my view, the new amendments tabled by our rapporteur are particularly fitting in this connection, and we will be supporting them.</p>
<p class="contents">What we do not like in the proposal is that it could, of course, lead to a situation in which even the internal payments, which are, or at least seem to be, now mostly free, will become more expensive for the consumer. That too will do nothing to boost the euro’s popularity. It is therefore important to avoid this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, why is it a choice between two evils? We are not bankers and therefore do not know how bank charges should be calculated, nor do we want to know, in all honesty, for that is why we have bankers. Self-regulation is therefore the big favourite as far as our group is concerned. We have tabled an amendment in this connection. Should this not be accepted, and the banks have so far not been sufficiently prepared to do something about this, then these measures will unfortunately be inevitable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of those expectations is that when they use the euro in the relevant Member States, they will pay the same price for using means of payment other than cash. It is therefore unsatisfactory that shortly before the introduction of the euro, an adequate solution has still not been found to the problem of charges for cross-border payments.</p>
<p class="contents">In this matter, a large proportion of the blame must be apportioned to the banks and financial institutions. Self-regulation in the sector appears not to be working. That is why I have great admiration for the efforts by Commissioner Bolkestein and rapporteur Peijs, who tenaciously worked to find a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">There are sound arguments why banks should not charge anything at all for electronic cross-border payments. Current technology enables these payment transactions to be carried out at low cost and the same technology can also be used for cross-border payments. The use of different charges is not desirable and contravenes the concept of an internal payment market and a common currency. For banks, electronic payment means a saving since less labour-intensive PIN payments are encouraged. I therefore support the view of the European Commission and rapporteur Peijs, and hope that a prompt introduction of this measure will strengthen consumer confidence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Under these circumstances, the reason why some Members are portraying them as evil is because they are inexorably seeking to achieve a uniform internal market and because there has been a backlash from the pro-euro propaganda, which promised the impossible. Having made these points, I shall leave it there.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a regulation that is before us today belongs to the next stage. Since the market is putting up some resistance, it is proposed that we use force to make it submit, by decreeing compulsory equality of bank charges on internal transactions, as on cross-border transactions. We believe this text is untimely, not only because it denies the realities of the market, which will exact their revenge in one way or another in the future, but for four other reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is that it undermines subsidiarity, because this issue should be a matter for Member States. The second is that it undermines the freedom of pricing, which we actually believed was carefully safeguarded by the Commission. For the euro, however, which of our grand principles would we not allow to be sacrificed? The third is that it undermines the commitments repeatedly made to use regulation as sparingly as possible because, in being directly applied to the Member States, such regulation undermines the national parliaments’ power of transposition, which is, in fact, perfectly legitimate. The fourth and final reason is that this will lead to many rather veiled forms of unequal treatment of citizens, since the actual, but banned, costs of cross-border payments will have to be passed on to other banking products.</p>
<p class="contents">There, then, are many more reasons than are needed for rejecting this regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The current situation, in which for a payment of EUR 100 you may have to pay as much as EUR 23 bank handling charges, cannot be tolerated. Other colleagues, too, have referred to this matter. Besides, at the beginning of next year the problem will only get bigger, when twelve euro area Member States move over to euro cash. Developing the payment system and reducing the costs incurred both by banks and subsequently by consumers is therefore one of the top-priority items on the ‘urgent’ list of our Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that the Commission will agree with this target we have, but the means to achieve it differ in part from Parliament’s original wishes. Structural problems must not be solved by force. Cross-border bank charges can permanently be reduced only, and indeed only, if we are able to create technical standards for automated handling of payments in the euro area. The current high costs are caused by the fact that payments have to be processed manually. This paper chase, as old as Adam, is costing both time and money.</p>
<p class="contents">However, since there is not sufficient consensus in the banking sector so that this kind of technical standard could have been produced, Parliament has in several reports on the matter emphasised the role of the European Central Bank in the development of a payment system. In fact, Parliament did, towards the end of last year, demand that the ECP should assemble a working group of qualified experts in the field, who would be given the task to create a suitable standard. The idea of Parliament was that the group would have carried out the work during this year and a proposal would have been made public before Christmas. In this way, a new standard, binding upon all banks, would factually have existed before the euro zero hour at the turn of the year, after which the commercial banks could have implemented it at their required time schedules. This kind of arrangement would naturally have also given a competitive edge to those financial institutions, which are able to make a transfer to the new system faster than others.</p>
<p class="contents">It is regrettable that this was not achieved. Therefore, this time it is unavoidable that we have to read the Commission report, which in all respects truly is not in accordance with Parliament’s original wishes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to recall that we have been working on this issue for over 10 years, as the rapporteur rightly said, and that we have always supported self-regulation and voluntary agreements, but that in this sector it has, in the end, always been necessary to adopt legislation, in order for example to bring about quicker, more reliable and above all cheaper transfers. Here I am, of course, also thinking of the double charges which both those who made transfers and those who received them had to pay. Happily, this is now in the past, but this experience in the European Parliament taught us precisely that it is necessary to enact legislation. That is why I welcome both the tone and form of the regulation. It does not dictate prices, but it does state quite clearly that domestic and cross-border credit transfers must be treated on the same footing because we are in an internal market. This internal market requires a European payment system, and not just for large payments, like TARGET, but also for retail payments, for the transfer of small amounts.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone is affected by this: mothers or fathers who have children studying or undergoing training abroad; those of us who order books or wish to pay for a journey or a hotel in another European country. Those who have a holiday flat or even a holiday home are affected by this. All of them suffer as a result of this situation, including migrant workers who receive their wages in one country and want to send them home to their families. We need to think of them. An average of EUR 24 to transfer EUR 100 is quite simply too much and unacceptable. I strongly reject Mr Maaten's proposal. We have tried everything; now we need to make decisions. I must also say that I do not understand Mr Karas's plea. Why should a proposal be forthcoming now, in the next two or three weeks, when it has been overdue for over 15 years? I have to say also that the proposals to postpone all of this to 2005 are really unacceptable in my view. The rapporteur's argument is as far as I am prepared to go, and I therefore think that we need to secure a broad majority in favour of this long-awaited project here in Parliament, because a European payment system would have been a reality long ago if the banks and building societies had wanted it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not on for EUR 18 of bank charges to be debited for transfers of, say, EUR 100, and often this is done twice, once from the sender's account and once from the recipient's. It is not on quite simply because the financial institutions have, for some considerable time, had the technical means to carry out transfers, honour cheques and make card payments quickly and at a reasonable cost. We must be careful to ensure, however, and this has already been mentioned several times – that, as cross-border charges go down, domestic charges are not increased correspondingly. Should this be the case then, in the future, domestic charges will also have to be laid down in a regulation. We should clarify this too.</p>
<p class="contents">One snag is the fact that there are moves to postpone the deadline by two months. On this point, I am afraid that I cannot go along with the rapporteur. The banks have always been able to raise interest rates and bank charges overnight. In the space of a month and a half it will now also be possible for them to lower their charges to a standard level. I hope that there is not a majority in favour of the amendments concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, I also support all amendments which Mrs Peijs has tabled on behalf of our group. Despite this, it is regrettable that some three years following the launch of the electronic euro and on the eve of 1 January 2002, we are still having to work on a piece of legislation of this kind. It is beyond me why the banks, which otherwise find each other so promptly and efficiently in a cross-border context and are united in effective professional organisations, should be forced by law to organise themselves properly and to automate in order to be able to work more cost-effectively in the internal market, and no longer to discriminate.</p>
<p class="contents">The binding nature of the non-discrimination rule will raise a few eyebrows, but there is no alternative: leaving things as they are would be worse, for we would then accept what some small businesses and consumers fear, namely that the benefits of the euro will pass them by and that cross-border payments will continue to cost some EUR 20 each. As we cannot afford to lose the confidence of the consumers or of small businesses, we have no choice.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one concern I have, and I should like to ask the Commissioner a question in that connection. How can we prevent this Regulation from being seized by the banks as an excuse to increase the charges for domestic payments, and how does the Commission itself view this proposal? Is it being regarded as a big stick in order to get a last-minute gentlemen’s agreement out of the banks or, Commissioner, do you intend to continue to move towards a Regulation? I hope that you as Commissioner remain resolute. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, as Mrs Peijs stated a moment ago, I was standing on the same spot in this House in October last year, talking about the same issue, namely the establishment of a common payment area. The Commission had just published its fourth or fifth communication on that subject and in it, it was stipulated that the internal market and the single currency had to be accompanied by a common payment area.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament then levelled criticism at the Commission for being too passive. I remember this well. Mrs Peijs wondered when the Commission would spring into action. Well, the Commission has listened carefully to Mrs Peijs and has acted accordingly, no one will be able to deny this now. The Commission has submitted a draft Regulation which is based on a simple principle, namely that each payment in euro is to cost the same, irrespective of whether the payment is national or cross-border. This is of the utmost importance to the citizens, as has been noted by many Members of this Parliament. Today, the euro is a virtual currency, especially for the citizens, but on 1 January 2002, the currency will become tangible, for from that date onwards, 300 million Europeans will be using the same bank notes and coins.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, European citizens still accept that a cross-border payment costs more than a national one. The reason is that different currencies are involved, but after 1 January, that will no longer be the case. The citizens will then question the usefulness of the euro if cross-border payments are still as expensive as they are now.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I should like to remind you that our latest study into the cost of cross-border payments has yielded baffling results. It transpired that in the year 2001, a cross-border payment of EUR 100 costs no less than EUR 24 on average. We carried out a similar study in 1993 and unfortunately, we had to establish that no progress at all had been made in eight years. That is why the Commission has decided to introduce a Regulation as a tool. The market itself has failed to come up with solutions to the posed problem, and with this interventionist measure, the legislator wants to force the economic operators to set up the infrastructure which the market requires.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Peijs knows, I am a staunch Liberal, and I regret the fact that I had no choice but to propose such a binding document for the banks. However, it is the only way to persuade the economic operators to take great pains over the new systems which are vital for the smooth running of the internal market. It is therefore with satisfaction that I have noted that the first results are rolling in. In one section of the bank sector, the plan is now being put forward to set up a new system for cross-border payments. And that proves that the present proposal for a Regulation is also realistic. After all, the saying ‘where there is a will, there is a way’ also applies to the bank sector.</p>
<p class="contents">What took me rather by surprise is the idea of the bank sector that since they, as banks, have committed to implementing the plan, we, as Commission, can withdraw our proposal for a Regulation. Firstly, we should not overlook the fact that this plan can only count on a proportion of the bank sector. Indeed, there are three European pressure groups for banking and only one of those has written to me to propose this plan. That is an important fact. After all, a payment system is a network, and a network develops at the rate of the slowest members that belong to it. All it takes is for a few members of a network to refuse to develop any further, and that will throw a spanner in the works for the other members. That is, in fact, one of the reasons why in the past ten years, no progress has been made whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the proposed plan is too late. It was only announced in a press release two weeks prior to the discussion of the proposal in Parliament. However, the Commission has been asking for this matter to be looked into for the past eleven years, but in all that time, too little progress has been made, and for those reasons, the Commission is unable to give a positive response to those MEPs who proposed to grant the bank sector a certain level of self-regulating authority. The bank sector has had sufficient time, and it, at least a section of it, is now coming up with a proposal. It is too little, too late, and that is why the Commission must resort to the proposals of a Regulation. It is therefore illogical to demand withdrawal of the proposal just before the first benefits are becoming visible. Accordingly, the idea to suspend the Regulation, as proposed in Amendment No 9 by Mr Maaten, seems unacceptable to me. I repeat what I have said a moment ago: the proposals for self-regulation are too late.</p>
<p class="contents">Any call from the Commission to the banking world is being, or has been, backed by this Parliament, which is encouraging. In this connection, I would praise many MEPs and particularly the rapporteur, Mrs Peijs, who has worked tenaciously to achieve the goal, namely to reduce the cost of transfers. In this respect, Mrs Peijs is the mouthpiece of the citizens and illustrates the great significance for industry, not least the small- and medium-size enterprises. The Commission proposal specifically embodies what is referred to as the Europe of the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to turn to yet another bone of contention, namely the date on which the present draft Regulation should enter into force. Some MEPs have in this connection referred to the opinion of the European Central Bank which states that the ECB is in complete agreement with the objectives which we aim to achieve with our proposal, but that we, the Commission, are said to go too fast and are too demanding. The bottom line in the ECB’s argument is that the banks need more time to set up the necessary infrastructure and logistical provisions. That is why the European Central Bank proposes 1 January 2005 for the Regulation to come into force.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, I do not dispute the fact that time will be needed to set up this infrastructure, but on the other hand, we should not make a mountain out of a molehill. After all, for years, banks have claimed that cross-border payments only account for 1% of the total transfers. Consequently, the entry into force of the Regulation in 2003 will not involve insurmountable additional costs, and if our expectations are fulfilled and if it transpires that the price reduction results in a greater use of this means of payment, then there will be even more reason to go full steam ahead with the activities.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by Mrs Peijs contains sixteen amendments, seven pertaining to the recitals and nine to the articles. One single amendment is not acceptable, namely Amendment No 9 on the suspension of the Regulation which I mentioned a moment ago. One amendment constitutes a legal problem, namely Amendment No 4 on the rise in costs for domestic payments. It concerns a political statement which although I fully endorse it, does not fit in a legal document.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, in this connection, I should like to refer to the last speaker, Mrs Thijssen, who asked me whether it is possible for banks to compensate for the losses incurred with regard to international payments by national payments. As has been rightly noted, this proposed Regulation is not a price measure: indeed, the charges for transfers are not specified, and that means that, in theory, the charges for national payments could increase. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL)</span> However, an essential component of this Regulation is transparency. Banks must notify their customers of the price structure for the different types of transfers and they must also inform their customers when those prices change. That means that total transparency will apply in terms of what this is all going to cost, and the Commission assumes that, based on the normal rules of competition, the different costs for domestic payments will be kept under control and will therefore not increase.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 6 stipulates that the Member States must assume their responsibilities with regard to the application of this Regulation. The Commission can identify with the first part of the amendment. The second part, however, comes across as somewhat mysterious, and the Commission is finding it difficult to pass judgment on it at this stage. With Amendment No 10, the person who tabled this amendment hopes that the principle of non-discrimination will not apply to payment cheques. As it happens, the Commission has never wanted to promote the use of cheques and therefore agrees with the amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, rapporteur Peijs would like the entry into force of the Regulation to be postponed until 1 March 2002. That does not pose any problems for the Commission. We can thus accept that amendment. The other seven amendments are acceptable in principle, although some will need to be edited.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal will be discussed by the Internal Market Council in some ten days’ time, on 26 November. I am convinced that we will reach an agreement, not least because the European Council in Ghent has requested the Council to reach its findings promptly and has endorsed this proposal. I know that the rapporteur, Mrs Peijs, also has numerous contacts with the Council and I think she will share my feelings on this score. I should like to thank Mrs Peijs for the excellent document she has drafted and for all her efforts since 1989 to reduce the costs of cross-border payments. I hope that second reading will be nothing but a formality, in which case the text will be ready for publication in January.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to ask Mrs Thyssen a second question. She has also asked me whether the Commission is prepared to stand by its decision, and not to succumb to the pressure of the banks, and whether she considers this as a big stick. No, Mr President, this is intended as a Regulation and the Commission is thus certainly planning to adhere to its original brief and to ensure that this Regulation enters into force in March next year and that cross-border payments will cost no more than national transfers.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, allow me to thank Parliament as a whole for the sound cooperation. It shows how progress can be made if both institutions, Parliament and the Commission, are on the same wavelength. This proposal demonstrates the specific benefits of Europe to the citizen and enhances confidence in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first part of the amendment which the Commissioner mentioned remains unchanged, something which he, in fact, endorsed. We, too, thought that the second part was set out in a rather peculiar way, all the more so since it was not Parliament’s intention to set up a new institute. We have converted this part into a recital, which contains more or less the same question for redress procedures as the 1997 directive. With this, I believe that all mysterious elements have been removed, and we will thus all be able to concentrate on the second reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
