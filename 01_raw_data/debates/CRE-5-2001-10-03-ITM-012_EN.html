<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berger (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, I would like to begin by taking the opportunity to reassure Commissioner Bolkestein. We have already said in the two interventions on the Huhne Report that most of our amendments have already been withdrawn. Both of us have emphasised that here. So far as I know, there are two amendments remaining. The Commission can easily live with that and I hope the rapporteur can, too. A vote will be taken on the amendments tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to my own report, however. We know from experience in this House that the agenda is very often changed. We are often glad about that to a greater or lesser extent. This time there is a real point to it – my report was deferred so that the debate on the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan could be held yesterday. That is certainly more important than the further refinements we want to make to the internal market. It also allows us to hold a kind of joint debate today. The field of financial services, services generally and also Mr Radwan’s report, which will be debated next, go together very well.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure we all agree that services generally as well as financial services and information services deserve our special attention. They are rightly described as the key area of the European economy today. Two thirds of Europe’s workforce are already employed in the service sector. Above all, the dynamism and innovation that make this sector so important will enable us to achieve the objective set in Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">If my report has given rise to some differences of opinion, they are never about the objective, only about what we consider to be the most appropriate means of achieving that objective. I am sure we can support the Commission’s approach of identifying all the barriers in a first phase, listing all the obstacles encountered by service providers, and then in a second phase proposing suitable remedies. But we have no time to lose. We now have the remedy of treaty infringement proceedings. In many cases, better information from authorities, professional bodies and similar institutions about the law as it currently stands could perhaps help to remove some unjustified obstacles.</p>
<p class="contents">In all but one of the urgent legislative measures listed by the Commission – I have to admit it is the reform of public contracting – Parliament has not been responsible for any undue delay on any other points. The call for certain legislative measures to be speeded up should therefore be addressed primarily to the Council. I have already mentioned that we have now at last received the common position on the distance marketing of financial services. Discussions in the Council took a very long time. I hope we can make up some of the lost ground in Parliament and make rapid progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Something else that has already been before the Council for a very long time is the two directives on the situation of third country citizens when it comes to providing services – employees on the one hand and self-employed on the other, where the introduction of a service provision card could make a major contribution to achieving freedom in the provision of services. I am also sorry that the Commission itself no longer lists these measures as priority measures in this communication today.</p>
<p class="contents">Essentially, our differences of opinion are over which legal instruments will be suitable. We should not rule any instrument out. We will need further harmonisation. I am sure we will be able to implement the country-of-origin principle on the basis of harmonised, coordinated, largely approximated laws in our Member States. Article 50 of the EC Treaty will probably also continue to be used in a number of remaining areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I do, of course have a problem when harmonisation is automatically described as over-regulation and when the country-of-origin principle is to be used as a magic bullet, the cure all to solve every problem at a stroke. Unfortunately, things are not like that. We have to go this laborious way of finding the appropriate instrument for every problem that arises. I would again like to point out that even in the <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce directive – important as the role of the country-of-origin principle is there, and I fully support the content of that directive – the regulating principle is not the only one to apply.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments that have been tabled for tomorrow follow two principles: preserving freedom of choice of legal instruments, not confining ourselves to one instrument, and not making any sector-specific changes. That is also in line with the Commission’s wishes, since it deliberately wanted to present a document applicable to all sectors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am very glad that the European Parliament is now about to take a decision on supporting the Commission’s proposed strategy for creating an internal market for services. The need for this is enormous – for economic growth, for the advancement of companies, for employment and for consumers. An internal market for services has for a long time been a missing element in a European growth policy, a policy which must also be supplemented by measures to speed up the liberalisation process in sectors such as postal services, electricity and energy – something which cannot be said too often.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s overall course of action is good. We cannot continue with sectoral regulation of services, something which has so far proved to hinder, rather than facilitate, the creation of an internal market. Ninety-nine per cent of European companies are small and medium-sized. These employ 66 per cent of workers and generate 55 per cent of turnover. Bearing in mind the significance of these companies for the European economy, it is necessary for them to be able to benefit fully from the internal market for services – a market which quite simply cannot function well without them. It is also important that the candidate countries should be involved as soon as possible. What is known as the enlarged internal market for services must also be well prepared.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in order for this work to be a success, the Commission must not be left alone. <span class="italic">We </span>have a major responsibility here in Parliament, but the Member States too have a great responsibility to involve themselves in the process and to work at political, legislative and administrative levels to remove obstacles to the exchange of services. Without political will at all levels, the goal cannot be achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Harbour (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Berger very much for her clear statement of support for this proposal this evening. Those of you who have looked at the report will know that she withdrew her original explanatory statement. I was delighted to hear this evening that she had confirmed her full support.</p>
<p class="contents">This report, with the support of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and my colleague, Mr Beysen, and with Mrs Berger's assistance also, now strikes the right balance by giving the Commission a clear indication of the support of our committee and others for this important initiative. I am delighted that Mrs Berger is going with the flow of that for many of us felt that her initial report really did not do full justice to what we regard as an imaginative proposal, a wide-ranging proposal, and one that is of crucial economic importance to the future of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not ignore the continual structural change in the world economies, in particular in developed economies like the European Union. We are seeing services and manufacturing business starting to converge. We are seeing more integration of traditional service providers, with their manufacturing arms looking to focus on customers in a very different way. Therefore, opening up the single market for services is going to be of great importance.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing I particularly welcome from the Commission's analysis – something it has indicated in the report that it will now do more work on – is that it highlights the importance of a highly competitive service infrastructure in the overall competitiveness of European industry. So many businesses depend on high-quality, effective, low-cost, efficient services to deliver their businesses. Indeed the whole of the electronic commerce area, which we talked about in financial services earlier on, is facilitating and opening up these sorts of markets. Therefore, this communication is extremely welcome. We look forward, in the Legal Affairs Committee as well as in the Industry Committee, to working with the Commission and to moving forward with the necessary legal framework and the other actions that will be necessary to achieve it.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to reinforce what Mrs Grönfeldt Bergman said about the role of the small- and medium-sized enterprises in this sector. Again we are seeing the combination of increasing importance of services combined with electronic commerce and the electronic means of delivering those services. That is an area, particularly crucial in the business-to-business sector, where small- and medium-sized enterprises have a crucial role to play in the European economy. Again, these provisions will help. I refer back to the country-of-origin principle. I share Mrs Berger's view that by a happy coincidence we have a set of reports tonight with a common thread running through them.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not regard the country-of-origin principle as a magic bullet to achieve market integration at a single stroke. Clearly there is a lot of work to be done. Yet, by operating the country-of-origin principle vigorously and consistently we will actually achieve competition and higher standards for consumers more quickly than by any other means. Consumers are going to be well-informed and intelligent enough to know where the best standards of consumer protection are. They are going to demand them from other countries. This is not a question of harmonising down. It is an effective means of making the market operate in the interests of consumers, which is exactly what Commissioner Monti told us in addressing the competition report earlier on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will also improve the competitiveness of European industry and will provide more benefits to the consumers who will be offered a whole series of high-quality competitive services.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore of the opinion that it is of crucial importance for the internal market strategy to build on the strength of the <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce directive and the principle of mutual recognition. Mutual recognition forms the keystone of the European Union and the European internal market, in particular. Mutual recognition is only possible if the consumer enjoys equivalent protection right across the Union. This means that harmonisation is only required if this equivalent protection does not exist. Furthermore, a business based in the Union is guaranteed completely free cross-border trade in services.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the report, as it has now been approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, after inserting, inter alia, a number of amendments which I myself tabled, reflects and supports the Commission’s balanced approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am delighted to find out that the Commission adopted a regulation on sales stimulation yesterday. This shows that the Commission is really serious about further developing the internal market. In the current economic climate, we cannot afford to lose momentum in the direction of a real internal market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, firstly the Commission would like to emphasise the economic and political importance of its communication on a new internal market strategy for services, which I hope, will henceforth enjoy the European Parliament's full support.</p>
<p class="contents">A functioning internal market in services, far from being a reality, remains an objective to be achieved. It is an objective which ought to be considered a priority if we really want the European economy to become the most competitive in the world by the end of this decade – the ambition we set ourselves in March 2000 in Lisbon. Just to quote a single fact, services account for two-thirds of the European economy and, therefore, any progress we make on that front will greatly benefit the citizens of this continent.</p>
<p class="contents">Achieving that goal is rendered all the important by the growing dynamic of the information society, with all its potential for cross-border trade, and by the imminent introduction of the euro, which will increase the transparency of costs and encourage businesses and consumers to look beyond national boundaries for the provision of services.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, at present there are still too many legal and administrative obstacles preventing our businesses and consumers from considering the whole of the European Community as their true domestic market. That means that we are failing to realise the enormous potential for growth and establish a framework in which millions of new jobs can be created.</p>
<p class="contents">At no other time in our recent history has it been more important to encourage entrepreneurship, innovation and opportunity. Just as the 1992 campaign enabled us to focus on – and to a large extent achieve – an internal market in goods, it is now crucial for us to concentrate on dismantling the barriers to trade and services. This new strategy seeks, above all to enable two groups – namely small and medium-sized enterprises and consumers – to reap the full benefits of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">In many instances, small and medium-sized enterprises – which Mr Harbour and Mr Beysen have mentioned also evening – will not have the means to establish themselves in all or several Member States. If they try to do so, they will be faced with the need to expand their infrastructure and with extra financial and administrative burdens. Therefore, they must be allowed to offer their services freely throughout the Community from their establishment.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as consumers are concerned, this strategy is designed above all for them. We shall not have succeeded until European consumers have greater access to and a wider choice of, safe and reliable services at more competitive prices, and that means there must be more competition between service providers. The strategy is the first attempt to apply, at Community level, a horizontal approach to trade and services since the General Programme for the removal of barriers to services of 1962 was introduced almost forty years ago. It calls for the cooperation and support of national authorities, the participation of all interested parties and the active engagement of the Community institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has highlighted many of the difficult issues preventing an effective internal market in services from functioning. I am delighted that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market shares the Commission's philosophy and supports its ambitious approach. I also hope to be able to count on the full support of the European Parliament in implementing both the first and second phases of the strategy. The first phase is now being carried out. This means that existing restrictions to the freedom to provide services and the freedom of establishment are being identified and evaluated. In the second phase, legal and operational instruments for the elimination of barriers will be put in place and our approach will be based on harmonisation, assuring a high level of consumer protection combined with the principles of country of origin and mutual recognition enshrined in the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, the Commission would not welcome the newly tabled amendments. Those amendments appear to run counter to the principles of mutual recognition and country of origin and, in the Commission's view, would undermine the positive and well-balanced approach of the report, for which the Commission is duly grateful. I should like to thank Mrs Berger on behalf of the Commission for having drafted that report. The Commission feels that the newly tabled amendments would significantly weaken the support of the European Parliament for the proposed internal market approach.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I refer to the earlier discussion between Mrs Berger, Mr Harbour and Mr Beysen on the various merits and demerits of harmonisation, mutual recognition and the country of origin. Large-scale harmonisation may waste time, prove unnecessarily bureaucratic and divert political goodwill and attention away from the key issues that Member States should agree on. It may also contravene the subsidiarity principle in the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, it must be admitted that harmonisation may be necessary where there is a need to establish a high level of protection, notably for consumers. Mutual recognition, on the other hand, can be made to work more satisfactorily if it is implemented through secondary Community legislation which clearly identifies the areas in which mutual recognition must be accepted. Both principles have their merits and demerits, but by and large I am inclined to agree with Mr Harbour's view that the quickest way of achieving an adequate level of protection for the consumer is to adopt the country-of-origin principle.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, may I thank Mr Beysen for his kind remarks on the sales promotion directive adopted by the Commission this week. Lastly may I apologise to Mrs Berger for having omitted previously to thank her on the Commission's behalf for having withdrawn almost all of the amendments tabled on the previous matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
