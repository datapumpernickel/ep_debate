<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">David Martin, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span>– Madam President, today, my strong recommendation to this House is that we reject the ACTA Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">At the outset of this debate though, let me make it clear that, unlike some, I do not criticise the Commission for bringing forward this proposal. It is their role as the institution with the right of initiative to do so. But the role of Parliament has been strengthened under the Lisbon Treaty and it is our job to scrutinise international agreements and to give them or deny them our consent.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last three or four months, I have carefully studied the text. I have spoken to the officials who have negotiated this agreement. I have spoken to the rights holders that it seeks to protect, and I have engaged with civil society organisations who have serious concerns about this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally have come to the conclusion that there are serious flaws and serious concerns about the way that this agreement could be misinterpreted and implemented. Therefore, as rapporteur, I cannot recommend that the Parliament gives it its approval.</p>
<p class="contents">Before, I have described myself as the accidental rapporteur. I genuinely came to this report with no agenda on ACTA and, if anything, I was probably regarded as having a pro-IPR agenda. I know of authors and musicians who are far from wealthy and who depend on the protection of their creations to make a living.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have said before, creativity is the raw material of the European Union. In September 2011, we were here debating the EU 2020 strategy and the future of trade policy. Protecting European intellectual property is a key part of that. We cannot compete globally as a low-wage economy and we should not try. Protecting our innovation and creative industries is vital for job creation and for economic recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">But this is not a vote about the general importance of IPR. It is a vote on the text of the ACTA Treaty. I have listened to civil society’s concerns on this agreement and, while some of the perceived threats of ACTA were perhaps exaggerated or unfounded, I am convinced that there are some key problems with the treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is a lack of clear definition of ‘commercial scale’. ACTA refers to ‘commercial activities for direct or indirect economic or commercial advantage’. But what exactly is ‘indirect commercial advantage’. What if one person copies a piece of music or a film and gives it to a friend, who gives it to another friend, and so on. Is that ‘commercial scale’, or is that simple private usage? I know the Commission will say that it is not ‘commercial scale’ because commercial scale is defined in European law. But ‘commercial scale’ is not defined in the ACTA Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also possible that ACTA could unintentionally criminalise individuals if we do not have a clear and precise definition of ‘commercial scale’. I also have related concerns to the sanctions contained in the ACTA Treaty which appear sometimes to be excessive in terms of the civil and criminal penalties.</p>
<p class="contents">The third major area of concern I have is the role of Internet service providers (ISPs). Provisions which might push ISPs to monitor online behaviour and report individuals for IPR infringement is very dangerous. It is not the role of ISPs to police the Internet, and we should not be privatising law enforcement in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had many debates in this Chamber on international agreements. I have often said that the devil is in the detail. This time, the devil is in the lack of detail. Rights holders in the creative and manufacturing industries are voracious in pursuing their rights, often understandably so when you see the level of counterfeit and piracy they face.</p>
<p class="contents">But this means that a vague text is dangerous. We cannot guarantee that civil liberties will be robustly protected by the ACTA Treaty provisions. When it comes down to protecting intellectual property rights or protecting civil liberties, civil liberties should always be central to the concern of this House.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karel De Gucht, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Madam President, honourable Members, tomorrow, you will have to make a choice. It is an important choice for at least two reasons. Firstly, because the debate over the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement has involved much discussion of its relationship with the fundamental rights and freedoms of European citizens. Secondly, because of the signal this vote will send to our trading partners and to the more than 120 million workers that work in Europe’s innovative, manufacturing and creative sectors. They are dependent for their livelihoods on the effective enforcement of intellectual property rights, in Europe and across the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has asked the European Court of Justice for its opinion on whether the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement is compatible with the treaties and, in particular, with our Charter of Fundamental Rights. We have done this because these questions are crucial for those who took to the streets over ACTA earlier this year. We share their view that these concerns must be addressed. That is why the ACTA agreement should be the subject of the most careful scrutiny and deliberation.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I believe that it would have been preferable for Parliament to wait until we know what the Court thinks before voting. But that is not where we are today. Tomorrow, you will only be able to choose to vote ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the agreement. Let me then just say that my considered view, as a lifelong supporter of human rights and fundamental freedoms, is that there is nothing to fear in this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">ACTA is not an attack on our liberties, it is a defence of our livelihoods. This is because we do not have to modify any part of our internal legislation, the so-called <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. What is legal today in the European Union will remain legal once ACTA is ratified. And what is illegal today will still remain illegal with ACTA. Nothing changes in the eyes of the law. And since our freedoms are not threatened by our current laws, our freedoms will not be threatened by ACTA. This is also – I might add – the view of the European Parliament’s own Legal Service. I hope that you will bear these considerations in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Economic consequences are the second reason the vote is important. We all agree that counterfeiting and piracy are a serious problem. They risk undermining one of Europe’s most significant competitive advantages over other regions of the world, namely, our knowledge-based and creative industries. ACTA is designed to extend the tools for enforcement of intellectual property rights that have been so successful in Europe – and which this Parliament has always supported – to other countries as well. No more. No less.</p>
<p class="contents">So, as you come to make your choice about how to vote tomorrow, you should also make no mistake: a vote against ACTA will be a setback for the protection of our intellectual property rights around the world. Neither are there any quick fixes for its rejection. Those who think that we can come back any time soon with a revised agreement or with a new treaty have been misled. What is true is that, if Parliament votes this treaty down, the Commission will continue to wait for the opinion of the Court and study it closely. Why? Because citizens have raised concerns over its potential impact on fundamental rights, because many of you have raised similar questions – so let us get some answers.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider it my obligation, my responsibility as European Commissioner – indeed the responsibility of us all – to ask for clarity from Europe’s highest court. Furthermore, we will also look at how the debate on intellectual property rights evolves over the coming months. There are legitimate issues to be discussed and clarified about some rules on intellectual property rights in the digital environment. For instance, the definition of ‘commercial scale’ and what sharing information means in relation to the challenges one faces with respect to the protection of intellectual property.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that these discussions will be able to happen in their proper context – which is in debates about the substantive law of the European Union, not about international enforcement.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides the European Parliament, the Commission would also discuss the outcome of the Court referral with other signatories of ACTA and would then consider further steps to take.</p>
<p class="contents">As Europeans, I believe that we all share profound respect for individual freedom. But I also know that freedom needs a framework. What we are doing both with ACTA and with European legislation is making sure that the framework strikes the right balance. It is a delicate task and we must proceed carefully. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Committee favoured a negative position on this agreement. I, as rapporteur, was more favourable towards it, but I have to respect the majority opinion, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I must add a few comments on this. In my opinion, there is a clear majority in this Parliament that simply wants to reject this agreement, and for a variety of reasons. I have to say it is rather illogical that Parliament has decided not to wait for the opinion of the European Court of Justice on the compatibility of this agreement with European primary law. I frankly do not understand this, and I would consider it far more logical to wait.</p>
<p class="contents">I take things as they are, however, and since the Committee on Development has adopted a negative opinion, I have no option as rapporteur but to reproduce that opinion here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For those of us who have been involved in the information policy debate for a long time, the decision that this House will take tomorrow is not only symbolic of what is right and proper in the information age, it is also crucial for European democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Communication and culture build societies. It is no surprise, therefore, that ACTA was the issue that generated the pan-European debate that caught our attention and that caused many people to consider how we as a society actually want to deal with communication.</p>
<p class="contents">It was on this very issue that I and many others in my political party, the Pirate Party, found a reason for our involvement in politics. The problem is that the agreement does not change anything. We need more access to culture and communication. How do we actually want to relate to other people? How do we build a sense of community and familiarity with other people?</p>
<p class="contents">All of us who consider these questions and who are helping to build these communities hope that Parliament will be strong when it takes the decision tomorrow – we hope that Parliament will listen to all of Europe’s citizens when they speak with one voice because our societies need to be founded on the values of the citizens. It is clear that citizens’ values involve making communication and cultural exchange a priority and an opportunity for the future, and that is something that I and my political group here in Parliament, together with many other colleagues from other political groups, will recognise in the votes tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, ACTA is a prime example of how we should not be dealing with the justified concerns of citizens, in other words, with a lack of transparency that has to be seen to be believed.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many serious reservations about ACTA. The Committee on Legal Affairs has taken these reservations into account and has made clear its opposition to ACTA. The intention of the agreement is to intervene in data protection and, therefore, in the right to informational self-determination. The agreement is too vague and, as a result, I am concerned that it may be implemented differently in the relevant states, which will be to the detriment of our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I am opposed to Internet service providers being able to monitor citizens and, under certain circumstances, actually doing so. I am concerned that the necessary renewal of copyright in Europe will be restricted and forestalled under pressure from the industry.

However, we must not accept and cannot allow basic fundamental rights in Europe and the rest of the world to be eroded. The European Union – and I must emphasise this – has established very high levels of protection for fundamental rights and the European Parliament must be in the front line of efforts to maintain those high levels, for the benefit, as always, of European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely within this spirit that we arrived in our opinion at the conclusion that ACTA is not compatible with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, especially in light of its ambiguity. We therefore recommend that the House reject this ambiguous agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to underline this: rejection of ACTA should not mark the end of the affair.

<p class="contents">We need international cooperation in order to defend intellectual property rights, to put a stop to counterfeit medicines and vehicle parts, to stop violations of European patents and piracy of European products and to safeguard Europe’s competitiveness. ACTA is a good basis for this work.</p>
<p class="contents">It would, however, be irresponsible to vote on ACTA tomorrow – to take a position before we have all of the cards on the table and before the European Court of Justice has issued its opinion on the agreement. This is not a reasonable and responsible way to deal with this issue. I would like to ask all those who are opposed to waiting for the Court of Justice just one thing: why? What is it that you are so afraid the Court of Justice will say that you feel it is necessary, at all costs, to vote before the EU’s highest judicial body has expressed its opinion?</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow’s vote is not just about ACTA. It is about patient safety, research, air safety, competitiveness, the environment, job security, etc., as these areas are all affected by piracy, patent violations and counterfeiting.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, voting ‘no’ tomorrow carries a great deal of responsibility. It may perhaps resolve the conflict regarding ACTA, but it will not represent a solution to the problems and challenges that Europe is facing. Voting ‘no’ will not maintain the status quo either. It will weaken Europe’s voice on the world stage. How are we to be able to convince India to take forceful action against counterfeit medicines if we ourselves have rejected European or international cooperation based on our own legislation?</p>
<p class="contents">It is no surprise to me that those in this House who do not want intellectual property rights or who do not believe we should protect intellectual property rights will vote against ACTA before we have the Court’s opinion, in the same way as it is no surprise that someone who does not want Europe to fight against climate change does not want the Kyoto Protocol either. However, I do not believe that reflects the opinion of the majority of us in this House, and therefore I hope you will not want to put an end to ACTA before we have all the cards on the table. Why is that? Well, we need international cooperation on intellectual property rights in order to protect European jobs, consumers, patients, etc. That is why we should not discard ACTA tomorrow.</p>

We in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have analysed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) very closely and carefully, and we would like to make it clear that ACTA is not a suitable instrument for guaranteeing copyright protection and preventing counterfeiting. ACTA is the wrong instrument for this and, therefore, we in the S&amp;D Group will be voting against it. Why is that? For three reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the countries which are mainly responsible for counterfeiting and disregarding copyright are not the subject of the agreement. The good have been sorted out from the bad and, in international terms, it makes absolutely no sense.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, ladies and gentlemen, rules from the analogue area of counterfeiting have been transferred into the digital world and, as a result, the wrong rules are being imposed on consumers who behave differently in a digital environment. This is why we are saying that we cannot put apples and pears into a saucepan and finish up with apple sauce. The wrong things are being combined here and that is the second reason why we are opposed to ACTA.</p>
<p class="contents">However, ladies and gentlemen, the most important reason is the third one. ACTA is putting the digital world into a straitjacket and we do not even know whether we want it, because the question of enforcing intellectual property rights on the Internet, in the digital environment, has not even been resolved within the European Union. The Commission’s presentation of its legislative proposal is overdue. How can we conclude an international agreement in this area if we have not even discussed the legislative proposal within the European Union and drafted some sensible legislation? Therefore, let us put ACTA to one side and, first of all, draw up a sensible European law. I call on the Commission to submit a legislative proposal for the European Union.</p>

The Commission decided to go ahead and sign straight away, assuring us that everything was fine, only to subsequently turn to the Court of Justice and receive a worrying warning from the EU privacy supervisor.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, citizens in the EU mobilised in an unprecedented way, with 2.8 million signatures, whilst many entrepreneurs have reacted cautiously with regard to the future of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), precisely because they believe that existing laws can protect them just as effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that there are two lessons in this, and I hope that the Commission will learn from them with regard to the next measures announced by the Commissioner. The first lesson is that the Web is now considered by European citizens to be a real common good, like biodiversity or water. It is considered a space for individual freedom that must not be threatened by any kind of measure. In Washington, Senator Wyden, Chair of the Subcommittee on International Trade, whom I visited last February, told us that with ACTA, experiences such as <span class="italic">Wikipedia</span> might have not come into being. I do not know if this statement corresponds to the truth, but we must also adopt the precautionary principle.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we cannot implement important measures without the citizens’ approval, and there is a need for debate, which so far has been clearly insufficient. I think this should be understood and, if we do not understand it, I believe we will not go very far in today’s Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I became familiar with ACTA just after I was elected. I have followed this agreement as shadow rapporteur in a thousand debates in committee, in plenary, – and I have to say the Commission has always shown a very loyal and cooperative attitude – in interviews and in debates with civil society. I do not know if this will be the last debate. I must say that we will certainly be ready for further discussion and, Commissioner, I really do not hope that we will be able to say <span class="italic">‘acta est fabula’</span>, the play is over. This is in the public interest, in the interest of freedom of expression and, I must say, in the interest of the European institutions’ image as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">More than two years ago, we sat here together and I explained to you quite clearly, I warned you, that Parliament would vote against an international agreement once again unless you looked into its questions and requirements.</p>

Of course I am of the opinion that there are indeed ways of guaranteeing that intellectual property rights are enforced on an international level. I believe that it is very important to understand why the developing and emerging economies have been refusing to cooperate with us for such a long time in the international organisations, including the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), and perhaps to consider exceptions for generics and technology transfer, because coming to an agreement on international regulations is not a one-sided process.</p>

<p class="contents">There were concerns right across the House on transparency; there were concerns on the issue of fundamental rights and civil rights for citizens and I think some of those issues would have been dealt with by the European Court of Justice. I think we also have to be quite clear that many of the laws about the Internet which are worrying us actually come from national governments. The ‘three strikes and you are out’, for example, and some of the American proposals on the Internet have nothing to do with ACTA.</p>
<p class="contents">These are national governments that have brought in these measures but I think there is also an important distinction to be made. In his book ‘Free’, Chris Anderson, the editor of ‘Wired’, makes a distinction between the world of atoms and the world of bits. He says that in a world of increased processing power, increased bandwidth and increased storage, the price of digital products tends towards zero and therefore he proposes new business models for digital products.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem with that view is that people should be allowed to give away and share if they want but, at the same time, we should not prevent those who want to use intellectual property and make money out of intellectual property from being allowed to do so. We should allow both business models to be able to coexist.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, my real concern about this is that many political groups wanted a referral to the ECJ. We pushed the Commission for a referral to the ECJ but, when the Commission actually goes ahead and listens to us and refers to the ECJ, what do we do? We move the goal posts and we complain about a referral to the ECJ and we ask for rejection. I actually think that is quite dishonourable and we will not be taken seriously if we continue to act in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say, as someone who is concerned about European integration, that in some way, I welcome the undermining of the ECJ in this way because the ECJ has been one of the greatest pushers for European integration. If you are going to set that precedent, I thank you, but let us focus on the issue at hand. Let us not move the goal posts when we have asked for a referral in the first place. The most honourable thing to have done would have been to wait for the referral to the ECJ and wait for the ECJ to rule. In fact, the ECJ’s ruling may even have given you ammunition against those who are against ACTA. I welcome any blue cards at this stage. Bring it on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They came to the conclusion that they do not want or need ACTA. They are concerned that ACTA represents a threat to their freedom in the digital world. They are also worried about issues of central data protection.</p>
<p class="contents">We have learnt during the course of this debate that the Internet has brought a new dimension to democracy and to our lives. It has become an important aspect of the way in which democracy in the European Union functions, particularly over recent weeks and months. The citizens are pinning all their hopes on the European Parliament and relying on it to defend their interests against the Commission, which has negotiated this agreement, Mr De Gucht, with a mandate from the Council over a period of six years. Two years ago, we insisted that more transparency was needed and we succeeded in bringing the secret ACTA negotiations into the light of day. Now we must not postpone this debate. We must come to a decision. We do not need to wait for the Court of Justice of the European Union, because this concerns the content of the agreement, as other Members have already said. We must decide now.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this is about a quite different dimension. We must all work together to bring about change. We live in an age when the ways in which information and knowledge are used are becoming increasingly separated from the concept of private property. We need to develop new structures that will equate to a new legal culture concerning the access to and use of content. Children must acquire an understanding of this area in school. This is the content of the debate about ACTA and it also applies to the debate about the future development of patents, copyright, international trade and economic cooperation in a multilateral and networked world. We also need to discuss this on a multilateral basis with China, Brazil and many other countries within the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) and to come to an agreement about it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr De Gucht, I believe that you are not certain about or fully aware of the revolutionary impact of the Internet. In the case of ACTA, you are continuing to defend a business model from a period in the past when most people still went to a shop to buy records. At that time, it was mainly big non-European companies such as Sony that were making large amounts of money and they treated their artists as if they owned them. Anyone who defends this sort of monopoly is failing to support the interests of the artists. I hope that tomorrow’s vote will be a good moment for democracy and for the importance of the European Parliament and that it will allow us to put an end to ACTA. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we all know, this matter has caused not just debate and discussion, but also mass street protests in many of the countries of Europe and other parts of the world. It was conspicuous that the protesters were mainly young people, people who are particularly sensitive to the vulnerability of fundamental rights, including the rights to information, liberty and privacy. The sense of being under threat and the feelings which emerged when this document was being considered were also influenced by the difficult situation in which the younger generation finds itself, and by the social context, mass unemployment and low pay. The history we are witnessing has also revealed the citizens’ overwhelming lack of trust in the democratically elected authorities of particular countries and of the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The greatest outrage has been caused not just by the content of the agreement itself, but also by the way it was introduced and the circumstances under which this was done, including the lack of real public consultations. This caused understandable suspicion and anger, particularly among young people. We should learn the right lessons from this bitter experience, and should look again at the serious and real problem of protecting intellectual property rights – a problem which none of us treats lightly. The paradox here is that the way forward and the way to change and correct this situation is to reject the document at tomorrow’s vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In keeping with my opposition in France to the bureaucratic censorship authority, Hadopi, which is a sort of French version of ACTA and which has already shown real shortcomings – particularly technical shortcomings – in its fight against piracy of protected works, I will vote for this recommendation, which aims to put an end to this umpteenth freedom destroying project, this time on an international scale, for ACTA is most definitely a freedom destroying, internationalist project. Under the guise of wanting to combat counterfeiting, ACTA’s repressive logic with regard to individuals would surely lead to Internet censorship while threatening access to culture for the weakest of our fellow citizens to the sole benefit of large private groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, allow me to offer another perspective, because if we are surrounded by counterfeit or poor quality products in Europe, is that not primarily because our countries are actually paying the price for Europeanist policies and internationalist and ultraliberal dogma? Is it not also the fault of the Commission, which still believes, despite the terrible financial, economic and social crisis we are facing today, that our borders should remain open to the four winds of brutal and unfair competition?</p>

Millions of consumers in Europe have had difficulties with counterfeit products and tens of thousands of jobs have been lost as a result, but the majority in this House is on the point of rejecting ACTA. We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) have always said that we want a proper evaluation of ACTA and that we are only in favour of ACTA if it does not change anything for Europeans living in Europe. That is still true today. I advise every Member of this House to look again at the two legal reports from our independent parliamentary Legal Service which, in my opinion, come to a very clear conclusion about ACTA.</p>
<p class="contents">For us in the PPE Group, the freedom of the Internet is one of the most important issues. Yesterday afternoon, it once again became clear who is actually fighting for the cause of freedom every day in this House, when we were discussing the agenda for this part-session and the groups which are allegedly in favour of freedom in the context of ACTA expressed their opposition to a debate on the breaches of the constitution and the intolerable situation in Romania. Ladies and gentlemen, what happened yesterday to your campaign for freedom and human rights in the European Union? I would like to see you taking a much more consistent and uniform position in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">My concern with regard to this discussion on ACTA is the way we deal with one another in an open democracy. I very much welcome the wide-ranging public debate. It should have taken place earlier and there should also be debates of this kind on other topics. I am also very pleased by the immense dedication of the younger generation who have shown an incredibly strong interest in and commitment to this subject. However, I found the disinformation campaign staged by some opponents intolerable, in particular, at the start of the debate on ACTA. We all remember the anonymous video containing a number of invented untruths which was made available on the net. This amounted to an attack on democracy. For this reason, I would like us to treat one another with respect, in particular in the light of the latest press release issued by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and by Mr Swoboda accusing us of a lack of transparency and of deception.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we have never asked for a secret vote, neither in committee nor here in this House. We have always said that we are in favour of postponing the matter, so that the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Commission have more time to complete their homework. However, it was Members from the S&amp;D Group and the Liberals who came up to me personally and said that they were in favour of ACTA, but that the pressure in their groups was so great that they needed my help. Nevertheless, we still did not ask for a secret vote.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We have always been quite clear about the fact that we want to keep ACTA alive. We want to put it to rights and improve it, not kill it off. It is your group which is exerting the pressure on its Members and not allowing a free vote in committee and also here in plenary. Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you to remain democratic and to open up the vote in your group so that every Member of this House has the opportunity to vote tomorrow according to his or her convictions.</p>

I have to ask myself where the Members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) were 18 months ago when we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance asked for the compatibility of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) to be evaluated by the Court of Justice. I have repeatedly said this to you too, Mr De Gucht. If this had happened, we would have had an opinion and a result from the Court of Justice today, the day before the vote. You are clearly applying double standards and, as Mr Leichtfried has said, this is nothing more than an attempt to postpone the issue, as you do not want ACTA to be rejected because it is wrong in political terms.</p>

First of all, we have our own methods. We have the parliamentary Legal Service which has issued a clear statement on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). The question is not whether it was right or wrong for the Commission to go before the Court of Justice of the European Union. The Commission has done this and it is a question of respecting other institutions, which means allowing them to give us their opinion. I think it is very important for us to ensure that the Court of Justice has the necessary time.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, my group has never said that it is unreservedly in favour of ACTA. We have always made it clear, most recently in April at a large press conference, that we also want the situation to be clarified once again. Unfortunately, the Commission informed us far too late, not until the Wednesday evening before the vote in committee, that it was prepared to make these improvements.</p>
<p class="contents">In this case, the question is that when a patient goes to hospital with a minor cold, he deserves a proper diagnosis and he also deserves to be cured and not to be left to die. We want to cure ACTA and not to kill it off and that is the political difference between us.</p>

No, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has never changed its position. I would, however, like to mention that at the beginning of this parliamentary term, when one of our fellow Members, Kader Arif, was coordinator of the Committee on International Trade (INTA), he led the S&amp;D Group, along with others, to present a resolution here warning against ACTA because we thought that this agreement had been poorly negotiated, that it was filled with ambiguities, and so on, and Mr Martin has defended this today. This resolution was put to the vote in Parliament and it was not passed; it is a non-resolution. It did not receive enough votes. The warning at the beginning of this parliamentary term was never heeded in this Chamber. What has happened since then? Civil society has spoken. We have had e-mails, e-mail campaigns, discussions, forums, and so on and, suddenly, our MEPs who did not vote, who distrusted ACTA at the beginning of this parliamentary term, will probably vote against ACTA today. That is interesting.</p>
<p class="contents">We saw a similar case before: software patenting, with the Rocard report, two parliamentary terms ago I think, was swept up by the power of civil society. When civil society speaks, when direct democracy gets started and comes together with parliamentary democracy, then we have an extremely interesting equation which allows us to overcome problems.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what is happening today and that is what is interesting, my friends. When citizens understand, they act. It is up to us to make them understand. Now, we are against counterfeiting. There is still some way to go in this area, but I am pleased that tomorrow we will reject ACTA with an alliance between Parliament and civil society. That will be a red-letter day. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This made it clear that dignity, the freedom to exchange information, the right to privacy and the protection of personal data, as well as freedom of expression, are not empty words, but are recognised as being basic rights in the EU, which should be fully respected in order to strike a balance with the protection of intellectual property.</p>

I very much agree we need measures to counter piracy and protect intellectual property, which is vital to business, but I cannot support this ACTA. It is not acceptable in its current form. It is too catch-all. Whilst the thrust of the agreement is worthy, the devil is in the detail. In the detail, we find that Internet service providers will be forced to spy on all their customers, Chinese-state style, becoming legally responsible for pirated files. Search engines could be closed for aiding and abetting.</p>
<p class="contents">In this ACTA, we have what I call ‘pre-crime’, as in the movie <span class="italic">Minority Report</span>, where you can have your PCCs on the mere suspicion of infringement. You have a loose definition of commercial scale, which could see many law-abiding citizens prosecuted for very low-key usage. You have customs officers able to go through your files at airports, and we have this unaccountable ACTA committee which has the power to make changes without referring back to this Parliament or others.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I support the aim but I do not support the detail of ACTA.</p>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, when you spoke at the Committee on International Trade two weeks ago, you effectively said that, regardless of how Parliament votes tomorrow, the Commission would try to push ahead, regardless of what the result is. That represents a complete contempt for democracy, but at least you have been consistent in that contempt throughout this whole process of ACTA. In your letter to MEPs, dated 26 January, you accused those protesting against ACTA of basing their action on – and I quote – ‘misinformation, or possibly even worse, wilful misinterpretation of the content of the agreement’. What an outrageous statement! Who needs democracy and debate in society when we have the European Commission to tell us what is what. If there was any misinterpretation, if there is any misinformation, then that is due to the complete lack of transparency and the deliberate ambiguity contained in this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike you, I applaud the anti-ACTA campaigners, the thousands who have taken to the streets, the tens of thousands who sent e-mails, the millions of people who have signed petitions. If ACTA is defeated tomorrow, it will be thanks to those campaigners. However, the struggle against ACTA and measures like ACTA will continue, as is clear from the Commission’s attitude. We will continue to fight it, today, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, and to struggle for a society and an economy based on the free exchange of information, knowledge and research for the benefit of all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

European businesses lose EUR 250 billion each year, while 100 000 jobs are lost every year. Ultimately, ACTA does not establish new intellectual property rights, it is simply a question of the proportional implementation (see Article 6) of measures intended to combat the counterfeiting of physical goods.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 27, the only article on the digital environment, has sparked a campaign of misinformation on the Internet and has misled public opinion, leading people to believe that there would be so-called ‘individual criminalisation’ or controls on Internet service providers.</p>

Why immense? Because it has created the suspicion that access to the Web, which is a great modern revolution, would really be inhibited.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is this? Because it has made the mistake of lumping together counterfeiting and piracy, which are two totally different issues. The way to combat counterfeiting has nothing to do with copyright. Then there is another mistake, in that it has excluded Parliament from an important activity that it has been doing for some time: creating a new copyright, although some people would like to retain the old copyright law, which existed before the Web.</p>
<p class="contents">The point is that we have to work on copyright and put ACTA aside, as it is an obstacle. We have to reject it, exclude it, because it is an obstacle to our work. Fortunately, the Commission, after months and years of hesitation, has brought two important measures to the attention of Parliament: orphan works and the one regarding copyright management companies. This is positive; let us work on this rationally rather than just emotionally, but without letting ACTA get in the way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I beg your pardon? The fact that the very states which produce the majority of counterfeit products are not covered by this agreement means that the entire coalition of the willing is completely pointless. It is futile and also brings huge problems for us when it comes to fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole agreement is characterised by a complete lack of legal certainty. The wording is completely open and means both everything and nothing. This is not what the European economy needs in terms of competitiveness. From this perspective, ACTA represents a move in totally the wrong direction.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point is that you are taking the approach of making Internet service providers into deputy sheriffs. This is something which could be described as privatising the law and is completely unacceptable.</p>

Anything that is worth nothing will not be stolen. Therefore, it is very important for us to make every effort to reach a good compromise in this debate. We are aware that various things need to be brought up-to-date. Copyright regulations need to be adapted to the new digital world. We understand the value of European cultural assets. Whether it can provide a livelihood for artists, journalists and authors will depend on the question of whether content will, in future, be paid for directly by consumers who value it and want to have it or whether it will only be possible to fund the content via advertising and promotions, in order to give artists and journalists an opportunity to earn a fair living.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we also need to revise the e-Commerce Directive. We need to answer simple questions such as: Is it possible to sell a product for less than the introductory price? What is the situation with price labelling on the Internet? How can we create certainty for our citizens with regard to copyright issues? I believe that the Commission and Parliament still have a great deal of work to do on drawing up the necessary regulations. I would like to know what the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) will actually achieve, and this point has already been made today, if China, India and Brazil are not included.</p>

However, many speakers have already emphasised the fact that this is also a political decision. I think that the political decision depends on when the Commission finally submits a proposal for updating copyright regulations. Ultimately, it is also about the question of how we deal with monitoring organisations which often impose unfair penalties on digital consumers and of what rights providers will have in future with regard to the distribution of content. This is the basis which we should be working on. Therefore, I am also in favour of postponing tomorrow’s vote. Only when we in this House have come to a consensus about how we will take the area of intellectual property rights forward will we be ready to reach a decision.

We need sector-specific approaches to counterfeiting: a bag is not a movie.

This debate simply continues the confusion of recent months. We have seen almost every approach in recent months from the idea of rubber-stamping the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) as quickly as possible, to waiting for a court judgment and now to quickly rejecting it. These proposals always come from different sides of the House. In addition, it is clear that quite a lot has gone wrong during the negotiations on ACTA in the last few years, as many speakers have mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, ACTA does, in principle, have some good features and, in principle, Europe, as a continent almost totally lacking in raw materials, must be able to protect its creativity and its innovations. We must ensure that we have fair customs measures and fair procedures for claiming damages.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, some speakers have mentioned the fact that the very states that produce counterfeit products are not parties to the agreement. That is true. However, since we have been talking over the last week about how we need more transatlantic cooperation, let us start here. We need to send out a signal in this globalised world that the Internet is not an unlegislated area and that we want to protect our intellectual property. Other countries will follow our example. The signal that we will send out by voting against ACTA is a devastating one, even though ACTA is not at all satisfactory.</p>

In my view, ACTA correctly identifies the problems, which are the counterfeiting of consumer products and infringements of intellectual property rights, but the instruments that it proposes are not the right ones. Why is this?</p>
<p class="contents">It is because it is a mistake not to distinguish between consumer goods and cultural goods, and not to distinguish between personal use and commercial use. It is because voting against ACTA means protecting authors and users, since these groups are not mutually hostile. It is because we need to make a firmer commitment to supporting innovation, in order to find the answers that guarantee respect for the rights of creators and the public. For all these reasons, our group will vote against this agreement tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I do not wish to end without reiterating my congratulations to the rapporteur, Mr Martin, on his good work and on the efforts made towards a good debate.</p>

I suggested that. Yet nothing was done.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone would have benefited from this. Those who, for reasons of legal certainty, will vote in favour of a joint interpretation would have had the advantage of shedding light on the ambiguities decried by ACTA’s detractors. Those who will vote against the agreement, myself included, would have had the advantage of being able to make a fresh start on clearer concepts in the case of renegotiation. In all cases, an interpretative protocol would have bought us time. Now, we will have to start again from scratch with the hypothesis that we can unite the critical mass for a new start in the fight against counterfeiting.</p>
<p class="contents">Another lesson to be learned from this episode is that it is important from now on to involve Parliament in the definition of the negotiating mandate for any new treaty or international agreement. This would mean that Parliament, which, need I remind you, has the final say on this kind of agreement, could take responsibility from the beginning.</p>

The war of words has been joined by people for whom the ground-breaking social and cultural role of the Internet is of great importance. People are not protesting against the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement because they are against the protection of trademarks or intellectual property rights. What motivates us is the imbalance which ACTA creates between the rights of creators and producers, on the one hand, and the rights of Internet users, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with my colleagues from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I am going to vote against ACTA, because we do not see cultural goods as nothing more than a product, which, like any other product, can only be bought by those who can afford to do so. We are against ACTA because we see that the Internet plays an extremely important role, not just as a provider of information, but also as a gateway to cultural property for all of us, building identity and a feeling of community. The immediate rejection of ACTA is, for us, the first step towards changing the way intellectual property is protected on the Internet. Our objective is to extend what is called permitted use, so that people do not have to fear any consequences if they have shared files privately with friends but do not share files commercially. We urge you to help change this law.</p>

ACTA is an attack on fundamental rights, such as the protection of privacy, freedom of information and communication and the right to informational self-determination. It is the whole host of vague legal terms which have opened the door to this. We are faced with the threat that legal protection and legal procedures will no longer be available. We are right to be concerned that providers will be forced to monitor the Internet, put web blocks in place and filter content. Ultimately, this could lead to law enforcement being privatised and the providers being turned into deputy sheriffs.</p>
<p class="contents">The protection of individuals’ copyright must not, under any circumstances, lead to the freedom of information and communication being undermined. It is true that we need a modern copyright law which has a sensible balance between the interests of the originators and of the users. I would like the Commission finally to submit a proposal for this. ACTA will not help in this respect at all. Instead, it is forcing us to move in a very specific direction. This is why we must say ‘No’ to ACTA tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, you negotiated this agreement, yet neither you nor your services have been able to provide concrete and effective responses to the increasing numbers of questions and concerns from citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, throughout this entire campaign, the debates have focused on online rights and freedoms, but we have spoken very little about counterfeiting physical goods. However, this type of counterfeiting represents a loss of 30 to 40 000 jobs each year in France alone, and close to 100 000 in Europe. For our companies, it means an annual loss of several billion euro of turnover, as well as a significant loss in terms of tax revenue for Member States. Although counterfeiting is covered by most of ACTA’s provisions, counterfeiting physical goods has almost passed us by without mention.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the solution to combat the sale of counterfeit medicines, which represent a real threat to public health? What is the solution that will allow all of our companies to innovate, to create, without fear of plagiarism on the other side of the world?</p>

Tomorrow, it is up to Parliament to confirm this vote and put an end to this controversial dossier. The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) is a treaty that seeks to introduce a new framework for the protection of intellectual property rights, but does so without distinction, without distinguishing between commercial use for financial gain and consumer use by individual users not seeking profit.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we need to fight the fake goods market, to combat counterfeiting, but without undermining the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In a nutshell, I believe that commercial interests must not allow us to eliminate civil liberties. For this reason, ACTA is the wrong way to go about this, which is why tomorrow’s vote is very important. Tomorrow, therefore, we need to say no to ACTA to ensure the transparency and protection of citizens’ rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From the little that is clear, we can see that the rights of undertakings are protected above those of citizens. This applies both to us in Europe and to the people in poor countries who are waiting in vain for legal generic medicines that are being seized in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">However, if the best defence for an agreement is that it does not change anything, the agreement itself is not worth anything either. Mr De Gucht, you say that this agreement does not threaten our freedoms, but instead protects our livelihoods. The problem is that the ‘we’ that you are talking about are long-established companies with old business models. The ‘we’ that I am talking about are the millions of people who have actively opposed ACTA, and it is their rights we are defending by voting ‘no’ tomorrow. It is democracy that will make the European Parliament vote ‘no’, not new facts.</p>
<p class="contents">I would issue a word of warning that the fight is not over, however. The bad bits of ACTA will resurface in other legislation and initiatives like a monster in a second-rate zombie film. We therefore need a bigger change in intellectual property rights in order to defend the right to allow cultural growth, rather than the growth of profits. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must get used to the fact that we also need to pay for the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">What I wanted to say was that ACTA, the instrument we are debating today, is not the right instrument. The delegation of the Dutch Christian Democrats (CDA) to this Parliament therefore rejects ACTA. Moreover, what I have to say to Ms Stassen, though her chair is empty, is that the CDA has also rejected ACTA in the Dutch Lower House – because she makes it sound like it is a national matter. She has said her piece, but is no longer here with us when I actually have a chance to answer her question.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I believe that ACTA should be rejected because it raises too many questions and contains too many ambiguities. How does it address the Internet freedoms of an individual citizen? Are citizens’ fundamental rights recognised? Are rich countries being favoured at the expense of other countries? Will it bring any changes to current European legislation? We need clarification on all those questions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are the reasons why I have supported the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) since the start. First, I support it because piracy and counterfeiting are behind the constant rise in huge losses to the economy and employment capacity of the EU. Second, there cannot be effective protection of intellectual property rights without international cooperation. We can stop Chinese counterfeit goods at our borders, but we will not be able to do it in the US, Australia or Canada without an international agreement. Third, there cannot be effective protection of intellectual property rights without also covering piracy and counterfeiting on the Internet. Offering counterfeit goods on the Internet is no less serious than selling them in a street in Brussels or Strasbourg. Fourth, I believe that ACTA does not jeopardise civil liberties on the Internet. Fifth, intellectual property rights are fundamental rights of citizens, whereas piracy and counterfeiting are not.</p>

It really is very simple, because the story of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement is a story firstly of arrogance, then of contempt, secret negotiations, requests for information about the progress of those negotiations, and refusals. It is also a story of revolt, because Internet users went on to the streets and something started which those gentlemen behind closed doors had not foreseen. This was followed by fear of the rebellion, and once that began, we began to see ACTA being abandoned. Governments started to back down, saying ‘actually we never wanted this, we did not know, we thought it was all about baseball boots – not about freedom, but about counterfeit trainers’.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to warn everyone who thinks of trying to get changes on Internet freedoms in through the back door: do not do it, because it does not pay. The revolt may happen again. If you want to say something worthwhile about freedom on the Internet, then say it openly. ACTA will die an orphan, but it will leave all the problems behind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Doubts, contradictions and grey areas have all increased, especially at a political level, as well as at a technical and legal one. I have not changed my mind about tomorrow’s vote, but there is no doubt that my motivation is even stronger.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand and agree with the request to postpone the vote, but I do not accept that this should be due to Parliament being conditioned by the justice system. Getting politics to play a secondary role in a situation like this, bowing to the decisions of the judiciary, constitutes, I believe, an improper transfer of responsibility to which we cannot allow ourselves to stoop. I think the point is that tomorrow, Parliament needs to express a position.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement as proposed is riddled with dangerous gaps, leaving legitimate concern for the violation of the right to personal data protection and, more generally, for the violation of the right to freedom of communication on the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Parliament tomorrow must accept and welcome a request from over two and a half million citizens to Parliament via the Committee on Petitions (PETI). There will then be a time for change later on, to introduce instruments that actually combat counterfeiting.

<p class="contents">I will be voting against the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) not because I am convinced that the fundamental rights of the Union are truly being violated to the core, but because counterfeiting and online piracy cannot be fought with the same weapons, almost as if counterfeiting a handbag or a drug is similar to downloading a song or a film from the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">I am against ACTA because the Commission and the Council hitherto have not yet regulated in a credible way an issue that is so very much in the limelight in the digital age, such as the protection of intellectual property on the web. I am opposed because current legislation would already enable action to be taken against those countries that make a living out of counterfeiting.</p>
<p class="contents">I conclude by reiterating my opposition to an agreement that touches on highly sensitive issues, but does so in an inefficient, confused way, lacking a legal framework that is the only thing which would allow me to do anything other than vote against, as I shall be doing tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Furthermore, having an international agreement on counterfeiting that does not include China and India is like signing a maritime treaty between landlocked countries. Finally, it is unacceptable to support a vague treaty from which the authors have deliberately excluded all democratic bodies since the beginning of the procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these reasons raise questions for me, too. Why are several Members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), particularly this morning, still counting on postponing tomorrow’s vote on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA)? They are flogging a dead horse! Mr Fjellner was today’s example.</p>
<p class="contents">The PPE Group replied to me this morning on Twitter saying that it wants to hear the opinion of the Court of Justice. I replied – but I had already been expecting this remark – that it was comical, bizarre, alarming even, that Commissioner de Gucht should be questioning the legality of the treaty that he had signed by asking for the opinion of the Court after the event.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why tomorrow, we will vote against this treaty, which is, unfortunately, a bad answer to a good question, the question of counterfeiting.</p>

We represent their interests. If millions of young people are angered by new and unjustified legislation, we cannot ignore their protests. In my opinion, there is a need for clear legislation which protects intellectual property rights at international level, legislation which protects the creators of intellectual property from ‘pirating giants’ like China, the source of 60% of illegal goods. However, the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement is not the answer. Instead, it imposes misleading provisions – provisions which have also mobilised three million citizens to present a petition on ACTA to the committee on which I serve.

<p class="contents">People have given us a clear message that they do not want ACTA. They are afraid, and rightly so, of encroachment on their rights. We are confused – there is too little clarity.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to fight against product counterfeiting and bolster intellectual property protection, but we need more creative and effective ways of doing so. The European Court of Justice should not be an excuse for delaying decisions. Five parliamentary committees have rejected this international agreement. For Parliament, it is very clear that ACTA should be dropped.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement has not been agreed democratically and transparently. The people of Europe are worried about ACTA rather than expecting it to effectively protect rights or curb online piracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude with a thought by a well-known Slovenian Internet strategist at a conference in Brussels. ‘ACTA protects those who are stuck in the cave paintings era’. That is why we have to say ‘no’ to ACTA tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That was the majority decision of the Committee on Development at its last vote, and in reaching it we weighed up various issues, such as: firstly, that only 11 countries took part in the negotiations, therefore limiting its global impact, as the countries where the majority of counterfeits come from, as well as the majority of developing countries, are not parties to the agreement; secondly, that we need to go further than this agreement and prevent the negative impact that it could have on access to drugs and public health in developing countries, and also in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The more than likely negative impact of ACTA on public health has been written about and criticised on countless occasions by non-governmental organisations, by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Health, and by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Access to attainable drugs remains a key priority for people on low and middle incomes worldwide. The ACTA Treaty requires the signatories to pass laws and regulations that pose a risk to the availability of and access to generic drugs.</p>

We would then potentially have the machinery in place to do what China does to its Internet access in that country: monitor and filter out unsuitable political content.</p>
<p class="contents">The losses claimed to have been incurred by the entertainment industry are exaggerated enormously. It cannot be presumed that every person who illicitly gains access to copyright material would otherwise have paid for it. The obligation of ISPs to hand over personal data about alleged infringements of copyright would open the door to large corporations forcing people to pay unjustified demands for money to avoid crippling legal expenses. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is about rallying political support, regardless of the consequences, for unprotected intellectual property in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">It is mainly the negative aspects of ACTA that have been highlighted today. We have not talked about what is good about this agreement and why we need it. I am thinking of the safety aspects and the loss of EUR 8 billion a year and what that ultimately means for jobs in the European Union, because we know that an awful lot of people, especially young people, are unemployed.</p>
<p class="contents">I take seriously concerns about human rights violations and, because of this, I think we should wait for the decision of the European Court of Justice. In fact, I am appalled at the total distrust that exists in this regard, because there are many people who apparently do not trust the experts in the Member States involved in the preparation of this agreement. They do not trust Commissioner De Gucht and they are saying that we do not actually need the European Court of Justice.</p>

This is why we cannot support ACTA in its current form.

A number of Members, amongst them Mr Albrecht and Mr Scholz, have said that I did not properly inform the European Parliament and that I have contributed to secrecy. I have no problem with the Parliament having a completely different opinion to the one I have. That is what Parliament is for: to reflect all opinions in society. What I do not accept is this criticism, because from the moment that I took responsibility for this file, I have done everything possible to make the results of the negotiations public. And, by the way, I managed to convince our negotiating partners to do this. I have no problem with you disagreeing with me, or claiming that I should have followed another procedure. I will respond to that. But claims that I have tried to uphold secrecy in this simply cannot be taken seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it has been said – amongst others by Mr Rinaldi – that I have not listened to Parliament. There, Niccolò, I have to tell you that the last time the European Parliament pronounced on ACTA, in November 2010, a majority – albeit a slight one – voted for a resolution supporting ACTA. So listening to Parliament means listening to the majority of Parliament, it does not mean listening to an individual Member of Parliament, or to an individual group in Parliament, but to the majority. The last time that Parliament pronounced on ACTA, in November 2010, Parliament voted in favour of ACTA.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a question by Mr Tarabella. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr Tarabella wants to know why I did not ask for the Court of Justice’s opinion earlier. We must look closely, Mr Tarabella, at the wording of the article on the ratification procedure in the Treaty, which says: </p>
<p class="contents">‘A Member State, the European Parliament, the Council or the Commission may obtain the opinion of the Court of Justice as to whether an agreement envisaged is compatible with the Treaties. Where the opinion of the Court is adverse, the agreement envisaged may not enter into force unless it is amended or the Treaties are revised’. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> This says very clearly that we may ask for or request the opinion of the Court of Justice once the text of the treaty envisaged has been finalised, that is, once the negotiations have been concluded. That is the very idea behind this special procedure before the Court of Justice. That is what I have done.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I am not the only one who has asked for an opinion from the Court of Justice, which was eventually requested and then withdrawn. If I may, Mr President, because I still need some time to answer all of these questions, I would like to read you a letter: </p>
<p class="contents">‘The draft Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) would have legal implications in several fields of legislative competence of the European Parliament, including new ones, such as criminal law.</p>
<p class="contents">‘In order to have legal certainty, and to avoid that questions of the compatibility with the treaties arise during the ratification process, or after ratification of the agreement, we would like to request that the European Parliament seeks an opinion of the European Court of Justice concerning ACTA.</p>
<p class="contents">‘Thus, on the basis of Rule 90(7) of the European Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, we request that the plenary vote be held on the following text: <span class="italic">Pursuant to Article 218(11) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the European Parliament submits the following request for an Opinion of the Court: Is the envisaged Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) compatible with the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union?</span></p>
<p class="contents">Signed for the Greens/EFA Group: Rebecca Harms and Jan Philipp Albrecht’.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that this is slightly different from what I heard this afternoon from Mr Albrecht. He has changed his opinion in the meantime, not me.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also told that in fact, I want to use the European Court of Justice to postpone the whole discussion on this. I think this is an utterly light argument because in any case, we are going to have this discussion on all the topics that are discussed in ACTA. I think it would be very useful that we have the opinion of the European Court of Justice. I will come back to that later.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now try to answer the substantive questions that have been put to me.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lange, you claim that we do not have the substantive law ready. This is true and it is also the main reason why I think we should go to the European Court of Justice so that they help us in formatting this whole discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">What I fear is that if you now vote it down – which obviously is on your minds – that we will no longer have that substantive discussion during this mandate. I think it would be a complete mistake not to have that discussion. By sending the whole file to the European Court of Justice, we create time for ourselves – a kind of time-out – so that we can discuss the substantive items that indeed have to be tackled sooner or later. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> I also have a question for Ms de Sarnez and several other MEPs. Why are India, Brazil and China not included in this negotiation, this agreement? It is quite simply because they do not want to be. They do not agree with it. Emerging countries are not in favour of protecting intellectual property. They are very reticent on this subject. The argument that nothing will be resolved if these countries are not involved is not valid then. For the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) actually seeks to strengthen our legislation, not only at our borders, but also at the borders of the other countries associated with this agreement. That is what it is about. If counterfeit products come, for example, from China, we must stop them not only at our borders, but also at the other borders of important markets for them. We will thereby stop counterfeiting from continuing. The idea that these countries must be involved in this agreement is not at all correct. Furthermore, if China does not agree on this subject, honourable Members, it is not because it is protecting fundamental rights, but because of other reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">You say that only industrialised countries are involved. On this point, I could repeat my response but I think that there is another element that is not clear in all of these discussions and that is the debate on medicines. I have received thousands of e-mails on this subject too. Fortunately, all of these e-mails were identical; otherwise I would have had to read them all. Let us look at the bilateral agreements that we are negotiating, for example, with India. I have been asked several questions about this subject too. We have been very attentive in order to ensure that these agreements do not shut the door to generic medicines, quite the opposite. Furthermore, Ms de Sarnez – but I see that she has left the Chamber – there is a difference between generic products and counterfeit products. This is also a serious problem and a risk for public health. Some medicines are labelled as ‘generic’ but, in reality, these are counterfeit products, which sometimes even have the opposite effects to those listed on the packaging.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Ms Bélier’s comment about ‘rejecting the world proposed to us by ACTA’, I can understand this argument coming from some groups, even though it surprises me. However, I do not understand why this is the argument of Parliament as a whole. That is rather strange. </p>
<p class="contents">Let me now come to who will, in fact, be the next speaker, David Martin, and what he has been saying in his previous speech.</p>
<p class="contents">David mentions the problem that this Treaty could be misinterpreted in the future; that it is not clear enough. Basically, I agree with that – not technically, but politically. Technically, it is not correct what you are saying – I am not saying you are not putting it correctly, but your analysis is not necessarily the correct one.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, in relation to ‘commercial scale’, when you look at the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice, it is very clear what ‘commercial scale’ is. But, of course, a citizen is not expected to look at the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice; that I agree with. However, this is a very clear concept.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, you say there is the issue of sanctions. Again, I agree, but you should also agree with me that the issue with criminal sanctions in a treaty is not something that has been negotiated by the European Commission; this has been negotiated by the Member States and is their sole responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Once the text was ready, those Member States unanimously agreed to the text. Therefore, you cannot blame me for what the Member States have put into ACTA. This is out of our scope; I would say, unfortunately.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the role of Internet service providers ties in with what I want to say as a final point: the issue that they should start checking everything. Again, the European Court of Justice has been very clear on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Very recently, in the Sabam v Netlog case, the European Court of Justice ruled that it is not possible to impose on intermediaries such as social networks a general obligation to monitor user data. That means that the European Court of Justice is looking into these matters; it is giving answers to these questions. That is why I am so surprised that you no longer want to have this opinion of the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand as rapporteur you have to reflect the opinion of Parliament and the opinion of the committee, but as far as I know, you started by putting those questions to me. The idea was that you would put those questions to the Commission and that we would try to give answers, and it was at that very moment in time that I said: OK, let us also ask the European Court of Justice what they think about this.</p>
<p class="contents">But afterwards, you changed your minds; OK – that is up to you. That is your democratic responsibility. I think it is also the responsibility of the European Commission to be straightforward in this. We need a discussion on intellectual property; we need a discussion on how to enforce intellectual property. I think also we need the guidance of the European Court of Justice on this.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we will continue with this demand for an opinion from the Court of Justice and come back to you – obviously not only to the European Parliament, but also to our negotiating partners, if it were proved that there are serious problems in this agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think there has been one misunderstanding in the debate, which is the role of the Commission here. I think people, particularly outside this House, have to understand that the Commission not only has the right, but has the duty to defend its proposal and has a duty to advocate its proposal, and that with the way the institutional triangle works, it is then up to Parliament and the Council to accept or reject the Commission’s position, and that is where we are now.</p>
<p class="contents">The one thing that is worrying me about this debate is the presumption on some benches that if you listen to ordinary citizens, you are being populist. But if you give in to the big commercial lobbies, you are being responsive. That is not a distinction that I can accept.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two demographics that I have found who have been opposed. There has been general opposition to ACTA, but two demographics in particular have expressed concern about ACTA. The under-25s who regard the Internet as a zone of freedom and an open area for expression, and I do not think ACTA has successfully reflected their concerns. Interestingly, the other demographic has been people from central and eastern Europe who know what it is to have their freedoms curtailed and have expressed great concern about the way ACTA might be implemented. So I understand where the people have come from on this issue and I think we are absolutely right as a Parliament to respond to that.</p>
<p class="contents">I also take from this debate though, both on the Internet and in this room, that there is no one who really opposes the idea that rights holders should get a decent reward for their efforts. What they object to is, perhaps, overreaching the proper definition of reward and curtailing freedom in providing that reward. What we have to strive for now, both as a Commission and as a Parliament, is the balance between ensuring that rights holders do get a return for their investment, for their effort, whilst maintaining Internet freedom. That is the challenge we all face in the weeks and months ahead.</p>

However, this must not be done, under any circumstances, by infringing fundamental rights, as is happening, unfortunately, in the case of ACTA. The agreement blatantly infringes at least three fundamental rights, namely, the right to protection of personal data, the right to privacy and the right to confidentiality, which is also the clear conclusion from the opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor.</p>
<p class="contents">If ACTA were to come into force, it would force Internet service providers not only to monitor users’ entire activities on a large scale, but also to pass on possible irregularities detected to the holders of intellectual property rights. These measures are not only excessive and disproportionate, but are also illegal as they create a private system of law enforcement where the service providers and rights holders are the police and judges in cyberspace, to the detriment of the judicial authorities. For these reasons, I believe that ACTA is unacceptable in this form and must be rejected by Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Counterfeiting and piracy have recently increased significantly. The consequences of the growth in such illegal activities have extremely serious consequences, which range from economic losses to health and safety risks to European consumers. Infringement of intellectual property rights harms growth, competitiveness and innovation; this causes substantial damage every year to European companies and puts European jobs at risk. I firmly believe that the EU needs an effective tool in its efforts to protect intellectual property rights. As it stands, ACTA is not acceptable. It does not meet the requirement to strike an appropriate balance between enforcement of intellectual property rights and fundamental rights such as freedom of expression, the right to privacy and protection of personal data and confidentiality of communications, and the right to due process. If we want to protect and enforce one set of fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter, we can hardly endanger other kinds of fundamental rights! The core provisions of ACTA bring about a feeling of legal insecurity. The protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms is our absolute priority, but ACTA is causing considerable concern. We need a modern tool which will not prejudice the rights also guaranteed by the Charter and the European Convention. ACTA in its current version is unacceptable, and we therefore call on the Commission to take urgent action and to present new and better quality proposals for effective tools to combat counterfeiting and piracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Paragraph 6 is not acceptable either, as it speaks of the circumvention of ‘an effective technological measure’ and of devices which are ‘primarily’ – but not exclusively – designed or produced to be used for this kind of circumvention thanks to ‘computer programmes’ which they contain.</p>

This is because many believe that these rules violate the freedom of speech and expression, and the freedom of information. The Hungarian delegation to the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) believes that a satisfactory and reassuring answer must be given to these concerns of citizens and civil organisations, and we therefore supported the European Commission’s decision to have the European Court of Justice issue an independent legal opinion on the compatibility of this international agreement with EU law and on the matter of the violation of liberties. In line with this, the group of Hungarian Members within the PPE Group supported the fact that the European Parliament postpone its decision until said opinion is issued. The Hungarian delegation to the PPE Group believes that we should pay attention to the complaints expressed by numerous citizens and civil organisations in connection with the agreement. Since these could not be settled, the delegation made the responsible choice in light of these concerns and legal uncertainty and voted against the conclusion of the agreement. The Hungarian delegation to the PPE Group is of the opinion that to treat the fight against piracy and the fight against counterfeiting together was a flawed concept from the beginning. Our delegation continues to urge action against counterfeiting. Due to the influx of counterfeit foreign goods, tens of thousands of jobs are in jeopardy, and counterfeit drugs are endangering the health of citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall be voting against ACTA. I do think intellectual property rights should be protected. We must also settle certain matters relating to the Internet. However, this must be done in a way which is clear and is acceptable to a variety of groups in society. This cannot be done either by adding a provision which is mainly about counterfeit goods but which otherwise is unrelated to the agreement as a whole. It is certainly the case that the matters which ACTA has attempted to solve do have to be solved, but not in the way ACTA tries to do. We need to keep working on unsolved problems, but as well as consulting with legal experts, we also need to take on board the views of a variety of other groups in society.

The EU is a global leader in the field of innovations, patents and scientific development. For our continent lacking in natural resources, the successful protection of this type of property is crucially important to the prosperity of all Europeans. Nevertheless, I will vote without hesitation against ACTA because the agreement has failed on the key point – to resolve the conflict between the protection of intellectual property and civil liberties. This is the main underlying reason giving rise to the outburst of unprecedented civil discontent. The numerous discussions pinpointed exactly the controversial areas creating an opportunity for abuses. It is sufficient for us to mention two of them. Firstly, the lack of a precise definition of the key term ‘commercial scale’ as grounds for prosecution and, secondly, the possibility of Internet service providers being forced to monitor their customers’ behaviour. This danger has been explicitly confirmed by the European Data Protection Supervisor. These are two clear examples of ACTA’s failure. I firmly believe that every time Parliament is faced with such a conflict, it will always side with fundamental rights and freedoms. In fact, this will happen by a huge majority, just as I expect tomorrow in this Chamber, which I will be joining. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the appropriate solution would be for Parliament to postpone the final vote and wait for the decision of the European Court of Justice on the compatibility of the agreement with EU law and on the violation of liberties. Only in possession of the expert opinion of the Court of Justice can Parliament take a responsible decision. A negative vote by Parliament would undo the results of years of international negotiations. I agree that we should take the opinions of the public, of EU citizens into account when deciding on important matters that concern them, but we should not entrust the legislative process to manipulated mass movements. Those who criticise the agreement are often not even familiar with its actual text, and I believe that Parliament should have acted differently when seeking to dispel concerns about infringements of rights. The parliamentary legal opinions requested by the Committee on Legal Affairs further proved that ACTA does not represent a threat to rights relating to personality, and the parts of the agreement that are being brought up to alarm people do not apply to the actions of private individuals. EU competitiveness greatly depends on our achievements in respect of intellectual property rights, as the EU society is an innovative society. Intellectual property rights are the engine of the EU economy, and they must be guaranteed appropriate protection at international level as well. The debate that emerged in connection with ACTA indicates that we will need to approach issues of similar importance far more carefully in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Another, and probably the greatest, problem is the threat of restrictions on fundamental civil liberties. Intellectual property should, of course, be protected. I am not therefore saying that everything in this agreement was negative; many of its features are already present in existing regulations. However, we must make greater efforts to find a solution to protect intellectual property that would take into account the views of a broad section of civil society. I would like to point out that despite the non-conclusion of ACTA, the debate surrounding this document has brought about a situation whereby copyrights have started to be taken into account. In practice, therefore, legislation in this field is finally being used. It should also be noted that the non-conclusion of this document is a clear example of how every EU citizen can influence decisions made in Brussels. It was, in fact, members of the public who, through their lobbying, activity and highlighting weaknesses, forced many members to correct or change their opinion on ACTA.

I based my decision on the negative assessment by the five pertinent committees of the European Parliament. The following are the main areas of controversy to which the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the Justice Committee, the Committee on Development and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy drew attention in their assessments: under the pretext of curbing piracy, ACTA gives the authorities great authority to control the Internet; it creates the preconditions for extrajudicial surveillance activity, and mere suspicion is sufficient to transmit sensitive personal information to copyright owners; several concepts that possess a legal dimension are not defined and permit countries to interpret them depending on the interests of the moment; there is a risk that business secrets will be leaked, because the agreement does not guarantee any confidentiality for the relevant information; the objective of preventing counterfeit medicines from entering the market is not achieved, and the agreement would instead limit the availability of cheaper generic medicines; and, of course, the secrecy in which the agreement was drafted. In supporting ACTA, the Commission confirms that the agreement will protect European jobs and innovation, increase economic growth and fight crime and the entry of counterfeit medicines into the market. These are commendable objectives, but there are, unfortunately, serious shortcomings in the technical formulation of the agreement. The fact that the question of whether the rights of citizens might be infringed has been submitted to the European Court of Justice does not relieve us of the obligation to deal with the agreement here and now. There are, after all, other questionable areas in the agreement, such as the inadequate definition of concepts, provisions that allow diverging interpretations, etc. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

European businesses and European consumer organisations were not invited to talks on the ACTA Treaty, and had no opportunity to influence the form of the treaty, while, for reasons unknown, some supranational businesses were there even at the birth of the treaty. The threat to the transfer of generic medicines, the possible problems with plant seeds and a range of other impacts disappeared in the storm surrounding the fight against Internet piracy. The ACTA Treaty, however, also includes provisions that might threaten basic human freedoms, such as the right to a fair trial, for example. Article 27 paragraph 3 of the treaty would allow private firms to enforce the law. The right to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence or right of appeal, however, are a cornerstone of European civil rights. Europeans have always stood up for these freedoms, and have always fought for them. It is therefore not possible to support – with a clear conscience – a treaty which, through vague formulations, allows civil rights to be handed over from the courts to non-European private companies. Today, the European Parliament again has a chance to show that it is the final barrier between European citizens and the arbitrary will of certain governments and supranational businesses, and to reject the ACTA Treaty. Let us do this resolutely and quickly. If we need to amend the European legal framework, let us do so ourselves, and not under some trans-oceanic tutelage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The diplomatic negotiations of ACTA took place under a veil of secrecy. It took leaked documents for repressive mechanisms such as luggage checks at airports or the ‘3-strikes and your Internet is cut-off’ clause to be exposed and dropped. This is a crude and misguided international enforcement deal that tries to address online copyright infringements with the same legal instruments used to combat the counterfeiting of goods. Fake medicines are a matter of life and death. Threats to health and safety unquestionably require the firmest and most robust measures possible. However, applying such draconian methods to the digital world comes at an unnecessary, unacceptable and counterproductive cost in terms of privacy, technological innovation and access to knowledge. To the Commissioner and those colleagues who argue that we should wait for the European Court’s opinion, I say the following: even if the opinion deemed ACTA compatible with EU legislation, I find its process flawed enough and its substance politically unacceptable to warrant its rejection tomorrow. That is what I will do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, the European Commission failed to heed my warnings and those of the experts. The very idea of a treaty that left out China and other sources of counterfeits on the EU internal market, and which failed to differentiate between measures suitable for offline and online environments, was flawed. Within my role as rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I pushed for an amendment in relation to the insufficient guarantees of basic human rights and freedoms, protection of personal data and a fair trial in the ACTA Treaty. The general lack of clarity of some ACTA provisions led us to declare that it was incompatible with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Our decision tomorrow is extremely important, as many citizens are putting their trust in us to correct a situation brought about by Member States and the Commission. The issue of what will follow our vote is no less important. Based on my proposal, the Commission will have to draw up an EU Code of Online Rights this year, which will ensure that the rights of Internet users are protected so that no similarly flagrant threats to their rights can take place in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This puts the freedom of ordinary Internet users at risk and provides insufficient guarantees for the protection of consumer privacy. In addition, we could ask serious questions about the effectiveness of this agreement given the fact that countries that produce the largest number of counterfeit products have not signed it. My group is of the opinion that the Commission ought, first of all, to come up with a proposal for the revision of the e-Commerce Directive. We are also developing a proposal at the moment that is supposed to create a new framework for enforceable intellectual property rights that can protect authors and artists and encourage innovation but which is, at the same time, consumer-oriented and in line with the principles of civil liberties and privacy. I do hope that the Commission will learn its lessons from this debacle. Since the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament has been a fully-fledged colegislator, also when it comes to international agreements. The Commission would therefore do well to ask for a negotiating mandate from the legislator before the negotiations begin. The time when Parliament’s arms could be twisted, first following SWIFT and now ACTA, is clearly over. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
