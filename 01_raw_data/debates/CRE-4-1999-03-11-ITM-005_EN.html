<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Evans </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, a point of order under Rules 119 and 120 concerning roll‐call votes, in which I know you have a special interest. At this morning's sitting we had any number of roll‐call votes. We are destined to have more again this evening and Members can look forward to a fairly healthy‐sized volume of roll‐call results in their pigeonholes tomorrow morning.</p>
<p class="contents">Rules 119 and 120 referring to roll‐call votes state they shall be recorded in the Minutes. Rule 133 states that the Minutes shall be distributed to the Members.</p>
<p class="contents">I wonder whether, in the interests of economy, efficiency, and certainly of modernisation, you could either rule as President or call for an investigation to see whether the word ‘distribution" could be interpreted to mean ‘distributed electronically", so that those Members who want to access the full list of recorded votes can do so through the computers or a certain number of copies can be made available to those Members, rather than going through the expensive and wasteful procedure of distributing hundreds of pages to everybody.</p>

I did in fact send a letter to the President of the European Parliament, and this very afternoon the Conference of Presidents debated the matter. One of the issues I raised in the letter, which of course will be distributed, is the excessively large number of roll‐call votes, which often reach 100 or more. This is of course my own opinion, and does not commit anyone else.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from the waste of time, each of these cost the European taxpayer EUR 300 because, as you know, the results of the votes must be published the following day. They also have to be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities, and that costs a great deal of money. An initial debate has taken place in the Conference of Presidents but I do not think I should expand on that now, since it is neither the time nor the place for a more general debate. There is a problem and, of course, we note your recommendation.</p>

But let me make another suggestion. Let us discuss in the relevant committees how we can get back to the original purpose of roll‐call voting, which was to enable us to hold a special vote on particular issues of genuine importance. I believe it is rather pointless to take a roll‐call vote on every single phrase. For that reason, I believe we should be well advised to review this procedure, and then the paper problem would automatically be solved.</p>

Trans‐European networks are, on the face of it, a sensible arrangement which improves both security of supply and competition in the energy market. However, there is another side to the coin which people should be aware of, namely that the various energy providers cannot supply on equal terms. Small, environmentally friendly, decentralised combined power and heating stations, which are owned and run by local interests, cannot be expected to supply electricity at the same price as nuclear power stations and large, coal‐fired power plants. Renewable sources of energy are also uncompetitive because the external costs of the large plants are not included in their prices. There is therefore a risk, as things stand at present, that a healthy, environmentally friendly development in the power supply industry could be destroyed by the trans‐European networks. The June Movement actively supports the development of environmentally friendly forms of energy, and believes that the Member States should have the opportunity to promote renewable energy with all the means at their disposal.</p>

We can all imagine the disastrous consequences that such an increase in energy requirements would have for the environment if measures were not taken to considerably increase our use of efficient energy resources that are both renewable and less harmful to the biosphere.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need to meet the objectives set at the Kyoto Conference in December 1997. In order to do this, it is essential to make practical use of the progress made in the field of renewable energy sources and to perfect those sources that have not yet reached the stage where they can be put on the market.</p>
<p class="contents">Strictly from an economic point of view, uncontrolled consumption of non‐renewable energy sources in the long term is likely to threaten our security of supply and price stability. Therefore, we also need to look at the sustainability of economic development when discussing renewable energy sources.</p>
<p class="contents">For many of our countries, intensive use of renewable energy sources is also likely to restore equilibrium to our balance of trade, which has been thrown off course by massive imports of traditional energy sources.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, at a time when jobs are in short supply, we cannot ignore the fact that renewable energy sources have an employment potential that is two to five times greater than that of traditional energy sources.

<p class="contents">Given the fact that energy consumption in the Member States is set to increase by 50 % in the next 20 years, we need to make an extra special effort in terms of energy efficiency. Sufficient resources should therefore be allocated for this purpose. Our rapporteur is concerned about ‘the low budget allocated to SAVE II" and says that, as a result, ‘the programme"s potential is being overestimated."</p>
<p class="contents">In its opinion, the Committee on Budgets takes the same line. It stresses that the Union"s dependence on energy imports is increasing and goes on to highlight the importance of the SAVE programme, since its objective of saving energy ‘will thus reduce this dependency".</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection is of the same opinion. It states the following: ‘The Commission proposal on the promotion of energy efficiency is somewhat disappointing. The measures it contains are far too weak if the targets set at Kyoto are to be anything more than empty words."</p>
<p class="contents">It is unfortunate that the European Union is not providing itself with the resources needed to achieve its objectives. However, I will support this proposal since, above all, it does at least exist. But we need the resources to implement the policy.

The European Union is one of the largest producers of greenhouse gases in the world. We therefore have a responsibility, not just to ourselves but to the planet as a whole, to encourage greater energy efficiency and cut greenhouse emissions. We must not fiddle while the earth chokes on our fumes.</p>
<p class="contents">The British Labour Government is leading the way. Britain was instrumental in securing worldwide agreement to cut greenhouse emissions at the Kyoto Environment Conference in 1997. Indeed, without the chairmanship skills of the Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott, the Conference would have produced more hot air than it prevented! Moreover, yesterday, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, announced new green energy taxes on companies and lower taxes for smaller, more eco‐friendly cars.</p>
<p class="contents">This is in sharp contrast to the Tories, who always promoted the Great Car Economy rather than greater control of emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">Britain is well on the way to meeting the commitments it made at the Kyoto Conference. Britain, however, cannot tackle a global problem alone. Other EU Member States, the United States and the rest of the industrialised world must also show similar commitment. Only then will we be able to enter the 21st century confident that future generations will see the 22nd.</p>

<p class="contents">The amendments reaffirm the need to support European tobacco production which, I would like to point out, only represents 23 % of the volume of leaf tobacco consumed by the European processing industry.</p>
<p class="contents">The battle against smoking, which, in my view, is essential, should not involve the reduction or abolition of this production, as some of my colleagues have suggested. It would be immediately replaced by production from countries outside the European Union, which already account for 95 % of world tobacco production.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, this report proposes a greater increase in premiums. This is doubly justified, firstly, because of the losses that resulted from the withdrawal of the green ecu, for which there is no compensation as it is below 1.98 % – which represents a loss of ECU 1 million for French producers – and secondly, because of the losses suffered over the years when subsidies were not increased to account for inflation.</p>

This production requires a considerable workforce and allows many jobs to be preserved on relatively small farms.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore opposed to the amendments proposed by the chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, which seek to eventually abolish the aid granted to the tobacco production industry. We are all aware of the European Union"s low level of self‐sufficiency: it only provides 20 % of its own needs, which means that any reduction in aid will lead to a decline in European production to the benefit of tobacco imports from third countries, especially the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations voted in favour of Amendment No 5, which provides for full compensation for producers for the negative effects of currency conversions in the transition from the ecu to the euro. In France, for example, we know that compensation aid and official prices have fallen by 1.9 % for all farmers in the transition to the euro. This provision obviously requires additional budgetary resources but it preserves the principle of equality. We regret that, although their income decreased during the 1997‐1998 season, farmers were not treated fairly: the challenge of the single currency was more important to some people.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 7, 8 and 9 aim to transfer the guarantee thresholds from group III (dark tobacco) to group II (Burley) and group I (Virginia). Although this transfer does not affect the budget, it encourages production to move towards quality tobacco. The level of nicotine in dark tobacco, in particular, is higher than that of the other types of tobacco which would benefit from the transfer.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would also like to make a stand against the principle of gradually reducing agricultural aid, as proposed by the Commission on the basis of a French initiative. This phased reduction would represent 3 % per year as from 2002. Taking account of the depreciation of the currency, that would mean that official prices and compensation aid would decrease by around 5 % every year. Initially, the lowest performing producers will be forced to stop producing and the level of European production will therefore fall. A uniform phased reduction of 3 % will primarily penalise the sectors of production which receive the most aid, such as tobacco growing. It is a mistake to think that our producers" productivity gains could compensate for this decrease in compensation aid.</p>

Moreover, the Commission proposal does not basically provide for premiums for the tobacco varieties to be redefined, thereby confirming the gradual reduction in real producer income as a result of the failure to make adjustments based on inflation levels in the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I am calling for an increase in the premiums for all varieties of leaf tobacco for the 1999, 2000 and 2001 harvests.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I believe that it is necessary to revise the COM in the tobacco sector so as to protect and improve quality production by tailoring it to market requirements; those adjustments should be made in the light of the changes dictated by the reform of the CAP (Agenda 2000) and taking into account the prospects of European enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">For the above reasons, the non‐attached Members will be abstaining in the vote on the report, as we do not consider the content of the report to be a sufficient guarantee that the interests of Italian tobacco producers will be protected.</p>

As the World Trade Organisation has just confirmed that these sanctions are illegal, the European Union has an urgent duty to respond resolutely to the American attacks. It is now essential to make the American leaders understand that the European Union and its Member States have the will and the ability to respond harshly to such a direct attack on their interests and their rights. The absence of a firm and credible reaction from the European Union in other matters has surely been a deciding factor in Washington"s decision to opt for a test of strength.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations regrets Commissioner Brittan"s ambiguous and soft language in a context where the United States is testing our strength and where the European Union must therefore convince them now that it has a real capacity to cause trouble. Yesterday, in this House, while giving the impression that he was adopting a firm position, the Commissioner basically left open the way for negotiations on a fresh modification of our COM for bananas. This expectation is unfounded and particularly ill‐timed. As our new COM was drawn up in order to comply with WTO requirements, there is no reason for us to envisage any future adjustments. Will the Commission not place a little trust in the WTO bodies responsible for resolving disputes?</p>
<p class="contents">While we support the joint resolution, our group would have liked it to have been more emphatic and, in particular, to have asked the Commission to consider introducing a great European 301: the Americans are retaining their instrument despite the fact that they are members of the WTO. Above all, we would have liked to ask the Commission to freeze all programmes and actions associated with the transatlantic partnership as it is clear that this partnership is currently being flouted through the aggressive and illegal attitude of the United States to the banana issue. On the eve of the ‘millennium round negotiations", it is paramount that the European Union and its Member States learn from this crisis and provide their international trade strategy with a new focus based on greater coherence and a greater determination in rejecting any unfair behaviour on the part of the United States.</p>

It is not a matter of their fleeing from the fighting; they are actually being systematically driven out, village by village. One village after another is being burned to the ground with the aim of altering, so to speak, the ethnic composition of Kosovo, 90 % of the population of which comprises ethnic Albanians, and to swing the balance there in favour of the Serbian occupiers. We must protest vigorously against this, and we must also take military action to stop it. It really is high time we launched air strikes and stopped making empty threats about last chances. Slobodan Milosevic is laughing his head off at the West, and the so‐called ethnic cleansing continues day by day in all its systematic brutality.</p>

I did not, however, vote in favour of the report, as I think that it has unfortunately been distorted by certain amendments. This does not make it any less interesting, as it is a very good example of the contradictions of European policy.</p>
<p class="contents">On one hand, we give excessive unconditional support to the claim for a new Palestinian state alongside Jordan, while on the other hand, we say that the proclamation of that state would create an explosion situation. Added to this, we state that, in any case, it is too expensive and the administrative structures are not viable. Undoubtedly, and absurdly, this is what is interesting about the report. But it is not a reason to adopt it, since it sets out a position which explains why, for a long time to come, Europe will continue to pay without truly being able to make any decisions.</p>

Following the Wye Plantation agreements and the deadlock in the situation on the ground, the Palestinian authorities have decided to declare the independence of the territories unilaterally on 4 May. The Israelis have stated that if that happens, they will occupy the territories with military forces. As it is obvious that there is not enough time left to achieve the considerable progress that is necessary, I believe that the rapporteur is right to ask the two parties to engage immediately in negotiations in order to put back the date of application of the provisional agreement until after 4 May. I also share his view that the negotiation process must result in the constitution of an independent Palestinian state and that the existence of the State of Israel and its right to security must be recognised by the Arab world.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said in this House in 1998, to try to resolve each conflict in the region separately would be to erase all the historical, ethnic, religious and cultural differences and to forget the international strategies that aim to control the raw materials and maintain areas of influence through the military alliances. The European Union"s aim, in fighting every form of extremism and fundamentalism, must be to strengthen its political role in the region and to support a process that establishes security and cooperation between all the countries of the Near and Middle East and benefits all those involved. It must also support any moves towards finding regional solutions. I hope that the Euro‐Mediterranean Conference to held in Stuttgart between 4 and 6 April will enable us to make progress in that direction.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this frame of mind that I will visit Syria next week with a delegation from the Socialist Group. We are now at a stage where Syria and Israel have expressed the will to resume peace negotiations on the basis of regional cooperation founded on the common interests of the countries and the region.</p>

We must welcome this along with the fact that for the first time, all of the main Israeli political forces seem to have accepted the principle of exchanging land for peace.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what is much less pleasing to us as Europeans is that we have been in no way associated with the political negotiations, despite the fact that the European Union is the region"s main financial backer. In a way, we are paying, but we do not have anything to say.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two main reasons for this. Firstly, despite a few institutional steps in the right direction, the Union"s common foreign and security policy is still largely in its embryonic stages. Secondly, the considerable sums of money given to the Palestinian Authority were not enough to improve the lot of the Palestinian people; quite the opposite. To be more specific, I should in fact say that, on the one hand, these funds were used in an inappropriate manner, and on the other hand, their distribution was hindered by the administrative obstacles put up by the Israeli authorities and by the repeated closures of the territories in the wake of attacks.</p>
<p class="contents">On this particular point, I would like to express my own personal belief that it is not advisable to link the resumption and continuation of the peace process to a cessation of terrorist activities. The terrorists" very goal is to block the path to peace, and those who plant the bombs will continue with their terrible acts as long as their crimes serve their political objective: to bury the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, like our rapporteur, I would like to stress the need for the European Union to establish a common position as quickly as possible, especially with the prospect of 4 May 1999.</p>

According to the final declaration, that future is to be based on more extensive political dialogue and the development of economic cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Not, unfortunately. a political success, the Conference has left us only the euro‐partnerships as a tangible sign of what might be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">That being so, it seems to me exaggerated to talk today in terms of a Mediterranean policy of the Union, particularly since, three years on, some Mediterranean countries have still to be invited to take part in the Barcelona process.</p>
<p class="contents">However, given the existential problems the Community is facing, the establishment of a well‐structured Mediterranean policy which is not abandoned at the conceptual stage, but set at the more appropriate regional policy level, could prove a real litmus test, the first step, at last, towards defining appropriate Community policies.</p>
<p class="contents">We share the view of those who are rediscussing the scope of EU foreign policy and consider that it cannot continue to look to the north of the Community and to Central and Eastern Europe, although these are certainly important regions of the old continent, finally restored to democracy and socio‐economic progress. We should in fact also be deeply concerned to see the Mediterranean region resume its historical role as a linchpin, a bridge between cultures and human and economic societies.</p>
<p class="contents">And the fact is that this region is currently in the grip of extremely difficult problems and tensions, no doubt influenced by a resurgence of fundamentalism. But that could be resolved with the Union's help, as part of the current financial aid measures, through a programme which allows disadvantaged countries gradually to reduce their foreign debt burden, reinvesting those sums in projects for economic reconstruction and defining common rules spanning all the problems of immigration – its objective being aid for socio‐economic development throughout the region.</p>

The trouble is that this has not happened, and there is no sign that it will happen. Having extended the lifetime of the nuclear power stations with the help of EU aid, the applicant countries now claim that the safety of their nuclear plants has become so good that there is no reason at all to close them down. The Adam report has not taken this into account. It does not link aid to the demand for closure in the long term. Nor does it spell out a clear policy for financing the form of energy which will replace the nuclear plants. On top of that, the nuclear power industry in the West is also having its lifetime extended. The order book was more or less empty, but with EU money a new and lucrative market has emerged. The June Movement recognises the right of countries to choose and manage their own forms of energy, including nuclear power. But under no circumstances will we be party to giving economic aid to maintain nuclear power as an energy source, at the expense of developing more environmentally friendly sources of energy. The June Movement will indeed vote for a short‐term improvement in reactor safety, if it is aimed at phasing out nuclear power. The Greens' amendments provided for that, but since they were all rejected, we have voted against the Adam report.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Ahern </span> <span class="bold">(V), </span> <span class="italic">in writing. ‐</span> Despite the decline of nuclear power in Europe, the EU continues to waste massive resources on promoting, researching and developing it, via the Euratom Treaty. It was one of the three original treaties of the European Union, and still maintains the ‘atoms for peace" lie in a legal constitutional form, so as to ‘permit the advancement of the cause of peace" (recital 1) ‘by creating the conditions necessary for the speedy establishment and growth of nuclear industries" (Article 1). While the European Parliament has a major say on the EU Budget, it has, exceptionally, no real control over the activities which take place under the anachronistic and non‐transparent Euratom Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The European nuclear industry, having been badly hit by Chernobyl, has turned that around into a business opportunity. They have made millions of ecu working on nuclear safety projects in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, funded largely by the EU. However, EU Court of Auditors Special Report No 25/98 on the PHARE‐TACIS nuclear safety programmes recently showed that no real safety improvement has taken place, as we have claimed for years (and was shown in a Parliament STOA study commissioned at the initiative of the Greens), so that over 800 MECU have been largely wasted on producing reports.</p>
<p class="contents">And yet, the European Commission is currently considering three safety‐related Euratom loans, for the completion of Khmelnitski 2 and Rovno 4 (k2/r4) in Ukraine as part of the Chernobyl closure agreement, for Kallinin unit 3 in Russia and for Kozloduy units 5 &amp; 6 in Bulgaria, all Soviet designed reactors. These projects neatly illustrate the sort of problems associated with EU enlargement negotiations as far as the safety of nuclear power plants is concerned. Ukrainian President Kuchma has written that his country originally wanted gas‐fired stations as part of the Chernobyl closure deal, but the G7, looking after the interests of their nuclear industries, forced Ukraine to accept the completion of these two VVER 1 000 MW reactors, whose construction had been abandoned after the collapse of the USSR, and which have not been that well preserved in their incomplete state.</p>
<p class="contents">The Least Cost Study on this project carried out by a panel led by Prof. John Surrey of SPRU at Sussex University showed that they were far from least cost, and yet the Commission and G7 continue to press the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to fund these reactors (190 MECU), alongside Euratom's 400 MECU, in breach of all rational procedures, technical and financial concerns. Energy saving is clearly the least cost investment in Ukraine, where energy intensity is an order of magnitude higher than in the EU, a situation common to the former Eastern bloc states.</p>
<p class="contents">Kozloduy illustrates another crucial aspect of this problem. Units 1‐4 are of the more dangerous VVER 440‐230 type, and should be closed forthwith. Bulgaria made a closure agreement with the Nuclear Safety Account run by the EBRD for the G24 countries in return for finance, but the conditions attached had to be carried out by Bulgaria, allowing them to legitimately extend the closure dates by not meeting those conditions, which they have now done.</p>
<p class="contents">In both cases the interests of the Western nuclear industry takes precedence over everything else, something that must be changed during the rest of the enlargement negotiations – firm dates without escape clauses for the reactors are essential as a pre‐condition for entry to the EU. It is of course worth noting that there are equally dangerous nuclear installations in the EU, such as the UK Magnox reactors, which have no secondary containment, not to mention all of the unstable high‐level waste and other dangerous materials associated with the UK and French reprocessing plants (something not found in Eastern Europe).</p>
<p class="contents">Nuclear power will leave a heritage of nuclear waste, for tens of thousands of generations to come. But, a more subtle heritage is to be found in the permanently altered genetic stock of every living thing on the planet. Atmospheric nuclear weapons testing was the first of many reckless activities to spread radio‐isotopes all over the planet, which is why the military scientists made sure that radiations standards were set at an unreasonably high level, so as to avoid consequent claims against the weapons states that they had compromised the health of the human race. This problem is still with us today, as the science is manipulated, prevented or simply neglected, which shows that despite the reductions in levels, they are still way too high, as was demonstrated in a Parliament workshop initiated by the Greens, the basis of a STOA study published on this matter. What is worse, the Radiation Standards Directive (Euratom/96/29), which should protect the public and workers as from 2000, actually has features which facilitates the dilution and recycling of radioactive waste, so that consumer products might even contain these materials and no one would know. A radical revision is urgently needed, before these materials are released. And the new areas of radiation protection research need to be urgently pursued by the EU, such as Genomic Instability and DNA mini‐satellite research, so that we find out the long‐term effects of low‐level exposure.</p>

It is essential that in the new enlargement process nuclear safety is put at the heart of the negotiations. Agenda 2000, the European Commission's Framework for the Development of the European Union, states that most of the power stations operating in the applicant countries are still using Soviet technology and do not meet international safety standards.</p>
<p class="contents">From an EU perspective, reactors are placed in three categories: reactors of Western design, reactors of Soviet design and unsafe reactors. The European Commission must agree to an energy strategy for each of these countries under partnership and cooperation agreements in which provision is made for the closure of unsafe nuclear reactors at an agreed date.</p>
<p class="contents">While the initial assessment by the European Commission and the Agenda 2000 programme is not sufficiently detailed, the Mochovce plant in Slovakia which is still operating must be singled out for special attention. If this plant is to meet international safety standards, together with other nuclear installations in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Bulgaria, modernisation programmes will take at least seven to ten years to ensure that the highest environmental and public health standards are met. Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Slovenia and Slovakia also have to find solutions for the storage of the nuclear waste that they produce.</p>
<p class="contents">All these problems are broad in their implications for the European Union and we must ensure that no enlargement of EU takes place until we are sure that the nuclear plants operating in the applicant countries meet the highest international safety standards. This is not going to be a particularly easy task. For example, it is now fourteen years since the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl. It is hard to believe that this nuclear plant is still a key supplier of energy needs for the people of Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that Western finances will still be needed to close this nuclear plant down once and for all. The overall cost involved in ensuring that no further environmental or public health affects arise from the plant is estimated at £1.7 billion. This is designed to ensure that the two reactors which are still functioning at Chernobyl are safely closed down and defused.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will have a role in this process and I welcome the fact that they have contributed close to $ 200 million last year alone to help the Ukrainian Government to close down the Chernobyl Plant in the near future</p>

Retrogressive nuclear policies are increasingly being abandoned, a process which has led amongst other things to decisions by Sweden and Germany to begin the phasing‐out of nuclear power. It would be more than desirable if the Central and Eastern European countries and the New Independent States did the same.</p>
<p class="contents">The report from Mr Adam and the Energy Committee contains several points which, in my opinion, tend in the opposite direction (encouragement instead of the phasing‐out of nuclear power). For example, the nuclear power industry in the EU countries is encouraged to continue its activities in the countries concerned. I consider on the contrary that the EU must provide economic support to help those countries commit themselves to moving away from nuclear power. In this context, the economically stronger EU countries must offer help.</p>
<p class="contents">I have misgivings with regard to the assistance programmes addressed by the report, in view of the problems which have arisen hitherto in the EU's assistance programmes, on which the Court of Auditors presented a report last year. The problems seem to be very wide‐ranging, and the money which the EU had set aside has not brought about any noticeable improvements. This is a serious matter, and the EU should consider how support for the phasing‐out of nuclear power and support for renewable energy and efficient use of energy should be formulated in order to produce tangible results.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in the vote I have supported all the amendments which we tabled in the Green Group and which are of great importance for the future.</p>

There is nothing surprising about that, but it explains, amongst other things, why we believe the euro is a political instrument for closer integration. Individual Member States should insist on following their own economic policies, including their own policies on tax, VAT and employment. The heart of state sovereignty is having independent instruments to manage the economy. With the euro, the states have to give up this right and subordinate themselves to the interests of the Union, thereby undermining what is best for the individual state. The EU should not meddle with the economic instruments of the Member States. Monetary union and a central bank will not be able to survive in the long run unless they are controlled by a common government and a common parliament. Therefore, monetary union must either be followed by a new leap towards political integration or perish.</p>
<p class="contents">In principle, we believe that voluntary coordination of economic policies and currency cooperation between the Member States could be an excellent idea, but this report does not prepare the way for voluntary coordination. On the contrary, it maintains that the Member States should be <span class="italic">committed</span> to coordinating fiscal policy (paragraph 43). The report calls for systematic coordination of the taxation of enterprises, capital and energy. We do not think the EU should be deciding macro‐economic goals and instruments, which are the essence of democracy in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore voting against this report. However, we do share the report's concerns about the global economic crisis. We endorse the report's criticism of the EU's inability to fight European unemployment, which has admittedly fallen, but is still very high.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Theonas </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL), </span> <span class="italic">in writing. – (EL)</span> The Commission regards the growth of the European economy over the past year as broadly positive, although it appears rather worried about the repercussions of the international economic and financial crisis. It acknowledges that these repercussions are already visible in the economy of the European Union, and forecasts a slowdown in growth for 1999. The conclusion it has reached on what should happen is based on the well‐known logic of unilateral austerity, further reducing financial deficits and the public debt, and strengthening anti‐inflationary policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission fails to mention that the stifling restrictions on national budgets will limit the scope for action in the event of the crisis deepening. It fails to explain why, despite ever‐increasing returns on investments, increased profits, reduced labour costs and low interest rates, there has been no stimulation of private investment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and the report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy both call for measures to reverse the downward trend in public investment. But how will this come about, when the scope for action is extremely restricted as a result of the obligations deriving from the Treaty on European Union and the stability and growth pact? Our fear is that this will lead to a reorganisation of budget infrastructure, resulting in further cuts in social spending.</p>
<p class="contents">We are particularly concerned by the attempt to bring about closer links between the procedure for approving general economic measures and the policy on employment. While admitting that the EU and Member States have failed to tackle unemployment, the Commission is further subjecting wage policy and the other aspects of employment policy to the requirements of the Maastricht criteria and the stability and growth pact. A typical example of its hypocrisy is that we were initially told that adding a chapter on employment to the Treaty would solve the problem. Subsequently, we were told that the process to implement the relevant provisions was to begin. Then we were told about special measures that were to be decided upon at the European Council meeting in Vienna. Now we are being told to wait for the European Employment Pact, but although this is now at the drafting stage, it merely covers the same ground as the German action plan on employment. It is clear that the idea of greater convergence of the political choices made in terms of the general direction of economic policies and employment policies, as called for by the Commission and by the majority of those in the European Parliament, is resulting in more job opportunities in the sense of an increase in part‐time and atypical forms of employment, as well as an undesirable restructuring of the social security system. Moreover, the two reports that were published by the Commission on structural policies, known as Cardiff I and II, call for greater flexibility and for greater changes to be made in labour relations and in the labour market, which the Commission regards as the extra key ingredient in our macro‐economic endeavours. We are also seeing that almost all new jobs are part time, while the number of full‐time jobs is falling.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has failed to state that it will take decisive initiatives at international level in order to limit the movement of capital for profit and to promote productive investment. We call on the Commission to include in the next round of multilateral negotiations the problems created for international monetary and financial stability by the unchecked movements of capital, and to promote the adoption of measures such as the Tobin tax.</p>
<p class="contents">It is painfully evident to the people of Europe that the policy currently being followed will get us nowhere. It is clear that there is no future for the deception perpetrated on the people of Europe through insipid debates about employability and entrepreneurship. With increasing force and coordination, the people of Europe are demanding specific measures in favour of full‐time, stable employment, budgets for the redistribution of income in favour of working people, an end to the scandalous impunity enjoyed by multinationals, a totally different policy in Europe, and that the Member States should pave the way for sweeping changes which will promote peace, progress and social prosperity.</p>
