<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. Madam President, as Parliament knows, Nigeria went through an important test of its stability and of its democratic development in the election cycle of April and May. We in the European Commission supported these elections through an assistance programme of EUR 6.5 million which went to the Independent National Election Commission, directed at the education of voters and which supported domestic observation organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time we deployed an Election Observation Mission. The mission has concluded its operation in Nigeria and I am delighted that Mr van den Berg will be able to present his findings to Parliament here today.</p>
<p class="contents">I thanked the chief observer in a press statement I made on 5 May 2003. I am glad to repeat here today what I said in that statement. The head of the mission and his team did an extremely professional job. We thank the honourable Member and his colleagues for the dedicated way in which they completed this exceptionally difficult task. I would also like to thank Mrs Junker, who represented the European Parliament delegation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Election Observation Mission dealt formidably with the challenges of a long deployment, the challenges of working in a large and complex country, and the challenge as well of dealing with three difficult election days.</p>
<p class="contents">The elections did not trigger the widespread violence which had been feared by many. I shall say straightaway that this was a relief to all of us and is the best news to come out of these election campaigns. The absence of violence is a necessary, but not, as the philosophers might put it, a sufficient condition for democratic elections.</p>
<p class="contents">What the European Union Election Observation Mission saw was, as Parliament will know, disappointing. There was serious fraud in many states, there were various irregularities in others and overall there were systemic problems like unreliable voters’ registers, a lack of secrecy and insufficient safeguards against double voting. Those were some of the sad features of these elections.</p>
<p class="contents">The reactions of the government and the national election commission have likewise been disappointing. Instead of verifying and addressing shortcomings, they criticised our Election Observation Mission. They did not question reported facts, but rather said they were questioning the mission’s cultural understanding of those facts.</p>
<p class="contents">Explaining electoral fraud as the result of cultural differences seems both far-fetched and self-defeating. Furthermore, it has been proved on other occasions that, despite problems, relatively transparent elections can be held in Africa. We saw that, for example, in Kenya last December.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to note that the findings of domestic observer groups, which had deployed almost 50 000 observers covering one third of all polling stations, were very similar to those of the European Union's Election Observation Mission.</p>
<p class="contents">We note that President Obasanjo – who was sworn in on 29 May 2003 – and his party have greatly strengthened their electoral position in the country. While the President remains an important partner for us, we will have to keep an eye on the development of pluralism in Nigeria's democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say one other thing. The Election Observation Missions that we support, invariably under the leadership of Members of this House, are one of the most important ways in which we provide practical assistance for the development and strengthening of democracy around the world. They are one of the most practical ways in which we improve governance, not least in poorer developing countries. But it is imperative that the integrity of the process and of what we are trying to do is maintained. I decline to take the view that we should hedge the conclusions of our Election Observation Missions around with political considerations.</p>
<p class="contents">Once we are seen to be politicising this process, it will cease to carry any weight and frankly will cease to be the valuable instrument it is at the moment for the development and enhancement of democracy. However convenient it may seem to some to bowdlerise the conclusions of missions, however inconvenient it may seem to some to tell the truth about what experienced observers have seen on the ground, we have to be absolutely clear on every occasion that our Election Observation Missions have the job of telling it as it is. We have as good a record as anyone in this area and I would not want to see us detract from that by one centimetre.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again I would like to pay a tribute to the honourable Member and to all those who worked with him. They have done an outstanding job and I hope that the House will continue to provide equally effective heads for these missions in the years ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

His report is factual, fair and frank, and I find it disappointing that the Council report – perhaps for obvious reasons – was not as strong in its comments. In future I hope that the institutions will try and speak with one voice. As the Commissioner has just said, we have to be outspoken and condemn wrongdoings or there is no point in observing.</p>
<p class="contents">The Nigerian elections were a classic example of how important election observation by the EU institutions is and how important it is to have observers out in the polling stations. The sight of observers not only ensures that misdemeanours are spotted, it also encourages voters that the outside world is taking an interest in making sure that rules are observed and democracy and freedom of choice are being given a chance.</p>
<p class="contents">I have always believed that it is difficult to transpose a European-style election procedure onto some developing countries, as they do not have the capacity to properly prepare the paperwork. It is in this area that we in Europe could help by increasing our support to strengthen procedures. It is extremely disappointing that some regions showed such a blatant disregard for honesty and transparency, and these are well documented by the chief observer. Action <span class="italic">should</span> be taken by the appropriate bodies to rectify such anomalies, and we here should continue to monitor what happens.</p>
<p class="contents">President Obasanjo has the potential to be one of the great leaders in the new Africa and should not be tarnished by the behaviour of some of his supporters. Nigeria is one of the largest and, potentially, richest countries in sub-Saharan Africa. With good governance, it can set an example not only for the region but also for the whole continent. However, to do that it must set aside the ethnic differences of the north and south, outlaw the extremes of Sharia law and work together towards economic prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">In the African Union and NEPAD Nigeria can take a leading role in building a regenerated Africa under the Cotonou Accord, so it is disappointing it did not set a better example at these elections. There were blatant and obvious misdemeanours, both before and during the elections, but we must look ahead to the future, correcting the mistakes of the past – by legislation where necessary – and we must encourage it to do so. The chief observer's report should point it in the right direction. I sincerely hope Nigeria will take note and take action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van den Berg (PSE). </span></span>  – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, I have the honour today of presenting the EU Observation Mission's final report on the elections in Nigeria, which is being handed out as I speak. The report is very extensive and contains a lot of information and many recommendations. There is far too much information to sum up in three minutes, but it is all in there for you to read up. I would like to mention a few conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, it is, I think, important to establish that the Nigerian population, and many of its socially active organisations, greatly value this modern instrument of external EU policy. I am in total agreement with the Commissioner on this point. It is an effective instrument to promote peace, stability and democracy. The EU should be proud of this 'soft power'<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the mission, invited by the Nigerian Government, was the longest and most extensive mission which the EU has ever accomplished. I had the privilege of working with a very proficient core team, efficient departments in Brussels and with an enthusiastic observation team comprising over one hundred members. The findings of our mission have been widely discussed, both worldwide and within Nigeria. The main thing was that we identified the election fraud we discovered for what it actually was, rather than putting it into perspective or concealing it. We did not mince our words. This, quite simply, was what we owed to the Nigerian electorate.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, we established extensive systematic fraud in six federal states during the governor and presidential elections on 19 April and we discovered serious shortcomings in another five federal states. The same happened on 3 May, but then there were seven instead of six. Our findings correspond to those of 10 000 national election observers.</p>
<p class="contents">Simply to call this fraud Nigerian fraud is unacceptable and an insult to the Nigerian population. It is, in fact, evidence of the over-organisation of those in power and not of underdevelopment. If we realise that about half of all the states have electoral problems, this brings into focus the significance of the legal cases which are now being brought before the specially instituted election tribunals. It remains a very serious matter that meanwhile, the central and regional INEC – the election council – was unwilling, not allowed or unable, to do anything about the election fraud that was discovered. It was, and still is, their task.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the Commissioner actively to promote the EU, via the local EU delegation – under the excellent leadership of Leonidas – with the backing of local lawyers' organisations, being given the opportunity of actively following these election tribunals – without any involvement of course, for that is not up to us – and to inform the Council and Parliament accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to ask the Commission to reconsider its aid contract with Nigeria, which affects many states, in such a way – and I am not at all in favour of sanctions or similar action, for that would be wrong – that it becomes possible to shift, as it were, the resources for federal states which will not obtain a democratic structure or new elections – such as the federal state of Ogun – to civilian projects of democratic states.</p>
<p class="contents">May I finally say to the Council that its statement contravened the facts. There was a low turnout and few women took part. Results showing a high level of participation had simply been falsified. The Council should have taken a more professional stance. It should speak with one voice. This would really be more helpful than engaging in external foreign politics. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
