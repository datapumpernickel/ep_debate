It is unfortunate that we now have to round up this important debate, which is important on its own merits. If I can use this opportunity, I would just like to say that it would perhaps be sensible if in future, for example, we do not manage to vote on a Tuesday evening, we could squeeze in an extra round of voting, so that we do not incur further delays during the rest of the week. You might be able to submit this to the Bureau for their consideration. But this is, of course, not really related to these issues. I do not need to add too many explanatory notes. </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it is indisputable that non-governmental organisations play a vital role in Member States, in the European Union and outside of the European Union. Everyone is agreed on this. This is something which the Council states, and which is backed up frequently by the Commission and this Parliament. Also, Article 136 of the European Treaty, in combination with declarations 23 and 38, underlines that cooperation with <span class="italic">Wohlfahrtsverbände </span>(welfare associations) is necessary, and these are also non-governmental organisations, of course. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has always put its money where its mouth is and has for some time, for some considerable time, created a line, B3 4101 in order to finance non-governmental organisations. However, as a result of different provisions which have been agreed in conjunction with the Council, and following judgments by the Court of Justice, this line has now more or less expired after three years. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission has been aware of this for three years. This is not the issue. This issue is that so little is happening. On the one hand, the great need is staring us in the face while on the other we see little in the way of specific action, except for the document which the Commission has issued and which we are specifically asking after. </p>
<p class="contents">The six million dollar question now is how we can translate the finely worded ideas we have all expressed into reality. What I am saying on my own behalf, not on behalf of the Commission, is that bureaucratic issues are bound to crop up. The reason for this could be that there are different Commission directorates involved. NGOs are not restricted to one directorate general. It could be that they are looking for a general angle and at the same time specific angles, but at any rate, this is all taking up too much time, as the budget lines are expiring. </p>
<p class="contents">This is also the reason why we are drawing the Commission’s attention to this issue this evening, in itself not a very appropriate time. Speed is the main issue. It is not so much the Commission’s intention which is at issue, but the speed with which certain things can be brought about. We might otherwise run the risk of failing to implement not just a core task stipulated in the European Treaty, but also what has been stated by the European Council in Feira, because NGOs – and this is the only problem – are extremely sensitive, at least the majority of them, to breaks in payments to them. They are far more sensitive to this than other organisations, and certainly Member States. This means that if we wait around for too long, the patient will die. This is the serious concern which we have in our committee. This is the reason why we are asking these questions and this is also the reason why we hope that the Commission will tackle this matter with due haste within the scope which the Treaty offers and within the generally benevolent climate which the Council and Commission have displayed in Feira, as witnessed by the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Verheugen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, the Commission has received some 40 different comments on its discussion paper entitled “The Commission and Non-Governmental Organisations. Building a Stronger Partnership”. These comments have been published on its website and on the Europa server. Currently, various working groups set up by the directorates that have most contact with the NGOs are taking the ideas set out in the discussion paper further on the basis of these comments.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">At present, these working groups are concentrating on the question of grants to cover running costs and measures to improve consultation with NGOs. This latter point will be dealt with by setting out guidelines for best practice in consultation with the NGOs, as already provided under Action 4 of the White Paper on reforming the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Justice’s ruling on case C 106/96 together with the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 October 1998 on the legal bases have altered the conditions for financing social non-governmental organisations. Moreover, the new rules on financing must be observed to the letter in all programmes and budget lines. Against this background, organisations financed in the past will continue to be financed in future only if they satisfy the conditions set out in the decisions on certain action programmes, which will form the legal basis for the budget line in question.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the two programmes could be cofinanced from 2001 on, provided they are approved by the Council, that is to say the Council and Parliament. As stated in the Commission proposals, the rules set out in the guidelines and the procedures for core-funding would have to be observed. A limited number of NGO networks and platforms at European level with experience in combating discrimination and social exclusion would be eligible for grants, for both the programmes I have mentioned do after all relate to discrimination or exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">The criteria for deciding which organisations receive grants will be determined in agreement with the relevant programme committee. The Commission will then approve the annual grants on the basis of detailed work plans and funding plans.</p>
<p class="contents">The NGOs have already welcomed the guideline for the administration of financial aid that entered into force in 1999 as progress. The conditions set out in it will be incorporated in the budgetary rules and their implementing provisions in due course. The Commission is well aware of the importance of promoting the civil dialogue ands attaches great value to cooperation with non-governmental organisations, especially in the social field.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past years a large number of social NGO projects have been funded thanks to the setting up of various European networks and the European platform of the social NGOs. The two programmes proposed by the Commission – combating discrimination and social exclusion – should basically cover the running costs of the social NGOs that operate on a Europe-wide basis.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also takes the view that civil society plays a most important role in the European Union. In effect there are a variety of actions in a variety of fields – social affairs, the environment, education, development, agriculture, etc. – that have helped build up a stronger partnership, as was emphasised in the working document on the Commission and the NGOs adopted on 18 January 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">Closer involvement of the citizens and new forms of partnership with civil society are among the Commission’s top priorities. That was made very plain in the documents entitled “The Commission’s Strategic Objectives for 2000-2005. In line with these priorities, the President and several members of the Commission have made it clear on many occasions how much importance they attach to the civil dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">The guidelines for best practice in consultation with the NGOs that I mentioned earlier are meant as a first step in that direction. The President of the Commission intends to consider the question of the dialogue with the citizens in the framework of the White Paper on strengthening democracy in Europe. That White Paper will be published by the end of next year.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the next Treaty, as you know the Commission has already set out its position on the agenda of the current Intergovernmental Conference. The subject of the civil dialogue was not addressed because the main purpose of that Intergovernmental Conference is to prepare the EU institutions for enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Pronk pointed out in his statement that the problem is not so much one of strategy and objectives but of speed. I firmly agree and would assure him that we will do our utmost to speed things up. But allow me to give you the benefit of my personal experience after nine months of activity within the Commission. It is very difficult to speed up anything in the Commission because there is no other international institution that has to work with as many different and at times conflicting rules and procedures as the European Commission. So perhaps those who would wish certain things to move faster should also try to help simplify the procedures.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I thought the response by the Commissioner was encouraging on its own merits. I think he is right in stating that we in Parliament should make every effort not to obstruct procedures. I should point out, however, that we in Parliament have tried our hardest, using all the means at our disposal, to keep those budget lines up and running that enabled us to continue financing NGOs. This can only be stretched so far and speed is then of the essence. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make one last point following on from the official reply by the Commissioner on the Intergovernmental Conference. It is, in fact, not so much the content of the present Treaty or present declarations which is at issue, in fact he is more concerned to adapt these declarations, presumably in such a way as to form a legal basis from them, so that a programme can be based on them. This is the problem, in fact, and I would ask the Commissioner whether it would be possible to give this matter further attention within the Commission. As such, we are thus not asking for a new treaty, but for some attention. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, because we are of course involved in the development of NGOs in the new Member States, in the context of enlargement, we believe that this should be given extremely high priority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have to say that I was not totally satisfied by the Commissioners' responses, in that the documents that were referred to, with which we are familiar, as Mr Pronk said, need to contain time frames and rather more practical decision. </p>
<p class="contents">As we know, we have been discussing the issue for years. Parliament has played a fundamental role in this dialogue, but it is now time to move on from dialogue and declarations to concrete action. The Commission needs to start putting forward practical solutions, for otherwise the issue will never be resolved. I can see a certain contradiction and I am concerned, and I believe I speak for the rest of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs as well, that behaviour within the Commission in relation to the issue appears to be somewhat contradictory.</p>
<p class="contents">The role of the non-governmental organisations in the democratic construction of the Union and the economic and social role they play in Europe, the entire social economy sector, the third sector, is now acknowledged in practice as well as in documents – if we consider that approximately nine million workers are employed in this sector – as a major sector of fundamental importance. Well, the most recent decisions of the Commission – and I refer to the Directorate-General for Industry – have labelled this a negative priority – they have now invented the concepts of positive and negative priorities – and have abolished the 'social economy' operative unit. In my opinion, this is extremely serious and leaves us extremely sceptical as to whether the declarations made repeatedly in this House, which we have heard on several occasions, will be followed by practical action in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">The NGO platform, with which Parliament and the Commission have maintained dialogue, and all those involved feel as if they have been taken for a ride, and I think that we parliamentarians also feel rather as if we have been deceived, when declarations are made saying one thing and then, in reality, practical decisions lead to another. </p>
<p class="contents">The absence of an interlocutor on the administrative side apart from anything else will make it all the more difficult to resolve these problems rather than making it easier. So if we genuinely want to make positive progress, speed up the procedures and provide positive responses for the European citizens as well as the Non-Governmental Organisations, in my opinion, we need to rethink a whole series of decisions which have been taken and, most importantly, change them.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lambert (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, many of us in the Group of Greens and the European Free Alliance have our roots in the NGO and activist movement, so it is very dear to our hearts. Earlier today we discussed the annual report of the Committee on Petitions, that is the complaints end of the process of evaluating what is going on within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The NGOs in our view act as part of the preventive process. They provide a scrutiny mechanism, they provide a way of making sure that we do not lose aspects of the legislation that we are doing. They make us think of new things and they are essential to our process. They are one of the few organisations which are really active on the citizens' behalf and if we are trying to create confidence within the structures we are trying to build, their role is absolutely essential. It is really important that they are there to counterbalance a lot of the business interests which do not seem to have financial difficulties in finding a path to our door, whereas for a lot of NGOs working internationally is enormously expensive.</p>
<p class="contents">The work we have been doing in various committees over the last few weeks on Article 13, the anti-discrimination article, would have been impossible without the input of those bodies. So the need to sort out a clear legal basis for their participation, and hence their funding, is absolutely essential, because this body cannot work properly without them.</p>
<p class="contents">Reference was made to the applicant countries, and I would echo the words of my colleague, Mr Pronk, that the NGO and civil society movement in those countries is going to be essential if we are going to have a European Union based on values of justice and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge that we find a way of establishing a serious and reliable funding mechanism for those organisations that represent the poor, the excluded and the discriminated against at least, so that they are not scrabbling for funds every year, wondering if they are going to survive so they can do the job they exist to do.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As long as the Member States are of the basic opinion that social issues should be dealt with by the Member States themselves, there will be no rapid change. We are, of course, aware that those funds which do exist are strictly budgeted for and that it is difficult to move funds around within the budget. It is difficult to meet new needs while the Member States have this attitude.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, I believe that it is particularly important for those of us who work in the EU institutions to concentrate on according much greater importance than we have until now to the non-governmental public organisations in Europe operating in the social sphere. I am sure everyone can see that there is a need for transnational activities in the social sphere, too. There is, therefore, a place for non-governmental organisations. It would, however, be unfortunate, and that is perhaps the way the Member States see it, if the non-governmental social organisations were to be strongly bound, financially and politically, to the EU – more so than they are already becoming. Their worth lies precisely in the fact that they are non-governmental and civic and are able to see social problems from a different perspective than the authorities. In that way, they constitute a complement or alternative to the Commission, the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I will take the opportunity to make a suggestion, despite there not being many people listening (there are only around six MEPs in the House). I propose that the Commission try to set up a European fund for this purpose with the non-governmental organisations in the social sphere. I propose that the Commission turn to the Council and the Member States to try to get them to contribute to such a fund. This fund ought to be set up as an independent institution whose board of directors is made up of people from the social organisations themselves, together with researchers and experts in the social sphere.</p>
<p class="contents">One might imagine that such an organisation would escape some of the bureaucratic problems. Financial supervision could be exercised by professional auditors.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that if we set to work on a task like this with a certain diplomatic tactfulness, the Member States would react positively to the proposal. I also believe that all other parties – the socially disadvantaged, the non-governmental organisations, the Member States and the EU institutions – would all be very pleased with such an institution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You told us that the Commission was active in meeting the operating costs of NGOs, but what we Members of Parliament want is to ensure that all NGOs, may be supported and funded on the basis of a number of practical projects. For, nowadays, it is the major NGOs which have the opportunity to respond to a number of invitations to tender: <span class="italic">Médecins du monde</span>, <span class="italic">Médecins sans frontières</span>, the Red Cross and so on and so forth. That is my first comment.</p>
<p class="contents">You must be aware of the problems experienced by a good number of smaller NGOs in being able to respond to a number of invitations to tender. The work they do in terms of relations and competencies is, however, just as important as that of the major NGOs, but some of them do not have the same administrative facilities that some major NGOs have.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, what we would also like to see is the needs of NGOs being satisfied before a major tragedy occurs. Let me take just one example, the protection of childhood. For four years, a number of Members of Parliament have been fighting for funding for associations working to combat child abuse. Our attempts have been ignored. It was not until the Dutroux case that we were able to obtain a budget line enabling two programmes to be run: Daphne and STOP. Today, regrettably, only one programme is left, the Daphne programme. I can tell you that, as experts on matters to do with small children, a number of NGOs would indeed love to be able to respond to specific invitations to tender.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I feel it advisable to simplify the procedures and that, in this connection – I do not know if this has to be a fund –, the Commission should, at least initially, make a service available to NGOs, enabling them to obtain information on the work carried out by other parties and, possibly, establish networks on certain topics in order, ultimately, to be able to submit tenders to the Commission when offers come up.</p>
<p class="contents">That, Commissioner, is what I wished to say. We shall make progress in the social sector because we know that we have to make progress in terms of cooperation in that sector. We need time for this. This is precisely why, given that social matters are essentially part of the remit of NGOs, we must make progress in the matter of civil dialogue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European social NGOs are playing a critical role in our work. Anyone who went through the Article 13 discrimination package could see this. Since the 1998 budget crisis which saw the freezing of funds destined for NGO work with some of the most vulnerable people in Europe and the developing world, much progress has been made. The Portuguese presidency broke new ground and invited the European aid platform to the Lisbon informal social affairs summit and the French presidency is following suit. These kinds of initiatives were recognised in the conclusions of the Lisbon summit.</p>
<p class="contents">But words are not enough and two years after the 1998 budget crisis, the difficulties continue. There have been two years of consultations with NGOs and all the Commission has come up with is a discussion paper and two internal working groups which have hardly met. Meanwhile NGOs, and I worked in the NGO field, are being squeezed by bureaucratic rules which were introduced to promote accountability and transparency but which in the end have created more red tape.</p>
<p class="contents">The troubles of NGOs Mr President are further compounded by this House when it makes difficult rules on co-finance requirements which are set with the tightest deadlines. The one budget line that we had – B3-4101 has been scrapped and the Commission has failed to come up with a proposal for a legal base for the civil dialogue either through suggesting a Council regulation or a Treaty article. Worse, the social NGOs have been told by the Commission that they will need to be funded through our new discrimination and social exclusion budget lines. How can that be when the funds for those programmes have been reduced beyond what is reasonable?</p>
<p class="contents">A number of valuable social NGOs are facing serious crises because of the inaction of the Commission and the Council. I saw one NGO which made an application for projects requiring eighty pages of budget sheets and so many supporting papers that one NGO application weighed over twelve kilos.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, that has to change. NGOs are critical to our work and we must support them.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will pass them on and will raise them during the Commission’s debate. Let me just reply briefly to two points. The first concerns the legal bases and the financing. Here we should not forget that one of the characteristics of a non-governmental organisation is that it should not be dependent on public funding. Otherwise it ought to be called a governmental rather than a non-governmental organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">So I do not have very much sympathy for the oft-repeated call for governments or the Commission to assure the financing of non-governmental organisations in full. All they can ever do is provide support and cooperate on projects. That is quite fundamental.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of speakers have addressed the question of non-governmental organisations and enlargement. I will answer them, because this matter is within my direct remit. All the ideas I have heard put forward in this debate have long since become reality. With our pre-accession aid, we are working very closely with the non-governmental organisations in the candidate countries; moreover our communications strategy, the organisational and financial framework of which has now been established, is also very much targeted at non-governmental organisations in candidate countries, since the aim is precisely to fully involve civil society in this important political process.</p>
<p class="contents">I will faithfully report everything else back to the Commission, without omitting to mention what I perceived to be the basically rather critical mood of this debate, and I can assure you that I myself will certainly urge very strongly that procedures are simplified and decisions taken more rapidly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
