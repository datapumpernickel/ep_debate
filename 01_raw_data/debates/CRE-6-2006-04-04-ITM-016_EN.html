It has been appreciated by Member States and the general public alike since its birth 20 years ago in 1985, thanks to Melina Mercouri. The main idea is still to highlight the richness and diversity of European cultures and the features they share, as well as to promote greater mutual acquaintance between European citizens. This is also a topic very close to the previous one.</p>
<p class="contents">However, our experience has shown that some aspects of the current programme of cooperation need improvement, mainly in four areas: competition between cities, the role of the selection panel, the European dimension of the action, and the monitoring process. That is why last year the Commission adopted the proposal that is intended to replace the decision of 1999. That was a parliamentary request voiced by Mrs Prets and I promised at that time personally to introduce a new proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The new system should encourage Member States to organise competition at national level between interested cities. A mixed selection panel should evaluate the applications as part of the national competition. That mixed panel will be made up of seven experts appointed by the institutions, together with six experts to be nominated by the Member State concerned. The Member State will then propose one city to the European institutions. As in the past, the Council will make the final decision concerning the designation of the city.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the proposal lays down streamlined and clearer criteria compared to those in the current decision. Following the designation of the European capitals, a monitoring process will be put in place to provide cities with support and advice in finalising the preparation of the programme and in particular with a view to ensuring that European added value is effectively reflected.</p>
<p class="contents">A prize will be awarded to the European Capitals of Culture that meet the criteria and objectives of that initiative. At the same time, I will propose a substantial increase in the Community contribution to such cities participating in the programme via the Culture 2007 programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased that Parliament, the Council and Commission have worked in close cooperation in order to find compromise amendments suitable for all. This report is in line with the Commission’s approach and clearly improves our proposal, so I think that this new scheme creates a good balance between local and national interests and enhances the European dimension. I am sure that this will increase the transparency of the selection process and the visibility of the action.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to confirm that the Commission welcomes this report and accepts all the compromise amendments. Consequently, I expect adoption of our amended proposal at first reading. I should really like to thank the Committee on Culture and Education and in particular the rapporteur Mrs Prets for her efficiency and effort. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Christa Prets (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, as the Commissioner has already mentioned, some aspects of this 20-year-old agreement were in need of reform. Although a new decision had been presented in 1999, this had overlooked the fact that we were to be joined a few years later by ten new Member States – perhaps even more – and so these new Member States needed to be taken into account. Consequently, we now have a partnership system.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal that was presented to us at that time was unsatisfactory. In 2004, we drew up another new proposal, but an abridged one, as we were in a hurry so as not to obstruct the process for the 2009 and 2010 cities, and thus accepted its shortcomings. The Commission kept its promise, however, and, six months later, did indeed present us with a new draft.</p>
<p class="contents">Our priority is to redefine the role of the panel. We have had problems with it in the past, and so we need to ensure that we have a better one in future. This new draft makes the panel more democratic. This means that the Member States and the candidate countries are represented on the selection panel, at the pre-selection stage, and are able to make their contribution this way: it is not only those in Brussels who have a say, which is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">In the second phase, there is a monitoring and advisory panel, which follows this process critically, but plays a supporting role too instead of just identifying shortcomings. That is very important, as the cities very often feel left alone with their preparations and do not know exactly how to deal with all the rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Competition was another crucial issue; we wanted to strengthen the competitive element. The Member States should bear in mind during the preparatory period that what is important is new cultural activity, and that the public and the individual regions are also involved. Although I am stressing the competition issue, I should also like to point out that there are no doubt some smaller countries who are unable to hold major competitions. In such cases, a single candidate city would be permissible, but it would have to meet all the challenges and requirements for becoming a European Capital of Culture.</p>
<p class="contents">One essential criterion, and a discussion point, is the European dimension. The cities are required to create European added value, and the question is: what is the European added value? How do the cities reflect it? How can we explain to the cities precisely what task they have to perform? The Commission has not managed to define this with absolute precision, which I can understand, as it is very difficult. The Commission has promised to present the best practice model on a website. This website is a very important means of giving guidance and of sharing enquiries and experiences, which is very important to the candidate cities. I would ask the Commissioner to ensure that the guidance and website are indeed present when this project enters into force.</p>
<p class="contents">One satisfactory aspect is the funding – not as regards the amount, as there will be another problem in that regard. The new Financial Perspective is likely to reduce the amount envisaged for the European Capitals of Culture, too, which we greatly regret. If I take as an example the city of Linz, which now has an investment volume of EUR 60 million, but only 0.86% of this comes from the EU, I do wonder why the burdens are so great. Of course, one could say it is a matter of image: it helps the region, it helps the city, we are investing in the future, we are investing in sustainability – this is another important aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst we are on the subject of finances: it is gratifying that this prize is now to be awarded three months in advance. That will undoubtedly help the cities, as up to now the main problem has been that cities are always left worrying about their money after the event, after everything has been concluded. I hope and wish that this is really the case in practice and that, therefore, the European Capitals of Culture do indeed face a very democratic future.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that sustainability, good reputation and the impetus given to art and European culture in general find expression in this report, and also in the activities and implementation that follow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This cooperation, which was previously intergovernmental – it was actually a government action – has now developed into an interinstitutional matter. This means that we enjoy excellent cooperation, and also, as Mrs Prets has already said, our voice has been heard.</p>
<p class="contents">For years, we have been appealing for something substantial for the panel to evaluate and select, for the cities to make an effort to reveal European added value and not just what they already have. This action, in particular, makes us aware of the importance of European culture. The cities are the culture bearers and cultural mediators of the EU. This competition gives them the opportunity to bring a very great deal of elements together; there can be cross-border cooperation between regional cultures.</p>
<p class="contents">I could not agree more about the importance of also holding a competition to this end. Taking Germany as an example, I can say that the competition to find the 2010 European Capital of Culture was a wonderful event, with 10 cities aspiring to be the best. The initiatives they took did not peter out, but are being passed on. They set up a network with the Hungarian cities, and I believe that the Commission should set great store by that. The website is a potential tool for passing on such things, too.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the Commission has now overcome its administrative hurdles and a prize has been established – which is not really a prize, of course, but rather the money owing to a city, and means that the city finally has this money at its disposal as it begins its work. All in all, this action is a very good thing, which, in both this context and that of our previous debate on citizenship, helps the public to see Europe’s great cultural diversity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All members of parliament – I say this for your benefit Mrs Pack – receive letters urging us to support amendments tabled by our honourable friends. This is for the simple reason that we cannot all know the content of the hundreds of amendments tabled. I receive such letters, just like everyone else.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, as regards a comment made by another honourable friend, the committee chairmen exercise their right, like all members of parliament, to table amendments and, even when they believe that they may not be approved in committee, they also have the right – which is not contrary to the Rules of Procedure – to table them in plenary. I think this is something we all do.</p>
<p class="contents">To come back to the point, the cultural capitals are today still the biggest and best organised political institution in Europe. No other cultural action in the European Union has the same range today or, most importantly, the same projection and mass participation on the part of citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, it is hard to think of many other modern European initiatives in the field of culture which have constituted a standard. However, experience has shown, as other honourable Members mentioned, that certain specific aspects of this institution could go no further.</p>
<p class="contents">The main need is to improve the selection method of cultural capitals. This is something that has been done and the honourable Members who participated in the previous committee chaired by Michel Rocard worked a great deal on this. The current framework really does not safeguard competition, as we have heard.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important issue is that the European dimension is often missing from the programme; I have found this to be true of cultural events which I have attended within the framework of three or four cultural capitals.</p>
<p class="contents">The new proposal, on which our rapporteur, Mrs Prets, has done a very good job, tries to reconcile the various viewpoints both within Parliament and within the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to say a couple of words about the prize. It is important, as the Commission proposed, that there should be this prize in honour of Melina Mercouri. The proposal that the prize should carry her name was no coincidence on the part of the Commission or, of course, on the part of the 25 Council representatives who accepted it, because Melina Mercouri was the inspiration, the artist who worked the whole time she was Minister of Culture for this prize to be established. It was therefore her idea and I think that it is important for it to bear her name in future. Of course, there has been a compromise in relation to the initial proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">To finish, I should like to add that the cultural capitals are embraced by the European Union. At the same time, however, apart from independence of choice, what the Member States need as a guideline is to determine better the methods of intervention mainly in infrastructures if not in programmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Prets report is excellently structured and I congratulate the rapporteur on that. Two proposals that I find highly convincing and interesting are the idea of naming the prize that the Commission proposes to award to the chosen city after Melina Mercouri, for the reasons just mentioned by Mr Sifunakis, and the proposal to set up a website creating links between nominated cities, encouraging the exchange of know-how and best practices, and providing information on the candidate cities.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally believe it is essential to strengthen the association between the European Capital of Culture programme and tourism, a major industry, so as to take full advantage of the enormous economic and social potential that an event of this scale can produce, and also to ensure that it acts as a lasting incentive for the development of the city and the surrounding area.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I should like to resubmit the proposal that I put forward in this House during the debate on the Queiró report: to create a European capital of tourism. Further support for this proposal is provided by the enhancement of the urban dimension. The new agenda for 2007-2013 will in fact focus decisively on the role of cities.</p>
<p class="contents">As you can see, Italians are operative. If Mr Stubb, who jokingly described my fellow-countrymen as being incapable of drawing operative conclusions, were still here, I would tell him, equally tongue-in-cheek, that perhaps he has been influenced by some bad examples and by his political friendships.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, I hope that tomorrow Parliament will adopt the Prets report, since it is a thorough, rich text that highlights an important Community scheme designed to bring Europe closer to the people through culture, as well as to encourage the development and revitalisation of cities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even though some of the previous speakers have already mentioned the problems that occurred in specific cases, I should like to emphasise that, so far, the history of the European capitals of culture has by and large been a successful one. The individual cities named as capitals of culture have benefited, but so has Europe as a whole, because, time and again, these European capitals of culture have made it clear how diverse, rich and varied European culture is.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I should like to focus on two aspects of this redrafted report that are particularly important to me. Firstly, the idea of sustainability requires the capital of culture action not to be purely event-based, but to make a real contribution to encouraging greater social interaction, more promotion of art and culture, and new architectural designs. This also includes the issue of structural change, and the value of cultural activities for Europe as a whole. Secondly, the objective of establishing a truly European outlook and exchange and of emphasising European added value is a really decisive point in the redrafting of this programme, and there is still more to be done in this regard. The best way we can win people over and generate enthusiasm is to make it clear what European interaction really is, and not to refer just to what was already available without it, but to get together with many European players and develop new facilities. That will make the idea of European capitals of culture even more attractive in the years to come.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The celebrations have had both positive and negative consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">On the positive side, we have noted a flourishing of creative activity, cultural exchanges abroad and patronage for cultural events. The cities have been promoted and their citizens’ cultural ambitions awakened. On the negative side, I could mention the concentration of effort and resources on specific cultural events at the expense of social and cultural movements in the city and region concerned. I could also refer to the lack of a detailed impact assessment of the programme undertaken, and the imposition on Member States and city authorities of criteria that are often inappropriate to the needs and traditions of the cities and regions. I should comment too on the lack of clarity and transparency regarding the financing of activities from European funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Latterly, a tendency to restrict the role of Member States and selection in identifying European Capitals of Culture has become evident. This is a worrying development and we would do well to consider what is most desirable, effective cooperation or imposing one’s will on others. Personally, I am in favour of dialogue and the creation of conditions for active participation in culture, so as to promote its beauty and diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks are due to Mrs Prets for her report and all the efforts involved. I trust that in the course of future work we shall endeavour to draw on positive experiences. I hope too that we will eliminate aspects that are not conducive to further development and which, on the contrary, limit the cultural diversity that is vital to bringing about integration and national dialogue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nonetheless, I thank Mrs Prets for her work. I shall give you the reasons for my position.</p>
<p class="contents">The project that aims to designate each year a European Capital of Culture gave rise, at the time of its inception, to enthusiasm and to a desire to stand out from the crowd, as well as to the awareness that culture is a valuable asset. For a decade now, the Commission and Parliament have been trying to inject a new dynamic into the project, but they have gone about it using the same resources that are crippling the European project in general. Instead of rebuilding the initial enthusiasm, with citizens who were supposed to identify with the project, the Commission and Parliament are setting themselves up as judges.</p>
<p class="contents">With my amendments, my proposal was to give the Member States the task of designating the European Capital of Culture according to their own criteria. That would have encouraged them to shoulder their responsibilities. Instead of strengthening subsidiarity in order to construct the European identity, an identity that is founded on our diversity, the institutions are now acting as project managers: they dictate, make selections and judge, without, for all that, bearing the cost of their decisions, since the European Union’s financial contribution remains small.</p>
<p class="contents">Bureaucracy rises like a rampart between local initiatives and, Commissioner, I can only hope that future panels will be more conscientious than those who judged the Luxembourg 2007 project without even all being present and without being informed about the plan to extend to the Great Region and without realising that Luxembourg’s proposal to choose Sibiu in Romania as a partner town was to become so innovative. Culture amounts to more than just publicity events.</p>
<p class="contents">The Capital of Culture project should be more than a long firework display of events and, in order to ensure continuity, I proposed to link with the consultations a network of Capitals of Culture to be organised with the support of the Commission. Instead of that we are now witnessing the parody of a network that jumbles together some of those that have been legitimately appointed with those who have assumed this title for themselves. It is time we finally protected the title of the European Capital of Culture. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to congratulate Mrs Prets on a thorough and carefully set out report. It is universally recognised that the programme of the European City of Culture, or European Capital of Culture as it was later renamed, is a well-tried and very useful concept and much credit must be given to those who set it up back in the mid-1980s, especially to the then Greek Culture Minister, Melina Mercouri. She was indeed an inspirational and talented woman who, in her stormy life, fought courageously for democracy and for the promotion of European unity through culture.</p>
<p class="contents">Programmes such as the one we are discussing tonight indisputably help bring European citizens closer together and strengthen the bonds between them. They help promote understanding amongst our people and increase the appreciation of and respect for each others’ diverse but unifying cultural history.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the years some problematic areas have been identified and this Commission proposal, which will eventually be amended by Parliament, will no doubt improve and enhance the programme further. Hopefully, in speaking in what is for me a foreign language – English – I am assisting in unifying our European aspiration to have a common language of communication some time in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of the experience gained in the 20 years that the programme has been in operation, and due to changes necessitated by the recent enlargement, a review is now urgently needed. Two of the main alterations necessary are improvements in the selection procedure to be followed and putting a system in place that will ensure that once a city is chosen, a well-planned programme will be carried out successfully.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight the wisdom of two innovations of the proposal: the pairing-up system and the prize. I do not have time to go into detail. I once again congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our guiding principle must be, and must continue to be, to preserve our own culture and to become acquainted with the cultural riches of other nations. Culture is the most unobtrusive and effective link that binds nations who want to live in peace and mutual cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Capital of Culture makes such a link possible. At the same time, it also offers an opportunity to many host cities for greater investment in cultural facilities and projects, with long–term positive effects on the economy. This project also encourages citizens to become culturally involved and to familiarise themselves with culture in all its dimensions.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the proposal for a prize to be awarded if a city meets the criteria for the European Capital of Culture, as previous organisers have, in many cases, complained about a lack of resources, as the European Union allocated these only after the report had been submitted.</p>
<p class="contents">Our total commitment represents only a fraction of the contribution compared to the amounts invested in European Capitals of Culture by local communities, the Member States concerned or the private sector. For this reason, we must not complicate the process of raising funds with demanding administrative procedures. Instead, we must make the job easier for the organisers, as that alone will contribute to a better relationship between citizens and European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a joint selection panel to nominate the capital city is also a good idea, because it takes more account of the international dimension, and there will be more opportunity for a fairer selection, because on a national level there is a greater chance of bias towards a particular city. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was my pleasant duty to serve as Director of the European Capital of Culture programme at the time.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to state that the European Capitals of Culture programme is the most notable of the programmes emphasising the cultural unity of our continent. Furthermore, it is a programme that arose from the citizens’ initiative. It did not come about on the initiative of any institution such as the Commission or Parliament. Greece and Mrs Mercouri in particular deserve to be congratulated on the idea of finding a way to show what Europe is all about, and what the cultural unity of our continent actually means. In fact, it would be right and proper for this award to be named after Mrs Mercouri, who was then the Greek Minister for Culture, since this is what Greece and Mrs Mercouri deserve.</p>
<p class="contents">How should the role of the European Commission be defined? I am now addressing Commissioner Figeľ in particular. The Commission’s role should be to offer support and advice, to point out errors and counsel on appropriate measures to be taken. It ought not to get involved in administrative issues, as it is so prone to do. In particular, it should guard against such an approach in this instance, as the EUR 500 000 award is just 2% to 5% of the entire fund allocated for implementation of the European Capitals of Culture programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, a way must therefore be found to disseminate relevant information and support Internet sites and other publications. We need to learn the lessons of the successes and failures of former European Capitals of Culture. They are all part of the Association of European Capitals of Culture. Mr Figeľ, you are responsible for financing 25 networks, and the Association of European Capitals of Culture should be one of them, so as to ensure that services are available to the cities that are to play this important role in the near future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Both programmes are approximately 20 years old, and should we so wish, we could say much about the past and future of these programmes. I am convinced that not only the Committee but also Parliament is keen to make sure that the Capital of Culture programme becomes even better and more popular, and I believe that we are heading in that direction.</p>
<p class="contents">I would only like to add that the fact that ten cities in Germany and eleven cities in Hungary are competing for the 2010 title reflects an interest, competitiveness and movement or dynamism in the field of culture and cultural heritage, which is good for the whole of Europe. I would like to thank you all and to say that we are actually doing many of the things that Mr Sonik has mentioned in the field of information, consultancy and assistance. We would also like to increase the value of the prize or financial aid to EUR 1.5 million. All this, however, depends on the outcome of tomorrow’s voting and on the discussions about the Financial Perspective. Having said that, I am convinced that this activity, this component of cultural cooperation, deserves significant support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we work on new approaches it is important to bear in mind that the new Member States endured many kinds of pressure on their cultures during the Communist period. In addition, the variety and identity of these cultures was negated. Enabling such countries to become more involved in European Capital of Culture events is a unique opportunity to harness the unprecedented energy generated by societies in the so-called young democracies.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot fail to mention an outstanding candidate amongst the cities hoping to be named European Capital of Culture for 2010. I refer to the city of Goerlitz-Zgorzelec, where I had the good fortune to be brought up and educated. This is a most remarkable city, because despite its chequered history of cruel divisions, the people of Goerlitz-Zgorzelec have contrived to keep human, economic and especially cultural links alive.</p>
<p class="contents">This city was marked by history and divided by the post-World War II border, but thanks to European Union activities it now has an opportunity to be reborn on the map of Europe. It stands to become a place where reconciliation, understanding and supranational and cultural cooperation operate at all levels. It is an example of how common interests and the will for dialogue can overcome divisions and resentment, which might have been deemed impossible. I commend this approach to all undertakings at European level, not just to cultural ones. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It helps a great deal as regards learning about each other’s cultural traditions and values. Transparency, clarity, monitoring and best practices present the fundamental requirements of all types of selection procedures of the European Community and this should be carried out in the selection of European Capitals of Culture as well. I can only strongly support the inclusion of Bulgaria and Romania in the programme, giving way to the interest expressed by the two potential new Member States to take part in this action; given the symbolic importance of making them already feel a part of Europe and in order to further enrich our cultural values and diversity. The inclusion of the Cultural Month initiative in the project has the capacity to help people learn about other nations’ cultural heritage and to extend the project to a wider international level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
