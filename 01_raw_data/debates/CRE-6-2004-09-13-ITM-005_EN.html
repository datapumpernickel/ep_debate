During these years of attempts to reduce air pollution and its effects on climate change, the greenhouse effect and the effects mentioned a few minutes ago, the International Civil Aviation Organisation has been one of the bodies involved in drafting a policy to combat aircraft pollution. This policy also laid down the use of economic instruments – the so-called market instruments – and voluntary measures, as well as the possibility of emissions trading and of introducing taxes and fiscal instruments to reduce that kind of pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, it seems that recently the policy of the International Civil Aviation Organisation has been leaning towards a different position. Decisions taken some time ago basically assigned to this Organisation a task very similar to that of implementing the Kyoto agreements, which involved drafting Organisation guidelines aimed at ensuring that the various countries or organisations such as the European Union could then implement the same standards. Now, however, we are faced with the possibility that at the Organisation’s next meeting, which will take place between 28 September and 8 October in Montreal, an amendment will be tabled which would remove the option to use market instruments to combat pollution from aircraft engines, thus making the whole policy take a step backwards.</p>
<p class="contents">This is already serious in itself. While we debate, while we are ever more convinced of the problems we face, while evidence mounts for the link between aircraft emissions and the effects on air quality, this step backwards would be particularly serious. In spite of the progress made in drawing up the Organisation’s guidelines, aimed at allowing countries to adopt, operate or create an emissions trading market and possibly to use fiscal instruments, we are confronted with an amendment, backed by the United States as well as other countries, which would not only put an end to this policy of the Organisation, but even prevent the European Union, for example, from taking steps in this direction as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore ask the Commission and the Council if they are aware of this danger, if they share this concern and, consequently, what they intend to do so that we do not take this step backwards. Secondly, I ask them what measures they intend to take to maintain the European Union’s right to apply measures of this type, to create an emissions trading market or to be able to introduce fiscal measures aimed at discouraging the use of highly polluting fuels within the European Union or elsewhere. In summary, I ask what they think they can do so that the International Civil Aviation Organisation may continue its policy or, at least, so that the European Union may have the right to be able to follow it through to the end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The ICAO has been looking at three options: taxes on fuel or emissions, emission charges and emissions trading. Unfortunately, under pressure from the United States, the Council has decided to propose a resolution which recommends that the ICAO only pursue emissions trading and, therefore, disregard the other options. This is clearly contrary to our objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares the view that the European Union must make the most appropriate use of all economic instruments for achieving sustainability in the aviation sector, as it does in other sectors. This means pressing to keep all options – taxation, emissions charging and emissions trading – open. This view was unanimously supported by all Member States in the Council, in COREPER, when it was discussed in July.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that we keep all options open, not favouring any particular option at this stage, so that Europe can decide on the best way forward, after further analysis, on the basis of realistic policy alternatives. Since there is no certainty at present that any one measure will suffice, disregarding any option that might help limit the impact of aviation on climate change at this stage is not desirable. Therefore, even though this will be difficult, the Commission will work during the Assembly to try to achieve a resolution that keeps options open. Support from third countries is likely to be limited.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation once again illustrates the isolation of the European Union's position because it is not a full member of the ICAO and does not have the capability to influence the ICAO process from an early stage. It also calls for the closest possible cooperation between EU Member States during the Assembly if an acceptable outcome is to be achieved. Ultimately, it may be necessary to maintain a European reserve, in order not to be politically committed to implementing such a resolution if it is unsatisfactory. This would not be unprecedented; it has been done in the past, notably for the Hushkit Dossier. The European position will, at times, be coordinated following normal procedures involving COREPER.</p>

That itself is doubtful, to say the least.</p>
<p class="contents">That the debate on emissions trading and state subsidies to the world’s civil aviation industry is happening at all is attributable to a proposal from the ICAO Council. Moreover, the debate is taking place at the worst possible time, as neither the Committee on Transport and Tourism nor the plenary are in a position to consider in detail the ICAO’s position paper. The internal discussions within the Commission, and, in particular, among the competent Member States, have not yet been concluded either.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only that, but the issue of emissions trading and state subsidies to the air transport sector is far too complicated for this House to be able to comment on it without careful preparation. It is also in the passengers’ interests that European airlines should answer questions about the possible effects on air transport and on how they compete with the airlines of third countries – all the more so in view of the extremely heavy economic burdens already placed on European airlines by the consequences of what happened on 11 September 2001 and by the increase in the price of oil.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no disputing the European Union’s right to come to its own autonomous decisions in these matters, and so, for the reasons I have stated, we regard the motions for a resolution tabled by the other groups as ill-considered and premature and will vote against them accordingly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That the issue of air travel and the environment is a sensitive one is something we have noticed from the reactions of some airlines, but what is it all about?</p>
<p class="contents">We know that air travel and global warming are connected; there is no argument about that. We are now talking in terms of the possibility of emissions trading, and the studies carried out to date have got us no further. That makes it absolutely necessary to keep all the options open when it comes to reducing emissions, and to do so using instruments that are both environmental and based on the market.</p>
<p class="contents">What matters, then, is that neither the USA nor anyone else, at the meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organisation in Montreal at the end of this month, should slam any doors shut. After all, we are not talking about introducing emissions trading today or in the next couple of weeks, but about the future possibility of the EU opting to facilitate this in air transport, using market-based emissions trading instruments; it is this position that the EU should keep open for itself.</p>
<p class="contents">That, Commissioner, is why most of us in this House wholeheartedly support the Commission’s view that, as you have said, the EU should present as united a front as possible within the framework of the ICAO. I see it as both right and necessary that this House should underline this once again, so that no doors are slammed shut in the ICAO at the end of this month. The USA, too, must come to understand that the EU takes something of a different approach to the environment and air transport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore hope, Commissioner, that you will report to the Council representatives on what has been discussed here in this House, because it is, of course, also on them that we will be leaning, for we know that we cannot lean on the Commission. We also know that the Commission is not a member of the ICAO, even though we have asked them on many occasions to become a member, not only for aviation, but also for shipping, so that at those international meetings, we as a Union can finally speak with one voice and not only with the voices of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not debating a Commission proposal, but the fact that the Commission should keep its hands free to be able to put forward a proposal if it sees the need to do so. Essentially, then, we should not be looking for a solution at this precise moment. We only need to ensure that our hands are not tied before we can start the debate. In fact, we encountered the same problem when the subject of shipping was being discussed. Is it the International Maritime Organisation that decides on its own or can decisions also be taken regionally within the Union? We are now facing the same problem. Why could we not do the same for the environment as we did in shipping when, for example, the issue of double-hulled tankers came up? With regard to aviation, can the Union not take the lead as regards measures to make aviation more sustainable? There is absolutely no doubt that we should maintain a sense of balance in this, but as Mr Piecyk stated, neither we, nor the Commissioner for that matter, want our hands to be tied beforehand at global level. You have stated, Commissioner, that the Council agreed unanimously with the Commission’s opinion. What I would like to know from you is whether this will still be the case at the meeting at the end of the month. Are you certain that all 25 members of the Council will be adopting a common position and will thus settle for a reserve, if necessary?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, you stated that our position is receiving very little support from third countries. It appears that most of those third countries are following the line of the United States. Why is that so? Is there anything else the European Union can do to ensure that we receive support for our position and that, consequently, we can bring about better sustainability? I understand Mr Schmitt’s concerns, but sustainability means that a balance must be maintained socially, ecologically and economically. Let there be no misunderstanding: I do not want to overlook the economic aspect in aviation, but it must be possible for us as a Union to adopt a policy without anybody tying our hands beforehand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me thank you again for that. I see this debate as happening at the right time and in the right place, for we must do everything possible to prevent the resolution that the United States of America and other countries are strenuously backing from gaining majority support at the conference in Montreal.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make three points in relation to this. In the first place, this is about the EU’s autonomy in matters concerning Europe. What Europe does is Europe’s business, and the European Union, the Commission and the Council, have to decide what that is and determine what this continent’s future requires. That is not something that other states out there may do; the decision, then, is for us to take, and, as regards your decision, I wish you the great success for which you have been striving. I also hope that you will win the day.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that the EU has always attached a very high value to climate protection and seen it as very important. It is for that reason that the European Union signed the Kyoto Protocol. That, as you know, was an ambitious thing to do, and we must do all we can to fulfil it. That being so, it is quite intolerable that the air transport industry, a threat to the climate and to climate protection, should be exempted from the measures; that really is making a gamekeeper out of a poacher, and we want none of it. We know that air travel is a danger, just as we know that railways are a relatively environmentally-friendly system of transport. We cannot have rail transport laden down with taxes, including levies on emissions, while air transport, of all things, is not, and hence we want the same law for both. Priority must be given to the mode of transport that does not harm the environment, rather than to the one that does.</p>

Twenty-one delegations have tabled proposals that are likely to do aviation no good as regards emission levels. They are proposing the abolition of the individual initiative of countries or regions to take measures to restrict emissions and its replacement by a more legislative initiative from the ICAO. This is a contradiction in terms, because we will never manage to agree on issues such as these in the ICAO. The Community is striving towards sustainable development both ecologically and economically, something of which I have for years been wholeheartedly in favour. In that light, we should have the courage to face up to reality. Aviation and the environment are not compatible. In this House, we are making every effort to change this on all kinds of fronts, and we must, above all, continue to do this, in principle with our partners in other parts of the world, but if this proves impossible, without them.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, aviation enjoys improper benefits compared to other transport modes, and this should change. Maintaining tax benefits and leaving certain social costs uncovered does nothing to help our cause. However, we must make sure that we do not act against our own interests. Our measures should not result in European companies having to give up the fight. Rules are fine, provided that they apply to all players. This is, however, not a licence for stagnation. That is why I am also of the opinion that the proposed changes to ICAO resolution A33-7 must be taken off the agenda. Sustainable policy requires courage and foresight, and these proposals are lacking in both. It is up to the European Community to demonstrate that transport and the environment are less incompatible than the amendments would suggest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This would really be a step back, and we need to move forward. Our group advocates a very vigorous climate policy and we will not be avoiding difficult decisions in the process – certainly not when a sector is already enjoying tax exemptions and preferential treatment in this way. It is aviation itself, then, that we need to tackle. We think that the international emission trade for airline companies can be an extra incentive for the development of new and efficient aircraft, thus moving towards sustainable aviation. I would urge all my fellow Members, particularly those belonging to the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to support the resolution that is before this House, and thus send a clear signal to the United States. I would also call on the Commission and the Dutch Presidency, when they next put in an appearance, on no account to support an American proposal for a resolution on this subject during the ICAO Meeting. Instead, the European Union, with its partners, should focus on the ICAO making a constructive contribution to the forthcoming conference of the parties in Buenos Aires on the subject of the Kyoto Protocol. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to the sector's own analysis, the world passenger aircraft fleet could double by 2020. That means an increase from 12 000 aircraft to roughly 25 000 aircraft by 2020. This has a significant impact and, therefore, what we do is important.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission was aware of these problems months ago. There have been discussions with Coreper since July and there is definitely a common position between all 25 Member States and the Commission to keep all options open. We believe that this is the only way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">The next discussion in Coreper on the future strategy will take place next Friday. The Commission and Member States, with the UK taking the lead, are now working on alternative texts, as it is important to do the practical work. The Commission will also study the technical feasibility of introducing aviation emissions trading schemes into a general scheme and will look at different solutions in this area. The conclusions are expected in nine months, on the basis of which the Commission intends to propose measures.</p>
