Thank you very much, Mr Tajani, for your response.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, because of globalisation, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are facing increasing competition from other countries, including from emerging economies outside the European Union. This involves major challenges, but also significant opportunities. In order to remain competitive, to secure growth and to support the sustainability of our companies, SMEs must take part in international activities. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is convinced of this. This concerns imports and exports, foreign direct investment and, of course, also acting as or using foreign subcontractors.</p>
<p class="contents">However, only a small proportion of European SMEs are doing business with third countries. A total of 99% of the companies in the European Union are SMEs. However, only 29% of the SMEs in the EU import products, of which 50% import from countries outside the internal market. Only 25% of the SMEs in the EU are involved in exports, of which 50% export to countries outside the internal market. This means that our SMEs are not yet fully integrated into the global market. There are still opportunities to be exploited in this area and we now need to consider how we can encourage SMEs to do more business outside Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Not many SMEs are familiar with the public support programmes, such as the Enterprise Europe Network, or with information resources, such as the Market Access Database and the Export Helpdesk. There are also similar programmes available at a national and regional level.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to know what concrete measures the Commission is planning in order to ensure that SMEs are better informed about the available tools and programmes. We would also like to know what the Commission intends to do to make the confusing subsidy system more transparent and clearer for SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the decision made by the Court of Justice of the European Union on 10 December 2009, the Commission intends to include product-specific list rules in the implementing regulations for the Modernised Customs Code, in other words, to make these rules legally binding. The intention is to replace the current regulation, which has proved its worth over several decades and which specifies that the origin of a product is based on its last substantial processing or working, by countless product-specific origin rules for products imported into the EU. We are concerned that this will lead to an increase in red tape and, most importantly, will put SMEs at a disadvantage. We believe that this is not in line with the Small Business Act for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we are calling for a simplified form of this system which is beneficial for SMEs. How does the Commission intend to ensure that safety-related adaptations and changes to the Modernised Customs Code do not conflict with the existing simplified procedure and lead to competitive disadvantages? This is all about the position of SMEs on the world market, which will ensure their continued existence and allow them to safeguard jobs here in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We addressed this in the oral question but we also spoke about it way back in 2008, when I was the rapporteur for Parliament on enhancing the role of SMEs in international trade. More than three years have passed and still we cannot find a way to cut red tape and help SMEs in the internal market, in which regard I would also note that if there is no customs harmonisation, it will be hard for the single market to meet the needs of consumers and European enterprises, but there is not even a solution for ensuring more thoroughgoing and swifter integration of SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">Back in 2008, Parliament made its voice heard through 437 votes to tell the Commission that we needed harmonised and simplified rules in free trade areas, that we needed to facilitate the removal of excessive barriers, and that we needed to think about creating a system of international courts of arbitration that would be faster and less burdensome, so as to allow SMEs to avoid the delays and the difficulties that a dispute with customs or trade authorities of some third countries entailed.</p>
<p class="contents">We considered and approved the reduction in the cost of customs procedures by simplifying them and making them transparent. Furthermore, we asked for the harmonisation of international rules, more effective registration of the origin of goods and the modernisation of customs checks, which are essential for avoiding counterfeiting that is detrimental to both consumers and producers. Today, here we are again discussing the same problems, faced with an enormous crisis. Immediate action is required and we hope the Commission will take it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If we wish to overcome the crisis, we have to support the real economy. To support the real economy, we have to work on behalf of small and medium-sized enterprises, which must develop, of course, within the European Union. We have a large internal market of some 500 million citizens, or consumers. At the same time, we must try to work on promoting internationalisation, in order to stop businesses from relocating. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, honourable Members, I believe that these 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can truly be an extraordinary lever for stimulating growth at this time. It is our duty to help them and to remove all the obstacles they come up against, because as we well know, even the instruments that we offer them are not enough: a great deal is also done at a national level to help SMEs, with positive initiatives and the Commission’s helpdesks. Meanwhile, the European Commission has decided to appoint an ambassador for small and medium-sized enterprises or a ‘Mr SME’. Tomorrow, there is a meeting of all the small and medium-sized enterprise ambassadors of the European Union and it is quite significant that all 27 Member States have appointed their ambassador very quickly indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an important step forward, but we need a more robust strategy: the internal market will not suffice; we need to go and prospect elsewhere and, unfortunately, the data we have is not encouraging. Only 25% of SMEs operate outside their own country and only 13% operate outside the European Union. This is too little in comparison with the potential of this network of extraordinary people who create jobs and wealth. That is why we are working to put this internationalisation strategy together in short order.</p>
<p class="contents">Through it, we have set ourselves a number of tasks: to create an inventory of the instruments available at European, national and regional level; to increase the transparency of these instruments and create coordination between them, because often SMEs have many instruments available to them but do not know which is best to use, while they are also often incompatible or competing with one another, so we need to incentivise greater cooperation; we must rationalise our plans for supporting potential markets, for example, by putting forward guidelines and good practices based on geographical priorities; we must create an online portal that could, for example, be used to store all relevant information by theme and by country.</p>
<p class="contents">I think I have now answered the first question, so I will move on to the second. Updating customs regulations – as mentioned during the speech introducing the oral question – reconciles the commitment to ease trade together with the use of specific tools for customs checks, such as widespread use of standardised computer systems. In this vein, simplifying and cutting the costs of customs formalities through IT solutions is particularly in the interests of SMEs, while increasing use of computers will allow SMEs to be more competitive and more organised in terms of customs and in all other areas where we need to act to help businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, SMEs can become high-tech businesses, which eases the completion of customs formalities. On the other hand, the ongoing review of the implementing measures of the Modernised Customs Code suggests bearing in mind the specific characteristics of each business, particularly SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to the third question, it is true that SMEs intending to start trading internationally can now benefit from a number of national and European organisations and programmes, yet we also need to achieve greater coherence between the various systems for supporting SMEs, particularly by incentivising synergies and complementarities between existing tools – without creating any overlaps. European, national and regional coordination of programmes to support new or established SMEs – as well as non-EU SMEs – based on the principles of complimentarity, efficiency and sustainability, will be an integral part of the Commission’s strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Question number four: the Commission’s policies aim to help open up international trade and eliminate trade barriers in order to ensure non-discrimination for European businesses, including SMEs. The current economic situation makes these principles even more essential and the Commission believes that public procurement procedures present a fresh opportunity for international trade. That is why we at the Commission are always concerned to include the interests of Member States – including SMEs, of course – in all ongoing bilateral trade negotiations, as well as in the framework of the multilateral agreement on public tenders.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also currently considering a political instrument designed to show greater symmetry and reciprocity in negotiations for market access. During the impact assessment for this initiative, the Commission will be sure to analyse, in particular, the participation of SMEs in public tenders in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifth question: the Commission is fully aware of the essential role of small and medium-sized enterprises in supporting and developing the European economy and for getting out of this crisis. Therefore, protecting the interests of SMEs and micro-enterprises – which we also talk about too little – is a priority. In the communication entitled ‘A Strategic Vision for European Standards’, the Commission lays the foundations for increasing the active participation of SMEs in the European standardisation process. In order to implement this strategy, the proposal for a regulation on European standardisation provides for SMEs to be funded to participate in the standardisation process.</p>
<p class="contents">Likewise, the Commission strongly believes in the use of international standards, mainly those developed by the International Organisation for Standardisation and the International Electrotechnical Commission. European standards must be developed, while remaining mindful of existing international standards so as to facilitate international trade and to help cash-strapped SMEs to adapt their products to the often incompatible standards of countries outside the EU’s internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also launched trade and economic talks with the most significant countries for the European economy, namely, the United States, Russia, China and Japan. These talks will also address various standardisation policies in order to come to solutions to target free exchanges of products in future.</p>
<p class="contents">As I was saying to Mr Theurer just before the start of this sitting, I think it is also very significant that I am signing agreements with the countries of Latin America, which is another extremely interesting market for SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence, we have standardisation and are working on SMEs in Chile, Argentina and Brazil, but there is also important work going on in North Africa. Many SMEs are being established there, which can bring hope to young people – the leaders of the recent uprising – and also allow our SMEs to enter into joint ventures in these African countries. This will not only help to stabilise the situation, thereby introducing a political aspect to the internationalisation of our SMEs, but also presents a business opportunity because there is already a deep-rooted European presence in these markets. However, in my view, there is still more to be done in stimulating growth and development in Africa, stabilising the Mediterranean area, and cutting the grass beneath the feet of terrorism, fundamentalism and piracy. I therefore predict an important political role for our SMEs in a sensitive area such as the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why working towards internationalisation is becoming a priority for me and I think that this tight collaboration with Parliament can become truly essential for the growth of a sector of the economy that I believe is utterly crucial for getting us out of this crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Small Business Act and the Single Market Act together act as our engine for reform. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), including the smallest companies, are the tool that we can use to achieve growth and employment in the European Union, if we pay attention to the following points. SMEs must come first, both at home and abroad. We need to establish a pathway for SMEs into all the available education and research projects. SMEs are found in all areas of the economy and, if we want to start from the bottom, they are the ones that can generate growth and create jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">European companies are currently in a stronger position on the global market than US or Japanese businesses. However, the fact remains that only 25% of SMEs in the EU export their products and services and 50% of these export to third countries. This means that only 13% of SMEs are doing business with third countries. SMEs which sell their products and services to other countries create more jobs. SMEs which do business abroad created 7% more jobs, while those which only do business on their home markets created just 1% more jobs. SMEs that are selling on international markets make better progress. A total of 26% of these SMEs launched products or services which were new to their industry and their country. Only 8% of the other SMEs were able to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, competitiveness and internationalisation go hand in hand. We have a shortage of young, innovative companies. Only 6% of the new companies founded since 1975 are European and more than 70% are American. We need to catch up. Let us take this opportunity to remove the constraints imposed on SMEs and on the internal market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is worrying, therefore, to see governments asking to reduce Europe’s financial perspective or acting against the idea of amending the Treaty to strengthen the euro; it is worrying to see all these initiatives that do not aim to help the real economy but the financial economy – the dream of so many irresponsible people who continue to travel back and forth across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) also have to play their part in tackling new markets, offering new products, adapting to the whims of the global market, bolstering their capitalisation, investing in research and innovation and showing – as they already are – that in this changing world, nobody can reserve the role of bank of the world for themselves while making others function as their workshop.</p>
<p class="contents">We are heading towards a world in which today’s emerging big players are capable of being both bank and workshop and will have to face the challenges – including social and environmental challenges – that this world will deliver to them and will also affect us. Our competitiveness, our ability to grow and simultaneously ring-fence employment and security largely depends on our SMEs’ ability to adapt.</p>
<p class="contents">SMEs have much to gain from a new commercial policy, but to do so they must be strengthened, they must present themselves as consortia on world markets, and they must know how to work together to crack open new markets and meet growing demand, including in sectors that require the huge volumes which we have not been able to provide in the past. They must be supported when they have to defend themselves before the courts of third countries because their patents and trademarks are being violated.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe and its Member States have certainly done a great deal, but the fragmentation of skills and the random distribution of resources in many countries has so far prevented SMEs from working effectively on an international scale, in particular – I would reiterate – when faced with the enterprise shown by our big global competitors. This is what we need to focus our attention and commitment on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He was trying – successfully – to tie up some contracts to sell the shoes that he made in what was not much more than a workshop, without knowing Russian or much less Uzbek, yet he managed it.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a slightly unusual example because, in the end, while the European Union is a major international economy, on the one hand, on the other, 90% of our revenue is created by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), of which only 15% export to outside the European Union and only 30% trade outside their own country. Essentially, we are faced with a contradiction that reveals a profound vulnerability.</p>
<p class="contents">The very concept of an SME necessarily implies the ability to be reactive and flexible – as shown by this Italian entrepreneur in Uzbekistan – and these skills also apply to internationalisation. However, this potential is largely wasted. We do not use the opportunities presented by the markets, by consumer goods and by the new lightweight technologies that we could use in public tenders – though in that situation with a certain wariness, because I think the public procurement sector is still the most difficult for SMEs hoping to internationalise.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the tools available to SMEs are obviously not suited to their needs, which is the very reason behind this debate. There are too many instruments and too much bureaucracy involved in using them, as well as a lack of multilingual skills available to SMEs – which is a significant obstacle – and insufficient training and information.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we are asking the Commission for a thorough revision of the measures to assist in the internationalisation of SMEs, as well as for a precise target. Let us set ourselves an objective along the lines of doubling the rate of internationalisation among SMEs in 10 years – something we can use as a yardstick for the new policies.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, we also call on SMEs, because internationalisation – quite aside from all the objective difficulties and hitherto inadequate instruments – is also a question of culture, mindset, openness and keeping up with the times. The survival of SMEs, millions of jobs and the identity of our Union are at stake. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Past restrictions on interaction and collaboration have been removed by air travel and the Internet. The floodgates have opened up, increasing business opportunities, but this also creates a more crowded market place with greater competition. The Commission’s view of globalisation is that national borders are losing their significance. International competition now starts at home, so the role of the nation state in fostering entrepreneurialism and providing a suitable platform for its industries is more important than ever.</p>
<p class="contents">To stay ahead of the field, innovation and efficiency are essential. Globalisation not only rewards, but requires inventiveness and flexibility, yet the burden of EU legislation is bogging businesses down. An estimate by the Enterprise Commissioner suggests the burden of regulation costs the EU economy EUR 600 billion a year. From the Working Time Directive to the Agency Workers Directive, small companies are struggling through a bureaucratic quagmire that is stifling growth. A recent poll by ICM (the Institute of Credit Management) revealed that half of SMEs trading with the EU feel that the burden of regulation outweighs the benefits of the single market. 60% of UK businesses would renegotiate our relationship with the EU to return to a simple free trade area. The EU’s general attitude towards capitalism is to regard it with suspicion and contempt. By pushing forward erroneous social and employment policies, unifying welfare support across the Union, and promoting cumbersome rights legislation, the EU protects and rewards the work-shy, while aspiring entrepreneurs are demoralised, demonised and left without a safety net. The greatest enemy to SMEs is the EU itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During the debt crisis which many Member States are undergoing, it should at last be clear that we cannot afford expensive stimulus packages. If we look at the results of the policies of recent decades, it is obvious that Keynes was not the answer to our problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The first question is: what possible alternatives are there? The second question is: where is growth occurring that we can be part of? I am grateful to Mr Karas for so clearly highlighting which areas of the world are currently growing. With regard to what is preventing us from sharing in this growth, I would like to highlight the problems relating to the Modernised Customs Code which Mr Theurer and Ms Muscardini have referred to. I know that the Commission is apparently going ahead blindly and that the concerns raised in a variety of debates in Parliament and also by different committees have unfortunately so far been ignored. However, I would be very grateful if the Commission would finally take our concerns seriously and would consider how some aspects of the rules of origin can be saved.</p>
<p class="contents">To come back to the question of where growth is happening, the answer is generally outside the European Union. It is clear that there are regions in Europe where small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are very successful on global markets. My question is: are we in a position within the European Union to learn from these best practice examples? Is the right response to establish European chambers of commerce in some countries outside the EU? Would it perhaps be better to attempt to improve cooperation with the chambers of commerce, institutions and organisations which have demonstrated that they are able to introduce their SMEs to other world markets? Should we be doing everything we can to ensure that the organisations in the various Member States are better coordinated and can learn from one another more effectively?</p>

Unfortunately, even at European level, fewer than 30% of SMEs are involved in cross-border transactions. Therefore, how can we increase the level of internationalisation of European SMEs without relocating their business to third countries?</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is devising a new industrial policy and space policy, which means that international cooperation is becoming extremely important. These initiatives, which are crucial for creating jobs and for the European Union’s competitiveness, obviously need adequate funding. We have asked the Commission to allocate the budget required to carry out research into GNSS. This will enable European SMEs to help develop services and applications using satellite-based location services and implement the European space strategy globally.</p>
<p class="contents">On this point, we obviously have to promote European standards globally as well. What measures does the Commission envisage for increasing SMEs’ involvement in association agreements between the European Union and third countries or regions in the world, for instance, in light of the European Union-Brazil Summit being held on 4 October this year?</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, in 2009, the Commission published a communication about a clean and eco-efficient economy for European citizens.

This is largely due to the iniquitous commercial policy of the European Union, which, in exchange for illusory access to services and big tenders in third countries, has completely given up protecting the domestic economy and manufacturing sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The figures cited in the oral question are clear: the benefits of international opportunities are, if they exist at all, exclusively enjoyed by big corporations, while the problems remain for the smallest businesses, which find themselves doubly in difficulty as they suffer from extremely strong and unfair competition at home and the inability to compete properly abroad.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union could help SMEs, but unfortunately not everyone seems to have the same perspective and sensitivity. In the document on the next budget that we shall have to approve, the Council has proposed cutting more than EUR 70 million from the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme of the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, which also manages Enterprise Europe Network and other instruments designed to support the internationalisation of SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that Parliament will oppose this narrow-minded decision of the Council and get its points across forcefully in order to maximise the help it can provide to the true economic heart and added value of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, all the liquidity which is currently being made available will have to be regenerated and it is normally generated by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we have the problem that we import a very large volume of goods, including energy and raw materials, from China, from the Gulf States and from Russia, and all of this has to be paid for. We can only pay for it if we can also export goods. This is why it is so important for us to ensure that the World Trade Organisation (WTO) round is finally brought to a conclusion. We need the Doha round, including the trade facilitations that have already been negotiated, the public tenders, the competition law and the so-called Singapore issues. We must push to ensure that progress is made in the world trade round.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we come to the financial framework 2014-2020 and the old Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) which is to be relaunched. We must take particular care in this area to ensure that we promote entrepreneurship. We have too many unemployed people and too few entrepreneurs. This means that we need programmes which once again make it attractive to become an entrepreneur.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I would like to take up Mr Caspary’s suggestion that we develop programmes in collaboration with Eurochambres or EuroCommerce which involve going out to the relevant export countries and helping SMEs to make contact with business partners there. I have been involved for some time in promoting the Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs Programme, which is an exchange programme for young businesspeople, not only in Europe but, in particular, on an international level, because it helps to bring people together. Trust forms the basis for business and business creates jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the support of the online problem-solving network SOLVIT is so important, because it allows barriers within the internal market to be removed. This is our job and we need to do everything we can in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Internationalisation does not restrict itself just to exports. For example, cross-border cooperation, involvement in beneficial networks, looking for competitive methods or new technologies are important factors in motivating modern SMEs to become internationalised.</p>

In 2011 alone, many thousands of SMEs in Portugal have already gone out of business because of a lack of support and because of problems accessing credit, specifically for exporting their products. This is because of decreased demand and the reduced purchasing power of the majority of the Portuguese population, resulting from the austerity measures that are being exercised.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue I would therefore raise with you, Commissioner, is whether the Commission is going to propose amendments to the memorandum that the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank concluded with the Portuguese Government. Only with profound changes to that document will we be in a position to combat the recession, to foster economic growth, to increase the population’s purchasing power, to boost demand and to contribute to preventing micro, small and medium-sized enterprises from continuing to go out of business; that is a central issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Economic and financial globalisation has brought the world economy to a state where speculative financial groupings and gigantic supranational corporations dominate. This situation brought about the crisis. In my opinion, one of the measures for getting out of the crisis should therefore be to restore the emphasis on local production and smaller economic units within the framework of decentralising economic systems. The EU can play a helpful role in this area, and it frequently does. Small and medium-sized enterprises in the Member States are not, however, always aware of the support options. Ladies and gentlemen, you rightly drew attention in your question to the fact that public support programmes and information resources are often little known to businesses. In my opinion, one of the greatest challenges for the Commission is therefore to support and promote these programmes in individual Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They thus account for only a small percentage of Europe’s foreign trade balance. One of the reasons for this is the fact that they have not developed sufficient capacities to be able to engage in cross-border trade. They do not know about the public support programmes or the information resources backing them up, and therefore they do not know how to make effective use of this assistance. Additionally, in cross-border trade, they come up against customs barriers and different certification and standardisation rules in other countries. We must therefore look for new effective instruments for helping at least those companies that have the production potential for engaging in international trade, so that they can overcome these administrative barriers. In my opinion, we can effectively open up the possibility of international trade for medium-sized enterprises through the better promotion of public support programmes and information resources, such as a policy of gradually eliminating bureaucratic barriers to foreign trade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you know, we are working to prepare a text on internationalisation and therefore, this evening’s debate has been very valuable since I have taken on board the observations made and I also agree with many of the points that have been stressed.</p>
<p class="contents">We have an important problem in terms of access to finance, but we have already spoken about this in the course of this debate, under this new way of meeting between Parliament and the Commission. It is important for the directive on late payments to be implemented as soon as possible by the Member States and that is why I have asked the European Commission’s Mr SME, Mr Calleja, to insist in tomorrow’s meeting of all the SME ambassadors that this directive must be transposed before the deadline. This is one aspect of access to finance that we are entitled to, but then there is the access to finance that we would like to see.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, I have created a small and medium-size enterprise access to finance forum for SMEs, which is already bearing fruit: we have managed to free up the blocked EUR 30 million that was meant to help SMEs during the crisis; we are working on venture capital deals and on a series of initiatives; and the financial perspective 2014-2020 includes a series of specific interventions that should allow SMEs to have greater access to EU funds.</p>
<p class="contents">I am referring in this instance to the large EUR 80 million pot for innovation, some of which will be reserved for SMEs, while there will also be the Eighth Framework Programme and, as discussed with Ms Geoghegan-Quinn, we will be changing the rules on access to financing for SMEs. Alongside this EUR 80 billion fund, there are another EUR 2.4 billion set aside specifically for improving the internationalisation and competitiveness of SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we have already done a number of things. We spoke about multilingualism and reducing the tax burden. I can say that one of my first acts as Commissioner for Industry and Entrepreneurship was to ensure that all the REACH [Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals] documentation was translated into all the languages of the Union. I also reduced the tax on registering REACH substances almost to zero, on a sliding scale from medium to small enterprises and onward to an almost 90% reduction in the tax burden on registration for micro-enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that there is more work to be done and I share the worries of those who have said that the Council often waters down initiatives to help SMEs because there is a policy of budget reduction in place. I do share these concerns and I believe that the Commission and Parliament ought to insist that the Council does not reduce funding for SMEs, particularly in regard to the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of competitiveness on global markets, it is well known that I have always been an ardent supporter of the level playing field, which is different from the principle of reciprocity, and which allows our enterprises to be competitive in the world and also to defend our know-how in situations which we deem to be risky.</p>
<p class="contents">I think a great deal can still be done, including with regard to exports. We must provide more muscular support for businesses in Europe, because it is true that many SMEs do not know what opportunities the European Union offers. We have a network in place – which I think needs to be strengthened – that is designed precisely to provide information to SMEs. However, even the Members of this House and Commissioners can provide better information to European entrepreneurs in their meetings.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also helping these entrepreneurs with a network that reaches beyond the borders of the European Union. Indeed, we have begun an important initiative in Beijing to ease access to China for SMEs, so that they can explore an extraordinarily important market. The headquarters that we have established for this initiative is not merely an office with a clerk, but comprises the coordination – under the umbrella of the European institutions – of all the chambers of commerce that operate in Beijing and in China. This is therefore a rather substantial operation; it is not just a formality and I hope that initiatives like this can grow and be put in place in India and other important countries across the world, as is my intention.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of internationalisation, we have signed agreements on standards and relations between SMEs and shall continue to do so. The last one I signed was with Chile and then – to answer Ms Ţicău’s question – we shall be signing one with Brazil during the next EU-Brazil Summit, plus another with Argentina. We are also doing a great deal of work in Latin America, where there is great enthusiasm for strong ties with European businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">The figure that was put forward to me as a target to aim for seems like an intelligent proposal. Mr Rinaldi is not here but I shall appropriate it and we shall be sure to use it, perhaps as early as the tabling of the text on the internationalisation of SMEs. I hope I have replied to most of the additional questions that were posed during the debate, having responded – I think – thoroughly to the first five during the first speech. I apologise, Madam President, if I have dragged this out, but the topic is so significant for our economy and there were so many questions that I could hardly stop myself from providing equally thorough answers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
