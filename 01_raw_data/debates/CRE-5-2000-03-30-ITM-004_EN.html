The Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities has tabled a special opinion. I just want to point out that what is most important in this opinion is, of course, the view that proper resources should be set aside for mainstreaming. A mistake has nonetheless crept into our opinion. I do not want there to be a mistake here, even if we are not voting on it. The last part of section 4 of our opinion, following the words “Community action programmes should cooperate”, is to be deleted. The Committee voted to remove this section, but it has nonetheless been included by mistake. I want this part to be removed and I want to give notice of the fact now, before we proceed to the vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has requested a split vote on this amendment. I think that the first part of the amendment is uncontroversial, but there is a linguistic problem in the second part. I think it is a translation-related problem. It was the intention of the European People’s Party not to open a new debate but merely to re-confirm what Parliament had already decided recently, for example in the context of the Fifth Framework Programme on Research or in that of the Tannert report on the specific Framework Programme on Research. It is therefore important for us to adapt the German language version to the wording also chosen for the Fifth Framework Programme on Research. In this case, the English text is the original, and the German should read ‘verbrauchende Embryonenforschung’, which are the words also decided upon by Parliament for the Framework Programme on Research. It is not, therefore, a question of tightening up Parliament’s position but of emphasising what we have already decided. The German must therefore read ‘verbrauchende Embryonenforschung’.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The biggest challenge confronting the European Union over the next few years is enlargement to include the countries in Eastern and Central Europe. Enlargement will be an expensive business in many ways. It is therefore important that the EU should set aside large sums in this connection, and not only accession aid. In spite of this, enlargement is not mentioned in Mrs Haug’s report. Instead, “the social and cultural dimension of Europe” is chosen as the most important point to be taken up in the guidelines for the 2001 budget. </p>
<p class="contents">We think that the EU should devote its energies to those problems which the Member States cannot solve themselves, that is to say the cross-border issues. Cultural policy and social policy are very important political areas but ought not, on the whole, to be subjects of common legislation. </p>
<p class="contents">Aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo is taken up in Mrs Haug’s report as another priority area, which is something we support wholeheartedly. However, we think that the resources needed for Kosovo should be found from the aid given to tobacco cultivation and to other production in the context of the common agricultural policy. As liberals, we believe that agricultural policy should be adapted to the market and made less bureaucratic. If Parliament is serious about enlargement eastwards, efforts must be made to cut back considerably on the costs of agriculture. All direct aid given to agricultural production ought to gradually be abolished. </p>
<p class="contents">The EU plays an important role when it comes to employment, especially through the single market. We would nonetheless emphasise that unemployment cannot be reduced only by means of political decisions at European level. We are convinced that measures in the Member States, such as reduced social costs, flexible labour law and a good business climate, are what lead to increased employment and dynamic development throughout the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Committee on Fisheries does not want more money. We simply wish to be named in the guidelines, because what is not named does not exist, and fishing exists, and is even a common policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Fishing is crucial to maintaining employment and the economy in the peripheral European regions which depend on it. This industry also generates numerous land-based jobs, in the processing industry and in the dockyards. The cheapest jobs are those which do not have to be created because they have not already disappeared. It is better to support activities that already create employment than to have to invest huge amounts, later on, in the creation of new industries.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Committee on Fisheries believe that the international fisheries agreements deserve explicit budgetary support, so that the Community fleet may continue its activities and the economies of the fishing regions do not reach crisis point. In the process of reaching an agreement we will therefore see to it that the Union’s support for fishing is consolidated and increased. During the current budgetary procedure we will also highlight our concern that fishing resources be conserved and working and safety conditions in that industry improved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is too much staff-related expenditure.

They reflect political choices our delegation finds unacceptable. We condemn the priority accorded by the rapporteur to the financing of policies newly introduced in the Treaty of Amsterdam. The Union for a Europe of Nations Group denounces the federalist integration promoted throughout this report, which calls for growing Community powers in justice and home affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group likewise condemns the desire expressed by the alliance of the large Socialist, Christian Democrat and Conservative groups in the European Parliament to use agriculture, the appropriations under heading 1 of the financial perspective, as a source of financing for areas now falling within the remit of European Union ‘foreign policy’. We consider it iniquitous to seek to finance the reconstruction of Kosovo on the backs of the farmers, and unacceptable to try to make people believe the problem should be framed as a conflict of duty. Such trickery deserves to be denounced. On the contrary, Europe must maintain agricultural spending and possibly moderate spending on other budget headings, where there are margins.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact everyone now agrees in acknowledging that the EUR 360 million sought for Kosovo for the year 2000 represents a sum, a godsend for some people, that this region of former Yugoslavia, with ever-growing centrifugal forces at work, is in no position to assimilate. It can also be observed in this region of Europe that the donors other than the European Union countries, in their reluctance to shoulder their financial commitments, starting with the United States, are taking the view that the money is arriving too late and coordination is poor. And this is at a time when the Balkans is still a veritable powder keg where there is increasing evidence that trends are moving in the opposite direction to what we were hoping and the sound of tanks is more often heard than the sound of mechanical diggers.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, regardless of the substance of the agreement, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group denounces the rethink of last year’s Berlin Summit, represented by the ongoing demands for revision of the 2000-2006 financial perspective and the various headings, at a time when there are no precise figures for the European Commission’s ambitious programme for the Balkans (EUR 5.5 billion). There are no justifiable grounds for this demand for revision of the financial perspective and, assuming that the 2001 budget is adopted with the maximum amounts authorised in Berlin, that would permit a 5-6% increase in the available sums. It is right to oppose this poor solution and, acting responsibly, especially on behalf of the voters who gave us their support, we must certainly ensure that the budget for Europe remains in line with the evolution of national budgets, in particular as regards payment appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union for a Europe of Nations Group is equally opposed, out of concern for consistency, to any annual financing of the EUR 5.5 billion sought for the Balkans by increasing the ceiling on external expenditure by Europe and lowering the ceilings for the agricultural headings, on the deceitful pretext that the appropriations would not be taken from agriculture, but that it would be appropriate to release margins for 2001 and 2002. It should be remembered here that, in 2003, the mid-term analysis planned at the Berlin Summit in the context of Agenda 2000 will be known. There is a great risk that, when the time comes, this dubious practice will be claimed by many as an acquired right, and it will therefore constitute an extremely dangerous precedent as far as the farmers of our countries are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s figures for the Balkans are highly political and do not correspond to any specific study, while, for its part, the Council of Ministers thinks it is possible at the moment to finance the programmes and aid for the Balkans within the ceilings of heading 4: ‘External actions’.</p>
<p class="contents">So, first of all, and with great urgency, indeed before the draft budget for 2001 appears at the end of April, we must demand and obtain from the European Commission precisely calculated estimates for real needs, as well as strict multiannual budgetary planning, respecting certain conditions. It is unacceptable and irresponsible that, ten months after the end of the conflict, we still do not have any reliable estimates of the region’s needs.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, let us bear in mind that the European Union’s budget for heading 4 on external actions is far from representing just the concerns of Europeans, concerns which do not seem to be reflected in the budgetary guidelines. Taking natural disasters as an example, it is deplorable that there should no longer be specific reference to vital reforestation. Thus, the importance of the position of France, the country which suffered the most during the recent storms, is being dramatically played down, and likened to other situations with which it has nothing in common.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is because the engines which the company concerned plans to use have a by-pass ratio of less than three and so would be excluded from EU airspace under the Regulation as it stands. Article 2(2) excludes from the scope of the Regulation only aircraft which have been completely re-engined ‘with engines having a by-pass ratio of three or more’. This is in spite of the fact that the engines in question would easily meet all noise and emissions standards. Aircraft noise is not determined by engine by-pass ratio alone, and I believe that aircraft noise should be measured by the actual noise made during take-off, fly-past and landing as is the case under the Chicago Convention.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This regulation provides for the banning, as from May 2000, of certain noisy aircraft equipped with noise reduction devices known as ‘hushkits’. The civil aviation industry is experiencing annual growth of some 6% and this is expected to double in 10 years! This has to be accompanied by a progressive reduction in noise ascribable to aircraft. The noise issue is equally topical in American airports. Stricter rules on aircraft noise must be established at international level, within the ICAO. That is stressed in the resolution. In 1999, the regulation was suspended for a year. It will be implemented in May with a large number of exemptions.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest Euro-American talks suggest this conflict is not about to be settled. On top of everything else, the Americans have lodged an appeal with the ICAO. The American industry exerts enormous pressure and the situation is distorted by the prospect of the elections. The United States’ position on the regulation is ambiguous; in fact, although the United States government is in favour of ending the litigation, American manufacturers are totally against the standards set out in the regulation which would penalise them.</p>
<p class="contents">But how can anyone defend such exemptions on the pretext that there is disagreement? Did we tell French and Belgian chocolate manufacturers the directive would be suspended or there would be exemptions? Have we told hunters the ‘birds’ directive is on the back-burner or exemptions can apply because there is disagreement? What is the point of a legal text, months of consultation, drafting, work in committee, if it is not to be implemented? Is the European Union really just there to serve the multinationals and big business?</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a lot of fuss about nothing. The Union should not be afraid of American threats and retaliatory measures. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy unanimously supported the European Commission by adopting a draft resolution rejecting the indefinite postponement of implementation and calling on the United States not to use retaliatory measures. A strong message is needed so that the international community can get the measure of the strength of European convictions in the battle against noise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That ‘cooperation’ is the cooperation of the wolf with the lamb, and the poor majority of the population only get the dubious advantage of being exploited for the benefit not just of local potentates, but of European businesses too.</p>
<p class="contents">For two centuries France’s Mediterranean policy consisted of the colonisation of Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria. Italy’s was the occupation of Libya, and Britain’s the shameless looting of Egypt.</p>
<p class="contents">Voices have been rightly raised in this very House against the dictatorship that holds sway in Tunisia and the one that continues to rule in Morocco, even if it is more moderate. So why do we forget the material, military and diplomatic support France has given those regimes? Why do we forget France’s responsibility for the war it waged in Algeria and for the tragic situation that still exists in that country today?</p>

The main reason lies in the fact that the European Union and the Member States neglect North-South relations! This contrasts with the attention and financial aid devoted to the CEECs.</p>
<p class="contents">Far be it from me to suggest abandoning aid and support to Eastern European countries, but it is clear that we should rapidly correct this imbalance. The European Union must start facing South! The Mediterranean is a sea internal to the European Union. So it is strategically important to the stability of our continent!</p>
<p class="contents">It would be a sign of irresponsibility if we did not take account of the needs and expectations of the Mediterranean countries. The lack of progress constitutes a factor for potential crisis in this very sensitive area. In both political and economic terms, the European Union must invest more and better in the Mediterranean area!</p>
<p class="contents">It undertook to do so by signing the Barcelona Declaration, because the Euro-Mediterranean partnership was made up of three sections, a political and security section, an economic and financial section and a social, cultural and human section. It has to be acknowledged that the first section has not progressed much and political dialogue has remained virtually a dead letter. So we must relaunch that dialogue. The political changes that have occurred in several countries of the region represent an unprecedented opportunity although there are still difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter for Peace and Stability, for which guidelines were drawn up in Stuttgart last year, may constitute a good way of giving a new fillip to this political dialogue. But it will remain a declaration of intent unless there is commitment from the Mediterranean partners and the European Union to meet regularly around the negotiating table.</p>
<p class="contents">The effort has been focused on the economic section, where progress has been made, mainly thanks to the MEDA programme, the partnership’s principle financial instrument. This programme has facilitated the funding of bilateral action by the EU/Mediterranean partners. But it has virtually chosen to overlook interregional cooperation. That is an area which must be developed. Creating regional integration would guarantee the economic prosperity of this area, strengthening political stability and ensuring social development. Improvements in living conditions would make it possible to contain the fundamentalist trends for which poverty is the ideal breeding ground. Another consequence would be to reduce the pressure of migration.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the European Union must do everything possible to encourage the development of that regional integration which, in the long term, will maintain privileged links, still to be defined, with the European Union. I can very well imagine that this model could also be transposed to the East to create regional integration around Russia. I know such aspirations may seem ambitious, but they do at least represent a global and long-term vision for this policy, which is perhaps what is lacking at the present time. That is, of course, what I said during the main debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The partnership has failed to meet the expectations raised by the countries participating in the conference.</p>
<p class="contents">We are anxious to preserve the Mediterranean Basin as an area of trade and dialogue, and we want the Barcelona Process relaunched without ill-considered intervention by the European Union. In fact, the latter must take action to achieve a cultural, social and human partnership. There are still many social challenges to be faced.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation of an economic partnership is especially vital for agriculture. The European Union must provide compensation for the crucial difficulties in this sector, notably as regards fruit and vegetables, and wine-growing. The European Union must consider the island regions of the Mediterranean, particularly in terms of fisheries and agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">We are hoping for synergy in the coordination of the interregional and transnational cooperation programmes, and for coordination between the Interreg and MEDA programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, would it not be appropriate to arrange a Euro-Mediterranean conference on agriculture and fisheries involving the representatives of local and regional communities as well as professional organisations? Our reluctance to participate in the joint motion for a resolution and the vote is based on our rejection of a situation where the European Union would replace the Member States, come what may, in Mediterranean policy. In fact, Member States are directly affected by this policy. The European Union has a duty to be extremely vigilant about imports of agricultural products which threaten to imperil the whole of European production. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So we are astonished at the severity of the European Parliament’s report and the general tone of yesterday’s debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is, to have any impact on migratory flows, it is necessary to act on their indirect causes. So the action plans aim to draw up a list of problems for each target country, whether they be related to the political institutions, human rights, the economy or the government, and propose an integrated approach to the countries of the Union and to third countries, combining development aid, legal measures or foreign policy actions. So, in our opinion, it is an intelligent exercise, and the kind of thing which should be done more often at European level. </p>
<p class="contents">Why, then, are so many Members critical? First of all, because in their view this intelligent exercise is taking place in an excessively intergovernmental context and the High Level Working Group responsible for drawing up the plans is made up of Commission representatives and also – I shudder in relating – national civil servants. But, in our view, while consultation is useful at European level, it is precisely this presence of national civil servants, and the essential inclusion of the Member States in decision making which is the necessary condition of effective action plans</p>
<p class="contents">The second criticism is that the action plans are too repressive because they contain measures to combat uncontrolled immigration and they advocate an extension of the readmission agreements with third countries. But that is not a defect for us; on the contrary, it is a good idea. Indeed, it is an absolutely indispensable aspect of the plans. It makes no sense to want everything and its opposite at the same time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When it comes to the right of asylum, statements of principle are one thing, the reality of the situation is quite another. In France, for example, only 2,000 of 7,000 asylum applications have been accepted.

From south to north, from east to west, across Europe, these ceaseless waves of migrants destabilise the economic, budgetary, social, urban, religious and cultural balance. </p>
<p class="contents">Security, the first fundamental public freedom, is no longer guaranteed in European towns, the scene, since the 1970s, of drugs, muggings on trains, in the streets, on public transport, cars set alight, schools vandalised, murderous new crimes, lawlessness in the suburbs, town centres emptying and fear seeping in and taking over.</p>
<p class="contents">Observation of the facts shows that these two phenomena, migration and insecurity, are linked in time and space and involve the same persons. It can therefore be legitimately concluded that this is a case of cause and effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the Treaty of Amsterdam, Europe has been in charge of the regulation of asylum, refugees and migrants. So what is Europe doing? Europe is drawing up plans and developing measures, 108 to be precise, with unspecified funding of course. Faced with a planetary phenomenon of migration, we counter it with plans, budgets and information campaigns. No doubt if Rome, Byzantium, Spain and Europe had had such plans, then Alaric, Attila, the Saracens, Tamburlaine, the Ottomans, the sack of Rome, the fall of Constantinople, the raids on the Mediterranean coasts and centuries of fear could all have been prevented.</p>
<p class="contents">What it all adds up to is that, once again, the decision makers of the European Union are not dealing with either the causes or the scope of the problem. In the end, if there is a migration towards the European continent, that is because this continent is emptying fast. Italy, for example, will lose 17 million people from the workforce between now and 2050, and you are happy to conclude, along with the UN population division, that 159 million non-Europeans will have to be imported between now and 2050.</p>
<p class="contents">But between now and 2050, two generations could be born here, in Europe, with the right demographic policy for the same budgetary cost as has been allocated to importing non-Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">With population growth relaunched, Europe would create the internal market, the new demand and the additional dynamism needed to resolve at a stroke the stupid problem of unemployment created artificially by a policy of recession, immigration and ruinous taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">But for that to happen, we would have to deal with causes and the European Union is all about treating symptoms, prescribing palliatives and nursing care for an extremely elderly continent which is being allowed to sink into an Asian and African demographic lagoon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report is also a good text in that respect.</p>
<p class="contents">However, after the speeches other Members have made about the necessary and legitimate condemnation of child prostitution, those who organise it and those who make use of it, I want to talk about the general phenomenon of prostitution. In the wake of Mrs Gröner and Mrs Roure, who tackled this phenomenon, I want to mention the upsurge in prostitution in Strasbourg and Brussels during this Parliament’s part-sessions. Of course, our institution as such is not responsible for this evil. All the same, the coincidence is distressing.</p>
<p class="contents">Tolerating prostitution, closing one’s eyes to the shop windows, right here in Brussels, where prostitutes are on show like so much merchandise, as if this were a commercial activity which could be listed in a trading register, is ignoble and also irresponsible on the part of elected representatives responsible for the welfare of the community. We can hardly be surprised that certain individuals, at best psychologically weak, at worst deliberately criminal, lose all their moral principles and commit reprehensible acts not because of any geographic remoteness or cultural difference, but because, in their own countries, those moral principles have disintegrated.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not just children’s human dignity that must be defended, even though their natural vulnerability justifies our affording them major protection. That dignity must be defended and promoted for each and every one of us. If dignity does not belong to everyone then it ceases to exist. The struggle against the scourge of prostitution will only be really effective when we stop talking about ourselves in one way and about other people in another way, and when we apply to ourselves the principles and measures we legitimately want to see applied elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">Selling one’s body to survive is often the outcome of a desperate situation which we must remedy by ambitious policies to develop and support charitable organisations involved in bringing up children. Exploiting that economic and social misery, as pimp or client, is a criminal act and that is how we must approach it. The Klamt report is perhaps not sufficiently ambitious, but at least it has the merit of going in the right direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Commission has drawn up a report of the measures which have been taken in this field. In view of the results, it is clear that the European Union and its Member States must increase their efforts to combat sex tourism and the exploitation of children. The Member States must pass extra-territorial legislation allowing them to carry out investigations, prosecute and punish any individual guilty of crimes committed abroad and linked to child sex abuse.</p>
<p class="contents">We must go even further and establish measures such as a coherent child protection policy by creating a new general legal base in the context of the next revision of the Treaty, with adequate Community funding. I also think it is essential to incorporate the rights of the child into the Charter of Fundamental Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In conjunction with this, we must take action at grass-roots level by encouraging travel agencies, tour operators, transport and advertising companies to set up self-regulation systems designed to combat child sex tourism, and by creating free helplines for children in distress in every Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Exemplary penalties must be imposed on the people guilty of such monstrous behaviour. The fact is, when people are in a foreign country, in an unfamiliar region, they can act in complete anonymity and convince themselves that child abuse is less reprehensible in a different social and cultural context, and that the moral principles in force in their own country do not apply. That is intolerable! We must not be blind to the fact that the Internet facilitates these ‘practices’. This is why Parliament calls on the Commission to assess the link between child pornography on the Internet and the growth in sex tourism, and to propose practical measures against the phenomenon!</p>
<p class="contents">It is also essential to recognise that prostitution in general in the developing countries is very often due to poverty, affecting children, women and men. We must also fight on those grounds because there will always be unscrupulous people around to exploit human poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to end by reaffirming that children, this world’s future, are one of the most vulnerable groups in the population, with specific needs that have to be protected. We must never forget that every individual’s childhood and the particular circumstances of their family and social circle in large measure determines their adult life. Consequently, all the European Union and Member State institutions must be inspired in their action by the protection of children’s rights as recognised in the United Nations Convention of 20 November 1989.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Amendment No 1, which defines the child as any person under the age of 18 years, seems to me essential to the consistency of this report. The report rightly places this form of slavery in the general context of cross-border organised crime. That means the fight we are engaged in here cannot be dissociated from the problem of the trade in human beings and child pornography. Faced with the exponential development of the latter on the Internet, Amendment No 2 is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">It is all the more necessary to criminalise these forms of child slavery because there is a line of thought seeking to gain currency today for the idea that ‘sex workers’ are workers like any others. But a fundamental boundary has been overstepped when sexually exploited children are also represented as ‘workers’. In fact, this comes down to accepting the phenomenon of child sex tourism, on the pretext that the social and cultural context is different in countries where it is not unusual to work as a little slave from the age of five.</p>
<p class="contents">To stop that kind of sideways drift, the report rightly recommends supporting the draft optional protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and pornography portraying minors, which would be attached to the International Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>
<p class="contents">Criminal law must remain within the Member States’ area of competence but, to be effective, the struggle against organised crime undeniably involves strengthening judicial cooperation in criminal cases, on the basis of extending the Europol mandate. Amendment No 3 broadens the terms of this measure. The creation of a European observatory for missing children would seem to respond to the disturbing situations in the candidate countries and the vulnerability of some young people in our own countries (asylum seekers, illegal immigrants, young people from broken homes and marginalised families, and so on).</p>
<p class="contents">Let us try to look out for the future of these child victims, not just for the psychological consequences but also for the medical effects. The sex industry destroys the prospects of children who pick up the AIDS virus and sexually transmissible diseases. These sick children cannot even return to their families, which are just as crushed by poverty and social or ethnic discrimination. Any paedophiles found guilty must be banned from activities involving contact with minors and we must crack down hard on them, as called for in Amendment No 9.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am delighted Mr Marchiani’s amendments reaffirming the criminal nature of child sex tourism have been incorporated but, at the same time, I am disappointed at the rejection of other amendments tabled by my colleague which were intended to strengthen the principles set out in the text, without altering its general meaning.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, this form of ‘tourism’ is a crime. How else could we, as parents, especially mothers, and elected representatives, doubly responsible for the continuity of our societies, regard these acts, all the more heinous because they are committed against the weakest of all? But should we be astonished at this phenomenon when, at the same time, the development of prostitution, more generally, does not cause offence? How can we criminalise the perverts who go to the ends of the earth to violate children without, at the same time, condemning the pimps and clients who exploit girls from the East attracted to our countries by lies, and even by force?</p>
<p class="contents">This is an area where double standards must apply least of all. Belgian society is currently being rocked by paedophile trials, and similar proceedings often go on in our own countries. The poverty of some parts of the world is certainly used by irresponsible adults to try to explain the unjustifiable sexual exploitation of children. Nevertheless, the permissiveness of our societies, the libertarian views some people express, even in this House, are undoubtedly the essential root of this evil, with geographical remoteness just an illusory and gratuitous excuse for the depraved. We cannot rejoice at so-called taboos collapsing, and then lament crimes which are merely the consequence of the disappearance of rules that are natural to all social life.</p>
<p class="contents">We must condemn these practices. Our respective states must take the necessary measures to prosecute and sentence those found guilty. But back home, in our own countries and towns, we must combat the sexual exploitation of children, which is only the most despicable form of sexual exploitation of any human being. The dignity of the individual, of the weakest in particular and of all in general, must be our guideline, in this area as in any other.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report focuses specifically on combating child sex tourism but, as we all know, the issue is much broader than this.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, with new technology and globalisation, child pornography on the Internet, in particular, is an ever-growing international problem. Technology is proceeding faster than individual governments can legislate. Europe can act by strengthening child protection legislation and ensuring adequate child protection, particularly in some of the applicant countries, such as Romania and Hungary.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, it seems that animals have more rights than children in Europe. I believe we must be vigilant and ensure strong, effective measures are put in place to protect the rights of children in e-Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Progress is, of course, being made. More and more European money is being given to combat child sex tourism and to increase public awareness about child protection, with a EUR 1 million separate budget line, and the STOP and DAPHNE programmes. But whilst I welcome the positive noises coming from Brussels, it is not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I am not calling for a nanny-state approach, but simply that, in a civilised society, we recognise the right of children to their childhood. That is too precious to become the plaything of wealthy, western tourists. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it is precisely the subject of renewable energy sources that must be freed from the burden of ideology and wishful thinking, as well as from the material misuse of energy sources themselves. The present report on the subject of renewable energy sources does precisely the opposite, and that is why I have rejected it. What, for example, is to be made of the much-touted benefits of wind power, something I consider to be an economic and ecological mistake? No appreciable percentage of an ultramodern industrial state’s energy needs can be met from wind power. We are still talking about mere thousandths of the overall requirement. </p>
<p class="contents">Last year in Germany, two billion kilowatt hours were generated through wind power. That is just 0.8% of the total requirement of 2,500 billion kilowatts, and even that has cost the taxpayer DM 3 billion in grants. Clearly, then, the future does not lie down this particular road, and we should therefore turn back from this economic and ecological blind alley and find ourselves a new direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Of course, there is no problem with the general aims of the report. The current situation and its share of disasters now regularly oblige us to recognise the importance of what is at stake, and there is no difficulty at this time in making fishermen, oyster farmers and other operators on the French coast see the advantages of doing away with an energy policy whose conditions require unregulated rusty boats to transport carcinogenic oil waste under flags of convenience.</p>
<p class="contents">At that point, however, under the dual influence of the compromises so dear to this House and the environmentalist creed which takes off from confirmed observations into flights of utopian fancy, Mr Turmes report becomes a truly labyrinthine system, producing absolutely everything but the simple promotion of renewable energies.</p>
<p class="contents">So we will pass over in silence, out of charity, the side-effects of the rapporteur’s proposal for the creation of a tax on CO2 emissions, which highlights the environmentally-friendly nature of nuclear energy and how ‘clean’ it is, thus contributing to the preservation of the ozone layer. We are delighted at this possible interpretation, but we doubt whether that was your intention.</p>
<p class="contents">But, on the other hand, we must emphasise that from your first paragraph onwards you are proposing nothing less than the creation of a European tax. The adoption of such a measure would be regarded as creating an extremely serious precedent by anyone opposed to a standardised European taxation system.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="underline">You ingenuously demand the uniform application of Community guidelines on state aid, with all Member States and all energy subject to the same provisions. You hope thereby eventually, well, as soon as possible, really, to impose not just common but identical energy policy on Northern Finland, Central Spain, the Southern Alps and the outermost regions of the Union. It is symbolic, and really rather distressing, that the only amendment tabled at the sitting emphasises the specific nature of island situations, proof of the lack of discernment to which your frenzy to impose your idea of energy policy drives you.</span></p>
<p class="contents">But your egalitarian fancy turns into doctrinaire blindness when you express the wish to see restrictive targets imposed on the Member States, supported by sanctions if these targets are not achieved. This type of challenge is not appropriate in an area which has not yet officially ceased regarding the Member States as independent nations, freely implementing policies of their own choice.</p>
<p class="contents">You have the merit of having shown your hand, although in a rather peremptory way, by affirming that the Member States recognise that it is necessary to promote renewable sources of energy as a priority. We believe it is indeed necessary to promote these renewable energy sources, but that the priority is to draw up an overall energy plan which treats existing sources with some respect and, in particular, includes the adaptations of nuclear infrastructure needed for greater safety. Because, actually, its total eradication, which you seem to be so keen on, is impossible without exclusively handing over seven-tenths of the surface of the planet to the development of the replacement energies, as you define them.</p>
<p class="contents">That simple observation is all it takes to condemn a text where good intentions are not enough to mask federalist logic and a dangerous lack of realism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we were very divided when it came to the vote. I, for example, voted for the resolution because, for me, it sent out important signals concerning human dignity. Many in the group – quite rightly, too, I think – abstained from voting because most of the amendments of the Group of the European People’s Party were adopted. </p>
<p class="contents">I think it was the wish of the Group of the European People’s Party to attempt to transform this motion for a resolution into an advert for the patenting directive. They did not succeed, but they have nonetheless weakened the resolution. However, I am confident that the European Parliament will stop deceiving itself before long, by which I mean deceiving itself that the directive on patenting prohibits the patenting of human genes or parts of the human genetic make-up. That is unfortunately not the case. There is absolutely no point in burying one’s head in the sand and always maintaining the opposite of what is in fact the case, on the principle that the more you insist on something, the closer it comes to becoming a reality. Contrary to what Parliament believes, this patent is no isolated case. For years, the European Parliament has not patented human genes where they originate, in the body. However, the patenting of human genes and parts of the human genetic make-up still goes on. This is an affront to human dignity and also signifies a commercialisation of the human body. I was delighted to see that both the European and the German federations of medical practitioners are so clear-sighted about the fact and have also warned that research might be impeded by the patenting of genes. </p>
<p class="contents">It is also nonsense and self-deluding to maintain that the directive on patenting would prohibit this. I think this very case has shown that we need to revise the directive on patenting and that, above all, we need a moratorium on the patenting of human genes and parts of the human genetic make-up, for I believe that, with the granting of the present patent, the ethical and social consequences have become more than clear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This neither helps clarify patent law in the European Union nor makes for better and urgently needed protection against the rampant commercialisation of the building blocks of life. On the contrary. In its current form, the adopted text further reduces the minimum level of protection provided under the 1998 directive on bio-patents. In this way, there is a growing danger that the genetic inheritance of mankind will be taken from the community as a whole and made into a profitable commodity for the few. In order to counter this danger, my group and I have voted in such a way as to reject any elements which have nothing to do with patent protection for biotechnological inventions. In the end, we have voted as a unit against the resolution. That does not prevent me and my group from campaigning, in the future too, for a situation in which ethical limits upon medical research and therapy are all complied with. It is human dignity which provides the decisive standard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">While I understand the argument that bona fide cloning experimentation may contribute to scientific advances which would alleviate human suffering, I must point out that there exists a loophole for the totally unacceptable usage of the human embryo at the stage of stem cells, cultures ‘out of their natural environment’.

The Patent office has acknowledged a ‘linguistic’ mistake which does not seem to be entirely corroborated by Article 11 of the description of the intervention. A mistake like that becomes symbolic, a sort of Freudian slip, and it has impelled us today to hold this fundamental debate on cloning, certainly, but above all on whether the living organism should be patented.</p>
<p class="contents">Soon we will be cloning our pets. Just recently there was the statement by Bill Clinton and Tony Blair on free access to the genetic heritage of human beings, plants, animals and genes have been patented, and Craig Venter claims to own 97% of the human genome. GM corn, manipulation of the living organism, transplanting animal organs into human beings – we are entering unknown territory and there are great fears we must confront. Where will it end? Why should we put our trust in science alone in this new context? The issues and debates we face are increasingly complex and politicians will soon have to be multilingual and multicultural scientific experts as well, if they want to understand and not accept the word of experts as gospel. As elected representatives and citizens, we are outpaced by issues where the scientific component is too strong.</p>
<p class="contents">Science and the experts are suffering the consequences of serious crises (for instance, mad cow disease) and indeed the implications of crises to come, because they cannot tell us what the results of their interventions will be: dissemination of GMOs in the environment, manipulation of the living organism, genetic manipulation. Science itself seems outpaced by the onward rush of sorcerer’s apprentices with no longer any taboos, moral boundaries or ethics. Their research laboratories, which long ago became ivory towers, are increasingly surrounded by the business offices which are proliferating in this new biological El Dorado between knowledge and profit. There is plenty of money at stake. Will the political authorities have the power to regulate this new market and ensure that the ethical dimension is respected in genetics? Or will we soon find ourselves in the kind of world depicted in that excellent film ‘Gattaca’? It is not enough for the Patent Office to acknowledge a mistake and make its excuses. There are so many uncertainties at the legal and moral level, about the future acceptability of patents applied for, which are currently in the thousands.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate about the moral boundaries of biotechnology and how to control them has begun. Categories of ‘forbidden knowledge’ must certainly be created but without making the mistake of those who condemned Copernicus, Harvey (the heart is not the repository of the soul, but a large organ), or Jenner (the smallpox vaccine).</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
