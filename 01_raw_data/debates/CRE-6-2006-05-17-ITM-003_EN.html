<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Reimer Böge (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following difficult negotiations, we are today able to put before you the draft of an interinstitutional agreement on budgetary discipline and sound and sustainable management of the Budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, at the outset, to thank all those in this House who helped make it possible for this result to be achieved, in particular Mr Lewandowski, Mr Walter and Mr Mulder, who made up the negotiating team, along with the groups’ coordinators and staff, with especial thanks to the staff of the Bureau, who have really done a splendid job of work over the past months.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever our differences, this way of working together was and is the strength of this House, in that we feel a sense of obligation to add value to Europe rather than engaging in a one-sided debate about net contributions and the backflow of financial resources. The title of this agreement is a programme in itself, in that the Commission, the Council and Parliament are committing themselves to the framework conditions of the annual budget procedure and of multiannual financial planning until 2013. They are committing themselves to improving the agreement that has been in force up to now and amend the Council decision of December 2005. What that means is that our budget procedures can be more flexible. It means that we can respond better and more quickly to exceptional political, humanitarian and economic circumstances. What we have managed to secure is a reform of the Budget legislation, the simplification of the Budget Regulations, certification of EU programmes and reporting responsibilities for the Member States, more reliable financial planning and clear agreements when new agencies are to be established.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, the Council and Parliament are also committing themselves to modernising the financial instruments by drawing on the European Investment Bank’s lending facilities. That will be important in terms of research, innovation and small and medium-sized businesses and could create an important leverage effect by boosting investments.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement with the Council in December was also underpinned by what I have no option but to call targeted rebates and Christmas presents. By way of contrast, what we have secured through our negotiations is additional funding for programmes that really do provide added value for Europe, namely programmes for lifelong learning, for the trans-European networks, for research, for social policy, for innovation in the small and medium-sized business sector, for cross-border cooperation, for Natura 2000, for Life +, for health and consumer policies, for culture, youth and media. In foreign and security policy and in the neighbourhood policy, too, we have been able to make substantial improvements.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole may well, when added up, be a small amount when set against financial planning overall, but it secures the programmes that matter to the public, that bring added value to Europe and bear our signature, for this House, unlike the Council, was intent upon something more than a debate about 1%. What we wanted to do was to define an across-the-board negotiating position on the basis of an in-depth analysis of the political and economic challenges of an enlarged EU, as documented in the June resolution, with internal and external priorities, modernised budget structures and better-quality budget management.</p>
<p class="contents">We have not, by a long way, achieved everything, but we have been able to negotiate a big package and, to some extent, to make cracks in the Council’s concrete structures. Implementing the reforms, in particular, will bring considerable pecuniary benefit to the Union, to the Member States, and to those who have implemented the Community programmes. We have managed to enhance Parliament’s prerogatives as regards all the external policy instruments; Parliament has been accorded an appropriate role in the forthcoming 2008/2009 audit, and it will be possible, on the basis of the Commission's statement on the evaluation of these agreements in 2009, to ensure that the Parliament that will by then be newly elected can have its say.</p>
<p class="contents">Some deficits, though, still remain. The Galileo satellite programme is still underfunded, and there are – to say the least – question marks against the decisions on rural development and on voluntary modulation in agriculture policy. Natura 2000 has been left to decay somewhat; work on it and on other projects remains uncompleted, but I would ask our friends in the Council and the Commission to watch their step, for the 8 June 2005 resolution goes on to describe the financial resources and reforms that are – from our point of view – ideally suited to achieving the ambitious objectives of a union of citizens and states, and that is something to which we shall return time and again. We will be very vigilant in ensuring that the letter and spirit of all agreements are complied with.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to express my gratitude to the Austrian Presidency, for our negotiations with it were constructive and fair. The Presidency can certainly not have had an easy job with so many opponents of reform in the Council and in COREPER.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by expressing my deep gratitude to the Commissioner with responsibility for budgets. Following on from what one might term a period of weakness and a Commission position more strongly influenced by the Council, she has come back to making a positive and essential contribution to the final outcome that gives us hope for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, and under the prevailing conditions, the result incorporates important points on which progress has been made for the good of the public and with reform, a modernised budget, and the defence of Parliament’s prerogatives in mind. It is for this reason that I recommend that the House should vote to approve this agreement.</p>

I wish to point out that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has been asked to deliver an opinion on the compatibility of the Interinstitutional Agreement with the treaties in force. There is no legal obstacle to its adoption.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it is not for the Committee to assess the merits of the agreement, it should be noted that, on an institutional level, the agreement respects Parliament’s prerogatives as an arm of the budgetary authority. In this report, Parliament emphasises that future financial frameworks should be set up for a five-year period, in line with the terms of office of Parliament and the Commission. This in our view is a necessary step towards greater public scrutiny and democratic monitoring of the Union’s budgetary options.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise that has been reached between the parties does not live up to the vision and ambition shared by many Members of Parliament, myself included. At various times during the negotiations, the opinions of the Council, especially as regards financial appropriations, fell well short of the statements of intent expressed by the negotiators in successive conclusions of European Councils and in numerous speeches made by national and European politicians.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of the difficulties, Parliament was able to obtain this satisfactory compromise, which safeguards cohesion as a fundamental principle of the Union and the priority attached to the Lisbon Strategy. For Parliament to give its public assent, it does not need to consider that the agreement reached is perfect. With its shortcomings, the current text represents huge progress from the initial negotiating positions, and is infinitely better than brandishing an interinstitutional iron fist, which would have been irresponsible and for which the Union and its citizens would have paid a heavy price.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement on the review 2009 ensures that Parliament will participate on an equal footing. The review will cover all aspects of the Union’s system of spending resources and will have to address the issue of the reform of own resources. This key debate will benefit from the experience of implementing the agreement before us. This interinstitutional agreement was negotiated under extremely difficult circumstances. It is clearly a success and good news for Europe, especially given the atmosphere of crisis surrounding projects and leadership that has beset Europe in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">I should particularly like to commend Mr Böge, who led the negotiations on Parliament’s behalf with great skill and personal commitment on such a broad, complex issue, in a hostile political climate characterised by a crisis of confidence in the European project, by deep differences between the Member States and the institutions, and by a degree of confusion over the Union’s objectives.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karl-Heinz Grasser, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. <span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my apologies for the slight delay in my arrival. Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to address your House on the subject of how our Union is to be funded in future, and on the interinstitutional agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that the negotiations on the Interinstitutional Agreement were never a simple matter. What made them a particular challenge this time round was the fact that there were 25 Member States to negotiate with rather than 15, not to mention the fact that your House has become, as an institution, stronger, with more clout, and, quite rightly, greater importance, and acts with the self-confidence one would expect of such a body.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that your House’s negotiating team did not give us an easy ride. I am, however, very grateful for the consistently positive and constructive atmosphere in our conversations and negotiations, and I would like to extend very warm thanks to the team from your House that negotiated with us, consisting of Mr Lewandowski, Mr Böge, Mr Walter and Mr Mulder, for making it possible for us to do so in a constructive spirit, with one single end in view, that being to find a solution for the European Union. The way in which we worked together can be taken as an example of how our two institutions should collaborate generally, that is to say, with the political will to find a solution, even if we did perhaps start out from positions at a great distance from one another.</p>
<p class="contents">The result is one with which you will all be familiar, and so I would like just to sketch it out point by point; there is a detailed description of it in Mr Böge’s report. We know that there is no getting away from the fact that we will attach different values to results such as this one. It is inevitable that we cannot all be completely satisfied with what emerged from the negotiations, but I can offer you some consolation. There are some members of the Council who feel exactly the same way, that they cannot go along100% with what the presidency and your House have hammered out together. That is how it is with any and every compromise. I believe that the result is fair and evenly balanced. The mere fact that we have been able to achieve a result on a matter that is central to the European Union is something I regard as a triumph in itself. We all agree that 2005 was a difficult year for the European Union, and it was good, necessary and important that we should have been able to demonstrate the capacity to act as a European Union that currently comprises 25 Member States and will soon number 27 of them. I believe that every institution has done exactly what its responsibilities demanded of it, and that the search for the best possible European solution brought forth a climate of cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">If you look at the figures, I am certain that we can, on the one hand, face the public, the taxpayers, with confidence and tell them that we are being careful with the Community’s tax revenues. On the other hand, though, we are deliberately prioritising those areas where there is a need for more growth, more jobs and a reduction in the number of unemployed, which is our common goal. If you make a comparison with what we are now, in 2006, spending on important categories such as trans-European network, education and research among others, then I think we could negotiate and agree together on decidedly marked increases for the next period.</p>
<p class="contents">I have just three brief observations to make. I think it would be right and proper for us to agree on a new Part 3 of the Interinstitutional Agreement, dealing with the economic management of the EU’s funds. I believe that it matters that EU funds be subject to more effective controls, and, just as I have in the past, would like to stress our willingness to engage in dialogue on the common goal of improving those controls and the ways in which we plan our finances.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the overall ceiling to consider. We all know how very difficult it was to achieve consensus on this in the Council in December, and that raising this ceiling was therefore a very difficult issue for the Council. I think we really can regard the present increase in funds as a good investment, and am glad that it was eventually possible to achieve a satisfactory and well-considered compromise that has also secured the balance between the institutions and has therefore made no excessive demands on any of them.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point is that it is also, I think, important that we should have agreed on a statement on the review of the financial framework, one of the most important reasons for that being that it takes full account of Parliament’s rights and responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by saying that I have always been convinced that there can be only one common solution to the vital question of our joint financial arrangements and the agreement between the three institutions. This is a fundamental issue for the EU, and division on it would have done the Europe in which we share no good whatever. Our consensus is a demonstration of the fact that, together, we are capable of acting on behalf of this Union of ours and sends an important message to our people.</p>
<p class="contents">The day before yesterday – 15 May – this Interinstitutional Agreement was approved by the General Affairs Council and I ask your House to join with us in giving it your approval and adopting it today. Again, I thank you for the good negotiations and for your willingness to allow me the time today to say what I have said. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like personally to thank the European Parliament’s negotiating team, Mr Böge, Mr Lewandowski, Mr Mulder and Mr Walter, for the remarkable job they did. Their support and tight cooperation has brought great results. I would also like to thank the Minister for his untiring efforts to reach an agreement. That was also very helpful.</p>
<p class="contents">We understand that this agreement does not reflect every area of our original ambitions, but it is the best possible compromise for today. It is a success, in particular because it encompasses not only quantitative elements but also includes a new chapter on sound financial management and a number of solid institutional commitments towards more effective budgetary management.</p>
<p class="contents">The way EU money is spent is at least as important as the level of expenditure. In this respect I very much welcome the new commitments included in the IIA as regards increasing the accountability of all financial actors, including the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement is good news for an enlarged Europe, because it means that we now have a clear financial framework for the development of the Union over the next seven years, with full participation by the new Member States in key European policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement contains many positive elements, in particular the boost to the development of the new Member States. We increased funding for programmes directly related to the new Lisbon Agenda. There are also new elements. For the first time, the agreement entails a joint effort with the European Investment Bank. Those funds will help act as a catalyst for Lisbon-related priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, one should not forget the increased flexibility achieved through different instruments, to be mobilised where necessary for unforeseen events and needs. This agreement also clearly recognises the role Parliament will play in the wide-ranging review covering all aspects of EU spending and resources, which will be one of the top priorities in the coming years. This agreement is an essential milestone, but we will now have to move swiftly to build on the momentum created by this agreement to accelerate and complete the legislative process necessary to get all programmes up and running from next year.</p>
<p class="contents">Again, let me thank all actors who participated in these negotiations, and I wish Members a very good debate with a positive outcome.</p>

<p class="contents">I must reflect a rather negative position from that committee: in June 2005 you will recall that this Hemicycle was encircled by a 'Make Poverty History' band. Unfortunately, that hope has been dissipated as today we discuss Financial Perspective proposals that reflect lower levels of growth for the Development Cooperation Instrument than is the case for all Europe's other external actions. How can we believe that it is possible for Europe to meet its Millennium Development Goal targets if resources are to be limited for those critical years up to 2013?</p>
<p class="contents">Europe's preoccupation with counterterrorism and with migration should not dictate that resources should be diverted away from our essential task, which is to work with the pressing needs of the world's poorest people and poorest countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Development Committee also firmly rejects the language used by the Commission, which presumes that the proposals to rationalise the instrument have the potential to enhance either the coherence or the responsiveness of the European Union as a development partner.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, our commitment is to fund human and social development in the world's poorest countries. As things stand, I think we tragically face the likelihood that Europe will be seen as reneging on those principles and on those priorities. I also feel that the strong and welcome commitment made last year by us all – the Commission, Parliament and, in particular, the Council and the Member States – is now seriously under threat and the Committee on Development has to express its deep concern about the effects of the Financial Perspectives on its work.</p>

<p class="contents">One is that it is of the utmost importance that funds should be made available for the European Union’s peacekeeping operations in the Balkans and also in many other countries around the world. There is now the prospect of an operation in the Congo. That the funding has been topped up is something to be welcomed, but we would prefer it not to be divided up. The civilian component will be funded from the European Union’s budget, and the rest provided by the Member States from their current income. This results in shadow budgets that are ever more difficult to monitor as a consequence of their no longer being subject to the full scrutiny of the national parliaments, or, indeed of the European Parliament either. This must surely be counted as a deficit.</p>
<p class="contents">I might add that it is also of paramount importance that we have discovered deficits in these overseas operations, specifically in connection with reconnaissance and telecommunications. If we are to send troops on difficult missions, it is very important that it should first be ascertained what is going on on the ground, and for that we need satellite-based reconnaissance systems. It is irresponsible to deploy troops with five or six different types of communications apparatus, which often work together only with difficulty or are not mutually compatible at all. That is why we in the European Union need a single satellite reconnaissance system and common standards for telecommunications in this sphere. Another reason why that is particularly important is that it is the very same deficits that are to be found among the police and in disaster prevention and management centres. Let us imagine Europe being struck by a tsunami. In that event, it will, in the first place be of the utmost importance to be able to see what is happening, but also, and secondly, that those managing the disaster, the police and the armed forces, be enabled to communicate with one another without difficulty. This is another important task for the budget of the European Union.</p>

I would also like to take this opportunity of thanking my colleagues on the negotiating team, the Commission and the Austrian Presidency. I take the view that we have achieved as much as we could.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to budgetary control, undoubtedly the most important thing is the fact that we have been given a clause in the agreement about better control on spending and certification. After all, the Court of Auditors has been issuing negative Statements of Assurance for the past 11 years, and this is something that the European public will no longer accept from us. Last year, we stated for the first time that national statements should be introduced. Before the negotiations, 23 of the 25 Member States were still opposed to the idea; after the negotiations, they were all in favour.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it very important for the sake of the Commission that we should, in future, hold firm to the idea that Member States make those statements one way or another. I happen to know that there are a few that have objected to this. Fortunately, this is not officially reflected in any way in the documents we are ratifying today, but it will cause a problem for the future. It is important to this House that the Commission implement this agreement as it was intended.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, of course, a number of drawbacks to this agreement. Indeed, it is impossible to please everybody all of the time. For me, what poses the greatest risk is the Council’s declaration in the area of voluntary modulation. The common market for agricultural products is one of the things we have achieved in Europe. If we start with 20% – or any other percentage – of voluntary modulation, then this strikes at the very root of the common agricultural policy. That is very dangerous and something we must avoid. If this House is to have any say in the matter, I will – for as long as I am still a member of it – try to prevent this from happening.</p>

<p class="contents">The Regional Affairs Committee, though, is well aware of its responsibility to the 360 million voters who would like to get started on the programmes with which we seek to help the European Union’s poorest regions. Final agreement on the Financial Perspective provides, at long last, the political, economic and financial stability for these proposals to be actually put into effect.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not just the people in the new Member States who are looking to the European Union for support. It is because European structural and regional policies are up and running in every Member States that I ask that the proposal that Mr Böge has put forward should indeed get the backing of a majority in this House today.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity of expressing my thanks to the House for the way in which the negotiations were conducted, and also to say ‘thank you’ for the additional EUR 300 million allocated to territorial cooperation and for the efforts made towards creating a single legal framework.

Indeed, in the budget negotiation, heading 2, 'Preservation and management of natural resources', obtained an extra EUR 100 million under a reserve for forthcoming measures in the fields of Life + and of Natura 2000 and nothing more, despite the efforts of the negotiating team, to whose work I pay tribute.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides the fact that this does not by any means settle the Natura 2000 network's funding problems, I should like to highlight the fact that no answer has been given to all the other remarks and criticisms contained in my opinion, which was virtually unanimously adopted within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. I would point out that one of the main aims of the CAP reform, which was decided in September 2003, was to freeze the first pillar in order to strengthen the second pillar, namely rural development policy. However, it turns out that the package earmarked for rural development has been reduced by some EUR 20 billion in comparison with what the Commission had proposed, which, in the regions of the 15 old Member States, represents a 35% decrease in relation to the current 2000-2006 period. That is a huge decrease and comes on top of the reduction in the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">This is clearly going to result in more people leaving our rural areas and, indirectly, in the problems within our towns and suburbs becoming more acute. The first pillar, for its part, is going to come under strong downwards pressure: compulsory and optional modulation, financial discipline, reform of the common organisations of the market and WTO negotiation.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2003 agreements have therefore been completely disregarded, and the balance that was struck is being called into question before the 2008-2009 revision period is even looked at. Like Mr Mulder, I also want to stress that the optional modulation in these unconditional procedures resolves nothing. On the contrary, it is going to present some serious technical problems and create distortions of competition; I regard the Interinstitutional Agreement's concluding statements on this subject as being very weak in comparison with the risks taken. As far as I am concerned, this is the start of a renationalisation of the CAP; I will therefore vote against this agreement.</p>

<p class="contents">The final agreement on the financial perspective is not the one we would have liked for this policy, for fisheries, but I would like to put it this way: it represents the minimum necessary for us to be able to vote in favour. We cannot ignore the fact that there have been reductions compared to the initial proposal, and the funds available will therefore have to be used extremely efficiently. This period is going to require special work by the Fisheries Directorate-General. Furthermore, Commissioner Borg has taken on the task of implementing a new maritime policy within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of fisheries, ladies and gentlemen, we are still awaiting the adoption of the relevant regulations, and I would therefore call upon the Council to adopt the Regulation on the European Fisheries Fund as soon as possible, so that the Member States can draw up their programmes as quickly as possible and plan their spending as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the Commission to make every effort to keep the policy of international agreements alive and kicking and make the best possible use of these funds, in order to ensure that Europe has an efficient and competitive fisheries sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like finally to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Böge, on his excellent work, and I also believe that the Temporary Committee has done very good work.</p>

<p class="contents">If you believe the pious utterances of politicians in every one of our 25 Member States, these programmes are part of the European Union’s most important field of action, but when it comes to making available the funding that young people need, the 25 governments keep out of sight and make swingeing cuts, particularly to important investments in our young people’s futures. It is for that reason that I want to tell the Commission and this house how grateful the Culture Committee is to them for not merely talking but also acting and, in their proposals, sketching out appropriate dimensions for these programmes. Let me give you just two examples to show why I am talking about the number of young people and not just about the financial aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">The first example is Erasmus – the student exchange – and both institutions suggested that 285 000 exchange students per annum is a workable figure, only for the 25 governments – in the person of the Council – to make a drastic cut of over 50% in that number and reduce it to 140 000. The cut made to Leonardo – the training programme – was from 150 000 to 36 000. It is for that reason that I am very appreciative of all those Members who helped to ensure that what emerged at the end of deliberations at least bore Parliament's stamp and that the sums of EUR 800 million for lifelong learning and EUR 300 million for other programmes achieved some sort of credibility in this area.</p>

<p class="contents">From the very start of the negotiation process, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs made four precise demands. Firstly, we demanded that the freedom, security and justice sector be the subject of a specific and independent sub-heading in the new financial framework so as to highlight its importance in political terms. We obtained that sub-heading: it is sub-heading 3a.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we proposed appreciably to increase the appropriations with a view to anticipating the threat of terrorism and the development of organised crime and to responding to the demands for external borders to be controlled better and for migratory flows to be managed better. We obtained that increase in appropriations. During the next seven years, it will be possible to increase the appropriations allocated to the creation of the area of freedom, security and justice by 167% – yes, 167%. That is by far the strongest potential growth of the new financial framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we requested authorisation to finance the new agencies by means other than the financial framework, so as to preserve the resources dedicated to the operational programmes. If I have correctly understood the arrangement included in point D of part III, it will be necessary, in future, to obtain the agreement of the two arms of the budgetary authority that any new agency can be financed before it is created. This financing will therefore not be automatically covered by the financial perspective. We can be satisfied with this, even if we had hoped for something better.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we, in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, proposed that a kind of trialogue with Parliament and the Council be established before the Council’s first reading of the budget, and we did so with a view to harmonising the positions held by the two institutions regarding the political priorities and the distribution of resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Admittedly, this arrangement does not appear as such in the text of the Interinstitutional Agreement, but rather as a unilateral declaration by the European Parliament: it is Declaration 13. We have not obtained everything that we asked for, but it is true that we have obtained a slight improvement and, nowadays, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a slight improvement – to quote Raymond Devos – is indeed something; it is a significant step. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, the Council’s tight-fistedness and short-sightedness, arising out of national considerations, have triumphed over Parliament’s and the Commission’s European ambition. We will nevertheless be voting in favour of this Interinstitutional Agreement, since it is the only compromise possible under the current circumstances. Indeed, the lack of financial perspectives in the next few years would plunge the Union into an even deeper crisis than the one it is already in. Moreover, it would not be fair on the new Member States, for they need future prospects in order to continue their cohesion policy and to be fully integrated into the common market. This does not alter the fact that the present level of resources is insufficient to meet Europe’s new challenges. That is why the review clause and flexibility scheme were an absolute necessity, because the risk that sooner or later, we will run aground, is too great. Parliament should be fully involved in this. The most important conclusion we can draw, though, is that the current system of own resources has reached capacity levels. There is a need for sweeping reform. We must move away from the system of donations from national budgets, and return to real own resources as was the case at the start of European integration in respect of customs rights. That is the only way of ensuring that the European general interest will prevail over the narrow-minded and short-sighted national interest. This House must play a role – a driving role – in this and formulate proposals, and Mr Lamassoure’s studies and notes are a good place to start.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ralf Walter, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PSE Group</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it has to be said, with all due respect, that there is such a thing as the European Parliament and that decisions on Europe’s finances are not left to the Council alone.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the reason why this House, through the negotiating process, achieved important improvements simply because, from the word go, we did not work on the basis of ‘Here’s the money, now work out how to manage on it’, but instead paid attention to the structures. We took care that we did not, as we had done in the past, fight to put plenty of money in the Budget lines – as we had done with the last, 700 billion, perspective – only to end up with the actual expenditure totalling just over 550 billion; what matters, then, is the quality of the expenditure, and that is why we insisted on making headway on the Budget Regulation front, making things less bureaucratic, less tangled. The money must actually be able to flow, and we must be sure that it gets to the right people; that is why it was vital that we should ensure that the Member States, too, paid attention to the quality of each item of expenditure and considered whether it was getting to the right people.</p>
<p class="contents">We attached, then, great importance to the quality of the expenditure, and that also means that we want to prevent margins needed elsewhere from being eaten up by the constant creation of new agencies or extensions of the Common Foreign and Security Policy; that is why we had to set boundaries. We have therefore made sure that budgeting will be done in a more structured way in future and that the money can actually be made use of.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have made sure of sufficient flexibility in the Budget for new things. Where the Council, regrettably, had left nothing over in the ‘Citizens’ Europe’, we have created a margin, in order that not everything should be used up in the multiannual programme, with no chance of doing anything more. We have improved and extended the pilot projects and the preparatory measures, thereby giving this House greater scope for influence, and we have added 5% for the sake of greater flexibility to the budgets of the multiannual programmes, enabling us to respond to challenges with greater flexibility and precision.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also managed to achieve things of importance in the individual subject areas, such as lifelong learning, about which everyone always has great things to say, and where you, Mr President-in-Office, seem to believe that there are only 140 000 students left, whereas we have increased their number to 210 000. We have also achieved increases in the trans-European networks and in PROGRESS, the programme that, by combating social exclusion, sends a message to Europe that we are not merely an economic union, but also spare a thought for, and help, those who have problems to contend with. We have also managed to get more money for Health and Consumer Protection, for cross-frontier cooperation and in many other areas.</p>
<p class="contents">If you were to ask me whether I would like to see more than what we have achieved, I would tell you, without a doubt, that, yes, I would have liked more, but that I know that there are always two, or sometimes three, sides to a compromise, and that is why we were as tough as possible in negotiating, for we were negotiating with people who drive a hard bargain. The result that emerged is one with which not everyone can be satisfied, and all the things we would have liked, which we described in the Böge report, will be back on the table in the next few years, and these requests will keep coming back to you, whether for own resources for funding agricultural policy or for other areas; we will be asking you how you propose to meet your commitments – by which I mean to GALILEO – and you will then come to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say in conclusion that this compromise may well not be the stuff of my dreams, but I wholeheartedly endorse it, and ask my fellow Members of this House to approve it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Jensen, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the ALDE Group. </span><span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, reaching the agreement on budgetary discipline has been a long haul. In Parliament, we have done some thorough work, analysing what is needed and developing common political priorities. We have done this in the course of more than a year under the expert leadership of our rapporteur, Mr Böge, whose efforts have been exemplary.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU Heads of State or Government lapsed, however, into unseemly bartering about income and expenditure, with refrains such as ‘We will not pay’, ‘Maximum of 1%’ and ‘We want our money back’. The compromise we are debating today really is, therefore, a compromise. It is not a particularly attractive one, and no one is fully satisfied with it. Rather, it is the art of the possible. The optimist in us will, however, emphasise that it is constructive that there is now a framework to facilitate the legislative work on the programmes for the Structural Funds, research and education. What is more, the framework provides more resources for investment in education, research and transport and for aid to the EU’s poor regions, while expenditure on agricultural aid is cut back. I therefore recommend voting in favour of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">We have ensured that administration of the EU budget will become less bureaucratic. We have ensured that responsibility for administering EU resources has been placed squarely with the Member States. We have ensured that the European Investment Bank is able to provide far more ambitious funding and that more young people are able to take part in educational exchange programmes. We have also ensured that the EU budget for health and consumer protection was not subject to the swingeing cutbacks planned by the Heads of State or Government. The framework is tight, however; so tight that it pinches. Let me give an example. The Commission proposed EUR 20 billion by way of investment in cross-border transport projects. Parliament supported the Commission, but the result has only been EUR 7 billion. How are we to obtain money for the 30 cross-border projects that have been adopted? I think that the Council owes us an answer regarding how the common projects can be made a reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We believe that the Financial Perspective that we will now have for the next seven years has to be judged on the basis of whether or not the budget is geared to the future, whether or not it helps us to sort out together the problems with which we are faced, and whether it really is oriented towards Europe. It is for that reason that my criticisms are primarily directed at the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last few years, we have suffered a great deal as a result of this debate about one per cent and net contributors, which gives a voice, not to the European spirit and to concern for what benefits Europe, but to small-mindedness and narrow nationalism. What we are dealing with at the moment is a nationalistic deformation of Europe’s foundations that is detrimental to every plan we make for the future. Contrary to what previous speakers have said about there being no alternative, we do believe that one would have been possible. We could of course have gone back to the annual budget procedure, and we in this House would have had 30 billion more with which we would have been able to do something about our own priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us consider the messages that are being sent out. Over recent years, Parliament and the Commission have acted very responsibly, and have done so out of a sense of responsibility to Europe. What can we in Europe do better than the nation states on their own? That is what we need to concentrate on; that is what will win the European people over, but what has happened now? We have a structurally conservative budget that keeps agricultural policy as it was and makes no attempt to transfer funds to rural development. Just as before, agricultural export subsidies are in place, ruining, among other things, the development of African markets and contributing to the refugee problems about which we are always complaining. This is where the European Union’s policies are wrong, and I find it very regrettable that there has been no change in this respect and that the Council has stonewalled in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">My second concern is that, following the Council’s December meeting, it was clear that most of the savings had been made in the areas to do with the knowledge-based society and education, which runs completely counter to its own modernisation rhetoric. They are always getting on their hind legs and saying that Europe must become the most economically successful area in the world by 2010, that we must develop the knowledge-based society, that we must do more for education and exchange in Europe, and then the budget for this gets cut by 50%. This House may well now, by dint of a great common effort, have been able to make some small improvements, but there are only 210 000 students on Erasmus, and we want at least 285 000. Even that compromise is no kind of triumph, but rather no more than a drop in the ocean.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now move on to energy policy, where Europe ought to take a joint approach and move away from oil, investing much more in renewable energies in order to arrive at a new position that will win over the people’s hearts and minds. We have succeeded in doing none of those things and must therefore come to the conclusion that this Budget is quite simply not forward-looking enough. The Council stood in the way of much of it, and that is why we cannot go along with it.</p>
<p class="contents">The last thing I want to say is that I am very grateful to the negotiating team and to Mr Böge for the dedication with which they handled the proceedings. We will have no shortage of work to do in the coming weeks and months. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not his fault that the Council keelhauled the Commission and Parliament and bruised the political credibility of these institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The biggest miscalculation was made by the Commission in its original proposal for economic guidelines. It miscalculated the Council’s relative powers and created expectations that were far too great. The report by Parliament’s temporary committee was produced on the basis of these expectations. It was difficult for many Members to come to terms with Mr Böge’s sense of realism at the time. While the Council was editing the Commission’s proposal, the Commission continued to create expectations that were too high. President Barroso marketed the Commission’s view on the basis of total miscalculations. He has lost face in this process, as has Parliament as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s decision to reject the conclusions drawn by the Council in December 2005 at the time established a good basis for further talks. The Council, however, showed the Commission and Parliament that the EU’s money came from the Member States. The Commission and Parliament may in practice only be involved in decision-making relating to the EU’s expenditure: in the redistribution of cash within the framework dictated by the Council. Postponing resolution of the problems until the mid-term review at the end of 2009 will not increase Parliament’s power in EU budgetary matters.</p>
<p class="contents">On the revenues side, we have failed to get rid of the unjustified UK special rebate. On the expenditure side, the fact that the Council kept to a 1% level for payment appropriations undermined a budget which could have achieved European added value, as the Community budget would have been more than just the sum of the Member States’ contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">My group would have liked a more constructive budgetary framework for the period 2007–2013. This we have not got, and we are voting against the adoption of Mr Böge’s report. We have not achieved the sort of flexibility in the financial framework that would have been necessary for good financial management. Instead, the Member States are putting more money in the budget for the militarisation of the EU.

<p class="contents">The good news is that we have overcome the 10-month impasse in talks on the issue, and that the multiannual planning of the European Union’s finances now has a solid basis. It is also good that this basis is EUR 4 billion higher than the Council’s proposal. The bad news is that the net contributors are still continuing to place restrictions on the Union’s development by means of spending cuts. We should still remember that during the seven-year period from 2007 to 2013 the European Union’s GNP is expected to increase by around 15%, while EU spending is set to increase by 2%. The good news here is that spending related to the Lisbon Strategy has been increased by EUR 2.5 billion, but there is bad news in that this spending will amount to barely EUR 74 billion compared with the EUR 371 billion earmarked for agricultural policy and natural resources, as well as the EUR 308 billion earmarked for cohesion policy. It seems a good thing that a review of budget implementation has been scheduled for the end of 2009, but such an early date for this review is not so good, as it may harm the new Member States, where the absorption of Union funds may not yet have reached the target level.</p>
<p class="contents">This review may thus be understood to be an attempt to enforce budgetary discipline and another reason for spending cuts. It is therefore good that we have the new financial perspective, but bad that it demonstrates so little economic solidarity and such little will to meet external challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be in the interests of the European Union as a whole for the net contributors to contribute more generously. They would then reap the overall benefits from a higher growth rate in the beneficiary Member States. The competitiveness of the European Union will not increase if we continue to defend an outdated social model and expensive jobs. In this matter, blaming the new Member States or enlargement will not help. The Union’s economic problems have deeper roots, quite aside from political problems resulting from unfair and irresponsible comments directed at the governments of certain Member States. If a certain recent fan of Mao Tse-Tung, who is absent at present, for no apparent reason attacks the Polish Government as being fascist, his words doubtless hark back to Communist propaganda, which destroyed pluralism and democracy, and interpreted everything that was not Stalinism as fascism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Globalisation Fund does not have the objective of creating new jobs in sectors with long-term opportunities. It is seeking something entirely different. It is seeking to support those who lose work as a consequence of companies escaping from the tight reins of the EU. Instead of abolishing directives, opening up the market for services and labour and cutting taxes, we are currying favour with the citizens with a pipe dream of short-term social gain. Does anybody in this Chamber really think that greater support for the unemployed would lead to the creation of new jobs? Furthermore, with the establishment of the Fund we are creating a completely false impression that it is possible to protect the EU from the rest of the world.

It is also real proof that the European Union is functioning with 25 Member States. This is proof in a field where compromise is difficult, as differences are sharply delineated and calculable in financial terms.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial agreement and the agreement on financial principles leave us here in Parliament in doubt as to whether we have sufficient funds to achieve the stated political aims of the European Union. This uncertainty almost verges on the certain knowledge that, in line with the agreement, some limits must be revised upwards in the course of the coming seven years, especially in order to fulfil the European Union’s ambitions on the international stage. It is good, however, that the flexibility and capacity of the budget to react have been increased, that we have increased access to European Investment Bank loans and that certain funds, such as the Solidarity Fund, the Globalisation Fund and the Emergency Aid Reserve, have been placed outside the scope of the financial perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">The lesson we can learn from this experience is that there should not be such marked differences between the initial positions of the European Commission, Parliament and the Council, as such enormous differences, which amount to billions of euros, can mean that some figures become abstract notions, especially if spending cuts are subsequently sought where the budget was to have been modified. The Rural Development Fund is an example and symbol of just such a case.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget needs changes, but it does not require a revolution. It cannot be an alternative means of reforming the European Union. Public spending cannot replace the far-reaching reforms needed to make the Union competitive.</p>

<p class="contents">We want the new Members States to be able to begin to use the Structural and Cohesion Funds fully from next year, in order to promote their growth and true economic convergence with the most prosperous regions of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement is not very generous, but we are sure that it can be a useful instrument during these first years of accession, not just in terms of the economic development of those regions, but also in order to demonstrate to the Europeans of the new Member States that one of the distinguishing marks of our Europe is solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither do we want to add a budgetary crisis to the current political crisis in the Union, which has not just been created by the 'no' votes on the Constitution, but also by the negative campaigns against the integration process, which are having so much success in certain countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe these to be the fundamental reasons for our vote in favour. Nevertheless, given our desire to move ahead with the construction of an increasingly strong, fair and cooperative Europe, we have serious doubts about whether it is appropriate to vote in favour.</p>

He was working under difficult circumstances, but nevertheless enjoyed Parliament’s undivided confidence throughout.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial framework is a shallow one, payments only account for 1% of Gross National income, and it is visible within the content of the frameworks. It is unfortunate that we could not do anything about Great Britain’s annual EUR five-and-a-half billion contribution rebate. In my opinion every one of us should bear responsibility for financing the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Initially the emphasis in the financial frameworks was on improved competitiveness. The Commission set an ambitious objective to improve industrial and entrepreneurial competitiveness in the European Union by promoting research and development and endorsing training schemes. The funds intended for these were to be trebled within seven years. The purpose was to improve employment prospects in particular. The Council, however, cut these funds by 40%, so this ambitious objective remained unachieved, which has been the greatest failure in these negotiations on the financial framework.</p>
<p class="contents">It is good in the final outcome that progress has been made with the Structural Funds. The new Member States are to receive approximately EUR 24 billion net every year from the old Member States for their reconstruction. In this way Europe can once again become united and strong.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we need to hurry to make use of the time available to establish the financial programmes, otherwise unpaid commitments will reach intolerable levels in the first few years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should try to cope with this crisis of confidence through the sort of policies, results and reforms that restore public confidence. It sometimes happens that the moment of truth arrives earlier than one thought it would.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have to deal with today is the context of the European Union’s policies and the options available to it, and what I ask of you is how you propose, by means of this Budget, to meet people’s expectations. There is something spooky afoot when the President of the Council talks about a fair and balanced budget. This House hears what the specialist committees have had to say on the subject, about development cooperation being unsatisfactory, about education, youth and research not being up to any kind of standard, about defective communications on our security missions overseas, about the dramatic reversal in rural development.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in a state of affairs such as that that you are proposing, in all seriousness, to win back the trust of Europe’s citizens. There have been negotiations between Europe and 25 states, whose public expenditure share of GDP ranges between 45% and 50%, and which, in return for handing over between 30% and 40% of their functions to Europe, give it 1% of their money. That is a recipe for disappointed public expectations; the worsening of the crisis is built in. You cannot leave the text and the context unchanged. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is inadequate from a financial point of view and as regards its priorities and its instruments for addressing the challenges facing an enlarged Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is an agreement that fails to respond to the increased needs of cohesion, and to attach priority to fighting the increased imbalance, inequality, unemployment and poverty in the EU. It is a bad agreement for economic and social cohesion and for cohesion countries, insofar as it relegates the Community budget’s role of redistribution. The Structural Fund has been reduced by EUR 28 million in relation to the Commission’s proposal, and from 0.41% of Community GNI in the current financial framework to 0.37% in the future framework, and that in an EU of 27. It is an agreement that is EUR 100 billion down on Parliament’s original proposal. Parliament also negotiated a compromise of just EUR 12 billion and then went on to accept as little as EUR 4 million, which has led to inappropriate priorities and for which we are paying in cuts to other budgetary headings.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a bad agreement for countries like Portugal. Against a backdrop of increased competition and facing a deep crisis due to aspects such as monetary and budgetary policy restrictions that have led to increased unemployment and a divergence from the EU since 2000, the country has suffered cuts of more than EUR 1 million per day and 15% of Community transfers in relation to the current financial framework, not to mention the injustice of cuts facing the Algarve region, victim of the so-called statistical effect. Consequently, we have no choice but to reject this agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These kinds of regulations are created in almost all fields. They make it impossible for the new Member States to catch up with the richer Member States. Instead of creating a strong European Union in line with the Treaties, decisions are being made that cement its division into two parts; more to the rich and less to the poor.

<p class="contents">This lack of proportion runs counter to common sense and also harms the interests of the old Member States of the Union, as is mentioned in the most recent report of the Centre for European Reform.

<p class="contents">First of all, in spite of the feeling of satisfaction due to the fact that the financial perspective for 2007-2013 has been approved, it should be stressed that the setting of the general level of payments at 1% of the European Union’s GNP merely serves to meet the expectations of the most developed countries within the Union, and does not deal with the challenges facing Europe in the 21st century. It will be very difficult, if not impossible, to implement the enlargement of the Union, increase growth and achieve deeper integration with smaller financial means than we have hitherto had at our disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as a representative of a new Member State, namely Poland, I would like to express concern at the continued efforts to divide the financial resources foreseen in the financial perspective for 2007-2013 in such a way as to ensure that the stream of funding flowing into the old Member States is as generous as possible and continues for as long as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I am convinced that a further enlargement of the European Union, and the accession of Romania and Bulgaria in particular, which will require additional financial resources of at least a dozen billion euros per annum, will not restrict the funding for regional policy and the common agricultural policy in the 10 countries which joined the European Union in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I hope that the work done on the draft regulations facilitating the spending of the funds foreseen in the financial perspective will be efficient enough to ensure that 2007 does not become a dead loss, especially in terms of regional development policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are cures for these ills in the form of independent scrutiny. We must listen when some people call for greater transparency in European decision-making, for example the publishing of funding awards, so that people know who has actually benefited. Why not? It is only right that such information should be published. This is European taxpayers’ money that we are talking about.’</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that you, Mr Grasser, can agree with that. That was quoted, in any case, from your Federal Chancellor, the President of your Council, Mr Wolfgang Schüssel, who said those words, in this Chamber, on the very spot where you are standing, on 18 January this year. Now, though, what has become of publications by the Ministry of Finance? Eleven EU Member States have adopted the practice already; Austria, even under your Presidency of the Council, has not, even though the President of the Council gave a binding undertaking that we would be allowed to know how much money from the EU has gone into the pockets of big farmers and Austrian television journalists, including those around the farmers’ representative in the Austrian People’s Party, Mrs Schierhuber.</p>
<p class="contents">So just do it at last; pay no heed to those who whisper lies in your ear, and do not succumb to the deceitful intoxication of power.

<p class="contents">The Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline and sound financial management, which will be put to the vote today, provides for great advances in the field of budgetary discipline and Parliament’s budgetary rights. The question is whether these improvements are going to compensate for the serious deficits that exist in relation to figures.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament’s negotiating position expressed in the Resolution of June 2004 was the last compromise that was truly acceptable to the political groups and we therefore approved it unanimously. Since then, we have had nothing but bad news from the Council: a bad negotiation, a failed one, during the Luxembourg Presidency, and another negotiation during the British Presidency that ended with an agreement that everybody considers to be insufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">On that basis, the European Parliament and our rapporteur embarked upon an impossible battle: to raise the figures to acceptable levels in order to maintain a positive impetus within the Union and its programmes. It was not possible and the final round of interinstitutional meetings has led to a final result practically identical to that indicated by the European Council, with 1% of the budget, which is what the ‘letter of six’ originally called for, and with negative consequences in terms of cohesion and rural development.</p>
<p class="contents">Surprisingly, the head of the governments which will suffer most from this reduction, mine in particular, did not do much to prevent that failure. The final decision is in the hand of the parliamentary groups and the national delegations, which in any event will draw whichever conclusions they consider most positive for the future of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority of my group is going to vote in favour of this financial perspective. I would like to end by reiterating what everybody is saying about our rapporteur, Mr Böge: if we had to name a rapporteur again for the negotiation, we would name Mr Böge again a thousand times over. Had it not been for him, the Agreement would have been much worse. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It does not provide for financial perspectives. But it is nonetheless quite sensible that the two arms of the budgetary authority agree on a multiannual perspective to permit more sensible long-term and forward planning.</p>
<p class="contents">My one criticism of this agreement, seen from the point of view of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, is that it is so detailed and is broken down into so many points that it takes much of the flexibility away from the annual budgetary procedure. That said, in terms of overall content it is a good agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Many colleagues have pointed out that the sums agreed are less than what had initially been proposed by the Commission. That, of course, is true. At the same time, however, for most items of expenditure they represent an increase on current levels of EU spending. Sometimes the increases are substantial, as in the case of research and development. That is to be welcomed. The one area that will decline is agricultural spending, by about 7% over that whole period. It may not seem much of a decline, but not just the 10 new Member States but also Romania and Bulgaria will have to fit within that ceiling. That would mean a substantial decrease for the old EU-15. I think the reform of the CAP in this regard has often been underestimated in the debate. The redistribution from agriculture to other items of expenditure is something that should be welcomed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must ask ourselves whether the interinstitutional agreement reached will contribute to the attainment of this objective. We can hardly answer this question because initially the agreement was reached when the Member States shared opinions at the dinner table and decided which programmes should be funded. Later the European Parliament joined the dinner table and attempted to adjust the agreement with regard to priorities defined by social programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Can we really assess the economic impact of an agreement reached in this way? I do not think so. Therefore, I believe the procedures for developing such projects should be regulated in a more strict and clear-cut way. First of all we must clearly define the responsibility of the Member States in respect of the general budget, that is, reform the own resources system.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should say clearly that it supports this proposal and should say what it proposes and what it is doing, because at the moment there is a lot of uncertainty in this matter. The second important task is to actually define the criteria for each programme underlying the fund’s allocation. At present these criteria are of a very general character, on occasions overlap, and it is utterly unclear whether the funds, seemingly considerable amounts, will actually benefit the European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The third thing, which definitely must be defined in each programme is the responsibility – that of the Member States for the European Union budget, citizens' responsibility for the use of the funds and the Commission's responsibility for the efficient, apparent and the transparent functioning of that system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Following the compromise agreement between the European Parliament and the Council, the budget for the financial perspectives for 2007 to 2013 is particularly inadequate, both from the point of view of the amount and from the point of view of priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">We do, of course, welcome one of the basic points of the agreement, by which I mean the facility for the European Parliament to take a stand on the review of the budget to be implemented by the European Commission and in which Parliament will participate fully. Nonetheless, we disagree with it in essence. This agreement is particularly inadequate from the point of view of financial resources. For example, the last enlargement increased the GDP of the European Union and hence its revenue by 5%; at the same time, however, it increased its population by 30%. This means that expenditure will increase more than revenue, especially if account is taken of the fact that most of the new Member States have a much lower per capita income than the rest. Despite all this, the budget in absolute numbers is not very different from today's levels.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the agreement is inadequate from the point of view of priorities for meeting the economic, social and environmental challenges of an enlarged European Union. It does not reflect the cohesion requirements of the current enlargement. It is rather a political and economic translation of the objectives incorporated in the Constitutional Treaty with an excessive focus on security, defence, the militarisation of the European Union and external action, but with little increase in the funds earmarked for the cohesion and regional development funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, neither the points of conflict nor the stop-gap measures used to agree the annual budget and the financial perspective of the EU have been ironed out. We will have to continue patiently to seek forms of regular communication, at least between the Council and Parliament. In other words, we will have to continue to intensify communication between MEPs and the national parliaments and governments.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a far more complex and urgent matter, however to reform the individual structures of the EU as items of budgetary finance. We need mention only the well-known need for greater efficiency in agriculture, which is the largest recipient of European funds, or the reduction in finance from the structural funds, where the effectiveness of the programmes is often doubtful, and where funding difficult to control, and corruption and cronyism are likely.</p>
<p class="contents">One way out could be a gradual move towards supporting and increasing funding for the construction of trans-European networks.

Just when we are on the subject of a crisis of confidence in the European institutions, their contribution has demonstrated the extent to which our institutions, and especially our Parliament – that goes without saying – have played their part to the full.</p>
<p class="contents">The institutions have played their part to the full because, over and above the exemplary nature of those meetings, we are going to use this interinstitutional agreement to provide our fellow citizens with the practical resources needed to give full effect to Europe and to the powers it has in terms of development and solidarity. As a member of the Committee on Regional Development, I should like to emphasise one point. Throughout previous years, we have been able to observe, and we continue to observe, how much the Structural Funds have done for countries such as Ireland, Spain and Portugal, and how much these Funds have changed people's everyday lives within regions that were previously lagging behind and that, now, have aligned themselves with the average of our European regions.</p>
<p class="contents">With the Structural Funds for the 2007-2013 period, we can achieve this same result insofar as the new Member States, in particular, will be able to use the Funds made available to them. Nevertheless, we know that there will be a delay, in spite of rules n+2 and n+3; I therefore urge the Council, together with the Committee on Regional Development and the European Commission, to declare, forthwith, that the resources that are not used in the context of the Structural Funds will not be redistributed in the Member States, but reallocated as part of a new agreement that will be concluded in the next few years, thanks to which the Funds will be used to achieve the objectives of our proactive policy on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

More than a third of EU money goes officially to agriculture, but it does not reach the farmers. Danish farmers’ total net income for agriculture is only a quarter of the direct subsidy. That is madness. Farmers could obtain four times more by way of total net income if the various arrangements were circumvented and the money sent to farmers directly.</p>
<p class="contents">Another third goes officially to regional development and the Structural Funds. The reality is that poor people in distant regions are direct net contributors to the EU budget. In Latvia, 80% of EU aid goes to Riga. Poor people living in the countryside pay a large contribution to the EU via their daily purchases, but the money is not returned by the EU to those who pay. It is Robin Hood in reverse, with the EU taking from the poor and giving to the rich.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead, allow the new countries not to have to pay contributions. Focus Structural Fund aid on the poorest areas in the poorest countries and begin by putting a cap on agricultural aid so that no one can receive more than, for example, EUR 30 000.

The Council has also – to all intents and purposes – allocated more powers to Parliament by making it possible for the latter to assess the budget’s structure in 2008-2009. We are still in what is termed the period of reflection about the EU’s future. A period of reflection can, and indeed should, also offer the opportunity of calling a few things into question.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, we seem to be moving towards a European tax in the form of a tax on energy and transport. On behalf of the general interest of the European taxpayers, we must oppose this new tax – any new tax for that matter – that, whichever way you look at it, will be added to the fiscal pressure, which is already too high in most Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact is, half of the Member States are in serious deficit and the other half do not see why they should pay on behalf of mismanaged countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The time has therefore come to reform the system of resources that sustain the European budget. Our Parliament is working on practical proposals, and we have been doing so with the help of the national parliaments for nearly a year.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week’s interparliamentary conference made it possible to hold an initial, encouraging debate on the diagnosis, schedule and scope of the reform. The diagnosis is virtually unanimous. The current system is regarded everywhere as anti-EU, unjust and totally incomprehensible to Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the schedule, the consensus is that the 2008-2009 meeting must be used as an opportunity to reach a political agreement on the practical arrangements for a reform. As regards the scope, opinion remains very divided. There are the masochists who suffer as a result of the system, but who like to suffer. There are the moderates, who want to retain the principles of the current system. There are the ambitious ones, who are more open to more radical changes. There are, however, two common recommendations: on the one hand, not to bring the Member States’ fiscal sovereignty into question and, on the other hand, to protect taxpayers against further tax increases: the principles of sovereignty and of cost neutrality.</p>
<p class="contents">A further meeting is scheduled with the national parliaments’ committees on budgets for 21 June. Our aim is to succeed at least in bringing the points of view close enough together so that the Commission might take its inspiration from the proposals put to it for 2008. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The one we have at present is unworkable, unfair, lacking in transparency and is no longer sustainable. One of the things we regard as essential is that this House should be involved in the 2008/2009 reform process. I am grateful to those who have negotiated on our behalf. We need a new system, one that the public can understand and that is also fair, an objective system to replace the net payers, net recipients and rebates that we have at present; it will probably be a proportion of a tax levied in all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the period for which the Financial Perspective will apply, which we want to see brought into line with the period for which Parliament is elected; five years, in other words, instead of seven. There would be a closer connection between policies and the means by which they are funded, and so better democratic control and greater transparency would be possible.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point is that I think it is a good thing that we have transitional rules for the advent of the Constitution, which I do of course see as desirable, since it will strengthen Parliament’s prerogatives. It is good that item 4 makes preparatory arrangements for that event. I also think it is worth mentioning that financial control of the EU’s external policies has been improved; that is normally a prerogative of the executive, so that parliaments have no part in it, but this budget has enabled us to get a foot in the door, and things that usually escape our grasp – such as the decentralised agencies and the European Schools – are included in this agreement.

<p class="contents">Europe needs more than ever to devote significant resources to structural cohesion policies, as well as to policies focused on innovation, research and SMEs – in short, to policies that will support the emergence of a People's Europe and the spread of Europe’s influence in the world. The proposals presented by our Parliament in June 2005 enabled this ambitious policy to materialise.</p>
<p class="contents">I must confess to you my disappointment, as the compromise that we have just obtained following long-term efforts is still singularly lacking in ambition and inspiration and, although our Parliament succeeded in forcing the Council to review the unacceptable amounts it was proposing last December, the progress made by the Member States falls far short of Europe's real needs, which we all hoped to see fulfilled.</p>
<p class="contents">While the budget compromise is acceptable in its form because it complies with the Council’s policy choice, the fact remains that, in terms of content, the Member States’ ambitions are half-hearted, they are timid and, above all, they fall very far short of meeting the challenges of our society.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, albeit with a slightly heavy heart, I will be voting in favour of this compromise because, no matter what happens, I want Europe to continue to make progress. When the path is narrow and steep, it is better to move forward in small steps than not to move forward at all. Moreover, it is with great determination that I now await this meeting, which will enable us to renegotiate a real proactive policy in 2008, with renewed government teams and with our aspiration for Europe firmly instilled in us, and which will enable us to exercise …</p>

This will be one of the most significant and far-reaching votes in this part-session.</p>
<p class="contents">The interinstitutional agreement reached provides for a sum of EUR 864 billion for the next Financial Framework, or 1.05% of the European Union’s total national revenue. This is significantly less than the amount originally supported by the European Parliament, and as a result it will be necessary to reduce the amount of funding available for strengthening EU competitiveness, for science and trans-European networks and for EU regional policy, as well as for other areas. Unfortunately, at Council the tone of the debate was set by six countries whose only goal was to reduce the amount of expenditure in the EU Financial Framework to 1% of the European Union’s GNI.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise reached, however, has various positive features. Firstly, there is the flexible approach to setting a ceiling on amounts to be received from EU funds, as advocated by the European Parliament in its resolution. As a result, Latvia and Estonia have been allocated additional resources from EU funds over and above the ceilings laid down, and Lithuania has been allocated additional resources in order to deal with programmes connected with the closure of the Ignalina nuclear power plant. Secondly, there is the calculation of the ceilings, using each Member State’s individual economic growth forecast. Thirdly, there is the agreement to allow the use of Structural Funds resources for accommodation projects. The limit of 2% of total Structural Funds resources, which is identical for all the new Member States, is, however, difficult to understand. For example, it is obvious that heating homes is a much more urgent issue in countries with a harsher climate, such as Estonia and Latvia, than in southern countries such as Cyprus and Malta. Therefore, this unified approach is unjustified. Fourthly, there is the gradual replacement of the n + 2 rule with the n + 3 rule. Of course, the application of such a rule to the Cohesion Fund is still open to doubt. This agreement, however, is extremely necessary, first and foremost for the new Member States, and for that reason the European Parliament displayed a flexible attitude to the total amount of EU funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The usual practice when a compromise has been reached is to talk about whether the glass is half full or half empty, but that is not the case today, and that is why this so-called compromise will get no support from the Austrian Social Democrats. As the previous speaker mentioned, we are facing a backward movement in policies at national level. What was inherently wrong with these negotiations on finances was that six Heads of State or Government had said we could have more Europe, and achieve more European objectives, with less money, but that does not work – it does not work back home, and it does not work in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">All you need to do is flick through the newspapers. Yesterday morning’s headline in the Austrian <span class="italic">Standard </span>was ‘EU fails to meet its own education targets’. There are six million young people leaving school without qualifications, and, on top of that, the figures for lifelong learning are 42% down on what Parliament proposed. It is quite clear from this that things are out of joint.</p>
<p class="contents">Assuming we get a majority this lunchtime, we will be assuming joint responsibility for a budget on which we have not made our mark. Much as I respect our negotiators – who are outstanding and I really do want to congratulate them – the difference that they have managed to make over the last few months amounts, in terms of the total amount of this seven-year budget, to something like 0.2%. That is what the directly-elected European Parliament has managed to do with a budget like this one. It is not enough; the glass is not half full – it is empty. That is why I hope that many Members of this House will refuse to give their endorsement to this Financial Perspective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I also believe that it has, slowly and surely, become evident to the Member States that Europe cannot function on the basis of nobody paying in and everyone drawing out, and that, on the contrary, a rational balance must be found between the Member States’ demands for the funding they think Europe should provide, and what they themselves are willing to make available in terms of resources. Negotiations with this House’s delegation made it quite clear what is at stake here, and what we have achieved together is a great triumph.</p>
<p class="contents">That having been said, though, I would like to say in plain terms that the Interinstitutional Agreement that we will – I hope – adopt today, provides us ourselves with an array of possibilities in terms of how we can help to ensure that European taxpayers’ money is handled carefully and properly. There is just one issue I want to highlight and that is the great European disease of ‘agencyolism’ – the compulsion to keep on creating new agencies. We have now taken that function out of the Council’s hands; under the Interinstitutional Agreement, Parliament’s consent is always required. We are now the doctors who can grapple with this sickness within the Council, and we should take the use of these instruments very seriously. I believe that by doing so, we will add more European value than if we were to leave it in the hands of the Council and its secretive meetings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They all worked very hard through difficult and drawn-out negotiations to achieve this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I firmly believe that, given the circumstances, the best and most sensible deal was brokered. Parliament was right to push Member States to put more resources behind the ambitious programmes that all the governments and political leaders have signed up to. But, more importantly, the negotiations have had key outcomes, non-financial gains that add value and will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of future budgets. Let me highlight just three: the reinforcement of Member States' responsibility to improve expenditure control in order to achieve a positive Court of Auditor's statement, an improvement in the execution of EU programmes and an effective input from Parliament into the budgetary review in 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">The best course of action for now is to focus on this 2008 budgetary review. In it we must reform the structure of the budget from head to toe – deconstruct it to build a new improved framework that reflects the needs and expectations of the EU of 2014.</p>
<p class="contents">One reason we had so many problems in getting agreement on future financing was that the Commission missed an opportunity to address the root problem of the current financial framework, namely the lack of flexibility. I therefore urge the Commission not to miss the boat again.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we must build an EU financial framework that demonstrates transparency, one that is rigorous and displays solidarity. It has to be free from the legacies of the past; a framework that must combine the visions of over 27 Member States and is flexible enough to face future challenges. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Unfortunately, we are faced with a minimum Interinstitutional Agreement. Mr Böge, you were no longer able to do anything when, before you at the Council, there stood up the champions of a policy that I would describe as a deceptive policy, which pretends to propose a budget to Europeans that is in keeping with the declarations trumpeted by the Heads of State or Government in front of the media. Young people must benefit from more Erasmus scholarships, but we note that there is not an adequate budget for this. The Council declares that we need more Europe if we are to sustain regional funding, but does not want to commit itself on the matter. This deceptive policy makes people believe in the Union having its own sources of finance, but any notion of a European tax would mean Europe being severely criticised.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, this budget does focus somewhat on research and on the European transport networks, such as the Lyon-Turin project. Yet, what have become of the ambitions for Galileo as a result? Where are the funds that were supposed to encourage our SMEs to set up in international markets? What have you done with the rural development fund? With this agreement, a revision of which is already planned for 2008 - it is really most regrettable that we should be obliged, today, to put our hopes in this future revision – a coat of paint is being given to the front door of Europe House, but everything else is being neglected. This is the budget of hypocrisy.</p>
<p class="contents">Under these circumstances, I will vote in favour of this minimum agreement because I am genuinely obliged to do so, but it will be with a heavy heart that I give you my vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a step in the right direction, but only if the European Parliament is involved in this task, and under the best possible conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">A further issue is that the future financial framework must be established for a five-year period. Each successive Parliament and each Commission must have the right to vote on the financial priorities of their term. It is particularly important to us, or in other words Parliament, because it is Parliament’s Members who, on behalf of the citizens of the European Union, make financial decisions and are later held to account for them. It is, therefore, a positive sign that the European Constitution wants to change that. In Article 402 it proposes that the multiannual financial framework should be established for a period of – and I quote – ‘at least five years’.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to say that we all want a financial system which will be fair to both the old and the new members of the European Union. We want a system that will be transparent and that will give the EU an opportunity to fulfil its aims by using its own resources rather than by using the financial contributions of the Member States. Finally, I would like to say that those who do not like this budget should consider the following well-known saying: ‘If you do not get what you like, you have to like what you get.’ </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Many Members have seen the glass as ‘half-full'; many others have seen it as half-empty. Yet, what is the one significant political action, aside from the partial results on each budget chapter, that makes us realise that this is a good result? I believe that it is a political result, in the sense that Parliament has shown itself to be active and capable of relaunching an intergovernmental decision and of turning it into a decision with a European outlook. We owe our gratitude for this both to Mr Böge and the negotiating team and to all those who have demonstrated that they are constructively concerned about the future of a generation.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me, in that connection, to highlight the fact that the positive outcome of this political initiative can also be seen in the set of rules that accompany the budget outturn and that will allow for access to Community programmes in such a way as to ensure sound financial management.</p>
<p class="contents">In my capacity as rapporteur for the trans-European networks, moreover, I must stress that these networks represent one of the key factors in achieving the European Union’s targets for economic growth and employment, as identified in the Lisbon Agenda. I would therefore emphasise the need for Community resources to be used primarily on cross-border sections with high European added value, and subsequently call upon the Member States to make a commitment regarding the national sections of the networks.</p>

<p class="contents">In June 2005, virtually the whole of Parliament voted in favour of a budget of EUR 974 billion. This, in order to make a success of enlargement and of a policy of active growth and of support for research, thereby preparing for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the same people are preparing to vote in favour of the financial perspective, which has been slashed by EUR 110 billion. Would you believe it? I challenge anyone to understand that. To vote in favour of that would be tantamount to believing that a two-speed form of enlargement exists: that of the past, which, in the South, enabled Greece, Portugal and Spain fully to develop; and that of the present, which, in the East, inspires a debate that is all the more grandiloquent because it conceals the fact that there is insufficient financing.</p>
<p class="contents">On every side of this House, I will make a bet with you that, month after month, year after year, report after report, we will have to suffer the long litany of regrets at having an insufficient budget, but it will be too late. It is now that the European Parliament must confirm that it is the driving force behind European life. To quote the words of the Bolivian President, Mr Evo Morales Ayma, who visited us here the day before yesterday: ‘let us not lie, let us not be weak, let us be strong, let us not accept a financial perspective that is a cut-price financial perspective'. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We would probably have enjoyed greater short-term popularity in the eyes of very many observers if we had said ‘no’. The lead stories in some of the media on 5 or 6 April would probably have been along the lines of ‘Parliament shows teeth: Council rebuffed’, but would we then really have achieved more in terms of European goals, more for Europe’s people, more for a better Budget, or more for an effective European Union? Those are the questions that we – every one of us – must ask ourselves today.</p>
<p class="contents">If we do not effectively discharge our responsibilities; if the institutions are unwilling to work together; if there is no agreement with Parliament; and if we do not give our assent today, then there will be no security to plan ahead for a period of years, no interinstitutional agreement, no greater scope for manoeuvre for us to use in the annual budget negotiations, no review clause and no improved consultation on the programmes and the monitoring of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Every one of us must consider whether there really would, without our consent, be an extra EUR 800 million for education, EUR 400 more for the CIP programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises, an extra EUR 100 million for social policy, EUR 300 million more for the cohesion fund, EUR 200 million more for Natura 2000, and so on and so forth.

It has, unfortunately, retained the 1% doctrine which pins the budget of the enlarged Europe of the 25 at the level of the budget of the Union of the 15 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">With Parliament's negotiation, a marginal improvement was achieved which, despite the fact that it is a far cry from the real financial needs of the Union, safeguards a minimal level of continuity in the financing of Community policies. It is clear, however, that – within the framework set from the beginning by the governments – the mindset which prevails in the Council is a short-term, restrictive, accounting and administrative mindset.</p>
<p class="contents">The question therefore raised today goes beyond the debate on the future budget. It relates to the very credibility of Europe in the eyes of the citizens. In other words, if the European Union continues to set objectives, without safeguarding in practical terms the means and political will to implement them, then the lack of confidence on the part of the citizens will increase constantly.</p>

With him as coordinator, we were able to achieve continuation in the financial resources for programmes that expired this year and we gave guarantees for more comfortable margins for manoeuvre in what was until today a completely inflexible budget, so that the launching of new initiatives and the immediate response to emergencies are compatible with the perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The Böge report also helps to improve the quality of the implementation of the budget: internal control, the facility to transfer appropriations using the flexibility instrument and legislative flexibility. Mainly, however, we secured the 2009 review with our full involvement in the review process. In 2009 the question of the need for there to be a new own resources system will also be raised again intensely, in order to find the new financial 'fuel' to speed up the development of the Union's policies. I refer in particular to the need to implement the Lisbon Strategy, especially the aspect of the Lisbon Strategy for which, at the level of research and innovation, much was promised by the prime ministers, but little was delivered to the citizens of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Where possible, Mr Böge reconciled our political priorities with the Union's financial requirements. However, all together, with our systematic work in the Committee on Budgets, we basically achieved something else. We managed, in the overriding 1% problem and with the help of all our colleagues, to overcome the Commission's set trend, which the Council has always favoured, thereby giving the European Union albeit one part of the original financial strength that it deserves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Certain Members of your House who negotiated with us – Mr Mulder and Mr Walter among them – have said that your House believes it has succeeded in getting the most out that it could. The negotiations were tough, and what could be achieved was achieved; I can do no other than confirm that your House, quite rightly, gave us, the Presidency, a difficult time during the negotiations in terms of the pressure it piled on in order, quite understandably, to achieve the best possible outcomes. To those who have now described this compromise as not good enough and stated their intention of voting against it on the grounds that they believe it does nothing to make European goals achievable, I would like to put a question. What, then, would be the consequence of our failing to agree on a compromise in this matter, if we had not, together, managed to resolve the issue of the Inter-Institutional Agreement and of the Financial Perspective? Would that – as someone said – have been something that would win us back the confidence of the public? What would have been the result of that?</p>
<p class="contents">We know perfectly well that failure to complete in good time would have meant that the new Member States would have been unable to claim sufficient money from the Structural and Cohesion Funds, that we would have been unable to put in place the necessary legal bases, and that we would have been unable to run the programmes in the various Member States. It follows, then, that failure on our part, failure to achieve this compromise, would have sent the worst imaginable message about Europe’s capacity to act effectively, and would also have given the public the wrong idea about us. It is clear, then, that, when we are dealing with something as complex as a seven-year financial perspective or an interinstitutional agreement that has to be negotiated by the three institutions that are vital to Europe – Parliament, the Commission and the Council – no one party’s position must be allowed to prevail, but we can all send out a message. Together, we have found the best possible solution for Europe, and that was what we were tasked to do.</p>
<p class="contents">To all those who said that we should improve control, and that there was not enough transparency, I can give the assurance that I really do regard it as vital that we should, over the coming months and years, do everything possible to improve monitoring for the sake of greater transparency. It is vital that our taxpayers, Europe’s citizens, should be able to see that we are careful with money, that we conceal nothing and that we are trying to prevent abuses. This is our unconditional commitment to them that the Council, too, wants to improve monitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">So let me once again extend the warmest of thanks to your House's negotiating team and to the Commissioner and her own team, while also asking you to give your approval to this compromise.</p>

Is it a good compromise? Some earlier proposals would doubtless have been better for Europe and its future. Financially speaking, the European Union is not as strong as it could have been if we had managed to reach a consensus on a larger budget. In Polish there is a saying that ‘if you do not get what you like, you have to like what you get’. Today it seems that this compromise is a success. However, we will only find out after 2013 whether it will be viewed as equally successful in the future. At that point we will have to look at the level of cohesion in the European Union, the extent to which the European economy is competitive, the level of unemployment and the state of the education system and of scientific research.</p>
<p class="contents">It is difficult to reach a universal consensus with regard to basic budget priorities. I am convinced that an important dimension of European solidarity is practical solidarity in the form of cohesion policy. The quality of the implementation of this financial perspective will determine whether the European Union’s biggest enlargement to date, in 2004, will be fully exploited and completed. I hope that this will indeed happen and that no one will have any doubts that the return of 10 countries to the European family was right and beneficial not only to those countries, but also to all Europeans. Europe will be greater and more powerful at a relatively low price. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A form of financing based on own resources must be adopted, with the latter being fixed so as to provide the EU with full budgetary autonomy. These resources would be equitable, transparent, controlled by democratic procedures and in compliance with the principle of cost neutrality.</p>
<p class="contents">The revision of the Community budget, which is scheduled for 2008, must enable us to carry out this reform – which can be done without amending the basic treaties – by means of an agreement between the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council, acting on the basis of unanimity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are concerned here with negotiations that I have had the opportunity to follow closely as a member of the first temporary committee, which was set up on an ad hoc basis in order to draft the European Parliament's proposal aimed at strengthening the cohesion policy and guaranteeing an optimal level of financing so as to enable the necessary reforms to fulfil the ambitions of the European Union and its citizens, whom we represent.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has succeeded in adopting a budget that reconciles political priorities with financial constraints, and in updating its structure and improving the way in which it is executed. The result of today’s vote is a financial perspective that presents some new and highly desirable elements, such as the increase in spending options, greater flexibility in terms of management, and the priorities relating to the trans-European networks and to the programmes focused on strengthening youth exchanges, on the common foreign and security policy and on the neighbourhood policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
