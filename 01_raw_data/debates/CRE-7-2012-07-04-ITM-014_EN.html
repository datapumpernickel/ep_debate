<p class="contents">This House, in its resolution of 17 November last year, gave strong support to Georgia’s territorial integrity and to the process of political association and economic integration with the European Union. It also recognised the importance of the Geneva Process and gave its backing to the work of the European Union’s special representative for the South Caucasus and to the EU monitoring mission. These were important signals of commitment to Georgia and to the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Members of this House have also been in the vanguard of supporting the deepening of human rights and democracy in Georgia. At the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly held in Baku in April a resolution was passed underlining the indispensable role of independent civil society in strengthening democracy and stressing the importance in this context of freedom of association, freedom of assembly and freedom of expression, including in the press and the media.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I am aware that a number of honourable Members have submitted parliamentary questions concerning the treatment of the political opposition, respect for human rights, labour relations and other related issues. These issues are all extremely relevant as the EU looks at Georgia preparing for elections in the autumn, and as we support Georgia’s reform drive built on the basis of consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">President Van Rompuy is in Georgia today. His visit is an opportunity to demonstrate the top-level commitment of the European Union to the deepening of our relations with Georgia and to the peaceful development of the South Caucasus region as a whole. I will not anticipate President Van Rompuy’s messages to Georgia here, but I would like to signal before the debate is open a number of critical issues for us at this time.</p>
<p class="contents">We are making good progress with our Association Agreement and with Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area negotiations. We will also soon begin concrete work on a visa liberalisation action plan preparing for mobility and stronger people-to-people contacts. All this is very positive news, but it is essential that Georgia makes every effort already to live within the spirit of association. We will provide Georgia with every possible support in meeting this objective, bearing in mind its great potential to benefit from the ‘more for more’ principle enshrined in the European Neighbourhood Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, President Barroso and Commissioner Füle as well as, obviously, High Representative/Vice-President Ashton, have emphasised to President Saakashvili in their recent meetings in Brussels the need to ensure fair political competition and the legitimacy of elections. Parliamentary elections in October must meet international democratic standards. Public trust in the election process will be crucial. Pluralistic elections require a strong, credible and serious opposition that takes part in the election process in a way that respects the constitution and the law.</p>
<p class="contents">We have noted with concern the perception that the government is trying to hinder the participation of opposition leader Ivanishvili, that resources are being deployed against him and that laws on party finance and vote-buying are being applied in a one-sided way. We must insist that the laws are correctly and transparently applied to leave no possible doubt that due process has been followed.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, there is also a perception that Mr Ivanishvili is using his unequalled financial assets for electoral gain and this is a legitimate concern. Again we must insist that there is a level playing field for democratic competition and that votes cannot be bought.</p>
<p class="contents">We have focused in particular on equal access to media outlets. It is well established that the two main pro-government channels have enjoyed wider penetration than more critical channels, so we are encouraged by the recent decision by Parliament to enforce the so-called ‘must-carry/must-offer’ rules in the pre-election period and by the President’s strong statements on this issue, though we will wish to discuss further the enforcement of these rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should of course underline that the EU remains committed to conflict resolution efforts in Georgia through strong support to Georgia’s territorial integrity, through our contribution to security and stability by the deployment of the EU monitoring mission, and through our leading role as co-chairs in the Geneva international discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">The conflict over Abkhazia and South Ossetia remains high on our agenda and we will continue to spare no effort to help find solutions. This commitment was strongly reflected in the Council conclusions of 27 February 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much look forward to hearing the views of honourable Members on this very important issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Krzysztof Lisek, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PPE Group. </span><span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(PL) </span>Mr President, Minister, over the last year and a half I have had the pleasure of working on a report for the European Parliament concerning an association agreement between the European Union and Georgia. I have visited Georgia several times and taken part in dozens of meetings with representatives of both the government and opposition parties, with the Parliamentary Ombudsman, with media representatives, with representatives of non-governmental organisations – both those that work closely with the government and those that work closely with the present opposition, whether inside or outside parliament. I would like therefore to present my view, while reminding you at the start about two sections from our November resolution, a resolution that was adopted by over 90% of the European Parliament. In point M of the preamble we wrote: ‘welcome the significant progress made by Georgia in the areas of democratic reforms, including strengthening democratic institutions, particularly the Ombudsman's Office, the fight against corruption and the reform of the judiciary, as well as of economic reforms and liberalisation; congratulate Georgia on reducing overall and especially serious crime rates in the country’ and a bit further on in point O of the preamble we wrote: ‘call for the Georgian Government to enter more extensively into a constructive political dialogue with opposition forces and further develop a democratic environment for freedom of speech, especially the accessibility of public media for all political parties’.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that today we would all put our signatures to this type of statement. Georgia has been praised, not just by us politicians, but also by non-governmental organisations such as <span class="italic">Transparency International</span> for its fight against corruption and for building a democratic structure. The last elections that took place in Georgia, which were local government elections, were very well viewed by all observers. Even the opposition said that there was no great tension and that the elections took place in accordance with international standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we are returning to this discussion. The question is: what has happened to make us have to return to discussing Georgia? In my opinion, one thing has happened, which the Minister has kindly discussed. One could say that we have a new entity or rather a new leader of the opposition in Georgia, a person who has billions of dollars at his disposal, whose budget and money exceed the entire budget of the Georgian state. Unfortunately, these monies are not being used properly.</p>
<p class="contents">I could speak of my experiences over the past months, but I think that most of us have had the same experience. For some months now we have been bombarded, several times a week, by something that goes by the name of <span class="italic">Georgia Media Tracker, </span>which gives information showing that President Saakashvili is a demon and that everything that the ruling party is doing in Georgia is improper, unacceptable, etc, etc. I took the liberty of investigating this situation to find out why this is happening. It turns out that Mr Ivanishvili has hired 18 American, British, German and French lobbying companies to work for him. I think that one thing needs to be emphasised, based on our democratic experience: the presence and functioning of oligarchs in politics does not end well. This I would like to dedicate to the Georgian opposition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Last week, Commissioner Füle was in Georgia – so it just shows the great importance we accord to that country and to that region.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our wish, and it is also the wish of the Social Democrats, that Georgia is successful: that Georgia is successful in political and economic reforms; that Georgia is successful in preserving its territorial integrity; and of course that Georgia is successful in negotiations as far as the EU-Georgia Association Agreement is concerned; and also that we can make speedy progress in the dialogue on visa liberalisation – of course with a view to ending the visa requirement for Georgia.</p>
<p class="contents">So that is very positive, and we also acknowledge the reforms that have been made in the past few months and years in Georgia. However, as has already been said, there will soon be elections – in October the parliamentary elections, and then in 2013 the presidential elections, and we can see and feel that the political tension in Georgia is rising.</p>
<p class="contents">So I would like to say what our Georgian friends need – both in the government camp and in opposition – to calm down the situation. Georgia needs free and fair elections, Georgia needs to create free and fair pre-election conditions, so that all political groups, all political parties, including the opposition coalition, have free access to the media.</p>
<p class="contents">These elections will be very crucial for Georgia to preserve the fairness and openness of the elections, and of course they will be very crucial for progress in the negotiations on the Association Agreement and visa liberalisation. So on behalf of the Social Democratic Group I wish our Georgian friends success in this endeavour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not believe that today’s debate is one between left and right, between opposition and government. When you are in power, you do not need to let yourself be concerned by the situation of the opposition. I notice that President Saakashvili is more than concerned by the fact that he has, for the first time, a united and strong opposition to deal with in Georgia.</p>
<p class="contents">We have, of course, heard numerous allegations from both sides. I do not know how many of these allegations have been proven. However, I would like to point out on behalf of my group that democracy does not mean war with satellite aerials, and it does not mean war with the mass media either. It is great that there are several television channels expressing different points of view because we know very well, not only in Eastern Europe but also in that region, that this temptation to monopolise the absolute truth is extremely dangerous, and can cause democratic abuses.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the argument put forward that the opposition is currently led by a very wealthy person is not an argument at all which does justice to a democratic approach to the rule of law. Ladies and gentlemen, wealth or poverty is not a virtue per se. They cannot in themselves cast any doubt on the probity of those who are in such situations.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we must expect Georgia to initiate a debate on ideas, programmes and visions, and not a petty debate launched at the whims of either side. I believe, as Commissioner Füle emphasised, that this tension surrounding Georgia may be extremely dangerous in the future. The government which is ruling at the moment through the governing party must ensure that these elections are held in full compliance with European and democratic standards because this is the only way to guarantee a free future for Georgia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have had many visitors here in the last few days from various levels of Georgian society – government, opposition, the new united opposition that is going to run – and we are hearing lots of different things. I think it is not for us to come down on one side. It is for us to define what we think is necessary for a democratic modern country to do.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are really concerned about and what I am concerned about – and what our debate should be about – is to warn Georgians, be it government, opposition or citizens, that a war of words and non-transparent conditions for elections is something that is harming, or could harm, the image of Georgia, not just in this Parliament but in Europe and in Georgia itself.</p>
<p class="contents">A statement by the National Democratic Institute says that it is ‘concerned about growing political polarization in the country and a dearth of civil discourse among political leaders’. Therefore, what I think we should do is make it very clear that a war of words is not helpful, that there is a need for transparency on campaign financing and on party financing for everyone, whether government or opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally do not like oligarchs in politics – how much money you have should not be the criterion for whether or not you should be elected. It is about visions as the previous speaker has said. It is about improving and having the political will to improve human rights, the economic situation and democracy in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been one positive development, and that was an amendment to media laws prescribing that every cable network has to transmit all TV stations in the pre-election period. I think that was a very positive thing.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing I am really concerned about is the situation of the over-crowded prisons in the country. Yes, the crime rate has been reduced. However, two political activists were recently sentenced to respectively 35 and 45 days imprisonment for petty hooliganism. This is something, especially in a pre-election period, that should not happen.</p>
<p class="contents">I call again on the authorities to ask the government and the opposition, everybody who wants to run, to calm down and ensure transparency for the elections. Hopefully we will have free and fair elections in a democratic country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was only quite recently that we adopted the excellent report by Mr Lisek, in which we praised the determined and consistent work in introducing democratic standards in Georgia and I am wondering what has happened since that time. In my view nothing has happened. On the contrary, the Georgian authorities are still reforming the country, they are introducing democratic reforms, they have reformed media law and electoral law. Georgia is high in ‘doing business’ rankings as far as openness to business and the fight against corruption is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us all consider for a moment why it is that we have organised this debate today. What we should be doing is helping Georgia, providing support and encouragement to the Georgian authorities in what they are doing in their own country as regards coming closer to the European Union, because this is the kind of Georgia that we, as the European Union, need. At the same time let us look at the behaviour of the opposition and consider whether it is in the opposition’s interests for there to be a proud and independent sovereign Georgian nation or a country that is under Russian influence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why I welcome the fact that the Georgian Government has invited us to send as many election observers as we like for as long as we like, so that it really will be possible to check that procedure is adhered to.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider this to be a relatively positive development. While hooligans may find themselves imprisoned for 45 days in Georgia, a similar misdemeanour may be punished with seven years in jail in Ukraine, a fact that underlines the differences between these countries. We must, however, ensure that freedom of assembly is upheld, that free elections are guaranteed and that independent media are permitted. When I note that there are several different television companies in the country and that it was possible to pass a carry-all law on 29 June, then I realise that we have a better situation in Georgia than in most countries and greater differentiation than in some European countries, including some Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">However, when I witness television sets being distributed alongside campaign shirts in support of the party of the wealthy Ivanishvili, as a kind of party funding exercise, all the rules for party funding being broken, a lack of transparency in relation to private funding from a person who earned EUR 6 billion in Russia, then I start to become a little sceptical and to wonder whether we need to investigate both sides to ensure that all the rules have been obeyed. When I see evidence that votes are being bought, when I see that the opposition clearly has 20 times more money at its disposal in this election campaign than the governing party, then it seems necessary to me to perform a thorough examination that also involves the opposition, so that we achieve a fair assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that the use of 18 consultancies, most of them following the American model, should influence how we decide on European neighbourhood policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nobody can deny the fact that Georgia was making good progress in many areas. It was an encouraging and exemplary development. Georgia’s Members of Parliament play a very active and constructive role in the work of the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly that I have the honour to chair. But I have stated on many occasions that the real test for the eastern partners of the European Union are the elections. They show how stable and sustainable the democracy is and they show the maturity of the political system.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask my colleagues not to exaggerate, but also not to downplay, the recent developments in Georgia. My impression is that a political war is under way and both sides are making full use of the weapons that they possess. On one side, that of the ruling parties, they have the administrative and legal resources, while on the other side they have financial resources.</p>
<p class="contents">If you listen to the explanations from both sides on the situation of Georgia you would think that it is about two completely different countries. This already signals a problem. This situation has to stop and the political process should be brought back to normal.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask the Council and the Commission to use all their powers to help Georgia. There are different means available and possible. You know them best; just use them now.

We appreciate the work by the authorities to strengthen democracy and, in particular, the constitutional changes liberalising electoral law. It is in the interest of the European Union to protect this country against growing Russian infiltration and to stop attempts by Moscow to interfere in its internal affairs by, for example, financing pro-Russian opposition groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Georgian policy demonstrates a continuing, strong and decisive pro-West direction. Some months ago we adopted a resolution calling on Brussels to start work immediately on the creation of a free trade area and to maintain the tempo of association negotiations. I am decidedly in favour of strengthening such activity. The question of relaxing the visa policy for Eastern Partnership countries should also be given urgent consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Russian occupation of part of Georgian territory continues to be a problem. In addition, the Russians have moved their annual military manoeuvres from July to the end of September/beginning of October, which is when elections in Georgia are taking place.

<p class="contents">Three factors related to the upcoming parliamentary elections may destabilise Georgia, even threatening a new bloody intervention from abroad.</p>
<p class="contents">The first factor is the ongoing intervention of enormous amounts of Russian money to get corrupted politicians and a sufficient number of poor people engaged in the task of moving Georgia’s European politics back into a pro-Russian stance. The efforts of the Georgian parliament and government to prevent this totally fraudulent electoral campaign are being pre-empted by oligarchic and Kremlin lobbyist propaganda, claiming alleged limitations of freedom. And indeed there are restrictions on the freedom to promote ongoing Nazi- and fascist-type attacks against the current ‘non-ethnic Georgian, non-Orthodox, pro-minorities’, etc. government. Strangely such hate texts are appreciated by blundering European liberals. Let Russian money win in Georgia! That is the goal.</p>
<p class="contents">The second factor is the excessively powerful military exercises, just beyond the Georgian border, being postponed precisely for the time of the elections, maybe in the hope of any pre-planned street clashes.</p>
<p class="contents">The third and most immediate danger is the current Russian financial decline and emerging social crisis, which may lead the ruling group to try to turn people’s attention towards the external enemy by a renewed victorious Caucasian war. What we need here is boldness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is right that we raise in advance questions about the reports of arrests, impounding of assets and restricted access to media in advance of these elections. Indeed for cable TV packages to exclude the opposition-leaning TV channels certainly appears indefensible. I also express my deep concern at the violent breaking up of the country’s first Pride March on the International Day against Homophobia in May earlier this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, Georgia is welcoming 400 OSCE election observers, has established a multi-party agency to rule on violations, there is a civil society ‘This Affects You’ campaign which we should support, and I understand that the European Union has started media monitoring, so all involved in the elections must know that we are watching.</p>
<p class="contents">Like my colleagues, I stress that these questions are put in a spirit of friendship to the country and its people. Having visited the EU observation mission at the administrative borderline of the occupied territories, I want to use this debate to also invite the Presidency to join me in expressing concern that the head of our mission has been declared persona non grata by the proxy authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, to my EPP colleagues, I place on record our objection that you blocked our oral amendment to the Eastern Partnership report this week, removing an appeal to Georgia to combat child labour, when UNICEF says that there are 2 500 working children on its streets. I understand that your party is about to hold an event in Batumi which could be interpreted as seeking to help Mr Saakashvili’s party. Our role in this Parliament should be to promote functioning democracy, and we do not do so best if it appears that we are scrutinising one party in an election in a third country to a different standard from any other. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sure, as has been pointed out, there are visits by eminent public figures. Sure, there are elections to be held in October. However, this is not the only country where there are important visits and elections.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know why we are talking about Georgia today. We are talking about Georgia today because a certain oligarch has decided to take part in the elections – which is his right - and because he has flooded the coffers of lobbyists in Washington and Brussels with dollars and euros, which has obviously paid off as we have placed Georgia on our agenda, not to talk about the Russian occupation, or about Russia’s violation of cease-fire agreements or about Russian military manoeuvres during October, in the midst of elections, but about the electoral process in Georgia.</p>
<p class="contents">You have pointed out a number of resolutions in which we voted for an independent civil society, for a strong and credible opposition. An oligarch’s millions of dollars do not make a strong and credible opposition, nor do they create an independent civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we should not be giving a blank cheque to Mr Saakashvili. Yet I think that giving a blank cheque to this oligarch who has gone into politics is much more dangerous. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

President Mikheil Saakashvili is a controversial figure, however, and in May alone 80 000 people demonstrated against him. Democracy is formally assured by free and secret ballots, however political and civil rights and control of state powers are often limited. Shortly before his second and last term of office comes to an end, Mr Saakashvili has strengthened the position of the premier, so that political analysts suspect he is preparing for a legal bid for power. Clearly some lessons have been learned from Georgia’s unpopular neighbours in the Kremlin, in other words Russia. Thus, we need to take care here to ensure that these infant democracies, which are eyeing the financial resources of the EU with interest – I would remind you that Georgia subscribes to the European Neighbourhood Policy – also play by the democratic rules; after all neither covert dictators nor the oligarchs mentioned have any place in our value system.

<p class="contents">Let me start with a general statement. The European Union is not accepting instrumentalisation of the democratic process in pursuit of other agendas or in order to falsify popular will – anywhere or by anybody.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union believes in free and fair elections and that fair competition and genuine participation in the upcoming elections will be fundamental in achieving the legitimacy of election results. The European Union stresses that politically motivated persecution, direct or indirect, by law enforcement agencies or the use of selective justice against political contenders are not compatible with democratic values.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard the European Union is monitoring and will continue to monitor the situation in Georgia leading up to the elections. It will also monitor the conduct of those elections. The High Representative Baroness Ashton met last week with President Saakashvili. Her services have met with representatives of the Georgian Dream Coalition. Both sides have asked for increased EU involvement, in particular to ensure increased transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">The European External Action Service is already doing a lot with the organisation of security and cooperation in Europe, including media monitoring – to which many of you referred during the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the European External Action Service is also looking at how it can provide further support to ensure maximum transparency. This could include further monitoring of polling, exit-polling and supporting independent civil society organisations. The European Union embassies have set up a special on-the-spot taskforce led by the EU delegation. So we are watching and we are helping.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall our position on Georgia is very clear. We welcome strong European Union-Georgia relations. We have seen good progress on the Eastern Partnership Agenda and on the Association Agreement negotiations and we are delighted that steps towards visa liberalisation are now moving ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">There are other strategic interests too. The EU recognises the increasing importance of Georgia as an energy-transit country and appreciates its cooperation in developing the Southern Energy Corridor. The EU also recognises Georgia’s significant contribution to peacekeeping efforts around the globe.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen a lot of positive changes since the Rose Revolution but we need to keep up momentum. This means consolidating democracy, broadening and deepening reform efforts, in particular in the judiciary, the economy and the social sphere, and spreading the benefits of development to marginalised groups. But above all, regional security and democratic evolution are key to securing all the benefits which our association can offer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
