<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Theorin </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (SV)</span> Mr President, security policy has undergone many changes. The cold war has ended, and a major war in Europe would seem impossible. The conflicts which we see around us are the result of ethnic, religious and social differences. At the same time, new threats are emerging in the form of massive displacement of refugees, terrorism, international crime and, no less importantly, environmental and natural disasters. Bullets and gunpowder, however, are not the way to resolve such conflicts.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of environmental disasters have brought the human race new problems, such as the recurrent flooding in Europe, the dam disaster in Spain and, most recently, the widespread landslides in Central America. It is clear that there have not been sufficient resources to detect or prevent such disasters. Since environmental threats do not respect national boundaries, what is required is international cooperation. There is a growing international awareness of the extent of environmental problems, as illustrated by the UN follow‐up conferences on water, desertification, the environment and development, and climate change. Environmental problems can lead to such serious difficulties that they endanger the security of both individuals and countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Fresh water is a very unevenly distributed natural resource. Fewer than ten countries possess 60 % of the total fresh water resources on earth, and several countries in Europe are dependent on water imports. In future conflicts, attacks on fresh water may not simply be an end in themselves, but may also be the cause of conflict. An estimated 300 rivers, lakes and sources of groundwater are located in international border areas. In the Middle East, nine of the 14 countries have a shortage of water resources. Local and regional ecological problems can have serious implications for international relations, for example limited water resources or the large‐scale displacement of environmental refugees. The number of environmental refugees has now reached 25 million, compared with 22 million ‘traditional' refugees. By the year 2010, it is estimated that the number of environmental refugees will have doubled.</p>
<p class="contents">These new causes of conflict must be reflected in foreign, defence and security policy and the way in which nations establish and maintain peace and security. We need to mobilise resources to meet the environmental challenge. A much greater effort is required, but our means and resources are strictly limited. At the same time, the change in the security situation has resulted in détente and disarmament. The freeing‐up of military resources has given the armed forces a unique opportunity and plenty of capacity to deal with the increasing number of environmental problems. The armed forces have a highly efficient organisation and extensive technical resources which could be used for the enhancement of the environment without incurring any significant costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Prevention of environmental crises requires infrastructure, organisation and increased resources. These are to be found within the armed forces, although capability may certainly vary from one country to another. In the main, however, they can supply qualified personnel, technologies, advanced technological resources, organisational capacity and military methods of research and development. Military personnel are well equipped to intervene in the event of disasters and are trained to carry out missions under extreme conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Military activity is also responsible for widespread environmental destruction. Destroying the environment has been an established method of waging war since ancient times. War is also far and away the most serious threat to the environment. The military is responsible for emissions of several gases affecting the climate, fossil fuels, freons, nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide. Nuclear and chemical weapons and landmines are some of the most obvious types of armament that cause extensive damage to the environment, even in peacetime.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee held a public hearing to find out more about the ‘non‐lethal' weapons and HAARP, the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Project. However, I very much regret that the USA did not send representatives to the hearing or use the opportunity to comment on the material submitted.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been two public hearings to try to shed more light on the complex technical and legal aspects of the ‘non‐lethal' weapons and HAARP. We have also put forward proposals relating to the economic and practical implications of a training programme for environmental defence troops. My original proposals were dealt with under the Hughes procedure, and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has looked into the environmental aspects very carefully. Against this more detailed background, I am now presenting this resolution on the environment, security and foreign policy, which makes a series of proposals for measures to be carried out both at EU and national level. The resolution recommends that the Member States should seek to utilise military‐related resources for environmental protection through the setting‐up of a training programme for environmental defence troops with a view to establishing a coordinated European environmental brigade, listing their environmental needs and the military resources available, and exploiting these resources in their national environmental planning while also putting them at the disposal of the United Nations and the European Union in the event of an environmental disaster, or under the Partnership for Peace. Furthermore, the armed forces should comply with specific environmental rules and make good past damage to the environment caused by their own actions.</p>
<p class="contents">Civil environmental legislation should be applied to all military activities. We call on the Commission to present to the Council and Parliament – as foreseen by the Amsterdam Treaty – a common strategy which brings together the common foreign and security policy and the EU"s policies on trade, aid, development and the environment. It is noted in the resolution that preventive environmental measures are an important instrument of security policy, and the Member States are urged to define environmental and health objectives as part of their long‐term defence and security assessments.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution also addresses the problem of the uncontrolled unprofessional storage and dumping of nuclear submarines and surface vessels, as well as their radioactive fuel and leaking nuclear reactors. The Commission is urged to conduct an in‐depth study of security‐related threats to the environment in Europe and to draw up a green paper on military activities affecting the environment. The report also examines the legal aspects of military activities and calls upon the European Union to seek to have the new ‘non‐lethal' weapons technology included in and regulated by the international conventions.</p>
<p class="contents">So long as nuclear weapons exist, there is a danger of them being used in error. That danger could soon be considerably reduced if the nuclear powers were to implement the six proposals of the Canberra Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by saying that almost every day we receive reports of environmental disasters which could be prevented if we used our available resources sensibly. The resources in question belong to the armed forces, who could be allowed to continue to operate them. All that is lacking is political will.</p>

First of all, I am pleased to say that we agree with the background information provided by Mrs Theorin here in the House. However, I should like to conclude my intervention by touching on one or two issues which we view in a different light.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite obvious that nowadays there is no direct military threat to Europe's security. However, there are other bigger dangers, such as environmental devastation, shortages of fresh water, desertification, climate change, accidents in chemical and nuclear power plants and so on. It is therefore vital that we revise our ideas about security and develop them to include environmental threats, and on the whole, the report does just that.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a very good sign that we are applying normal civil environmental criteria to military activities – this is a necessary development in the present situation. Tackling the problem posed by earlier nuclear weapons is a major step in this respect. As to how this would be done, the report proposes that the armed forces should be ‘trained' to enable them to cope with environmental problems. That would certainly be a practicable solution, but the Environment Committee would like to make the point that if substantial resources continue to be allocated to the military, which is certainly the case today, some of those resources should be switched from military defence to the environmental sector, for example rescue and disaster relief services, the decontamination of land and water, and preventive measures to safeguard the environment. We believe that this is more important than the creation of a special environmental brigade. It is also an idea which could be put into practice.</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><img src="/doceo/data/img/hr.gif" width="100%" height="1" alt="" /></td><td align="right" width="16"><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="buttondocwin"><tbody><tr><td align="center"><a href="#top" title="Top"><img src="/doceo/data/img/navi_top.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0" alt="" /></a></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></table>
<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Titley </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, I hope colleagues are aware of the importance and significance of this report. I refer not just to the quality of Mrs Theorin's work, for which I congratulate her, but the fact that this report was produced by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy. It is a sign that Parliament has recognised that the end of the Cold War has brought with it an entirely new concept of security and that environmental security is crucial to future peace and prosperity. There is no doubt that the scarcity and degradation of environmental resources will lead in the future to conflict and we have to use all the resources available to prevent that happening.</p>
<p class="contents">If I have a criticism of the report as it has finally emerged, it is that the way it was amended by both the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has meant that we have tended to throw everything in including the kitchen sink. That is a mistake. We ought to focus on the basic points. What is important to most people is the air they breathe, the food they eat and the water they drink – indeed, the water which helps to grow the food they eat.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to concentrate on that one question of water. It is perhaps the most important security challenge facing us in the next century. For example, if we look at the Caspian Sea region, we find that it has tremendous oil potential leading potentially to great prosperity. But it is also a disaster waiting to happen, specifically in the republics of Central Asia. We all know the horrific tale of the Aral Sea. Equally, there are other conflicts as a result of both the Soviet system which wasted water and the collapse of the system which has led to chaos in terms of distribution of water supply.</p>
<p class="contents">There is Kyrgyzstan's hydro‐electric power which is undermining the downstream countries. Illegal tapping of water supplies and questions of water access intermingled with nationalist rivalries could easily explode at any moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, if we look at the Indian sub‐continent, a growing population accompanied by deforestation is causing flooding which is undermining effective water supply and dykes. The headwaters of several river systems are to be found in Kashmir and we are all aware of the security implications of that. In the Middle East access to the Jordan River is one of the key aspects of the Middle East Peace process, in particular in relation to the Golan Heights. Indeed, the history of Israel‐Jordan relations is as much a history of water relations as anything else.</p>
<p class="contents">So I welcome the fact that we are addressing these issues at long last. I share with Mrs Theorin the hope that we can use all our resources – specifically military resources of satellite intelligence, etc. – to start to attack environmental security. If we do not, then in terms of conflict ‘we ain't seen nothing yet".</p>
<p class="contents" align="center"><span class="bold">IN THE CHAIR: MR G. COLLINS<br /></span><span class="italic">Vice‐President</span></p>
<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Stenzel </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Theorin"s report on the environment, security and foreign policy addresses a detail of security policy, namely questions relating to environmental policy, exaggerates their importance and therefore tries to look at the security policy role of the armed forces mainly from that aspect and to change the task and role of the security forces. It has become particularly clear in the former Warsaw Pact member states how the armed forces can pollute the environment, for there the withdrawal of the then Soviet troops very often left serious environmental damage in its wake. Abandoned and often disintegrating nuclear submarines have become a danger to the seas, former barracks have left a legacy of oil‐polluted soil. Of course it is legitimate to ask who is responsible for disposing of the military waste, especially in these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">But to use this as a pretext for defining armed forces only in relation to their environmental compatibility, to prevent research on the grounds that it is not environmentally compatible, is to undermine the security policy task of those armed forces. Since the end of the cold war has not yet brought peace, we have to reject this basic approach that is taken in the report. To hold the armed forces responsible for the environmental damage does not take us forward, for it would put an unacceptable burden on the defence budget, limited as it is. What is, however, important and right, is for the governments to have to pay for environmental damage and to apply the polluter pays principle here.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of the basic approach taken in the report, which I reject on principle as unrealistic, some aspects are of course definitely worth supporting, such as the inclusion of environmental aspects in military research, gearing the arms industry more to the production of civil goods, the call for a ban on anti‐personnel mines and for the immediate signature of the 1997 Ottawa agreement, control of waste from the nuclear weapons industry, control of biological and chemical weapons, the further dismantling of nuclear weapons and in particular observance of the Nuclear Non‐Proliferation Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a great danger that weapons of this kind could fall into the hands of irresponsible despots or terrorist organisations and this must be prevented by a network of international agreements and by the appropriate controls. To call for environmental training of military personnel with the aim of setting up an environmental protection brigade is inappropriate here and would get us nowhere since environmental aspects are already taken into account in the national armed forces and in the NATO Partnership for Peace. Of course the armed forces must be prepared to deal with environmental disasters. But that is certainly not their primary task.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bertens </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the environment has to be an important factor in our foreign and security policy. That is the essential message of this report. I am grateful to Mrs Theorin for her energetic input here. It would indeed be a good thing for the Union to devise a common strategy in this area. There are already numerous conflicts which have their origins in problems of the environment. Mr Titley mentioned some of them: water in the Middle East, overpopulation as a factor of conflict in the Great Lakes region, deforestation and floods in southern Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear too that the armed forces are part of the social fabric, of a society in which high priority is given to protecting the environment. Where possible, we must make use of military personnel to resolve environmental problems. Airborne surveillance of illegal fuel dumping by tankers in the North Sea is a good example of how the military can be used to good effect. Environmental troops could usefully have been deployed to cope with the fires in Indonesia.</p>
<p class="contents">But this report also contains many things which are unrealistic and unnecessary. We must not start setting up new centres, writing countless green papers and forming new task forces. And we must leave it to national governments to switch budget funds away from the defence sector. It is not Parliament"s job to tell governments that they must have the army running environmental policy. Each Member State must reorganise its budget as it sees fit, and then the environment will naturally be one of the issues dealt with.</p>
<p class="contents">My group, the Liberal Group, wants to see the report pruned to its essentials. We shall table amendments to delete a number of paragraphs. My group will wait to see what happens to those, and we shall then decide whether to support this report or not.</p>

Nevertheless, it still lacks muscle in some respects, for example the responsibility of the armed forces for environmental destruction in peacetime, claims for damages against the military and, above all, space‐based weapons systems.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a remarkable contrast between the explanatory statement and the resolution itself. In the explanatory statement, HAARP – the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Project – is said to be a military research project on the lines of ‘Star Wars' which is environmentally damaging, has an unknown effect on people's lives and is legally questionable and probably in breach of international law. However, none of this is mentioned in the resolution, which only refers to further investigation. The Green Group thinks the time has come to say loud and clear that this research has got to stop, and this we do in our amendment.</p>

The conclusion that military activities have far‐reaching environmental effects is also important. But I would also draw your attention to a circumstance to which more account must be given in our future peace policy work. In Africa as also in the Middle East, in South America and in the states of the former Soviet Union wars are being waged about oil and other resources. Only when we manage to do away with this central source of war over the past century and move instead towards renewable primary energy sources will we see the first real success in regard to long‐term peace protection on an environmental basis.</p>
<p class="contents">I regard one point as particularly important here. The EU should launch an offensive against the increasingly widespread problem of mercenaries, which is very much implicated in this fight for resources. Mercenary troops should be prohibited worldwide and their European headquarters should be prosecuted.</p>

It seems to me clear that the impact of the environment on security is both immediate, important and growing. I absolutely endorse what both Mrs Theorin and Mr Titley said about conflict over water and resources and how central this should be as we plan the Common Foreign and Security Policy over the next ten years Equally, I am not going to add to comments that have been made on the impact of the military on the environment. You can see that in the Kola Peninsula. You can see that in the insecurity of nuclear sites in the Soviet Union of the kind that has been highlighted by General Lee Butler.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I want to say a word about the HAARP Project Mr Gahrton mentioned. Having listened to the hearing and done some considerable work myself I find the dangers of experiments with polar electromagnetism to be potentially very damaging and possibly calamitous. I say that without making any particular judgment as to the potential military applications of this technology, either as a weapon for disrupting an enemy's climate or its adaptability for the use in non‐lethal weapons in either a military or a civilian situation, or perhaps most dangerously of all as a covert continuation of ‘Star Wars" defence policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that when we look at this issue and when we listened in the hearing on HAARP, we appeared at times to be listening to science fiction. But that science fiction should not blind us to this turning into a considerably threatening reality. I echo other speakers' comments in saying that I regret that the American administration, despite contacts at the very highest level and contacts inside NATO, did not feel it reasonable to come to this Parliament and express a view. In the absence of that, I have to say that this Parliament must take the view that this is a matter which should concern us all and to which we should return in the next mandate. There are unanswered questions and this Parliament deserves some answers both from the Americans and from scientists involved in this issue.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bjerregaard, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (DA)</span> Mr President, let me begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Theorin, for her considerable efforts, which also – if I may be allowed a brief personal comment – admirably complement much of the political work that she has carried out in the past. Clearly, this report covers a number of areas besides those I work with on a daily basis concerning the environment, but I shall be dealing with the report as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has taken great interest in Parliament's report and the motion for a resolution on the environment, security and foreign policy which it contains. As has also been emphasised here today, it deals with a complex subject, the great importance of which is now being realised by the international community as a whole. The report is commendable because it clearly points out many of the connections which exist or could arise between the environment, lack of natural resources and security. A number of examples have also been provided in this debate, such as refugee problems and overpopulation or – in terms of the environment itself – water and climate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's services have been investigating a number of security problems and their economic consequences in a broader context. As part of this work, we have held a number of seminars, including one on the environment and security. It was decided that, as a follow‐up to these seminars, the Commission should produce a paper on the interaction of foreign policy, security and sustainable development, with the aim of starting a debate with the parties concerned and decision‐makers throughout Europe. As a result of this, my own services are already in the process of taking a closer look at some of the points in Parliament's report concerning the risks connected with global climate changes and the exploitation of resources, which could lead to an increase in environmental refugees, crisis situations and – as Mrs Theorin herself emphasised – direct conflicts.</p>
<p class="contents">DG XI has started its work on the environment and security. This will focus on issues such as water resources and water shortages, which Mr Titley touched on in particular, whether we are dealing with the Caspian Sea, the Aral Sea or the Black Sea, which Mr Spencer and I had the opportunity to look at more closely a little while ago. We shall also be focusing on soil erosion, lack of natural resources, transfrontier problems regarding the destruction of forests and biological diversity and the security problems which could follow as a result. In this context, we shall also look more closely at the effect on policy in other areas, such as trade, development aid and cooperation. This work therefore covers a number of the proposals which have also come from the European Parliament, particularly the resolution's very important first paragraph.</p>
<p class="contents">On various occasions, the Commission has expressed its concern at the deforestation and desertification in Africa. A large part of the emergency aid under the Lomé programme has been earmarked for combating these two phenomena, which of course have many causes, some of which are quite clearly of a military nature. However, the Commission has neither authority nor expertise in the area of military affairs. It does not have access to military activities or resources, because these are exclusively the concern of the national authorities. We in the Commission will therefore not be in a position to ensure that some of the paragraphs in the motion for a resolution are followed up. This applies to paragraphs 18 and 29. The Commission participates fully in the common foreign and security policy, and we shall therefore try, together with the Council presidency, to act as spokesmen for the views expressed in the resolution in the various international security forums, including the UN.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, the Commission welcomes the fact that Parliament has produced this resolution and report. It shares Parliament's concerns about the connection between environmental degradation and future risks in terms of security. As I said, we have already started working on some aspects of the problem, particularly those which directly concern the environment. With these comments, I would once again like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Theorin, for an excellent report and for the debate which we have had here today.</p>
