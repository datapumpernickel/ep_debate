<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Figueiredo (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Ladies and gentlemen, poverty in the European Union continues to be of grave concern, with new groups, such as immigrants, falling into this category and new threats of exclusion, amongst which I would highlight ‘info-exclusion’ resulting from ongoing inequalities in access to the new technologies. This affects tens of millions of people, particularly women, children and the elderly, but also, increasingly, workers in precarious or atypical employment or workers with low salaries.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, it is particularly important to place definition of a global strategy to combat poverty and social exclusion on the agenda, on the basis of Article 137 of the EU Treaty. Although all specific measures, both local and national, are important, it is crucial that we put in place a European Union strategy designed to coordinate policies and concentrate on the fight, which must be a priority, against this genuine scandal of living at a time when wealth is being created and increasing and yet, even today, more than 50 million EU citizens do not have access to fundamental rights enshrined in the Social Charters and the Charter of Fundamental Rights itself, recently proclaimed by the Community institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, as we all know, at the Nice Council, common objectives were adopted for combating poverty and social exclusion, which must be set out in a coordinated and integrated way, in a multidimensional approach, in the national action plans that the Member States have undertaken to draw up by 1 June.</p>
<p class="contents">As we all know, the common objectives that must be set out in the national action plans are:</p>
<p class="contents">- to facilitate participation in employment and access to all resources, rights and services;</p>
<p class="contents">- to prevent risks of exclusion;</p>
<p class="contents">- to work on behalf of the most vulnerable members of society;</p>
<p class="contents">- to rally all the parties involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, at the European Council of December this year, at the end of the Belgian Presidency, we are to adopt common indicators for poverty and social exclusion in order to be able to compare the results expected by the Member States from implementing national action plans on social inclusion. Given this context, it is particularly important that we adopt and implement the Community action programme as urgently as possible to encourage cooperation between Member States in the fight against exclusion. Until this programme comes into force, we will not have the necessary mechanisms for Community-level coordination and monitoring of the actions that are undertaken. These are fundamental aspects of the global strategy which the Council undertook to adopt.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, therefore, hard to understand the Council’s refusal to accept proposals made by the European Parliament, particularly those which the Commission has already accepted. We can see that the Council common position of 12 February 2001 fully or partially incorporates 25 of the 47 amendments adopted by Parliament on 16 November last year, whereas the Commission had accepted 31. In the proposals that are now being put forward again at second reading, which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs adopted unanimously on 25 April, the positions which the Commission accepted but which the Council, regrettably, rejected are being adopted once again. Amongst these are the establishment of comparable parameters for national action plans and the 90% funding of activities undertaken by the main European networks participating in the fight against poverty and social exclusion. This percentage of funding has already been accepted, in the programme for combating discrimination, for example, and has been rejected here for goodness knows what reason.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we are reconsidering the key issue of allocating the programme EUR 100 million of funding, rather than EUR 70 Million, as the Council and the Commission are insisting, although it is true that the Council has already accepted proposals that will require increased expenditure such as the networking of national monitoring centres and similar organisations for combating poverty. Spending will also be increased for exchanges of experience, preparatory meetings for the Annual EU Round Table Conference on social exclusion, with the participation of all speakers, and field visits to ensure that the excluded can participate. There are also issues of commitology, specifically concerning the Committee, including the Commission’s initial proposal, an assessment of the potential effects of macro-economic policies on poverty and social exclusion and the funding of innovative projects.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also make a reference to some small technical amendments that were introduced, after the services of the President of the sitting pointed out the need for them, to improve the legal quality and the visibility of the text adopted by the Committee on Employment and, at the same time, to enable us to bring our text into line with other texts adopted by Parliament, such as the minor technical amendments to Amendments Nos 10 and 2, and the new Amendment No 18. I do not feel that Amendment No 3, tabled by our Committee, is necessary, bearing in mind the technical amendments I have just mentioned, but I shall, of course, leave the matter up to the House.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the three amendments tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party, I feel that these are merely procedural issues and that adopting them would make adopting the programme more difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, I should like to thank all those who have contributed to producing this report and to express my hope that the programme will be adopted as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is even more important if we consider that there are Member States with no history of combating social exclusion using global policies based on scientific studies and reliable statistics and which do not understand the important of combating social exclusion, not on moral grounds, but for reasons of social cohesion and economic progress. I refer here in particular to my own country, Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we are calling on the European Commission to make a fundamental assessment of the national action plans which it receives, using the agreed quantitative and qualitative indicators, and not to make do with lists of political measures which are neither complementary nor global in nature and which do not get to the root of the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also calling for help for the agencies involved in combating this phenomenon, not just in the form of coordination from Brussels, but at national level, close to the root of the problem, which is why we, as a political group, enthusiastically support any new innovative plans with European added value to combat social exclusion. In order to facilitate this, we support funding to the tune of 90%.</p>
<p class="contents">We also call for the European Parliament, the social partners and other agencies in the civil society to be given an opportunity to help prepare the annual conference on social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">My political group maintains that the European Commission should not take recourse to extraordinary technical assistance or make use of external experts and, similarly, that the proposals financed should be selected on the basis of invitations for expressions of interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am also very glad that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has put forward these amendments. What the Commission has tried to do in bridging the opposition between ourselves as Parliament and the Council is also gratifying. But I really must say that the Council has taken precious little notice of us. Only a few formal matters have been adopted. The Social Council and the Swedish Presidency, the Swedish socialist presidency I would almost say, are not aware that there is also such a thing as codecision, they what to keep control of everything themselves. They think: there is open coordination and you as a Parliament must simply pay for our stunts from the Community budget. That is, I believe, unacceptable. That will undoubtedly lead, Madam Commissioner, not only in this case, but also in a number of others to great problems with the Council if the Council does not manage to clarify its position somewhat. We have had one discussion with the Council in which obviously the way was pointed to compromises between this Parliament and the Council, Mrs Figueiredo did that splendidly, but the Council did not listen at all and simply made a kind of blueprint, a kind of stamp of what it previously intended and that is a kind of circuit for civil servants, by civil servants and for civil servants, so to speak. Our amendments are an attempt to change that just a little. I believe that we must adhere to them, since only then can the fight against poverty and the combating of social exclusion be tackled in a truly European way, namely if everyone has a hand in it, and not just a bunch of highly-paid civil servants gathering cosily together in Brussels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to congratulate Mrs Figueiredo on the excellent work she has done, which is both helpful and useful. I believe that since we all agree how important this programme is, we can agree as soon as possible to start implementing it.</p>
<p class="contents">As you will recall, in its amended proposal the Commission accepted in full or in part 31 of the 47 amendments that were tabled by the European Parliament. The common position that we have been examining incorporates 25 of these amendments. With regard to the amendments which are now under consideration, the Commission can accept six of them in full or in part. I refer to Amendments Nos 2, reference to the Social Charter; 4, reference to the compatibility of the proposed budget with the current financial framework; 6, strengthening the comparability of indicators; 7, as it refers to the involvement of the local and regional level, 11, reinforcing the monitoring of coherence between this programme and other policies; and, most importantly, Amendment No 14, referring to raising funding to NGOs under exceptional circumstances to 90%.</p>
<p class="contents">The following amendments cannot be accepted. Amendment No 1 proposes adding solidarity among Member States to the list of relevant Community tasks. The fight against poverty and social exclusion in each Member State is a national effort and should be placed in the context of promoting national action plans underpinned by Community-level objectives and policy-oriented cooperation. So it is obvious that these are national efforts and national targets. Amendment No 5, in which the European Parliament is proposing to be involved in the agreement of targets, is not in line with the decisions of the European Councils of Lisbon and Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards commitology, referred to in Amendments Nos 3 and 10, despite the fact that our proposal referred to the creation of an advisory committee, I believe that the mixed committee is a fair solution. This is the option that is applied in two other programmes: the equal opportunities and the anti-discrimination programmes. The Commission is assisted by a management committee for horizontal issues concerning implementation, and by an advisory committee when dealing with individual funding decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 8 and 12 refer to the role of the European Parliament in the open method of coordination in the social exclusion field. I am ready to explore with you all the appropriate means of making sure that the European Parliament can play its full role within this framework in this context. For example, I have already accepted the setting up of a round table, which will bring together the relevant actors.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 7 and 13 propose to open funding under the programme to innovative projects with a European added value in combating social exclusion. As I have already stressed, the aim of the programme is to encourage close national policy cooperation and mutual learning, and not to fund actions on the ground. Moreover, innovative projects on the ground can be funded by the European Social Fund and by the new EQUAL initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">My next comment relates to your proposal in Amendment No 14 to name the actors to be consulted in the preparation of the annual Round Table Conference. I feel that such a list risks being more restrictive, incomplete and less flexible than the admittedly more general term "all the actors concerned".</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Amendment No 9, as I said at first reading, the Commission has carefully examined all the questions concerning the budget and is of the opinion that the original proposal for EUR 70 million is an appropriate one. I cannot accept at this stage an increase in the budget. Amendment No 18 seeking to delete Article 7 is not acceptable to the Commission because it will make the execution of the programme very difficult. Amendment No 15 attempts to restrict the implementation of measures, under Strand 1 of the programme, to tenders only, in fact excluding the possibility of promoters of the innovative projects participating in the call for proposals. Amendments Nos 16 and 17 seek to curb the role of the Commission by preventing it from using external expertise as well as technical and administrative assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 2, 4, 6 and 11. It can accept parts of Amendments Nos 7 and 14. It rejects Amendments Nos 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17 and 18. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If I have understood correctly, she rejects any mention of the European Parliament in the programme. Is that correct? Secondly, she also rejects increasing the programme, even though the Commission proposes to diminish the amount for other social actions in the next year by 17.5%. Is that also correct? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to the Lisbon and Nice Councils, there is a role for Parliament and cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, but nothing more than that – if you mean the commitology issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we can find other ways of cooperation. I have already said that we can organise a round table. There can be cooperation between the Commissioners and the high-level Social Protection Committee, which deals with exclusion issues. Of course, the European Parliament has a very important role to play in the joint employment report, which will evaluate all the programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the budget is concerned, I insist on the original proposal of EUR 70m. It is very difficult to change it. We have to be realistic about what the Council will accept and how this programme can be implemented with the human resources at our disposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
