I would like to say at the outset – and I am sure that the Chairman of the Committee will say the same – how much we regret the absence of Dagmar Roth-Behrendt tonight. She is one of the most energetic, enterprising and intelligent members of the committee. She is the coordinator for our group on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection Committee and, in her general enthusiasm, she is like a one-woman Congress of Berlin. She is in Berlin tonight and is to have an operation in the morning. I am sure the whole House, even at this late hour, would join with me in wishing Dagmar well, and believing that she will recover with her customary vigour in the very near future.</p>
<p class="contents">Dagmar Roth-Behrendt intended to move one of the two amendments tonight. I would like to say briefly why I and my group now believe that it would be for the better passage of this directive if it goes through unamended. That would mean, therefore, that we would wish to vote against both Amendments No 1 and No 2: Amendment No 1 for the very simple reason that it smacks of a desire to scuttle back into a form of neo-protectionism, but certainly over-regulation, of animal imports, which is a desirable but unnecessary consequence of the many scares we have had in recent years. In my country we are particularly aware of that, but we believe that the OIE code covers trade in live animals and will protect countries which do not have BSE from introduction of the disease. Additional measures against imports are not justifiable on health grounds and I expect that the Commission will say the same thing.</p>
<p class="contents">Even more briefly, on Amendment No 2, which did indeed come in my name: at that stage, we tabled this because we believed that if there was to be a vote through this Parliament for tests at twenty-four months in all the Member States quasi-imposed upon them by the Commission, this needed to be amended with a provision that those Member States which already have other forms of testing – or in the case of the United Kingdom, the over thirty-month cow – should not have to go through that procedure. Given that the principal amendment fell, it seems to me now that the second amendment should fall also. So, from the point of view of my group, we are not supporting any amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At short notice, I have agreed to try and say a few words on his behalf in relation to this most important topic. First of all, I would like to commend all those involved to date from the Commission up through the Council and indeed, back to us, but particularly Mrs Roth-Behrendt, for the personal commitment she has given to this most important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">A year ago, I spoke in Parliament in relation to this particular matter and my views were clearly laid out. I think it was 16 May last year, the time of the first reading. Not a lot has happened since in one sense. In another sense, both politically and scientifically, a huge amount has happened in the whole area of TSE, more particularly if you like, in relation to BSE. A year ago, it was the UK, Ireland and one or two other isolated outbreaks of BSE that was concentrating the minds, particularly the epidemic that had been experienced by the UK for some time. Since then, as you know, we have had Portugal, Belgium, Holland, Spain, Denmark, Germany, Italy and Austria. But we must look at the numbers involved relative to the cattle population in each country to make sense, rather than just to panic the consumer. It has been very hard to have a reasonable rational debate on the impact of an outbreak of BSE, be it 3, 4 or several hundred cases at a time. It must be taken relative to the cattle population in each country.</p>
<p class="contents">Only this week we hear of reports of outbreaks among the elk in the Colorado regions of the US and of new variant CJD outbreak among young men, young hunters – not the normal age group associated with CJD as we have over the years understood it to be. There has also been increased rigour in the reporting of BSE and increased surveillance generally with new testing regimes. This is not an indication that the disease is spreading, because we are get increased numbers. It means we are being more effective and more efficient in terms of looking for the disease in the various countries. That must be spelled out also so that we do not panic the consumer into thinking that the disease is continuing to spread. It is not. BSE is a disease of older cows, primarily older dairy cows. It has a much higher incidence among the dairy herds, than the suckler herds, probably because the dairy men could afford more concentrates traditionally over the years. In most countries the milk gave a higher economic return than, for example, breeding beef – certainly that was the experience in Ireland and the UK. But at the moment the high risk is with the dairy herd, the six and seven year-old cows and that is why, since I spoke last year, we have had the destruct scheme that was announced on 13 December 2000, if I recall correctly, that will be in place until the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">My one big criticism of the destruct scheme is that it did not particularly insist that Member States with a problem targeted the older cow, where the real risk cohort still remained. In fact, this scheme was used to underpin the market and the price of cattle, rather than primarily to take out the disease in the older cow. I do not mind underpinning the market. That could be part of it. But it should be secondary to removing the disease and that was not the case and I criticise that particular scheme in that respect.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also learned a lot in the last year in relation to new variant CJD and that patients with a distinct genetic makeup are prone to it, not the entire population. We need to say more about that so the public understands the relative impact that it may or may not have. It is genetic, its infectious, its degenerative, but there are very, very few cases, given, for example, the number of BSE cases in the UK in the cattle herd. We have been eating scrapie-infected sheep for over two hundred years, with no ill effect, and that is because the structure of the shape of the prion, the non-infectious protein, in the sheep, is not compatible to that in the human brain, unlike the rendered cattle or beef prion, that replaces the protein necessary in our brains. Again, we have not been telling the story as it is. Yes, I agree with an awful lot has been done and we need what is proposed before us here today, but I would rather we use the OIE or WTO standard, so that all countries could agree on the classification, so that what we do in Europe would not be considered a trade barrier by the rest of the world with whom we must trade our meat products and live animals. That is my one criticism still that, in this respect, we want to go it alone in Europe, rather than operate a worldwide basis in relation to this. Congratulations to all concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have now finally reached the point at which we have perhaps obtained some control over, and put an end to, the chains of infection which we know exist in this connection.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take this opportunity to ask us to think in the longer term. Unfortunately, human beings still do not know why, where and when the prion becomes ‘mad’ or when this prion-caused disease occurs and for what reason. The situation requires a certain humility on our part. Right now, another discussion concerning animal by-products is being conducted, and it now looks as though a new round of the debate will be getting under way.</p>
<p class="contents">We tried to make cows, which are vegetarian, into omnivores, and that gave us BSE. Right now, we are at a point at which I suspect that, out of fear, panic or for other reasons – political populism, perhaps – we shall try to make the pig into a vegetarian.</p>
<p class="contents">It would also be a good idea if we were to give a little consideration to our own history. Our forefathers knew perfectly well that animals that had died of natural causes should not be eaten. It is in modern times that we have left nature so far behind that we have begun to embark upon such experiments. I should like us calmly and quietly to show a bit of humility in the face of the food disasters which have hit us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the basis of scientific knowledge, which is increasing every day, I do believe that the two amendments that have been proposed to us are ambiguous and are more likely to slow down the implementation of these measures than to have a positive impact.</p>
<p class="contents">My group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, could conceivably support the first amendment, because classifying countries according to the number of suspected cases is a good approach and because the most crucial task is, above all, to monitor the infectious disease. Whether or not the countries that feel most vulnerable want to protect themselves, this is not necessarily a form of neo-protectionism. On the other hand, Amendment No 2 seems to be slightly excessive, seeking, on the pretext that animals under 24 months do not pose exactly the same problems as other animals, to eliminate the systematic use of rapid screening tests and to allow other countries, particularly Great Britain – the country that initiated this and the most affected – not to carry out systematic screening. If that is the intention behind the amendment, we in the Group of the Greens are totally opposed to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Since this debate is evolving continually, I will add that, as Mrs Doyle has just said, we are asking ourselves questions about Canada or the United States. No country is today able to say that it is free from BSE or TSE and, more importantly, we should now have screening for sheep, since it is obvious today that the disease was definitely spread from them and that it is better to monitor this type of livestock, which can also pose the same problems that we have had with cattle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

BSE is a nightmare for the consumers who desperately question the safety of their food, and BSE has dealt cattle farming an enormous blow.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we are discussing a package of measures which was announced back in 1997. This is therefore the appropriate time to thank rapporteur Mrs Roth-Behrendt: her perseverance, her expertise in this field were essential, and without her thoroughness, the Union would not be where it is today.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to Parliament’s input at first reading, the common position is, on the whole, acceptable: systematic test programmes, which will also apply to sheep in due course; strict and clear rules with regard to specific risk material; effective inspections especially on imports; and market access legislation. All of this is of crucial importance.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we have to express our trust in the common position. This is the policy by means of which we can fight BSE. The measures must also be able to count on the commitment in Brussels and in the Member States. That is a deciding factor. After the increase in the number of BSE cases in France, fresh measures have repeatedly been put in place in recent months, and it was remarkable in this respect that Commissioner Byrne himself stated that food safety as such does not require new measures, but that the measures were particularly necessary to restore consumer confidence. With this statement, he was, in fact, vague once again. Measures are needed and are no luxury. Let there be no mistake about this.</p>
<p class="contents">Food safety is a very emotional topic and as such, food politics is now partly about the management of emotions. Statistically, we can say that food has never been so safe, but that does not convince anybody. You cannot restore confidence just like that, not even by encouraging organic farming, or by discouraging large-scale, industrial production methods. Confidence can be restored by means of a credible policy and clear language. Safety, prevention, control and eradication of BSE now require political commitment. The BSE crisis was much more than a very serious food problem; BSE ended up being a political crisis as well. It stands for passing the blame and dodging responsibility. In this way, BSE became the cause of a complete overhaul of European food policy. A European food authority is set up and we re-establish the principles of policy on foodstuffs.</p>
<p class="contents">But our discussion goes further than that, of course. We must now take a good look at food production. We want a green revolution, we want quality rather than quantity, our agricultural policy can no longer damage the environment, we must move away from protectionism which disadvantages third-world countries, and we must take animal welfare seriously. And we should not wait six years to achieve this. Today, we must express our commitment to the BSE policy, and that is, in my view, the go-ahead for a green revolution and for a policy that is based on quality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Regulation under discussion will help in the harmonisation of the legal basis. The Regulation takes account of scientific development. BSE tests for sheep and goats will be introduced as soon as the testing methods exist.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur is proposing two amendments. The first one deserves our strongest support, as it will provide even more protection, especially for those countries where there have been no cases of BSE as yet. The transport of animals is the main reason for the spread of animal diseases, which is why inspection has to be effective. Our group considers the second amendment to be unclear and for that reason does not support it, especially if the aim is to lower the age limit for BSE tests to animals which are 24 months old. This is not necessarily a sensible solution for all Member States. In saying this I certainly do not wish to oppose the proposal, if some Member States want to do this. Measures in the EU must, however, adapt to the BSE situation prevailing in Member States in compliance with the general policy contained in this Regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In any event, she has only tabled two amendments, because the Commission accepted the majority of the amendments tabled at first reading. These two amendments, as has already been said by other Members, concern the additional guarantees that some Member States can stipulate in order for animals to enter, and also with the possibility of conducting tests on animals of less than 30 months.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as I come from a small region with small farms that have huge problems, and where there have been some, but very few, cases of BSE, I would like to highlight three issues that I think are fundamental. One of them features in Article 6 and refers to the need to train and educate staff working for the competent authorities, staff that work in laboratories, people who rear animals and those who sell them. In practice, I have seen that all of these people are faced with a problem that they do not understand and that they do not know how to deal with. This training programme is therefore essential, in my opinion, and should be implemented as soon as possible, because it would be a method of prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">With respect to the banning of feed containing animal proteins, as established in Article 9, my opinion is that this ban should now be total. Cows should eat grass and this is the best way of preventing what is occurring now. There should also be immediate 100% compensation for the animals slaughtered on these farms. I have seen how some of the farmers in the region where I live, who had 25 or 30 cows, have very little money left on which to live. If all the animals are slaughtered they are left without their livelihood. It is therefore essential that the compensation that they have not yet received be paid out immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">I think, Mr President – and I will finish here because my time has run out – that if we wish to regain credibility among consumers, measures like these and others must be implemented immediately and clearly. People need to see that measures are being taken in Europe, otherwise it will be impossible to regain that credibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The committee adopted the two amendments, the first of which was originally a joint proposal by Professor Trakatellis and myself. Its content, in brief, states that Member States in category 1 maintain their right to demand additional guarantees on animals being brought into their territory. It does not aim to prevent imports of or trade in animals between Member States, but just to stop diseases from spreading to those countries where they have not yet occurred. It is naturally in the interests of the EU as a whole that diseases, including TSEs, are confined to as small an area as possible and prevented from spreading to new areas.</p>
<p class="contents">In our examination of individual rules on the prevention and control of TSE, it becomes ever more apparent that the whole common agricultural policy needs to be reformed, which is to say, certain steps need to be taken to amend it. It would be worth seriously considering an arrangement whereby the CAP would set common targets and minimum requirements in such areas as environmental consumer protection and animal welfare, but in which the wisdom of common agricultural aid would be reconsidered. Such a model would permit national aid to be granted mainly to promote food safety, environmental cleanliness and the aims of regional policies. In my opinion this would be one possible way forward, and one that should be taken seriously, from the current system, which is bad for the taxpayer, the consumer and the environment, and particularly bad for the farmer.</p>
<p class="contents">When the EU was established, the goal of its agricultural policy, in its simplicity, was to guarantee a sufficient supply of food at a time of shortages in an economy just recovering from the war. Article 33 of the Treaty is still based on this approach, even though the EU achieved self-sufficiency back in the 1960s and production has exceeded demand since the 1970s. We now have to shift the emphasis from quantity to quality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Tonight could signal the end of two years of hard negotiations between Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the legal framework to combat transmissable spongiform encephalopathies. This is the first major piece of legislation to be adopted following the introduction of co-decision in relation to veterinary matters impacting on public health set out in the Amsterdam Treaty. It is both ironic and appropriate that it relates to BSE, as it was the BSE crisis which led to the introduction of co-decision in this area of community activity.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to pay particular thanks to Mrs Roth-Behrendt, the rapporteur, for her tireless work over the years in pursuing a coherent community approach to the control of TSEs. A great many of the key provisions of the Regulation under discussion result directly, or indirectly, from her personal commitment to putting in place a very strong framework to protect our citizens from the threat from TSEs and this is an objective I fully share and I want to join with Mr Phillip Whitehead in wishing Mrs Roth-Behrendt the very best for her stay in hospital over the next couple of days.</p>
<p class="contents">When we started our work on this proposal in late 1998, the majority of Member States considered themselves free of BSE. This was still the case in May 2000 when the initial opinion of Parliament, largely endorsed by the Commission, was adopted: The ensuing negotiations with Council remained blocked as Council could not agree on the proposed central role of a scientific assessment for the BSE classification of countries. However, after the adoption of new emergency measures for the Community-wide removal of specified risk materials and the introduction of rapid tests for BSE, a compromise on the legal framework came within reach. The provision for such a large-scale screening allowed Council to agree to classification by the Commission on the basis of the Scientific Steering Committee opinion provided it was verified by that screening.</p>
<p class="contents">At its first reading, Parliament proposed verification of the scientific risk assessment by statistically valid large-scale screening. In its amended proposal, the Commission proposed large-scale screening as a transitional measure for the changeover from the current uniform SRM rules to the classification-based rules of the regulation. These two elements allowed the Council to come to a political agreement on its common position in December 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from leading to the Council common position, the start of the large-scale screening at the end of 2000 had yet another effect: within days Germany detected BSE cases amongst healthy slaughter animals. Around the same time, Spain and Italy detected their first cases and a number of BSE cases detected in France also rose steadily. Consumer confidence dropped to a record low.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with this crisis, the position of Council, Parliament and the Commission drew closer. Aware of the urgency of the matter and the need for a proper legal framework, in particular in relation to BSE eradication and imports from third countries, an informal trialogue took place prior to the Council adopting its common position. During this trialogue, a very solid basis for agreement between the three institutions emerged.</p>
<p class="contents">These were hard but very constructive negotiations proving that the three institutions can work together very constructively on key issues related to public health. The Council agreed to additional demands from Parliament increasing the number of tested animals. The Commission committed itself to introduce all new measures, adopted under safeguard procedures after the common position, into the regulation. The Commission also committed itself to take without delay all necessary initiatives under comitology after entry into force of the regulation. Consequently, the common position of Council was adopted by unanimity and endorsed by the Commission. This compares with the very sharp differences in approach in the past on BSE-related issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I would finally like to remind Parliament of its resolution of 16 November 2000 on BSE and the ban on animal proteins in animal feed. In this resolution, Parliament asked for several protection measures. These included a temporary suspension of the use of meat and bone meal, increasing testing in all Member States and rules for the control of scrapie. The TSE regulation, in its current form, provides the framework and, in many cases, the detailed rules for these measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Further amendments at second reading would, however, delay formal action upon this resolution. I trust that this House agrees with me on the need for the proper legal basis to be operational without delay and from what some of the speakers have already said, there appears to be a measure of agreement on that issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The debates we have had in Parliament on this subject since last November make this only too evident. It is vital, therefore, that this regulation enters into force as soon as possible. The Commission is therefore prepared to consider only amendments which would substantially improve the text or correct important weaknesses. Neither of the two proposed amendments falls, in my view, into these categories.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot accept Amendment No 1 for reasons of substance also. This amendment, which had already been rejected in committee during first reading, proposes the right for BSE-free Member States to take unilateral action at their own discretion against the import of any live animal. This is against the principles of laying down Community rules. It is also superfluous, as one of the main objectives of the regulation is to create harmonised rules for the marketing of animals in view of BSE status.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor can I accept Amendment No 2 as it makes the establishment of an epidemiological picture of all Member States more difficult. This does not however prejudge future initiatives from the Commission on the basis of this regulation in the light of the experience gained particularly on the aid structure of the cases detected by the current screening, and this can be done by comitology.</p>
<p class="contents">Over 1.3 million tests were carried out on healthy animals aged over 30 months in the first three months of this year. These are in addition to the tests on fallen animals and at-risk animals. We are rapidly acquiring a hugely improved picture of the true incidence of BSE in the Community. If I see any reason in the light of this evidence to reduce the current age of testing, I will not hesitate to take the necessary proposals. I would also add, in this respect, that research continues on more sensitive tests than are currently available.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we are now very close to putting in place the proper legislative framework for the control of TSEs. It has taken much time and effort, but the text of the common position following considerable input of all three institutions provides a coherent set of rules and procedures for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">May I just comment briefly on some of the contributions made by some Members a moment ago. This particular proposal is compatible with the OIE international standards. Furthermore, let me say that I greatly welcome the views expressed by Mrs Paulsen when she made reference to the proposals on animal feed and, in particular, the bi-product legislation. Let me comment on Mrs Auroi's remarks on the testing of sheep: I should point out that I am bringing a proposal on random testing of sheep very shortly. In the draft decision, we have foreseen as a first step 170 000 tests on sheep from October 2000 for the first year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
