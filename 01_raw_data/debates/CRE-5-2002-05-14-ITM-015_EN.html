<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Paulsen (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, I wish first of all to thank the shadow rapporteurs and others in the informal food safety group in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for cooperating so well. Naturally, the Commission’s initiative in both reports was also welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall talk first of all about the monitoring directive. It is necessary to obtain a clear and unambiguous picture of the zoonoses situation in Europe. Of course, we are talking about the food scandals that have affected us, most recently an acrylamide alert in Sweden. We must remember, however, that, even if all these warning reports are serious in themselves, they are in actual fact more serious from a psychological than from a public health point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">The big threat for the future is the old familiar one which people have lived with for millions of years and which the developing world still lives with. Even in our own time, the most common causes of mortality among infants are in actual fact infectious illnesses and diarrhoea.</p>
<p class="contents">For us in the rich part of the world, it is resistance to antibiotics which will be the big problem. More and more of our simple infections are tending to become serious again. We should have put the brakes on twenty years ago, so it is already late and perhaps even too late, but there is a danger that, if we cannot radically and quickly reduce the number of infections and antibiotic treatments, we shall soon be back to where we were in our great-grandmothers’ time when almost every woman had to give birth to four children if two were to reach adulthood. The problem is greatest for children and young people. I am therefore very grateful that we are now to chart antibiotic resistance to the zoonoses we discover in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Statistics now indicate that salmonella infection and other animal food-borne infections are tending to decline slowly, while vegetable-borne infection is on the increase. I am therefore very concerned that vegetable food be included in investigations for the purpose of, for example, tracing outbreaks.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important thing of all about the monitoring directive is that we should obtain common standards so that the information collected is comparable between the different countries. We must have a standardisation of sampling, reporting and the way in which these matters are dealt with. I should also like to draw attention to the fact that new technology should actually make good reporting simpler and quicker so that we do not have to wait two and a half years to be clear about the situation. Greater speed is often required so that it will be possible to inform authorities, producers and citizens at a relatively early stage. That is probably the most important feature of the monitoring directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The control regulation is perhaps more controversial. The Commission’s proposal was very cautious and restrained and seemed to take account of the fact that certain Member States imagine that salmonella is in something like the same category as a mild cold. That is the kind of attitude that exists. There are also Member States affected by salmonella panic of the kind that exists in my own country.</p>
<p class="contents">There is nothing strange about such panic. Approximately 50 years ago, we were hit by the world’s biggest salmonella disaster ever, or at least the biggest for which statistics were kept. Subsequently, Sweden began to try to do something about the problem, as naturally happens as a consequence of disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">It took our country 25–30 years to put in place a system that worked. Matters have proceeded more quickly for Norway and Finland, which have been able to copy the Swedish model. The Swedish model provides us with experience but is presumably too distinctive and not applicable everywhere. Sweden is a small, sparsely populated and open country, which perhaps made it simpler for us to attend to the problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the proposal is extremely cautious. There is a sense of ‘pussyfooting’ around the problem. I had expected the Directorate-General for Health and Consumer Protection to be tougher in this case. First of all, not all forms of salmonella of significance to public health are included. It is strange that, in certain places, only two kinds are included, even though it is precisely these that account for 80% of illnesses among people today. Or, more precisely, <span class="italic">did</span> account for that figure in the past. What is happening with the remaining 20%? Why not include all illnesses that affect, or are dangerous to, public health when efforts are being made to control salmonella? How can the Commission know what type of salmonella will explode onto the scene tomorrow? Will it be St. Paul, Hadar or some other form?</p>
<p class="contents">We have a vast number of invasive forms of salmonella affecting people’s health. I am therefore keen that the wording, 'of significance for public health' should be included, and account taken of all forms of salmonella.</p>
<p class="contents">Species of animal are also missing from the Commission’s proposal. I am conscious of the fact that, for safety’s sake, I have included all types of animal, but I shall continue to fight on behalf of intensively reared pigs and veal calves, because we all know that the quantity of antibiotics used is very dangerous. We also know that the feed concerned contains both zoonotic and other bacteria that are wholly resistant to antibiotics.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, moreover so many simple and practical circumstances that are of relevance that, even if we can ensure that the breeding animals and stalls are kept clean, that does not help one iota if the food is not clean. We know, for example, that a very great source of infection with <span class="italic">salmonella aruba</span> is Brazilian soya. We know the story about salmonella normally being killed off at 67 degrees. For ten years, however, aruba has succeeded in surviving at 68 degrees. We should probably not imagine that we shall one day become completely free from risk or that this battle will have been won once and for all. It is, after all, life with which we are concerned here, life which is in some ways as intelligent as ourselves, even if the intelligence concerned is not perhaps to be found in the same place or does not express itself in the same way.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore appeal to the House to support my two reports, just as they were adopted by a broad majority in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Redondo Jiménez (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span><span class="bold"> </span>Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the Commission on their balanced proposal, both in the directive and in the regulation on the monitoring of zoonoses and zoonotic agents, which we will be voting on in Parliament tomorrow. These are matters of great importance for all EU States. For some EU States these are not only matters of great importance, but of the utmost importance.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express my great concern at the result of the vote on the report presented in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, given that, in my opinion, it takes our concern for consumers’ health to irrational extremes. We are all worried about the health implications of salmonella – as Mrs Paulsen has just pointed out – even more so in countries such as Spain, Greece, Italy, Portugal and France, that are particularly exposed to this danger due to the volume of livestock susceptible to infection as a result of average temperatures that favour its propagation and of another set of circumstances that are not worth going into now.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I do not understand that, on the pretext of protecting consumers’ interests, some EU countries support the extension of control and surveillance measures to agents that cannot be transmitted to humans, in other words, non-zoonotic agents that do not fall within the scope of these regulations. The only types of salmonella that affect humans are <span class="italic">salmonella</span> <span class="italic">enteritiris</span> and <span class="italic">salmonella</span> <span class="italic">tifimurium</span>, and to extend Community regulation to other types, more than twelve, in fact, will only, in my opinion, cause serious commercial consequences that would penalise the aforementioned EU countries and small producers. Producers in northern Europe, where the incidence of salmonella is virtually zero due to the climatic conditions there, would not be affected by this move.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I therefore call on you to support the amendment tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which includes the sentiments of many countries that have expressed their concern in this regard in all the debates that have been held, both in Council of Ministers and Commission’s working groups. This amendment guarantees consumer safety, given that it includes all the improvements proposed by the European Commission, yet penalises no one. I regret that the report approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Heath and Consumer Policy has not taken the main countries affected into consideration and I hope that this situation will be resolved, if not in tomorrow’s plenary, then in the negotiations in the next Progress Council and in the negotiations that will have to be undertaken as part of the codecision procedure, given that these measures will be hard to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">I also regret that there are a series of gaps that have not been sufficiently analysed in Parliament, such as, for example, the loophole mentioned in Article 9 of the Regulation, which anticipates the paralysis of trade in those countries whose national control programmes are not approved. This initiative could give rise to a situation of clear commercial discrimination. The report approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, in my opinion, has not been sufficiently tailored to the needs of each country and also falls into this trap.</p>

<p class="contents">The two proposals take up some of the commitments given in the White Paper on Food Safety. They aim to improve protection of European consumers against microbiological risks from food products. We cannot underestimate the extent to which successive food crises, including those linked to salmonella, have undermined consumer confidence regarding food safety. We can, therefore, only support the approval of the two texts which have been submitted to us today. We must strengthen the monitoring and control system of zoonotic agents of animal origin in order to reduce their prevalence, whilst stressing that the effectiveness of the texts that are currently in force has been restricted by the fact that some Member States are failing to apply these texts properly.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, the Commission’s proposals are balanced. It might have been better, however, to go further on certain points and consequently I, like the rapporteur, believe that it would be worthwhile providing for control programmes for all the salmonella serotypes that present a risk to public health. I also wish to stress the need for strict coordination between the work of the European Food Authority and the work of the national authorities so that the early warning system functions effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding resistance to antibiotics, I believe, like the rapporteur, that we must treat this worrying phenomenon with due attention. Careful use of antibiotics must be encouraged and the necessary studies on resistance to antibiotics must be carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">My group also supports the amendment seeking to allow the Member States that have achieved a high level of protection to prevent, for a limited period, the placing on the market of products imported from Member States which do not yet have an approved control programme within the stipulated timeframe. This measure will act as a considerable incentive to introduce harmonisation of security levels within the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that the applicable control measures are based on objectives that are set every three years. This will enable us to set ambitious but realistic constraints. We must ensure that we do not go too far and impose timetables on Member States that they will be unable to apply. The Commission has, in this area, striven to achieve a balance. Like the rapporteur I believe it is important for the monitoring of zoonoses and their agents to apply to all levels of the food chain, including animal foodstuffs. My group also supports the principle of including vegetables within the scope of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we must work to ensure that these provisions are swiftly adopted and implemented, which will, I am sure, contribute to restoring European consumer confidence in food. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Following that bombshell, egg consumption in the UK fell by 60% and the government embarked on what can only be described as knee-jerk reaction, when they slaughtered 2 million chickens. Although some progress has been made in combating salmonella in the UK, there is still much work to be done. There are still 15,000 or 16,000 cases per year of salmonella food poisoning in the UK, half the previous levels.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, this is not just a problem in Europe. In the United States in 1994, there was a case connected with contaminated ice cream where nearly a quarter of a million people became ill. Sweden, as Mrs Paulsen has said, has led the way but there they have looked at, for example, heat treatment of feed rather than just looking at the blunt tool of slaughter of flocks. Of course, we hear stories now of Swedes going to Spain on holiday and falling like flies from salmonella food poisoning because they are not used to the constant exposure.</p>
<p class="contents">It is certainly true that Member States need to make progress to establish more effective national control programmes and at the same time, we need to ensure that imported products meet our own high standards. We must also concentrate on where the problem is, and that is poultry, and in particular eggs which are eaten raw.</p>
<p class="contents">Pork is less of a problem and, anyway, my grandmother would say that anyone eating raw pork deserves to be ill. Infection in cattle and sheep is negligible so we can continue to eat our rare steak.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of antibiotic resistance, there is resistance building up. However, we should not rush to ban prophylactic antibiotic use, as we could then see an explosion of disease prompting high levels of the resultant therapeutic use that could exacerbate the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, on the issue of plant-based infection, maybe that has something to do with the increase in organic food consumption where I understand you are 30 times more likely to get e-coli infection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is absolutely crucial that having set out the broad principles of a European food law and a food safety authority to act as the overall scrutineer of such proposals, the details are dealt with effectively and accurately. The zoonoses regulations to which Mrs Paulsen has devoted so much time are in a way the building blocks of the provision of an effective and precautionary food law for the future. It may seem rather over-elaborate to talk of them as building blocks, but they are an appropriate way to move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of us have reservations, perhaps, about the extension of these provisions, as they stand, to products of plant origin. An appropriate way to deal with <span class="italic">them</span> is through the hygiene regulations <span class="italic">per se</span> and not in these additional monitoring provisions. There only I dissent slightly from what Mrs Patrie has said. Otherwise, I applaud her remarks also.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that, on the general detection and prevention of salmonella, the rapporteur is right to take us down this road as long as it can be implemented the length and breadth of the European Union. It is as necessary for food producers as for the general public. Without the restored confidence of the latter, there cannot be a secure future for the former. We want to have the increasing antibiotic resistance, which is being demonstrated at the moment in zoonotic organisms, accurately mapped. I do not agree with Mr Goodwill that there may be more harm than good in that. It is not a question of preventive medicine – it is of the other applications to which antibiotics are put, and wrongly, in my view. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I am delighted to respond to this debate on the two reports concerning zoonoses. This is an example of the implementation of the farm-to-fork approach highlighted in the White Paper on Food Safety. Our proposals are much more ambitious than the current directive. To ensure their successful implementation we need to allow sufficient time for Member States to meet these objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">This dossier has progressed quickly. First, may I offer my thanks to all those Members who have driven this dossier forward – in particular Mrs Paulsen and the Members of the Committee on the Environment, who have made such valuable contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">Public interest in food safety is immense, as we know. Protection against zoonoses, disease transmission between animals and humans, is a growing concern not only in the European Union, but throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The first proposal, on the monitoring of zoonotic agents, is the basis for improving knowledge of the sources and trends of these pathogens, supporting microbiological risk assessments, and adopting risk management measures. The European Food Safety Authority will obviously play a key role in this exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">The second proposal, on the control of salmonella, aims to reduce the public health burden caused by this agent. Over 150 000 human cases of salmonella are reported every year in the European Union. The regulation will apply to primary production – a major source of contamination.</p>
<p class="contents">While some Member States have seen a reduction in human cases following stringent control measures, the situation varies considerably. The Commission therefore favoured a progressive approach to reducing salmonella occurrence. But the strategy is clear: to ensure high standards of food safety to European consumers, the prevalence of these pathogens must be reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">The primary target is salmonella, an important pathogen for which we know efficient control measures can be taken, starting at primary production. Other pathogens may be added in the future, if measures in animal populations can be shown to be efficient in reducing human cases.</p>
<p class="contents">Many amendments were discussed in the Committee on the Environment, and I am grateful for the quality of the result, which is excellent. The majority of the amendments are technical and improve the proposals. I welcome these amendments, which represent important and rational suggestions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, instead of dwelling on all the amendments that I am happy to accept, I will instead concentrate on those that cause the Commission some difficulty.</p>
<p class="contents">I will start with the first of Mrs Paulsen’s reports, dealing with the directive on the monitoring of zoonotic agents. I can accept most of the amendments on this proposal. I will start with comitology. I welcome the acceptance of our proposal on the adoption of implementing measures. I can accept that, in addition to the Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, the Commission may be assisted, where appropriate, by the Committee on the Human Communicable Diseases Network. This may, however, lead to some delays in adopting implementing decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">I can also accept that certain basic criteria be transferred from the annexes to the articles. However, I do not accept that systematic prior consultation with the European Food Safety Authority is required for any transitional measure or before amending the annexes. Certain actions are administrative and do not require scientific expertise. I cannot therefore accept Amendment No 22.</p>
<p class="contents">Shortening the deadline for Member States to report on their monitoring activities from five months to three months is overly ambitious, considering the time needed to collect and compile data. Experience with the current reporting system shows that five months is already optimistic. I therefore reject the relevant part of Amendment No 20.</p>
<p class="contents">Systematic microbiological studies during investigation of food-borne outbreaks may not always be possible if the suspected food is no longer available. I cannot, therefore, accept Amendment No 18.</p>
<p class="contents">I can support Amendments Nos 28 to 33, which enlarge the scope of the monitoring of anti-microbial resistance, and supersede Amendments Nos 15 and 21. The other amendments are either wholly or partly acceptable, subject to editorial amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I come now to the regulation on the control of salmonella and other zoonotic agents. For the same reasons as on the proposed directive, I reject Amendment No 10 that shortens the deadline for Member States to report on the implementation of their control programmes. I also reject Amendment No 27 that requires consultation of the European Food Safety Authority systematically before taking transitional or implementing measures or amending the annexes.</p>
<p class="contents">An overriding long-term objective to avoid completely the presence of zoonotic agents in the feed and food chain is unrealistic. All reasonable efforts must be made to reduce the risk from zoonotic agents to a very low level. I cannot, therefore, accept Amendment No 7.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 1 and 16 would introduce food of plant origin into this control regulation, but this should be tackled under the food hygiene package, as Mr Whitehead said. I therefore reject Amendment Nos 1 and 16.</p>
<p class="contents">I would note that as I can accept Amendments Nos 1, 6 and 12 on the proposed directive the monitoring of zoonoses in products of plant origin would be covered. Amendments Nos 2 and 22 provide for additional guarantees not only for salmonella, but possibly for other zoonotic agents. Although additional guarantees may constitute an incentive for Member States, extending them to zoonotic agents other than salmonella would create additional barriers to trade. Moreover, additional guarantees for food should be tackled under the food hygiene package. I therefore reject Amendments Nos 2 and 22.</p>
<p class="contents">I come now to Amendment No 24, and the sanctions to be applied to Member States. Sanctions are a horizontal issue, not only for zoonoses. The Commission is finalising a draft regulation on official feed and food controls, in which the issue of sanctions will be tackled. I therefore cannot accept Amendment No 24 for that reason.</p>
<p class="contents">An amendment to Article 8 on the prohibition on the use of antibiotics for preventive or growth promotion purposes was rejected in the Committee on the Environment, but not the recital to the same effect. Amendment No 37 would restrict the use of antibiotics to therapeutic purposes only. The Commission has already announced the total phasing-out of anti-microbials used for growth promotion. The Commission will ask for a scientific opinion on the risks and benefits of the use of antibiotics in medicines to control salmonella. For these reasons, and for consistency, I reject Amendments Nos 3 and 37.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 36 and 38 and the relevant parts of Amendments Nos 29 and 32, on the targets and measures for laying hens and slaughter pigs are acceptable, subject to review of the sampling for pigs and, possibly, setting a different timetable for breeding pigs and for slaughter pigs. We need a scientific opinion before setting additional targets for calves, other cattle and sheep. Moreover, adding targets should be considered on the basis of the experience with the implementation of the new regulation. I therefore reject the relevant parts of Amendments Nos 29 and 32.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendment No 35 on targets, it is evident that these are needed for those zoonotic serotypes with public health significance. However, this amendment goes much further, and it is not practicable. I therefore reject the relevant part of Amendment No 35.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 33 would require the eradication in poultry breeding flocks of all salmonella serotypes with public health significance, instead of just two serotypes. Given the difficult experience with the current zoonoses directive, this objective is overly ambitious. It would also contradict the principle of flexibility for Member States to set the necessary control measures. I cannot, therefore, accept Amendment No 33.</p>
<p class="contents">Shortening the deadline for laboratories to apply international standards for quality assurance schemes seems unrealistic, considering the time needed to prepare and reach accreditation. I therefore reject that part of Amendment No 26.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 25 requires the European Food Safety Authority and the Food and Veterinary Office to be closely involved in monitoring that equivalent control programmes exist in third countries. Control programmes are essentially a management issue and do not fall within the remit of the EFSA. I therefore reject that part of Amendment No 25. The other amendments are either wholly or partly acceptable, subject to editorial amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that Parliament understands the reasoning behind the decisions to reject or accept in part some of the amendments put forward. A full listing of the Commission’s position on each of the amendments is being provided to Parliament. I trust that this will be included in the Minutes of this session.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, may I repeat my sincere thanks to all those who have participated in this huge effort. Along with the food hygiene package, the zoonoses proposals mark another important step in our review of food legislation, in pursuit of our objective to ensure that European consumers have access to the safest possible food supply in the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
