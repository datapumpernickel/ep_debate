<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Trentin (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, we are faced with an economic situation which is still very uncertain, and the European institutions need to do more than just wait for American recovery and its impact on the European Union economies. Moreover, as in Europe, recovery in the United States still appears to be slow and to differ according to sector, and it is accompanied by restructuring processes which are having considerable repercussions on employment and require substantial capital investments.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no coincidence that the United States Government has adopted a highly interventionist policy, and it should make the European institutions pause for thought for they still have to counteract ongoing stagnation in the investment sector, at least if they want to avoid the gap in competitiveness between Europe and the United States widening further.</p>
<p class="contents">This being the case, the need to respect the constraints of the Stability Pact, particularly in terms of national budget deficits and the debt reduction mechanism, cannot, as some would advocate, take the place of stronger coordination of economic and social policies and a policy mix which will impact on the economic policies of the countries of the Union, particularly the Eurogroup.</p>
<p class="contents">The constraint of the 3% threshold for national budget deficits must be respected. However, we have to understand, at this point, that the scarcity of resources available for each State to develop an economic and social environment policy which is capable of giving fresh stimulus to employment and the economy makes it essential that we create fresh synergies through stronger coordination of economic, social and environmental policies, particularly in the eurozone; moreover, this coordination should also be evident at the level of the policy for supplies of oil raw materials, in order to reduce price fluctuations and counteract the threats from inflation.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why our report calls upon the Commission to propose to the Council and certain groups of States open coordination experiments precisely in the investment sectors in which the Lisbon European Council recorded the greatest delays in the European Union in the development by 2010 of a knowledge-based economy and society moving towards full employment and social cohesion. I refer, in particular, to investment in research and development, to investment – which has to be substantial if it is to have any effect – in lifelong learning; a policy which is inseparable from the promotion of job flexibility. I refer, once again, to investments which could encourage, which could facilitate a policy of active ageing based on the voluntary choice of employees and on the retraining of older workers so as to ensure the endurance of a collective pensions system. I refer, lastly, to investments in integrated infrastructures of networks and services which can lead, with the commitment of the States, with the commitment of private individuals and with the support of the European Investment Bank, to the immediate recovery of employment.</p>
<p class="contents">I also feel it is important and urgent that consideration be given to the recommendations of the Green Paper on corporate social responsibility, in cases of mergers and restructuring, so as to use benchmarking and other procedures to encourage the practice of informing and consulting workers and in order to find solutions based on employability and continuous education as alternatives to structural unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this is the path proposed by Jacques Delors yesterday and again today in the interview published in <span class="italic">Le Monde</span> this morning. With this path, the economy and the markets will benefit from a considerable announcement effect which will encourage economic recovery in the countries which are currently just marking time too.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, I would like the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs’ call to the Commission and the Council for Parliament not just to be consulted but to be more involved in establishing the broad economic policy guidelines and promoting greater cooperation between the European institutions to be taken up, so that this process too is carried out with full transparency and with the informed participation of the Members of Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Μarinos (PPE-DE),</span></span>  <span class="italic"> rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, my report on the annual assessment of implementation of stability and convergence programmes, which was approved unanimously by the European Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, concludes – in brief – that the annual stability and convergence programmes submitted by the governments of the Member States and their application in 2001 were, for the most part, in keeping with the requirements of the stability and growth pact, despite the recession caused by the decline in growth rates, what were luckily temporary setbacks in the American economy and one-off incidents such as the terrorist attacks on 11 September.</p>
<p class="contents">This generally positive state of affairs, a number of very serious exceptions in the case of Germany and Portugal notwithstanding, proves that having a stability pact and applying it as strictly as possible – and the policy of the European Central Bank has helped here – are vital to monetary stability. That was why we were able to introduce the euro successfully and the prevailing opinion is that it is a prerequisite to healthy and sound economic growth in the European Union, something we have yet to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, apart from a few exceptions, rates of growth are still low, high unemployment persists, causing serious problems among the poorer classes and the young in particular, and we live with the threat of inflationary pressures. The European Commission and ECOFIN believe that recovery is on the way and will start to bite during the last quarter of this year. The new stability programmes for the next three years paint a similar picture. We shall just have to wait and see if they prove to be right. Unfortunately, despite the upward trend in the American economy and recent improvements on the stock exchanges, uncertainty persists and huge swathes of the population are taking to the streets to voice their dissatisfaction, occasionally in extreme terms, especially at the last elections. Obviously, simple management by the intergovernmental conference is not enough. We need more effective economic policies which strengthen the competitiveness of the European economy, promote convergence, encourage productive investment, especially high-tech investment, and create jobs, if we are to allay fears caused by what is, unfortunately, an uncontrollable influx of immigrants, the criminality ascribed to them and persistent high unemployment, especially among the young.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the fact that a revised stability pact – or more lenient application of it – are being mooted in certain quarters, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs considers it is vital that it be adhered to rigidly and is therefore highly critical of the cowardly manner in which deviations in Germany and Portugal were dealt with. Unfortunately, despite the Commission's recommendation that an early warning be sent to these countries, as happened with Ireland in the past, ECOFIN did not do so, clearly for political reasons. That was a bad move and could undermine confidence in the need for the pact and the Commission's authority. And it has turned out to be an extremely bad move because, after the elections in Portugal, for example, the new Portuguese Government revealed that public finances were in a far worse state than the previous government had let on, with the budget deficit exceeding the gross domestic product by far more than the 3% limit. Figures were also covered up in Germany, on unemployment at least, while the deficit in both France and Greece appears to be much higher than suggested by the figures released.</p>
<p class="contents">All this creative accounting must stop; the Commission is already pressing for greater transparency and honesty in figures released by governments and stressing the urgent need to speed up the structural reforms needed, especially in pensions, the liberalisation of markets, especially the job and energy markets, and education standards, if the Lisbon targets are to be met.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union needs to be bolder, to learn from the successes of the American model – which announced a worrying 80% increase in farming subsidies yesterday – and to allow the creative forces of private initiative free – but not of course unaccountable – rein, without abandoning the social market economy, so as to escape the current climate of uncertainty which is a breeding ground for many a threat. And it has to do so against a backdrop of destabilising terrorist activities and in the face of the sort of revival of far-right and far-left movements, with all the suffering that presages, the like of which has not been seen since between the First and Second World Wars. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The latest version of the report arrived this morning, and it has not been easy for any of us on the committees to cooperate under these conditions. We are nonetheless agreed on many issues, and Mr Trentin has done very well in accepting a number of the viewpoints produced by our committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with him that the starting point must be the fact that the European economies are in the doldrums right now and need to be strengthened and that investments need to be made in what is necessary and in what there is substantial political agreement about. Both Mr Trentin and Mr Marinos have talked about education. I would especially emphasise basic education and basic professional training. It is also important to invest money in improving the ecological infrastructures, which are beneficial for the future, as well as to invest money in education, which has a large effect upon employment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important not only to do those things that are required immediately but also those that are required in the long term and that will have beneficial social consequences. It is therefore crucial to give particular attention, and more than has been given so far, to the importance of strengthening those local labour markets that are less vulnerable to economic trends.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall have the opportunity to return to this subject in Parliament a little later when we debate a report from the Commission about developing local employment strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish finally to say that, unfortunately, we have not had the opportunity to take sufficient account of the East European countries and their economies, something which it would be desirable to do as part of this process. Certainly, there are other measures which need to be prioritised in the short term, but as soon as we have a somewhat longer-term perspective it will be necessary to discuss the economics in a pan-European perspective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is that I am very happy that we are dealing with the Trentin and Marinos reports in a joint debate, because that again gives clear expression to the fact that there is not only no contradiction between the stability and convergence programme and the Guidelines of the Economic Policies, but also that they even complement each other. The second is that anyone comparing the Lisbon objectives with reality will be aware how much there is still to be done, and will see that there have been substantial delays in their being put into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon objectives, which are to make the EU into the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economic area, facilitating sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater cohesion, represent the goal to which all of us – Parliament, Council and Commission – give the highest priority and to which we have committed ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Commissioner, and speaking on behalf of my group, I fully support, as regards their content, the guidelines you have put forward and believe that their main features, despite a number of amendments we have also agreed to, are right and merit our entire support. Our objective is best, and most safely, reached by way of the model of the environmentally responsible market economy. I have to reiterate that, because the environmentally-responsible market economy incorporates on the one hand functioning free and liberalised markets and, on the other, sees responsibility towards enterprises, employees and consumers, along with sustainability, as part of its responsibility towards future generations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to appeal right now to an element among the speakers on the Left. Let us at last stop playing social policy off against economic policy, and employment policy against price stability. Growth and employment presuppose price stability, and social cohesion in our society presupposes growth and employment. Those who jeopardise the Stability and Growth Pact are mortgaging the future and acting irresponsibly. Those who abide by it have enough room for their political initiatives and investments to manoeuvre.</p>
<p class="contents">I call for greater consistency in implementing what we have agreed to and adhering to it. The implementation of Lisbon, of the convergence criteria, of the Stability and Growth Pact, of the Action Plan for Financial Services, of the plans for liberalisation, offers enough opportunities for coordination. Coordination at the expense of participation is something we will never agree to, but we will support coordination for the purpose of implementing our common objectives. The internal market enhances competitiveness in Europe and in the world, but it does not ban competition within Europe. We need competition in products and competition in systems!</p>

Stability cannot be an end in itself, it must serve growth. Europe needs a more innovative policy for growth. To achieve this, we must invest more in European infrastructures. The collective profitability of infrastructures is always much higher than their direct financial profitability. How many regions of Europe have experienced greater development due to a network of high speed trains, due to a new motorway, a more modern port or an airport?</p>
<p class="contents">The communication networks and energy transmission networks are also a factor in development and growth. Ten years after the launch of the trans-European networks (TEN), we must point out that few projects launched back then have been completed. What is worse, the increase in mobility has resulted in all the existing infrastructural networks being saturated. Those who advocate the liberalisation of the energy markets do not seem to be aware of the obvious lack of existing inter-connections for energy transmission. Similarly, those who desire a liberalisation of rail transport do not seem to be aware that the existing capacities on the rail networks are already saturated. This is true of passenger transport and freight transport.</p>
<p class="contents">We clearly need to extend trans-European networks in all areas. This is a typical Community policy since the trans-European networks, the name says it all, Mr President, do not stop at national borders but serve the entire European economy. The Commission would therefore be well advised to make improvements to trans-European networks and to extend all these networks.</p>
<p class="contents">Trans-European networks must receive European financing. The Union’s budget and the European Investment Bank must be used. Public and private finance is necessary. The European infrastructural policy serves growth, serves immediate employment but above all it serves growth and therefore employment, in the medium and long term.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish, Mr President, by thanking the two rapporteurs, and especially my colleague Mr Bruno Trentin, for the 2002 report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to highlight the following points: firstly, that we fully support the policy of budgetary rigour and the fulfilment of commitments established in the stability pacts. Therefore, we regret very much that the Member States, in the Ecofin Council in February, if my memory serves me correctly, did not support the Commission proposal with regard to the concern for the development of the Portuguese and German economies and the administration of their respective budgets. I would also add our concern at the French Government’s recent announcement. Therefore, I support the policy of budgetary rigour that will hopefully give confidence and strength to the European economy and its single currency, the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to point out that with regard to the broad economic policy guidelines, we agree with the Trentin report’s proposals, particularly where they aim to implement the Lisbon commitments after revision in the Barcelona Council. We particularly agree with the difficult compromise between achieving greater competitiveness whilst not abandoning the policy of economic and social cohesion. Clearly, this can only be achieved by putting an emphasis – as the Trentin report does, and as proposed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs – on the information society and the expansion of technological research and development activities. This will clearly give rise to the information- and knowledge-based society that will allow us to improve quality and be more competitive, which we hope for at the end of this decade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The message is that, if Parliament adopts this report, it will be rejecting the ‘wait-and-see’ strategy favoured by the Member States’ governments and is calling for a stronger qualitative growth. This message is conveyed by highlighting the fact that, in the triangle that economists know well, in other words that formed by the volume of public debt, the volume of public revenue and the volume of public expenditure – whether this is current expenditure or, more importantly, investment expenditure referred to in this report – we must also take into account the level of public expenditure needed to achieve the objectives defined at Lisbon and also at Gothenburg. And one does not need to be a genius to realise that this message runs counter to widely held views. To be convinced of this, one merely has to watch the election broadcasts by the main political parties, which all place the emphasis on reducing public revenue and fail to specify which areas of public spending should therefore be decreased accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind, therefore, the increasing tax competition between the Member States, I think that Amendment No 7 is an absolutely crucial amendment, because it warns against the pressure that public expenditure is under. Besides the tax aspects which we do not think are covered sufficiently in the report, this is another reason why we feel that Amendment No 8 is an absolute minimum in terms of corporate income tax and the implementation of the conclusions of the Primarolo report. But we must also – the Commissioner is well aware of this – move forward with environmental taxation and taxation on revenue arising from capital, which are all areas where the debate is stalling.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Commissioner, as far as the Stability and Growth Pact is concerned, my group will not vote in favour of the Marinos report, because I think that there is a contradiction, contrary to what other speakers have said, between the Trentin report and the Marinos report. The Marinos report calls for the strict observance of the stability programmes. I personally believe that, in the interest of citizens, it is unwise to refuse to launch a debate on the Stability and Growth Pact. It is unwise to seek to accomplish, at any cost and within strict timetables, budgetary balances: the level of public debt of the Member States is more important than simply complying strictly with budgetary balances. I think that there is a connection to be made between the rise of extreme right groups in Europe and the fact that the States no longer know how to respond to the basic needs of their citizens, or in any case these needs are not being properly satisfied. We need public funding that is sufficient to meet these needs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is our fundamental dilemma.</p>
<p class="contents">Opinions will differ to a marked degree as regards the Guidelines. If we make growth our priority, we can discuss whether or not it presupposes a high rate of employment, which makes for greater purchasing power and hence strengthens domestic demand. We can discuss whether to roll back supply-side economic policies a bit in favour of those that are demand-driven, but we will not solve the problem if we do not sort out communitarised policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States are jostling for position among themselves, which means that a common framework needs to be laid down, at any rate to provide guidelines for economic policy. How much can or should be budgeted for expenditure on investments? Is it really necessary – as is stated in the text – to prioritise the reduction of outgoings, or can we not change the revenue side by means of tax justice? Why does tax law not treat partnerships and corporate enterprises equally? Why is it that not every business or private individual pays tax on the profits it or they make? It is frameworks such as these that we can lay down and thereby enable there to be a level playing field in every country.</p>
<p class="contents">The question we have to ask ourselves – which I think Mr Karas framed in an improper way – is not to do with the Left wanting to engage in social policy as against economic policy or to oppose employment with stability. Good employment policy and low unemployment are merely the precondition for growth actually being achieved. We get growth only if the products that are manufactured are capable of being sold. That means that the two are linked together. That is why we have to give some thought to how to fit economic and social policies together much better, rather than setting them up in opposition to each other.</p>

<p class="contents">This is not, then, just a question of hoping that, in the future, the cooperative effort between Parliament and the Union will become reality. This is a real necessity if we still believe in the prevalence of politics over a certain type of economy, characterised by lobbying, which has certainly not yielded the desired result thus far, as is shown by the figures on the economic slowdown.</p>
<p class="contents">What, then, can we hope for in such a situation? I feel that, faced with the current momentous problems of our world – which have been mentioned, touched on today – we need to start to reason, to attempt to apply our great Europe’s entrepreneurial capacity to the problems of social cohesion which were evident in Mr Marino’s report too. We need to be able to define the new relationship between the new economy and the Welfare State in terms of the modern context, the Welfare State needs to be redefined for the modern age. We are attempting to do so in Italy and we are succeeding, but only by means of a great struggle to remodernise the relationship between capital and the world of work and achieve a great synthesis of the two, with a view, not least – and this is my invitation to Mr Trentin and the other Members of my committee – to what is going to happen in a few years’ time with enlargement, which is now almost upon us.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, chaired by Mrs Randzio-Plath, recently visited Bulgaria, where we were able to take a look at the budget of the applicant States, with some practical concern for what the implications will be for our economy. We must therefore act as if enlargement were on our doorstep and congratulate ourselves on our endeavours. In my opinion, Mr Trentin was right to refer in his recommendation to the age-old, noble values of which the Europeans are traditionally the champions; the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has therefore made good progress along this road, which is the road to the practical creation of an essentially inclusive European State with a sound economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And this is what is sometimes lacking when it comes to implementing agreements concluded in the socio-economic field. Since the Stockholm Summit, integration of social and employment policy and environmental policy into economic policy has been an objective in order to achieve sustainable development. The Barcelona Summit two months ago prompted the inclusion in Mr Trentin’s preparatory report, by amendment, of a whole host of social and employment objectives. Although I can trace the social and employment objectives in Mr Trentin’s report, I believe that there is insufficient consideration for environmental aspects. It appears that integrating economic and social policy is more a matter of course than integrating environmental policy into economic policy. Might the reason lie in the fact that environmental policy costs money and yields economic results that are not immediately measurable? I would therefore call for clear and concrete environmental objectives to be included in the guidelines for economic policy, in addition to references to the importance of the environment. Objectives relating to energy consumption and the reduction in CO2-emissions spring to mind. Economic growth will need to go hand in hand with the responsible use of our natural resources. Finally, I understand that the method of open coordination does not function entirely satisfactorily. In practice, it transpires that the use of this method is often too unregulated and the method itself is not clearly defined. As a result, cooperation by means of the method of open coordination is not sufficiently binding for the Member States. It is therefore desirable that it is made clear how cooperation between the Member States is taking place in the field of employment and social policy, taking into account the responsibilities of the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Two – almost magic – formulae, typical of a certain type of Europeanism are constantly being proposed in this Chamber: the European social model and the social market economy. The underlying implication – which is, in reality, often expressed – is that this is where the distinction between the European model and the US model lies, the former being an altruistic, inclusive model and the latter being an egotistical and cynical model. I feel we would do well to ask ourselves whether these labels actually correspond to the facts in reality, whether the European social model genuinely does protect the weaker sections of society and the marginalised. Does our economic policy really produce better results than that of the US? The Council texts before us today are pervaded by the optimistic, consoling mantra of the Lisbon goal: making Europe the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world in ten years. This is, of course, an excellent proposal, but we are overlooking the fact that two years have passed already and that the European economy is still at the starting post, that the necessary reforms are being postponed or diluted from summit to summit and that the hopes of Europe’s unemployed of economic growth bringing them work are still linked to the resumption of growth in the US economy, which is the motor for growth. It is a constant factor: we set grandiose, ambitious goals and then, when we fail to achieve them because it has become unrealistic to pursue them, we have to just resign ourselves!</p>
<p class="contents">The reforms need to be speeded up. The demands made upon Italy in this year’s broad economic policy guidelines are the same as those which have been made throughout the past five years, but nothing effective is being done to meet the requirements relating to the labour market, pensions, the liberal professions and the liberalisation of the markets.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end, Mr President, with a warning: only ten years ago, Japan was still seen as an invincible economy with a social model offering a remarkable level of protection. Now, a long recession coupled with the country’s inability to effect liberal reforms in its economy appear to be inflicting torture on Japan which is as long-drawn-out as it was unexpected. These are, of course, different situations which cannot be compared, but the fate of Japan is a warning which we in Europe would do well to heed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
