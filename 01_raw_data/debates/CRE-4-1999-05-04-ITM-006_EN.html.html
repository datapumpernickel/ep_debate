<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Spencer </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span><span class="italic"> rapporteur. ‐</span> Mr President, I hope that the President‐in‐Office is going to announce the decision to appoint the High Representative at the Council meeting in Cologne. Under our Rules of Procedure we will invite the successful candidate to speak to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy on 21 June so that we may put a recommendation of approval to the July plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">We take the view that the High Representative must be a figure of substance, not a creature of Council in‐fighting. The relationship which the successful candidate forms with Parliament and the Commission is, in our view, central to the coherence of foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The year 1998 was the year when our hopes of coherence in foreign policy were tested by reality. The last twelve months have seen the establishment of the euro and we deserve a foreign policy that matches the expectations in the rest of the world raised by our new monetary union. 1998 was the year of the pregnancy of our new foreign policy structures under the Treaty of Amsterdam. We deserve a foreign policy structure that provides the telephone number that Henry Kissinger asked for a generation ago. 1998 was the year in which we first engaged with the reality of Europe's defence. We deserve a foreign policy that is backed by clarity and coherence in our defence structure, most particularly as regards the Western European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">My report details the use of the Union's instruments around the world. It is a story familiar from recent years; a story of imperfect institutions struggling to grapple with an unstable world. We want to see a strong High Representative, a strong policy planning and early warning unit, a strong Commission structure with a coherent team of Commissioners dealing with external relations. We want a CFSP that is adequately financed, that is academically and intellectually credible, using to the full the successful crisis prevention network.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is a power in the world. It must find a common voice; a common voice for use not just in our near abroad. Our embarrassed silences on Iran, Iraq or the Indian sub‐continent are products of black spots in our vision, reflecting fifty years of building Europe brick by domestic brick rather than according to a global vision of our place in the world of diplomacy.</p>
<p class="contents">Our foreign policy has human rights and dignity at its core. How could it be otherwise with our own shared heritage of horror and civil war? Painful though it may be to contemplate, there is no other explanation for a Union that is prepared to wage war, not for oil, not for power, but to oppose the evil of ethnic cleansing in the heart of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Of all the instruments at our disposal the common strategies should be the most powerful. From the highest level they are supposed to guide Europe's footsteps in the world. Rightly we set out to define our relationship with Russia, our neighbour in the common European house, as a first step. To forge a new instrument in the heat of a crisis with our most important neighbour is perhaps excessively courageous. I am not convinced that the text that the Council is currently considering is yet good enough. To prepare it in a hurry without the help of the High Representative and without either the reality or the structure of consultation with Parliament is, in my view, hubris. It is the folly of the magic circle of national diplomats in Brussels who continue to believe that yesterday's working methods are adequate for tomorrow's challenges. Far from seeking to send a negative message to Moscow by proposing in paragraph 4 that the Council delay the adoption of the common strategy until the Helsinki Summit, we were seeking to ensure that the urgent did not drive out the important. It is exactly because we want a strong document that we offered the suggestion of delay. I accept however that there are those in Russia, outside the government, who are not committed to a positive relationship and who might deliberately misinterpret our motives. I am therefore happy to recommend to the House the adoption of Amendment No 2 from the Socialist Group.</p>
<p class="contents">War shines a harsh light on all our evasions, on all our half‐truths, on all our institutional improvisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe and our relations with Russia and with America will not be the same after the war. If that harsh light challenges us to define our views of the world, it does the same for America. My report has severe things to say about the conduct of American foreign policy, not least its co‐option by commercial interests. Washington, it seems to me, is currently torn between a view of itself as the centre of a unipolar world of American hegemony and the more realistic recognition that it is a super‐power that operates most effectively when it exercises its power in tandem with Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Nowhere, Mr President, are the new realities more apparent than in the Balkans. It is in the Balkans that Europe will be tested in the next five years. It is central to our relationship with Russia, it is central to NATO's credibility, it is central to Europe's role inside NATO.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent weeks I have twice been in Europe's south‐east. And beyond the horror of stories from the refugee camps I retain a clear sense of the suspicion with which our activities are viewed in the Balkans. This suspicion is not just the product of an understandable fear of proximity to war with a dangerous and unpredictable local bully. It is not only a justifiable fear about the economic consequences of a war which isolates and disrupts. It is a deeper fear of betrayal and deceit from the West.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe passionately that we need a coherent European initiative in the Balkans using all our instruments. I cheerfully admit to rechristening the Centre for European Policy Studies' proposals ‘the Prodi plan", a plan for reconstruction, openness, development and integration with Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I salute Professor Prodi's foresight in saying weeks ago that Europe's relations with the Balkans should be seen as part of the enlargement of the Union, rather than as foreign policy. But to succeed, such a plan will require a sea change in our mutual relations. We must stop seeing the Balkans as the repository of all that we are most frightened of in ourselves. They must learn to trust the Union and to trust themselves as fully European.</p>
<p class="contents">Much is made of the difference of the Balkans and particularly of the differences of religious heritage with the Orthodox Church. We have to make a real effort to understand our joint destiny as Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a commonplace of European rhetoric that we are formed by our inheritance from Greece and Rome. But it is an accident of Western European educational history that we define this in terms of Ancient Greece and Imperial Rome. The western intellectual tradition often forgets that there were two Romes. We forget at our peril that Constantinople was, for centuries, the original European city of culture when the ancestors of today's Council of Ministers were camping in the ruins of a former glory. Surely the time has now come to declare Diocletian's division of the empire redundant and to accept that Sofia, Skopje and Sarajevo, that Budapest, Bucharest and Belgrade are all heir to the same civilisation.</p>
<p class="contents">If an apology needs to be made about Western Europe's behaviour in the Crusades, it should relate not to the conquest of Jerusalem, but to the sacking of Constantinople by Frankish knights. The lack of trust in Western Europe goes that far back into our history and it urgently needs to be remedied.</p>
<p class="contents">The Danube in my view must become a symbol of our unity rather than a blocked artery in the body of Europe. I commend to this House, and to the President‐in‐Office, the initiative of His All Holiness the Patriarch of Constantinople in mounting the religion, science and environment symposium in September, in which representatives of all five of the great religions of the region – Orthodox and Catholic, Protestant, Jewish and Muslim will sail from Regensberg to the Black Sea in the interests both of environment and of reconciliation. There is a role here, both for Pope and Patriarch. The war with Serbia must be the last of Europe's civil wars. The cocktail of religious bigotry and nationalism must be put aside on the Danube, as it was 50 years ago on the Rhine.</p>
<p class="contents">These weeks, however dangerous, are rich with possibility. This is the moment when Europe grows up in its external relations. These are the weeks when we have to accept that Europe's role requires responsibilities as well as rhetoric, that we are charged with the difficult, as well as the detailed. These are the weeks when we have to learn to be ourselves, rather than merely an element in other people's strategy. These are the weeks when we assert that we are Europe, all of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I commend my reports to the House.</p>

<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Fischer, </span>  <span class="italic">Council. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what progress has been made in the four months of the German Presidency and the four months since the introduction of the euro? Four days ago the Treaty of Amsterdam entered into force. Of course it will not bring about a revolution, but it does represent an important step along the path to greater integration, politics for the people and democracy. We should therefore not make light of the Treaty. It strengthens the role of Parliament in particular within the European institutions, and this is a crucial step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">It also gives the Union the opportunity to make its common foreign and security policy more efficient, coherent and effective by improving its foreign policy instruments. The German Presidency has therefore made every effort to ensure that the Treaty can be applied in full from the first day. We must now use the new instruments for the common foreign and security policy as extensively as possible, beginning by defining a comprehensive and coherent policy towards our neighbouring regions. This is the aim of the common strategies. The first of these will concern Russia, and further strategies concerning the Ukraine, the western Balkans and the Mediterranean region will follow as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent months we have been able to reach a considerable degree of agreement on the substance and structure of our strategy on Russia. I am therefore confident and take a different view from the previous speaker, because although I fully understand some of your arguments, particularly concerning the procedure and the interests of the committee and of Parliament, in the present circumstances postponing this strategy on Russia would have a negative knock‐on effect. So I can only advise against postponing the strategy until the Helsinki summit, particularly in the current situation. Bear in mind that this is not just about Kosovo but Russia"s overall economic and social instability. Europe"s change of direction towards Russia is of crucial importance, and I would add that this also applies to our strategy on Ukraine, where I believe we are dealing with a similar problem. For this reason I am confident that the strategy can be adopted in Cologne. The aim of the Russia strategy is to help to promote democracy and the rule of law and to integrate this important neighbour into the European Economic and Social Area; it is also to strengthen relations in general and to establish a basis for future relations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Kosovo crisis shows only too clearly how urgently we need Russia"s constructive cooperation for peace in Europe. One of the West"s priority tasks is to ensure that the barbaric war in Kosovo does not also lead to any sort of reversal in our relations with Russia, but that we continue to build on our partnership. Our close cooperation with Moscow in the search for a political solution in Kosovo shows that Russia takes the same view. Russia must become a close partner of the new Europe, and we must devote all our energies to working towards this.</p>
<p class="contents">The experience gained through the Russia strategy must subsequently be put to use as quickly as possible in working out the other strategies. It is important that in doing so we ensure a careful balance between the regions, as stability to the south is just as important for Europe as stability to the east. As President‐in‐Office of the Council I would add that in the six months that I have been Minister of Foreign Affairs for the Federal Republic of Germany and, since 1 January, President of the European Council, one point has become absolutely clear: European foreign policy can no longer look to the East <span class="italic">or</span> to the South; these are <span class="italic">both</span> areas of conflict, problem areas which affect us equally, whether it is the south‐east, the southern Balkans with the Kosovo war and the crisis that must be resolved there, whether it is the Mediterranean Conference in Stuttgart, where we suddenly found ourselves physically in the middle of the Middle East conflict, with the Israelis to the right and the Palestinians to the left – we were suddenly in the midst of a negotiation process and we succeeded in keeping both sides in the conference, which was not a foregone conclusion from what we expected and in view of the political situation, particularly with the elections in Israel – or whether it is the current negotiations with Russia or with Ukraine. All of this shows clearly that Europe"s foreign policy must be based on a European approach and must not pit the east against the south. This offers zero prospects and would simply set Europe back.</p>
<p class="contents">We have therefore placed an important emphasis on the south with the third Mediterranean Conference in Stuttgart, particularly with the successful agreement on the basic components of the forward‐looking Euro‐Mediterranean Charter for Peace and Stability. Europe"s defence of the Kosovars" rights is a significant signal for the coexistence of Christians and Muslims in our future world, as it shows that Europeans form a community of values that goes beyond religion. Mr Spencer, you dealt with this aspect in great detail in your speech.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also very important, in the current difficult phase of the Middle East peace process, that Europeans should continue to pull in the same direction and that they spoke with one voice in the Middle East declaration of the Heads of State and Government on 25 March. The Oslo interim agreement expires today. We welcome the Palestinians" wise decision to take no unilateral action and we hope that serious negotiations can be resumed as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">During the German Presidency the EU"s relations with other regions of the world have been accorded considerable importance. The Berlin ASEAN meeting further strengthened dialogue and cooperation with our Asian partners. We are hoping that the first Europe – Latin America summit to be held in Rio de Janeiro will improve our political, economic and cultural relations. The EU‐US summit in Cologne should also give strong impetus to the future of the transatlantic partnership and at the same time bring current areas of conflict, such as bananas, hormone‐treated meat, hushkits and other, at least onto a constructive course leading to a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">The High Representative for the CFSP, provided for in the Treaty of Amsterdam, is to be appointed at the Cologne European Council. The German Presidency believes that this should be a man or woman who carries considerable political weight and is able to assert himself or herself. He or she must be given a powerful role in order to be able to promote a European foreign policy that is as operational as possible and to serve as a point of progression in foreign policy but also in domestic relations.</p>
<p class="contents">The High Representative should therefore ideally play an active role as adviser in internal consensus‐building.</p>
<p class="contents">A further important topic in this six‐month period is European security and defence policy. The Kosovo conflict has illustrated once again that the collaboration and presence of the USA remain indispensable for the defence of our fundamental values of peace, human rights and democracy in Europe. However, the USA"s predominance in both the military and political handling of the Kosovo conflict has also shown how urgent it is that we in Europe strengthen our ability to act in foreign and security policy if we ourselves are to be capable of effective crisis management in future. Tony Blair"s initiative in Pörtschach and the Franco‐British meeting in St Malo have provided us with a good model, and it has been a vital concern of the German Presidency to use this new dynamism. We secured the unreserved support of NATO at its Washington summit for the development of the European security and defence policy. The importance of future partnership between the EU and NATO also became clear here.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency is preparing a report for the European Council in Cologne which will establish the basic consensus that is emerging for the guidelines we presented and a decision on the integration of the WEU into the EU in accordance with Article 17 of the EU Treaty, including a target date in the foreseeable future. If we were to reach agreement on this the conditions would be in place for Europe to take unified action.</p>
<p class="contents">In my statement of 12 January I highlighted the prospects for the further development of European integration, and I would like to do this today for the CFSP. I would like to emphasise four points. Firstly, the European Union, as a global political actor, must take account of the increased importance of human rights through a committed human rights policy. For the first time, therefore, on a German‐British initiative it is to draw up its own human rights report this year, which should increase the transparency of EU human rights policy and deal with both subject‐related and country‐related issues. For Europe it has been a fundamental experience to discover how important the work of human rights groups was in the former Warsaw Pact area and how crucial Part 3 of the Helsinki Agreement was for the end of Communist dictatorship in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. This parallel nature of political dialogue, economic openness and defence of human rights is a legacy for Europe that must inform its human rights policy in other regions of the world too. In this respect we must tirelessly continue to support democrats and human rights proponents wherever they are oppressed.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason the EU clearly expressed its criticism of the human rights situation in China to the Geneva‐based Commission on Human Rights on several occasions, most recently in the EU declaration on the Chinese no‐action motion. We condemn in particular the action taken against political dissidents, for example the imposition of the death penalty on a scale unprecedented in international terms, and the treatment of minorities, especially in Tibet. The EU strongly urges the Chinese Government to ensure progress in the human rights situation in practice, with respect for democracy and the rule of law. The EU must also, within its own borders, show greater support for the observance of human rights. Human rights, democracy and the rule of law are stated clearly in the Treaty of Amsterdam as conditions of membership, and if they are not observed membership rights may be restricted.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that the EU will lay the foundations at the European Council in Cologne for the drafting of a European charter of fundamental rights to reinforce the rights of its citizens. Such a charter could later become a constitutive element of a European constitution. Enshrining civil rights may also serve as a model in the enlargement of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the EU must offer the states of south‐eastern Europe a political and economic perspective that goes beyond the Kosovo crisis, a far‐sighted vision and all‐embracing concept for peace and integration. The stability pact for south‐eastern Europe was roundly welcomed in the previous debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we also want to achieve the following. The greater the Union"s ability to act, particularly in the CFSP, the greater the democratic control and legitimacy of European policy must be. The German Presidency therefore wants to include the extension of the European Parliament"s rights on the agenda for the next intergovernmental conference on institutional reform, for which we intend to draw up a timetable in Cologne in June.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, in the long term we will only be able to strengthen the common foreign and security policy by presenting a united front in the G8, in international financial institutions and particularly in the United Nations, and by extending the use of majority voting. Yet in the forthcoming phase the common foreign and security policy is not concerned with further institutional reform but with maximising joint action and the intensive application of the new instruments. We must learn increasingly to change our thought patterns and to place our national interests after the greater interests of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">During the German Presidency we have succeeded in maintaining or even increasing the EU"s unity and ability to act in many difficult foreign policy issues in relation to Kosovo, China, the Middle East and many other areas. This is a success for all of us, and we must continue down this road. We must succeed in the next few years in realising a Europe that is capable of political action, as it is only in this way that the European Union will be able to defend its interests and values adequately in the multipolar world of the 21st century.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Titley </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, I should like to begin by taking the opportunity of wishing Mr Spencer well in the future and expressing the hope that his considerable abilities can be put to good use. It has certainly been interesting working with him for the last two and a half years, if only because I never knew what he would be getting up to next.</p>
<p class="contents">To return to the debate, I have to say that there have been times in the last few years when I have felt that the initials CFSP have not stood for common foreign and security policy but for coreless, fudge and sclerotic posturing. There has been a lack of direction and decision quite frequently. Some of that is understandable: we are operating in the most sensitive area of national sovereignty; it has been difficult to bring together nation states with different interests and practices and clearly we have had to walk before we could run. As Mr Spencer said, if we can achieve the euro, we ought to be able to achieve a genuine foreign and security policy. Certainly Kosovo has shown the inadequateness of our response and we need to use that as an example to spur us on further.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been, in many ways, guilty of complacency: we say often that the justification of the European Union is to get rid of wars within Europe's borders and forget what is happening just outside Europe's borders and our responsibility for that.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly we must change. The policy planning unit is going to be very important, but it must link in with other organisations, like the conflict prevention network, which Parliament was instrumental in setting up.</p>
<p class="contents">We need coherent long‐term thinking that will allow foreign policy issues to run through both pillar 1 and pillar 2 issues. I should like to see us focus on the longer‐term strategic questions, such as the role of water supply in conflict prevention. Obviously the High Representative will be very important but what is crucial is that this appointment should not be a fudge and that we appoint somebody who we know can do the job and whom the Council is prepared to allow to do the job. That High Representative must work with the other institutions, the Commission and Parliament. Indeed, I would like to see these institutions working much closer together throughout the CFSP. As I said in the previous debate, in particular I should like to see the Council listening more to Parliament. We have put together some coherent and important positions, particularly in our recommendations. We should like to believe that the Council is listening and responding to them. Parliament, for its part, must stop demanding the impossible. We cannot take action in every area of the world: we have to prioritise. There can be no morality without practicality.</p>
<p class="contents">We must remember the greatest contribution we can make to peace and stability is the enlargement of the European Union. That should be our main focus in the next parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly we also need a European defence identity but we should remember that the fifteen Member States spend two‐thirds of what the Americans spend on equipment and yet we have a fraction of the equipment they use. We must have more coordination on not only defence policy but also defence procurement and we must look to restructure our defence industries. We must have military thinking which reflects the new realities, as has happened in the United Kingdom with the defence review. We must have clarification of the position of the WEU and the role it is going to take in the European defence identity, and that must happen in Cologne.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must consider whether or not we need to increase defence expenditure if we are to meet our ambitions for the CFSP.</p>

At least three crises – those of Kosovo, Russia and the Middle East – demonstrate that the superpower that is Europe could have handled these issues much better.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spencer report goes some way to answering the major question that is tormenting all of us: ‘why did this happen?" By way of an answer it proposes, in essence, what should happen, that is, to redefine the parameters within which European foreign policy is conceived and implemented. This is both a conceptual and an institutional undertaking, which does not stop with the establishment of institutions, or the appointment of ‘foreign policy" representatives. It is an issue relating to the conditions under which the foreign policy representatives, or those mediators who are appointed by the European Union, will work.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President‐in‐Office, I address you in the light of the Council summit meeting in Cologne, and I say to you that, in Cologne, you will have in your hands a historic opportunity to establish the conditions and the prerequisites to enable the new Intergovernmental Conference to do for foreign policy what the Treaties of Maastricht and Amsterdam did for the economy; a European foreign policy which, as you more than anyone else are aware of because of your background, cannot stop at diplomatic processes, but must contain answers to challenges such as the economy, the environment and culture.</p>

A war is raging in Europe, a war with military input from the Member States. And a few days ago, the Amsterdam Treaty entered into force. That may perhaps give a new impetus to foreign policy. So I shall not concentrate so much on looking back at our common policy over the past year, but will try to look forward. One of the biggest changes in foreign policy will be the new instrument of common strategies. At first sight, the plan does not look all that remarkable, but it is a first step towards real majority voting in this area in the Council. The effect of this majority decision making will be to reduce the power of national parliaments, and that must be counterbalanced by an increase in influence for the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Only Union actions which draw their democratic legitimacy from the common foreign and security policy will be able to count on support from the people of Europe. For these reasons, a future High Representative will need to appear before Parliament"s Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy to seek its endorsement. Only in this way, I believe, can a close link be forged between this representative and the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">A word or two now on Europe"s identity in the field of security. The current war in Kosovo has shown once again the desperate need for the EU to have its own capability for military crisis management, as so often advocated in this House. In this area too, the Union must be able to act more independently of the USA if need be. So the WEU really must be merged into the Union without further delay.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, this is my last speech to the House on a report, and I am especially pleased that it is a report by my friend and colleague Tom Spencer. My thanks to him for the leadership he has sought to give, and has given, to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy. My compliments and good wishes.</p>

The Social Democrats and Greens in Germany, which holds the Presidency of the Council, are bombing the Yugoslavians, that is to say, the Slavs, with no formal declaration of war. There are still more Slavs in Russia. In the prevailing circumstances, Mr Spencer"s report is well‐balanced and carefully thought out, serving the cause of peace and cooperation, and serving also to maintain talks among the parties involved.</p>
<p class="contents">It touches on some issues that have been largely overlooked. It is by no means self‐evident that Russia must be helped. The EUR 400 million in food aid granted by the EU is a big mistake, as it is counterproductive and destroying markets. In addition, no decision has been taken on the basis on which debts are to be waived, and it what way this should be dealt with. The IMF is not rescuing Russia, but American and German banks, and it is therefore responsible for yet more disorder in Russia. Its country"s central bank cannot receive currency loans; its own reserves are located in Jersey. Thus I welcome Mr Spencer"s report, as it avoids setting out the sort of political conditions that Parliament usually does, but approaches the issue in a balanced way.</p>

Ladies and gentlemen, reconciliation with Russia is the most crucial peace strategy for our continent. In this respect the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia without a UN mandate represents the most criminal violation of this principle. The Western community has cast aside the peace principle in view of the massive human rights violations and ethnic expulsions in Kosovo. However, in my opinion it is a mistake whose consequences will set us back for a long time in our attempt to develop a common security strategy in Europe. The end never justifies the means as the results for our continent cannot yet be predicted. I would like to touch on a few of these.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, every bomb makes the return to the negotiating table more difficult. I see only one way out: Russia must be given an increasingly central role in the political solution. Attempts have been made, but Russia"s offers to negotiate have to date been rejected and in the end it has not been given this role after all. Secondly, the Washington option of taking military action without a UN mandate and against international practice forces Russia to define its own zones of influence and to assert its right to do the same here. We need think only of the many conflicts in North Caucasia and Transcaucasia and the dangers that have re‐emerged there too.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the ABM Treaty and the ratification of START 2 are likely to be indefinitely postponed, and with them goes our desire for worldwide disarmament which ties up so many financial and material resources. Therefore it is important that we develop a common strategy, and that we do so as the first act under the new opportunities offered by a common foreign and security policy. But it must not be used as an alibi. I would also say that unless there is interinstitutional change in terms of involving the European Parliament"s democratic right of control, then we will have less power of influence over foreign policy than we have had up to now. This is why we need interinstitutional change.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Dupuis </span> <span class="bold">(ARE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, out of friendship for Mr Spencer I will say that Mr Fischer"s speech confirms that this House is now being more cautious than the Council in its proposals to reform the common foreign and security policy. I believe that the Kosovo crisis is evidence for those who refused to acknowledge it of our need for a ministry and minister for foreign affairs and a ministry and minister for defence and security. It is high time for Europe to equip itself with the necessary tools to achieve this objective within ten or fifteen years, as it was able to do ten or fifteen years ago with economic and monetary union. It is time to work, to start working, as Emma Bonino said, towards defining a diplomatic and military union.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the amendments tabled by my group in this respect were not accepted by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy and I hope that they may be accepted in the House. I believe that one tool which we urgently need is a European peacekeeping and peacemaking corps. Again Kosovo is evidence of this. We need to start considering foreign policy from a Community perspective. Why not do this with regard to thirty or forty countries in the Pacific or in certain parts of Asia where no Member States are present?</p>
<p class="contents">Another important issue which is very similar to Kosovo and which Mrs Schroedter mentioned very briefly is Transcaucasia. I believe that Georgia is a central point for the EU and provides a door to Central Asia. The process allowing Georgia to become a member of the European Union must be accelerated. The cooperation agreement must be signed immediately and an association agreement must be rapidly concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">As highlighted again by Kosovo, we must equip ourselves with an information tool for all the people living under dictatorial regimes, in the manner of the American ‘Voice of America". We must have a ‘Voice of Europe" to fight against dictators before these tragedies occur, as in Kosovo. I hope that later my colleagues will fully endorse Mr Spencer"s report, which is an excellent text.</p>

As I come from a town on the Danube I would like to thank him for his statement today and for emphasising the importance of this strip of Europe that has very often been an area of crisis and war but could also be an area of peace and cooperation, linking western and central Europe with the Balkans and also with Russia, Ukraine and finally also Turkey, as he mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">It is on the one hand a positive sign for Europe that the crises and political conflicts are not inside but on the edge of the European Union. But this is no cause for satisfaction, as we need to devote extra‐special attention to achieving peace on our borders.</p>
<p class="contents">The President‐in‐Office was the first in today"s debate to ask what has happened to the political solutions. I would like to ask the further question: where were the crisis prevention measures in recent years? Crisis prevention is not a miracle weapon, if I can use the term ‘weapon" here. But bombs are not a miracle weapon either! Nor are ground troops, as we know. We must bear all these instruments in mind, but if we are building a common foreign and security policy here I would urge that we begin primarily where we should begin, which is with crisis prevention. This is an important task which we must bear in mind particularly in the near future, and to which this Parliament must also contribute accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">One final comment, again about the work done by Mr Spencer over the last few years. Being an enthusiastic parliamentarian he has often brought us into confrontation with the Commission and the Council, whether we wanted to or not. What is important is that he lent weight to Parliament and its Members. I would ask the Commission and the Council to take note of the fact that we parliamentarians are capable of more than simply holding debates such as these, which are not always very interesting or exciting, and that the Council and the Commission should in future involve Parliament more in the drafting and also in the implementation of policy. Then the policies of the European Union are sure to be even more efficient than they will be under the new High Representative.</p>

With composure our rapporteur has attempted to elaborate a strategy for our relations with the former world super power, Russia, and he has succeeded.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in my opinion it is essential that, in the pain and confusion that surrounds us, we send a clear message and that we acknowledge the role that Russia can and must play without delay in order to avert the visible dangers: the military entanglements; the broader destabilisation of the region; the revival of cold‐war rivalries.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, however, while the relentless bombardments continue, disinformation on both sides is rife and self‐criticism is in short supply. Even the call for a political solution, which Kofi Annan sought following his meeting with President Yeltsin, is scoffed at by those who fear that the military credibility of NATO will be compromised and that the Clinton policy on Kosovo will be discredited, if logic is brought to bear on self‐sustaining acts of stupidity.</p>
<p class="contents">The stance taken by Mr Prodi this morning, and what the President‐in‐Office has said just now concerning the importance that the Russian Federation will have in the immediate future for the success of the major policies of the European Union, such as enlargement and the CFSP, are encouraging. However, we must not wait for the new President to assume his or her duties before we call for immediate and feasible solutions to the explosive problems of today.</p>

One was by Mrs Piha, on the Union"s northern dimension, and the other was Mr Spencer"s report on the Union"s strategy with respect to Russia. The committee was unable to create a link between the two reports, since the one on the strategy with respect to Russia only mentions the northern dimension in passing. The report on the northern dimension declines, for its part, to take a position on Russia, as that was seen to be more relevant to the report on Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">The northern dimension must be seen as an essential part of both the EU"s external relations and the decision‐making process that impacts on its internal development. In external relations the northern dimension will be responsible for the creation of a separate common strategy, in which relations with Russia will have a key position. In developing the Russian strategy further the aim will be for the instruments already available to the Union, and especially the TACIS programme, to effectively implement jointly established goals.</p>
<p class="contents">In its EU policy, Russia must also be able to broaden its pan‐European network of contacts. The EU has to develop its institutions so that it can broaden its scope to cover the whole of Europe. This will require internal differentiation on the part of the Union, and its development as a confederation of states, rather than as a federation. The Union, in principle, must also be open to Russian membership, although this seems a long way off at present.</p>
<p class="contents">The Liberal Group approves the report on the strategy with respect to Russia as it stands, but we wish to remove the proposal to postpone decisions on it. The strategy must be put into effect without delay, and its implementation has to get under way in as effective a way as possible. My congratulations go to Mr Spencer for an excellent report.</p>

The standard of living of its people has continued to fall, insecurity and the influence of various mafias have increased alarmingly and the country is heading towards disintegration.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons and also because we must continue to improve our relations with Russia in light of the serious crisis in Kosovo, we support the decision taken on 26 April by the Council to adopt a proposal for a common strategy towards Russia. This common strategy sets out the need for democracy, the rule of law in public institutions and the integration of Russia into a European social and economic area as well as the common challenges which are facing the European continent. However, it will be necessary to improve the judicial system, the public administration, the police forces and the regional authorities through training, support for reforms, the reinforcement of relations between the European and Russian political systems and support for the NGOs and for an independent press.</p>
<p class="contents">On a social and economic level, there are various areas of action: restructuring businesses, public finances, the banking system or access to international financial markets, standards and certification, competition policy, access to the market, cooperation on technology and the development of agricultural reform and social dialogue. The reforms of the PHARE and TACIS programmes should be aimed at making the best use of the impetus for cooperation with European business sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of stability and security, joint initiatives must be proposed to Russia on foreign policy, through contacts made by the High Representative for the CFSP, and on increasing Russian participation when the EU uses the Western European Union for operations commonly known as ‘Petersberg tasks". Also, joint initiatives are needed to strengthen cooperation in order to prevent and resolve conflicts within the OSCE and United Nations and also in respect of disarmament control. Other challenges include the protection of the environment, nuclear safety and the fight against organised crime through regional or transborder actions.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel that a stable, democratic and prosperous Russia, firmly anchored in a united Europe, is essential for ensuring lasting peace on the European continent. Our support for the current and future democratically elected Russian authorities must continue. We also believe that this common strategy towards Russia must be adopted at the next meeting of the European Council in Cologne. We will therefore vote in favour of this and will not support any postponement.</p>

I very much welcome the fact that the Council firstly wants to adopt a common strategy with Russia. According to the Treaty of Amsterdam a common strategy requires the consultation of the European Parliament. In view of Parliament"s schedule the Council feels that consultation is not possible if the common strategy is to be decided at the June summit, as the final draft of the document will not be available until 17 May. It is therefore particularly important that we make it clear to the Council that the procedure of a report with recommendations to the Council on a common strategy is a one‐off solution because of the elections. In all future common strategies Parliament will insist on being consulted by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to look at a few issues of substance, although it is difficult to make recommendations about a text that we do not have before us. I would like to emphasise one point in particular: I would oppose the rapporteur"s endeavours to postpone the common strategy on our relations with Russia, which is of the utmost importance at this present juncture, as the strategy goes far beyond bilateral relations with this country. Both the Member States and the Commission have stated clearly that any delay in adopting the strategy could be misinterpreted by the Russians, and I believe that it is in all our interests to avoid any increase in tension between the European Union and Russia in the current complicated international situation. Russia"s efforts to solve the conflict in the Balkans serve only to further underline the importance of this country for Europe"s security structure, and I very much support the President‐in‐Office"s desire to adopt this strategy as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union"s policy towards the Russian Federation has not always been exemplary to date, but I would hope that the combination of a comprehensive strategy and the new TACIS regulation that is due to enter into force in the year 2000 will lead to a significant improvement in decision‐making and implementation in the European Union"s policy on Russia.</p>

I too consider it to be a mistake to postpone the issue of our relations with Russia and what form the strategy should take. I believe in fact that, particularly in view of current events, it is absolutely essential that we not only maintain the line of communication with Moscow but develop it further. It has been said several times today in the various debates that without Russia a European security structure and a flourishing Europe would be inconceivable.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also the case that on visits to Russia and in talks with Russian colleagues we are repeatedly asked about the European Union"s strategy towards Russia. In fact – at least this is the impression I get – this strategy has up to now been inadequate. We have had the partnership agreement, but what should come after that and how it should be developed are questions that have so far not been given sufficient attention. I believe these questions must be answered so that we can tackle the issue methodically and in accordance with our objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">When we are in Moscow our Russian partners often end up by asking whether we can imagine Russia perhaps one day even becoming a member of the European Union. I always reply that I cannot imagine it today but that I cannot say whether I might be able to imagine it in 30, 40 or 50 years" time. Our strategy need not go this far but I believe that at least the framework conditions for the development of this thriving cooperation must certainly be established immediately so that the Russians also know where they stand.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the work from the partnership agreement must also be developed further, of course. Russia itself continues to have a great many serious problems. I can only say that it is also our duty as the European Union and as a party in negotiation with them to do our best to make it easier for them to tackle and resolve many of these home‐made problems. Wherever we can lend support we should do so.</p>

Russia is indeed the most important problem in our foreign policy. But this has been the case for a long time in our history. Unfortunately, I sometimes have the impression that many of our leading politicians who talk about this have not read history or, if they have read it, have not understood it. We need a realistic relationship with Russia that should not be determined by fear but a policy that knows what the facts are and takes them on board.</p>
<p class="contents">Enrico Berlinguer once made a very true comment, which was that we should take what the Russians tell us seriously. We do not take it seriously. We have not taken on board that this is an imperialistic power with whom we have to coexist, but we must recognise that it is an imperialistic power and that attempts to make the poacher turn gamekeeper, as it were, sometimes go astray. We must pursue a realistic policy that is based to a large extent on the fact that Russia today, at a time of worldwide decolonisation, is the last great colonial empire on earth. Russia will join Europe one day, but I am convinced that this will only be possible when it has been decolonised, since we do not want to be dragged into any new colonial wars with the countries of the Far East, which is a very real danger.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone who has dealt with China – and I would hope that our politicians will devote more attention to China – knows what its plans are. China is a power that also has commitments in Siberia; every day 5 000 Chinese cross the Amur border illegally. These are the things we need to think about. I am grateful to Mr Spencer for his report; I would only ask that we keep to the situation in reality.</p>

<p class="contents">The recent Washington Summit and the future Cologne Council have further focused attention on how we can promote human rights and secure peace in Europe in the next millennium. Ever closer partnership with the Russian Federation will be essential to achieve these aims.</p>
<p class="contents">May I say at this point that the central conclusion of Mr Spencer's report on Russia, namely that we must postpone agreement on a common strategy beyond the Cologne Summit in June, is – and I think many agree here – diplomatic lunacy. What sort of signal would this give Russia at a time when we look to Moscow to play a positive role in assisting with peace talks on Kosovo. Such a delay in fostering closer political and economic ties with Russia would merely be a gift to anti‐western, communist and nationalist forces in Russia, as has been mentioned during the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">But the rapporteur is correct in calling for the common strategy to have real substance and the means for implementing it. The economic, environmental and social situation in Russia is dire, but Russia must also do more to help itself by reforming the economy and banking sector, collecting taxes and overhauling the legal system.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and international financial institutions should play their part in assisting an effective reform programme. But there must be political will on the Russian side to eliminate the ‘robber baron" style of capitalism which has developed since 1991.</p>
<p class="contents">With the resurgence of nationalism in Russia and the growing social deprivation of the majority of the Russian people, it is both our duty and in our interest for Europe to work with Russia to enhance democracy, security and prosperity for all our citizens.</p>

It is my belief that if we had had this foreign policy in place several years ago, we would not have experienced the crises in Bosnia and Croatia – far less the war in Serbia. The prevention of crises is, as our colleagues have mentioned, extremely important. I therefore believe that we should be careful not to put the cart before the horse, talking more about technical options such as bombs and armed conflict than about crisis resolution. So I say: crisis prevention first, military hardware second.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vitally important that we achieve agreement as far as the analysis is concerned, and that those in charge of the common foreign and security policy cooperate closely with the Member States. The new institution, 'Mr or Mrs Foreign Policy, ' should be primarily preventative and cooperate with the OSCE, the UN and so on. It may be regrettable that it did not succeed in the Balkans and that intervention was necessary, but that is something we must be prepared for when human rights are so grossly violated.</p>

The northern dimension, however, should have been accorded greater substance, such as the creation of free trade zones for northwestern Russia, which would help it to develop. However, the report talks about an economic and social crisis as if that were the heart of the matter. It is merely the result of a political crisis. That is the core issue. That is why the world"s richest country, in terms of natural resources, has become poverty‐stricken.</p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost, Russia needs a credible, stable political system. Shameless, large‐scale corruption on the part of politicians and dubious businessmen has destroyed the credibility of the administration in the eyes of its own nation. Furthermore, loans from the west have been transferred to private tax havens, which must not be tolerated. Prime Minister Primakov has vowed to address the problem of fraud. We are waiting for the Russian Government to ask Interpol for help in sorting out accounts and finance. Loans from western financial institutions must be made conditional on the eradication of corruption at high levels. Besides, it does not cost anything, or at least no extra loans are required. In fact, corruption rots the whole system from top to bottom, and it stifles many of the reforms. That is a lot more important than adhering to every detail in the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also rather passes over the fact that the nation has descended into poverty because a small elite has been clinging onto the nation"s wealth. This has had the unfortunate result that life expectancy has fallen by ten years in ten years. We need a strategy that will tackle the essential issues. In addition, the banking system and the criminal chains associated with it must be changed, reformed and straightened out. We should nevertheless bear in mind that Russia has an educated population and a splendid culture which will challenge the individualism and materialism of the west.</p>

I feel that this review underlines the extent to which the Union"s foreign interests depend on its internal strength and are closely linked to it. It is not enough therefore for us to wring our hands and regret that we have not yet consolidated our common foreign and security policy. Instead, we need to use all the means at our disposal to ensure that this foreign and security policy – and also our defence policy – is in line with our interests and responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to draw attention to two important considerations. The first relates to the speech made by Mr Fischer, the President‐in‐Office of the Council. We are entering a new stage that will be characterised by the Council"s appointment of the High Representative for the CFSP. Only this morning we heard Mr Prodi, the President‐designate of the Commission, talk about reorganising the Commission and suggest that it would be useful to appoint Vice‐Presidents and restructure departments. In my view, we need to do more than simply appoint a High Representative for the CFSP. As things stand at the moment in the Commission, five Commissioners are involved with issues of this nature and rationalisation would certainly be helpful. It should also be borne in mind that we need to move forwards towards a defence policy. Personally, I am very much in favour of integrating the WEU into the European Union. Such a common defence policy would enable us to cope with the challenges we are currently faced with.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">van den Broek, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (NL)</span> Mr President, first of all my thanks to Mr Spencer for his balanced report, which rounds off what has been for him, I believe, a successful parliamentary term. I wish to take this opportunity of offering my personal thanks to him in particular, and to all the members of the Foreign Affairs Committee, for the very intensive and for me extremely stimulating discussions I have been privileged to have with the committee during the past term.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to look both back a little and forward a little. Back, because I note that since I became Dutch foreign minister in 1982 – when we were still talking at European level about European Political Cooperation, although the Tindemans report was already eight years old and gave an extremely visionary description of the kind of common foreign and security policy a Union would need – since that time, since the Tindemans report and in the course of the last 15 to 17 years, quite a lot has been achieved in this respect. I say that because we tend to allow our achievements in the area of common external policy to be overshadowed by what we have failed to achieve, with Bosnia and the Bosnia issue probably marking the low point as regards the lack of effectiveness on the part of what is now the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I come to the points of criticism, let me recapitulate – not in detail, but just a quick tour. Mention has been made of it today, and the project of the enlargement of the European Union is certainly a major undertaking, or will be so, but it is also a serious step in terms of preparing the foreign policy of the European Union. The same can be said of the contractual and therefore structural ties, including political dialogues, which we have developed with Russia, Ukraine and in fact with all the countries of the former Soviet Union. I am thinking of the broader and deeper transatlantic ties which the Union has developed. I am thinking of the Barcelona process. I am thinking too of the broad consensus which has evolved over the years on the very sensitive issue of Middle Eastern policy. And, last but not least, I am thinking of the policy and ties we have developed with so many countries in the third world, developing countries, as part of the ACP process. As I said, I shall not go into detail, but all these things are positive achievements.</p>
<p class="contents">Where we have underperformed is in the area of crisis management. I think we are all agreed on one thing. We have not really had enough instruments for preventing and resolving crises. The Kosovo crisis on the one hand and the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty on the other, which gives us a number of new instruments which may further improve our capacity for crisis management, are two events which to my mind represent a dramatic coinciding of circumstances. We were far too late in reacting to Kosovo because, while we had no warning of Bosnia, we could have seen Kosovo coming. At the same time, though, we did not wait for countless people to die in Kosovo before collectively resorting to the ultimate weapon in an attempt to stop the barbarities happening in the Balkans. We did not wait until more than 200 000 people had died, as we did in Bosnia; after one and a half years of intense diplomacy, using all our resources to try to reach a political solution by these traditional means, including economic sanctions, we did not shrink in the end from collectively using the ultimate instrument of military force in an effort to bring Milosevic to his senses, difficult though that choice was.</p>
<p class="contents">The new instruments of the Amsterdam Treaty can never replace the political will of the Member States, of course. But I think there is some cause for optimism and, saddened as we are by the tragedy of Kosovo, Kosovo has given a boost to the political will of the Member States to make a collective stand against reprehensible political actions in our continent. I hope that this trend will be reinforced by the appointment of the High Representative, by the creation of a planning and early warning unit, and by the instrument of common strategies now being deployed.</p>
<p class="contents">As an outgoing Commissioner, I would venture to say – and not because the Council President has now left – that according to my interpretation of the Amsterdam Treaty, the devising of a common strategy, with all the opportunities for action which this affords the Union, is something that warrants prior discussion with Parliament. As I understand the text, Parliament has to be consulted on the truly fundamental issues of foreign policy, and on matters of implementation it must also be regularly briefed and kept informed. In the course of the last parliamentary term, I have done my best to further that process.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very much in favour of the common strategy towards Russia, which the President‐in‐Office mentioned. It would be sending out entirely the wrong signal – certainly in the present circumstances – if we sought for whatever reason to put off finalising that common strategy on Russia. I hope the Heads of Government will reach agreement on that in Cologne. And I would add the express hope that the newly elected Parliament – because this Parliament has now run its course – will be prepared in the context of this common strategy towards Russia to give a measure of priority to the very important instrument we need in order to carry out that action, namely the new TACIS regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Amsterdam Treaty also offers us the chance to move closer towards an integrated foreign policy combining political, economic and financial instruments with military instruments as well, in a new troika made up of the presidency, the High Representative and a Vice‐President – rather than five Commissioners – and presenting a new face of continuity, visibility and as a result, to my mind, greater effectiveness too in the European Union"s foreign policy. Also partly as a result of Kosovo, the pace of the debate on a European security and defence identity is steadily quickening.</p>
<p class="contents">There are interesting echoes of this in the Washington communiqué following the events to commemorate 50 years of NATO. Clear progress has been achieved here. I agree with Mr Titley that a common foreign and security policy is not really feasible unless we also have closer cooperation in the defence industry. This is a subject which has been raised many a time in this House, and I have the feeling that while some progress has been achieved among the Member States, you would like to see more. If the Commission can do more to help – once again, I should say, because in the past it has already done so two or three times in a number of communications – I am confident that the new Commission will be more than happy to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">I will leave it there, Mr President. Once again, my compliments to Mr Tom Spencer on his report and my thanks to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, but also to the other honourable Members with whom I have been privileged to hold such thorough‐going debates over the last parliamentary term on matters of foreign and security policy generally, though I am mindful too of the role which Parliament has played over this past term in promoting policy on human rights. Parliament"s voice is one which, it is fair to say, is heard by a very wide audience around the world. I hope the new Parliament will make that voice heard more loudly and more often, because the tragedy currently unfolding in the Balkans is proof enough that there can never be too many words of warning and incitements to action, not least on the part of a democratically elected forum like the European Parliament.</p>

Indeed I have even been guilty of that myself on occasion. So could I say very gently to Mr Truscott and other colleagues that if they had listened to my speech at the beginning, by accepting Amendment No 2 on the Russian recommendation – which is a Socialist Group amendment – it deletes the reference to ‘delay" in the adoption of the common strategy with Russia and replaces it with what I feel is a very valid statement of what that recommendation should contain. I want to make it absolutely clear to the House that I am completely comfortable with my report on the recommendation as I trust it will be amended tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">As I am on my feet I should like to thank colleagues for their overly generous remarks towards me. I return the compliment to the Commissioner. Commissioner van den Broek comes from a country with a powerful parliamentary tradition which he has embodied. He did the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy of Parliament the courtesy of engaging in intelligent debate. It is that intelligent debate which is the lifeblood of properly formulated foreign policy. I hope that in the next and all future Parliaments the Council will learn from his example. The High Representatives may be part of the mouthpiece of the Council but it is good debate between all three institutions which holds out the best hope for the future. Thank you very much indeed, Commissioner.</p>
