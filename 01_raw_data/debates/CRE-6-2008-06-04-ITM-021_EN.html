<p class="contents">The problem is the unchecked rise in the price of oil, the increasing demand from a number of countries with rapidly growing economies, regional disturbances in oil-producing countries, as well as the fact that renewable sources of energy or natural gas will cover a mere fraction of Europe’s energy needs. As a result, the construction of nuclear plants is being tabled for discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">Many questions worry European citizens. Can the safe operation of nuclear power plants be guaranteed? Do appropriate early warning systems exist to guarantee sufficient notice in the event of an operational problem? Finally, how safe is the management of nuclear waste? For all these reasons, I believe that on the initiative of the European Parliament and with the collaboration of the Commission, a dialogue could usefully be conducted leading to clear, unambiguous conclusions for European citizens. I call on the French Presidency to make this issue a real priority in its agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the 21<span class="sup">st</span> century, the age of high technologies and progress, this problems persists and it is too inhumane and brutal to be ignored or confused with other problems.

<p class="contents">The life of any child is a blessing and its destruction is a crime against mankind. The trafficking in children has atrocious consequences. It is called “modern slavery”. What follows is physical and mental mistreatment, sexual exploitation, homicide.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need is to join our efforts and cooperate in a common policy to reduce and minimize its existence.

<p class="contents">There is a need to approach the foreign relations in the energy field with joint efforts. The bilateral agreements between the Member States and third countries must reinforce the common European approach and not weaken it. The agreements signed by Italy, Hungary and Bulgaria with Russia in terms of building the South STREAM, a pipeline designed to avoid a Member State, like Romania, without any economic reasons, seriously affects the cohesion of European energy policy and represents political strategies that must be avoided among Member States. I was expecting a firmer position by the European Commission in condemning this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the legislation on energy security that is to be adopted in the second half of this year, I believe we should show an ambition level comparable to the one in the case of the legislation “Energy – Climate changes”.

The effect of this will be that thousands of employees on the Baltic will lose their jobs, and tens of thousands of employees at factories that work with the shipyards, both in Poland and in other EU countries, will likewise be out of work.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission is hiding behind the slogan of free competition, not wanting to admit to itself that during a period of massive price rises on a global scale some sections of the economy need to be protected, as Asiatic countries are doing. The European Commission is unwilling to recall that the eastern <span class="italic">Länder</span> received more than one and a half billion marks in aid from the German Government, and that included shipyards located on the Baltic.</p>
<p class="contents">I am asking whether the people and the place where the solidarity movement began – the fall of the Berlin Wall, the liberation of Europe – must fall victim to arbitrary decisions taken in Brussels in the interests of speculators who are looking to make their fortunes out of the rubble and soil of the shipyards.

The amendment basically relates to the ban on imports of exotic birds from the wild to the Union. Taking into account the practical situation for breeding small birds, the conditions imposed on their import are difficult to fulfil. It is obvious that the media hysteria surrounding bird flue was used to carry through the above-mentioned standard. The EU has a system of quarantine facilities whereby avian diseases that pose a threat to people are intercepted. On a number of occasions breeders have helped to return various animal species to the wild. They respect the law protecting the most endangered species listed in CITES. Banning only results in counter-pressures and attempts to bypass it. The black market will take off, smuggling will flourish and the prices of birds will rise.

A Slovak citizen who was working there legally exceeded the deadline for re-registration of his vehicle by four days and for this offence the British police threatened to destroy his vehicle. While making their enquiries, the police behaved in a xenophobic and insulting manner, taking advantage of his passive knowledge of the English language. All his documents were confiscated for no good reason, he was given a newspaper scrap instead of an official certificate of vehicle confiscation and his documentation, such as his European car insurance (Green Card) or Slovak authorisation, was not accepted by the British authorities either. For this offence, and I mean just an offence, the British police and authorities threatened to scrap his vehicle.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to express my gratitude to my fellow Member Mr Chris Davies for his help in investigating this unfortunate case as well as to the other British Members who have taken an interest in the case. I trust that such action by the British police is an isolated incident and that this attitude towards citizens working legally in the United Kingdom is the exception rather than the rule. The deadline for the return of the vehicle expired yesterday, and as yet we have no information as to whether the vehicle has or has not been destroyed. One way or another, our citizen does not have his vehicle even though the British authorities have received all the necessary documentation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Congress was the first in the world to pass such an Act, which bans the import of illegally logged wood. In 2006, 10% of imports to the United States were produced from illegally logged wood. Following the adoption of the Act, analyses have emphasised that this Act is helping the competitiveness of American factories, protects jobs, and sends a clear message to which forestry communities will listen.</p>
<p class="contents">My question is this: how long will the European Union wait, and what is it waiting for? It is shameful and disgraceful that we are waiting with our arms folded. But we MEPs can do something: I recommend that everyone sign petition 23, which was presented a couple of months ago and the aim of which is for us to persuade the Commission to introduce legislation at last, after the United States, while we still have forests.

He wants to set up a small online company that will offer photo-framing services. He, as a person with a disability, working from home, would be ideal to start up a new business.

The significant influence of the current situation in the United States, the election, is evident. However, compared with the suspension of the round in 2006, the NAMA issue is obviously a step backwards. Highly developed countries are managing to maintain an almost unchanged environmental situation. EU textile and clothing tariffs will be down from 12 to 4%. The markets of emerging economies will not open, as it is not tariffs, but the obligations of maximum tariffs that are to be curtailed. Besides, an 18-year transitional period is to be applied to China, the country that flooded Europe and the rest of the world with low-quality goods. The tabled NAMA project is unacceptable to Lithuania and other EU countries, as it would jeopardise their competitiveness. There is an obvious balance between agriculture and NAMA. The EU should not race to complete the Doha talks merely on account of its economy. I would urge the Commission to take its time and represent the EU countries’ interests fairly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sadly, today’s newspapers are full of headlines about Czech drivers being hassled by German and Austrian police. Since April systematic and detailed checks on buses and private cars with Czech registration plates have been carried out in Germany and Austria. After just over a month of general checking, Austria announced its intention to carry out checks, starting in June, in connection with the European Football Championship. That is fair enough. However, I strongly object to general checks on Czech drivers in Germany. This is a one-sided decision that is difficult to explain and it is damaging neighbourly relations. I get letters from citizens asking for the Czech authorities to retaliate. This is not a good situation and it will also affect the political climate prior to the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty. I have already submitted an appeal and now I am asking my fellow German Members to look into this matter at home in Germany. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
