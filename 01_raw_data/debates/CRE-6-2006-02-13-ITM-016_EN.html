<p class="contents">The procedure started with Framework Directive 89/391/EEC, which provided a comprehensive regulation for the entire issue of health and safety at work, and created the legal framework for a single approach to all possible risks that may arise at the workplace. Section 16 of the Framework Directive stipulates that individual directives must be created to address risks of various types. These are required because such regulations would allow for a more accurate adaptation of the general stipulations of the Framework Directive to specific situations. The adaptation of the content of general obligations to individual risk types is very much in the interest of employees and employers, because this is how the law of the European Union can be implemented in practice, and it can create competition neutrality and guarantee greater safety. If the content of the obligations is not unequivocal, employers will have difficulty proving that they did comply with the provisions of the law, which may lead to legal disputes of unpredictable outcomes. It is also in the employees' interest that the protection in the area of health and safety at work, which is the inalienable right of each European citizen, as stipulated in Section 137 of the Treaty of Rome, should be implemented through efficient articles of law that are easy to apply in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The preparation of individual directives has been ongoing for the past decade and a half. The Directive on Optical Radiation is meant to cover the fourth extremely important area after noise, mechanical vibrations and electromagnetic radiation. As originally envisaged by the European Commission and Council, this fourth directive would have addressed the treatment of optical radiation originating from both natural and artificial sources. However, there are some significant differences between these two areas, in terms of intervention and risk level reduction. Therefore, during the debate of the second reading of the Directive, the European Parliament passed on to Member States the entire regulatory competence regarding solar radiation risks. However, it was subsequently found that this decision violated certain European Union competences, as it would have prevented the application of the stipulation contained in Section 137 of the Treaty of Rome, which stated that the minimum level of requirements applicable in the area of health and safety at work should be set within EU frameworks, for each risk type. This was why the Council and the Commission were unable to accept the decision of Parliament taken at second reading, and a reconciliation procedure followed. In the course of the reconciliation procedure, the Council accepted the majority of the amendments made by Parliament, and only suggested two substantive and two formal alterations. The most important substantive amendment suggested that the scope of the Directive should not include optical radiation from natural sources, as the foundations of a pan-European agreement for setting minimum EU requirements in this area had not yet been laid down.</p>
<p class="contents">However, legislators are not disputing any of the issues concerning artificial radiation, and it would be expedient to introduce the individual directive providing precise regulation in this area right now, this year. The Parliamentary Delegation accepted these arguments, but in all other issues the Council accepted the position of the European Parliament. Consequently, it was the wording proposed by the Parliamentary Delegation that was included in Section 8 concerning medical surveillance, and in the relevant preamble paragraph. We can say that the reconciliation procedure was rapid and successful beyond our expectations, and a final agreement was reached as early as December 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, this is what I would like to ask my colleagues and Parliament to support during the voting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also wish to express my appreciation for their rapid conclusion of an agreement on an issue as difficult as optical radiation. This is the fourth and final part of the proposed Directive on the exposure of workers to risks arising from physical factors. The adoption of this new Directive, the provisions of which are based on the latest scientific reports, will make it possible to guarantee greater safety and health protection for all workers exposed in the workplace to artificial optical radiation. The Commission is pleased that this directive complies entirely with the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> in the area of protecting the health and safety of workers whilst ensuring the flexibility and proportionality required for businesses to be competitive. The directive on which we have agreed forms part of moves to improve legislation which, on the one hand, ensures that businesses are not disproportionately or unnecessarily overloaded and, on the other hand, complies with Article 137 of the Treaty, on protecting workers’ health and safety. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that, come what may, the text is well balanced, meets the requirements for health and safety work and maintains the required balance in relation to business competitiveness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We supported German building workers when they demonstrated in front of the Parliament building here in Strasbourg – an event that got a very strong helping hand from the European People Party’s SME group – my group’s tradesmen – and from the British members of our Group’s European Democrat wing, including the energetic Mr Bushill-Matthews. By means of amendments, first in the lead committee – the Committee for Employment and Social Affairs – and then in the plenary, we got a majority in favour of doing away with the mandatory health checks and with expensive action programmes against sunburn, which would have laid still more administrative burdens on the backs of small and medium-sized enterprises. We voted for solutions founded upon the solidarity principle, with the Member States themselves deciding on what measures they regarded as reasonable, adapted to the most diverse weather conditions and, of course, also to different skin sensitivities, all of which vary from one country to another.</p>
<p class="contents">I might add that, in the Conciliation Committee, of which I was a member, it did not take us long to reach a workable compromise with the Commission and the Council. We withdrew our demand for the application of the subsidiarity principle in return for the deletion of the references to natural optical radiation, which were not replaced by anything else. The title of the draft directive now refers to ‘artificial optical radiation’.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank, once again, our rapporteur, Mr Öry, for the work he has done. Together, we have highlighted the need for decisions at European level to be workable in everyday life. The European Union should spend less time on peripheral issues and a great deal more on the problems that really matter, such as the fight against unemployment and campaigns for sustainable protection for the environment and for effective cooperation in internal and external security. I very much hope that this good outcome from the conciliation committee will be reflected by a clear majority when we vote tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think he has done an excellent job of work. This directive will benefit workers exposed to risks from artificial sources of optical radiation in a wide range of working environments: everything from electric arc welders to workers using advanced industrial lasers.</p>
<p class="contents">When I was rapporteur at first reading on this proposal well over ten years ago, the use of industrial lasers was pretty much in its infancy, but now they are very widespread and exposing workers to varying degrees of risk. It is a useful piece of legislation and again I would like to say ‘well done’ to the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say, however, that he produced good work despite, rather than because of, the help of his own group. At one time this institution took its work on health and safety subjects very seriously, but a rather worrying trend has developed in relation to recent directives. When we dealt, for example, with the directive on vibration, we were told that we must exclude whole-body vibration because – and this was used in the tabloid press – what we were trying to do was to prevent farmers from driving their tractors for more than three or four hours even at the height of the harvest, which was nonsense. When we dealt with the noise directive we were told that we must exclude music and entertainment because what we were trying to do was to force members of orchestras to wear Mickey Mouse ear protectors and that we were about to ban the use of the bagpipes in Scotland. Again nonsense, but it grabbed the tabloid headlines.</p>
<p class="contents">In this proposal we have had a determined push by a number of Members in the rapporteur’s group and elsewhere to exclude a particular phenomenon from the scope of the directive. They pushed for that without realising that the risks arising from this phenomenon are clearly covered in the placing of clear obligations on employers by two earlier directives: the framework directive and the directive on temporary and mobile work sites. The phenomenon I am talking about is, of course, natural radiation.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur made a valiant effort and we tried to help him to give legal certainty to employers when it comes to solar radiation. They are now lacking that legal certainty and still have the full implications of the framework directive and temporary mobile work sites directive to deal with. Hopefully, common sense will prevail at Member State level, as it has so far. That would mean, for example, that a travel agency in my region could quickly discount the risk for employees working indoors in its shops in the north of England, but that it had better take very seriously the risk facing its staff acting as company representatives in Mediterranean resorts throughout the summer months.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the difficulty now facing employers. We have not given them legal certainty. We will have a number of more difficult cases to assess for employers between those two extremes that I have given as an example. I hope that in future we can again focus on producing good, serious health and safety legislation and not on producing tabloid headlines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We now have a sensible directive to protect workers such as welders from artificial radiation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that, at long last, everyone has seen sense and removed natural radiation from the remit of this directive. It has been a long, hard battle. I congratulate Mrs Weisgerber. She and I worked very hard after the Commission proposed to legislate against sun in the second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only would it have brought the EU into disrepute again, it would also have been a nightmare for employers and workers alike. Legally, it would have been very difficult to prove whether a worker had contracted skin cancer from the workplace, the back garden or the beach.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly, everyone ought to be warned about the dangers of the sun and that is why I am very much in favour of national campaigns. But once people have been given the information, we are adults and should be able to make up our own minds. It should not be left to the employer to enforce it. That is the nanny state mentality gone too far. Imagine the language from some builders, for instance, if they were told to cover up when they were trying to get a sun tan for their holidays! It is no business of the EU to tell workers that they cannot go bare-chested or wear shorts.</p>
<p class="contents">Today's proceedings, and I hope the vote tomorrow, are a victory for common sense. They also demonstrate the power of the European Parliament. If we had not voted the way we did at second reading, the Commission would not have changed its mind and probably, more importantly, neither would the Council. This is a good day for sensible legislation. As a pro-European, I think it very sad that we have had to waste time blocking ludicrous proposals like this. Sunlight should never have been included in the directive. It is a very good directive and I hope everyone will vote for it tomorrow, but just for artificial radiation and not for the inclusion of natural radiation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In principle, any initiative that reduces health risks and thereby affords people better protection deserves support, and, as people spend a considerable part of their lives at work, it is logical that the various dangers there should be precisely analysed and all of them, along with all hazards to health at work, reduced to the minimum possible. I see it as an extremely good thing that the attempt should be made to lay down, across the EU, uniform minimum standards of health and safety protection.</p>
<p class="contents">What I found really scandalous about the debate on this directive was the attempt that was made to prevent anything that might cost money. There is also something dubious about this compromise’s statement in one of its recitals that, and I quote, ‘This directive must avoid imposing administrative, financial and legal constraints in a way which would hold back the creation and development of small and medium-sized undertakings.’</p>
<p class="contents">I do not understand why health protection is not supposed to cost anything if the same rules apply to all, so that there is no unfair competition. By all means let services and products involving a greater health risk cost slightly more. Why should they not? Why should people in general cough up for the costs that business imposes on public health services simply because of the negligent attitude taken towards certain risks? Real competition exists only when rules apply equally and if the real costs are reflected as a matter of principle. Anything else is a short-term subsidy for individual businesses or sectors at the expense of the general public and to the detriment of workers who do dangerous jobs. What I want to see is more economic probity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to begin by saying that I am, of course, in favour of this proposed legislation. I am disappointed, however, with the outcome of the conciliation process, and in particular the role played by Parliament. The negotiations on this Directive, which is sometimes referred to as the sunlight exposure directive, have instead been more reminiscent of a second-rate soap opera. Initially, the experts, the European institutions and the Member States agreed that it would be necessary to add further legislation to the general regulation on health and safety at work that would have simplified the legislation on protection from optical radiation and made it workable. Similar legislation was adopted in the previous period, in relation to noise, vibrations and electromagnetic radiation. What is more, nobody has referred to the very modest limit values for exposure to optical radiation, as set out in the annex to the proposed Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur, Mr Őry, has shown tremendous determination and I should like to congratulate him for seeking a compromise. Nevertheless, it was his political group that had opposed the inclusion of all natural sources of optical radiation in this Directive. It strikes me as rather absurd that fierce opposition to clearly defined rules and standards for informing workers and protecting them against sunlight radiation has come principally from those Member States in which there is already a decent level of protection, whereas countries such as Italy, where much greater effort is required, did not raise any fundamental objections. Perhaps the Italians know, in short, that information on and prevention of illness at work is cheaper for workers than doing nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">The Directive on optical radiation would be a practical step, bringing not only improvements in the protection of the workers, but also a simplification of European legislation. The situation that confronts us today in this area is far from what I would consider a reduction in unnecessary bureaucracy. I fear that in the future legal disputes will be unavoidable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At second reading, and by an absolute majority, we in this House nailed our colours to the mast by voting to remove the provisions on protection from natural radiation.</p>
<p class="contents">In the conciliation process, too, we showed that we MEPs are able to get our own way, rather than being powerless and at the mercy of the Commission’s mania for lawmaking. We are empowered to draft the sort of directives that will be of benefit to the public.</p>
<p class="contents">Verheugen and others are always talking about the better lawmaking that will bring about more growth and jobs in the EU, but it is regulations like these that need to be improved first. It is a matter of considerable surprise that we have now been able, in the conciliation procedure, to persuade the Commission and Council of this.</p>
<p class="contents">The parts of this directive that make sense – the ones dealing with the protection of workers from artificial optical radiation, such as lasers, infra-red light and the like – remain unchanged. As regards the regulations on natural radiation, it has to be said that the Commission missed the mark by a long way, for the original proposal for a directive required employers to commission comprehensive assessments of the risks associated with sunlight and bureaucratic action plans to deal with them, which would have involved employers having to provide t-shirts and suncream for workers working outdoors. It would also have entailed liabilities of which employers would have been unaware, and, in any case, any sane person is the best judge of when and how they should protect themselves against the sun. It is all about personal responsibility and is pretty much the last thing that Europe should be laying down the law about.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has quite different problems to deal with, in the shape of unemployment, exhausted social security systems and more and more aged people among the population. Those are the things we need to worry about, not protection from sunlight. Even the Commission and the Council have come to their senses and recognised this in the course of the conciliation procedure, and I am very glad that they have. It has made possible a considerable improvement in the directive and prevented over-regulation that would have resulted in needless additional expense, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge you to vote, tomorrow, in favour of the Conciliation Committee’s proposal, and then we will flag up our desire for less bureaucracy and less red tape throughout Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Rarely, if ever before, have I known such distortion of what a directive is all about, and so I would like to go over once again why we Social Democrats eventually, in the course of the conciliation process, decided that we would rather leave natural radiation out of the directive altogether.</p>
<p class="contents">We came to that decision simply and solely because we want the minimum standards that we lay down for health protection in the workplace to be applied equally and across the board in all the Member States. Where social policy is concerned, we do not want an <span class="italic">à la carte </span>Europe, which is what the outcome of the second reading would have given us, a Europe in which each and every Member State could decide for itself whether or not to oblige employers to inform their workers about the potential hazards of natural radiation.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though the references to natural radiation have been removed from the directive, the framework directive is still in place and still obliging employers to protect workers from the hazards of sunlight. That has been confirmed to us not only by this House’s own legal services, but also by those of the Commission and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The only thing we wanted was to give this obligation more concrete form, and, painful though it is, the conservatives and liberals in this House must now face up to the fact that it was they who made this impossible. The consequence of that is that employers are still uncertain of where they stand, legally speaking, as regards whether they need to take steps to protect workers from hazardous natural radiation, and, if so, what action they need to take. The bottom line is that the majority in this House has relinquished to the European Court of Justice the right to shape policy, and that really is very much to be regretted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While it is certainly to be welcomed that a compromise has been reached in this matter, it is, alas, only a partial solution to the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">It is certainly to be welcomed that a regulation at least covers artificial optical radiation, but one can no doubt categorise the removal from it of natural radiation as one of this House’s less inspired ideas. Where the protection of the eyes and skin is concerned, artificial optical radiation is just as much a problem as the natural variety, in that there is a causal connection in both cases.</p>
<p class="contents">It follows that legal certainty is needed both as regards artificial optical radiation and that from a natural source. We will learn from the way environmental policy develops that the courts and the ECJ will be giving more and more attention to this problem, and then we will again have to take action.</p>
<p class="contents">The protection of workers has, for some considerable time, been founded upon information and prevention; that is more humane and less costly. The process that has brought this change of thinking has been a long and laborious one, beginning with sympathy for the workers, followed by the realisation that employers had a duty of care, and that suffering and illness can be alleviated through treatment. It was only then that people realised the value of information about illnesses and work-related accidents and of the prevention of these.</p>

<p class="contents">It is true that this particular proposal proved rather difficult to bring to a finalisation agreement, but thanks to the perseverance and the common-sense approach exhibited by all involved in the conciliation process, all the hurdles were overcome.

<p class="contents">However, we must not forget that the biggest source of optical radiation is not artificial radiation but the sun, and for most workers skin cancer occurs as a result of exposure to the sun.

I should like to thank all those who took part in that process, because it was not a smooth ride and in a number of cases it proved very difficult to reach a decent compromise. In any event, many arguments have been taken into account, and this Directive does represent progress. I believe that none of the ideas expressed in this debate can easily be rebuffed with a simple argument. I also feel that there is room for further reflection on the development of health and safety protection at work. In conclusion, I consider that the process represented a step in the right direction and I assume, on the basis of this debate, that the Directive will gain resounding support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
