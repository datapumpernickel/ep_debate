We have drafted a report in response to four Commission documents, the basic aim of which is to make one overall market out of fifteen individual markets.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur for the committee, I should like to draw the House's attention to a number of points, Mr President, but perhaps you will allow me to stop for a moment because Madam Vice-president has just joined us.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat, the basic aim of our report is to respond to four Commission documents and to make one overall gas and electricity market out of fifteen individual markets. The committee has identified a number of points here, which I should like to list. First, the Union citizens' right to freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services has so far only been partially implemented. We advise that this implementation be accelerated.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we welcome the fact that suppliers are forming new structures and we call on the Commission in its capacity as the competition authority, in collaboration with the national mergers and monopolies commissions, to ensure that new monopolies do not emerge, that new suppliers have free access to the grid, that exchanges are set up and that consumers can change their supplier.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we are concerned about security of supply and consider that great care should be taken to ensure that the Member States which so wish can impose so-called public-service obligations on the competitors involved. The Treaty contains rules on transparency and clarity in this respect but it also allows the Member States to make their own decision here. We want to ensure that this remains the case.</p>
<p class="contents">My fourth point concerns regulators. Most, although not all Member States have introduced regulators. We note that, in the countries in which regulators have been introduced, not only large consumers, but also medium-sized and small consumers can take better part in the market and the conditions for using the grid are clearer. Perhaps we need to reconsider if the negotiated network access model is the right approach, because it makes life easy for large consumers but difficult for medium-sized consumers and may be an instrument which hampers the European market as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, the grids are the central market place for the markets. We therefore need free access, and that means that tariffs must give the market the right signal of non-discriminatory access for everyone and – and this is the purpose of the so-called Florence process – good cross-border tariffs must be set which allow cross-border trade. A model has been worked out here whereby the costs of cross-border trade are paid into funds. The money is paid in by the national grid operators and paid out to those providing through lines.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, Madam Vice-president, I have two comments to make on this. First, we feel that the costs calculated by the grid operators appear to have been plucked out of thin air. We need to examine these costings closely in order to ensure that they are not completely out of line. Secondly, the costs included in the tariffs must be sure to give the market the right incentive, i.e. they must cover all losses and encourage investment. That is an important point in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixthly: not all cross-border services have the necessary capacity. This needs to be calculated and, if necessary, rectified or allocated in accordance with the markets, perhaps by auction. Then there are two more points which I should like to address. We hope to discuss with the Commission in committee exactly how imports of gas and electricity from the Central and Eastern European countries are to be dealt with, because we do not want to damage our own gas and electricity market in Europe by accepting different safety standards or the wrong competition terms.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in the case of electricity, transmission system operators have formed an association and it was with the help of this association that results were achieved in Florence. We call on the Commission to use its influence and to take its own action to form a similar association for gas transmission system operators so that results similar to those achieved in Florence can be achieved in Madrid in the parallel process for the gas sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Since the first directive on its liberalisation was adopted in 1996, and the second in 1998, there has been a significant fall in prices, especially in the countries in which those directives have been most strictly applied.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the Commission, and with the rapporteur, on the need for liberalisation to be speeded up, so that the Community can fully benefit from a dynamic and competitive market.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, despite the fact that the current regulations lay down the essential principles on the conditions, methods and pace of liberalisation, there are certain extremely important aspects which must be dealt with by means of additional measures and specific solutions. I am talking about the management of congestion, the cross-boundary aspects and the existing bottlenecks in the European transport networks, which hinder the balanced distribution of the benefits of these measures, which may facilitate the creation of a single market at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, there is still the practice of discriminatory prices for transfer between the Member States and the monopolies which own the networks, which hinders the genuine liberalisation of the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that these practices, as well as the possible substitution of the well-known national monopolies by a European oligopoly, should be combated relentlessly by the services which come under the responsibility of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Although this issue is of concern to us and deserves much consideration, I would like to end by supporting the balanced report of the rapporteur and highlighting the need to realise the expectations of our citizens as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Energy, of course, is not just any good or service. It is very basic and very essential and has to be treated differently from normal goods.</p>
<p class="contents">The two directives were very carefully calculated to ensure that there would not be huge and sudden job losses – approximately 250,000 jobs have been lost in this sector, with more to come – and secondly to allow those Member States which had invested heavily in, for example, nuclear energy to do some strategic planning and not leave them with too much in the way of stranded costs. For that reason they were not full speed ahead directives. Nevertheless they should have been implemented on time by every Member State and they were not. Those which delayed were wrong, especially those which at the same time took advantage of the opening of markets elsewhere and we have evidence that this also applies to countries outside the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I have said that the job losses were very considerable. There has also been a great deal of upheaval and restructuring and some evidence of the formation of new monopolies, something which must be combated. There has been a diminution in the amount of research and development and that is a shame. There is a lack of harmonization to date and Mr Mombaur is quite right to call for harmonization. I am fairly sceptical about allowing the regulators to do that through the Florence work.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of public service obligations is mentioned several times in the report. The Socialist Group has put forward an amendment asking for a framework directive ensuring that in sectors like energy services of general interest are protected. I hope that will be supported.</p>
<p class="contents">Although there are difficulties with the two directives and liberalization, it is part of creating Europe and lower prices do benefit people. However there are environmental implications which we have not taken very seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon Council asked the Commission to look at the possible need for an acceleration. I do not agree, however, with preaching to Member States and telling them what they should be doing. It is up to them to decide. I am very anxious that renewable energy is supported in a liberalised market. That is not easy to do and it is something the Parliament holds dear. I am very concerned about the threat to combined heat and power in the gas directive. That needs to be rectified very quickly.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Two major factors can be identified with regard to the liberalisation process of the energy market. First of all, the liberalisation process does not proceed at the same pace in all the Member States and secondly, there is also a difference in timing within the respective Member States. Moreover, it is also worth emphasising that the way energy markets are opened up depends greatly on the geographic location of the Member State in question. For the reasons set out above, it would be preferable to adopt a pragmatic rather than a theoretical approach. The pragmatic approach is also the way forward if we want to achieve Member-State-specific liberalisation, for, in our opinion, we should not speed up the directive’s implementation but rather carry it out gradually. </p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, it is important for the amendment tabled by our group to be approved within the Commission. This aims to force Member States to set up independent regulatory bodies that will be authorised to encourage full competition. The same amendment also aims to promote the interests of the consumers within the liberalised energy market by guaranteeing universal service provision. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to emphasise that our proposal on laying down a detailed schedule, in the course of which clearly defined goals would need to be accomplished, is important if we are eventually to achieve gradual, yet full, liberalisation of the energy market. Acceptance of this proposal within the plenary will put a stop to unfair competition which is currently affecting the electricity market and which is caused by liberalisation being applied in different ways within the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would also like to emphasise that the concept of public service and of the public good must go hand-in-hand with liberalization. I am referring to social and environmental concerns which this Parliament has always supported but which are not yet sufficiently articulated in the energy sector with reference to the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">It is particularly regrettable that liberalization has gone hand-in-hand with a negative impact on energy saving. This is something that we all pay a great deal of lip service to but we are in practice regressing, we are going backwards on energy-saving. We must meet our Kyoto commitments: we have international treaties and obligations under them and it is time that we took this more seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome proposals for network access for renewable energies. Subsidies for traditional forms of energies have been intense and are partly responsible for limited progress on renewables. It would be very regrettable if Japan, for example, were to surpass us in the new technologies which we have developed and researched over many years. This is currently something that we should be concerned about. If we support network access for renewables in Europe, we should not find ourselves in this position.</p>
<p class="contents">Liberalization should apply to all energy sectors, particularly the nuclear sector where there are huge subsidies from some states. Yet the Commission is not tackling this head on. Perhaps it is afraid. I have discussed this with Commissioner Monti. He is a powerful Commissioner and even he is unwilling to tackle some of the Member States head on in this regard. But it is a level playing field, fair is fair, and the nuclear sectors cannot be subsidised.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally on the Florence process, we must involve the Parliament and we must have some democratic involvement in this process. We cannot just let it remain outside Parliamentary control although it has been useful in some respects.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yes, I am aware of the few positive developments in European energy policy. Without doubt, electricity prices have fallen. However, the fact that the prices of some other forms of energy have spiralled is passed over in modest silence. Such facts do not fit in with liberalisation mania.</p>
<p class="contents">On balance, I feel that a number of very serious problems and misdirected developments in EU energy policy have not been addressed. First, I would like a discussion on the current, completely non-liberal practice already referred to of massively subsidising nuclear and fossil-fuel energy in their many and varied forms. Secondly, the EU directive on the internal electricity market must be supplemented by an EU-wide supply directive which promotes an ecological and decentralised energy economy. Thirdly, a radical rethink of the EU's promotion policy is also needed so as to promote energy savings from renewable sources of energy and regionalised energy policies, rather than the construction of high-voltage lines for a centralised energy economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, I should like to warn against subverting local energy operations by liberalising right across the EU, as we are doing at present. Economic aspects and the democratic strength and power of local energy authorities to act, socially and otherwise, are at stake here and must not be sacrificed to liberalisation at any price. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a very balanced piece of work covering quite a wide range of views.</p>
<p class="contents">We should point to progress made so far in liberalising the electricity and the gas markets, in particular opening up electricity to more than 60% of the market so far, while also remembering that we need to keep up the pressure for more progress.</p>
<p class="contents">It is hard to over-estimate the importance of this process to the competitiveness of our European economies in the widest sense. I know that in the short term it may be difficult to prove that but I am quite sure that in the long term this is a vital part of making our economies competitive in the wider world. I also believe that it is very important for us to distinguish between the processes of market efficiency that liberalization implies and other policy objectives that we may wish to achieve, such as the question of universal supply, such as the aims to reduce CO2 and it is very important to keep those two distinct and separate.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that I share the regret of some colleagues that some countries have been rather backward in implementing these measures and it is ironic that at least one of those countries is that which seeks to accelerate the pace of integration in Europe. St Augustine 'make me more liberalised but not quite yet'.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to recognise that the fears of the pessimists that liberalization would lead to cuts in security of supply have been confounded. Private sector provision has delivered the goods.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At this hour in the day and stage in the debate, I think it preferable and far more useful to get straight to the point with what I have to say. Personally, when I think in terms of ‘energy’ I think of security of supply in the long term, the guarantee of public service missions and the contribution to sustainable and environmentally friendly development. If I can, in addition, think in terms of competitiveness, then I certainly take the opportunity to do so, though, I have to admit, it is not my highest priority.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why ladies and gentlemen, I do not agree with the rapporteur’s conclusions, or the vision and proposals put forward by Commissioner Bolkestein in ‘Frontier-Free Europe’. Those who are not in favour of accelerating the liberalisation of public utilities are not old fashioned. Those who defend public service do not use fear as an argument to defend their values, and those who are in favour of a universal service are not nostalgic, nervous nationalists, but Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Mombaur, unlike you, I do not have blind and absolute confidence in market mechanisms. I do not favour price reduction over security. I defend employment first and foremost and what is more, I never lose sight of the fact that public services constitute a unifying element and an element of the European social model that is so dear to your friend Mr Jacques Chirac. They are of course, also a prerequisite for balanced regional planning whose failure or inexistence would cost far more than the savings you hope to achieve. </p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore have liked your report to have taken account of the Treaty provisions relating to general interest services and to have included proposals for measures designed to guarantee citizens’ access to public services in energy. This is because, and this is something I should like to stress, public service in energy is a factor in social cohesion, the fight against exclusion, balanced regional development, respect for the environment, security and lastly a prerequisite for national and European independence. </p>
<p class="contents">Rapporteur, I cannot deny that you have worked hard on this and even congratulate you on your efforts, but I cannot subscribe to the ideology that underpins your proposals. I hope that the amendments tabled by Mr Harlem Desir and other Members that also share my concerns will be adopted because I personally am not in a position to vote in favour of your report as it stands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, the value of strong regulatory authorities. It is quite clear from the experience in the fifteen still separate markets that strong regulatory bodies help market access for smaller players, protect the interests of consumers and force the pace of large monopoly-providers which might otherwise feel free to take a more leisurely pace. Secondly, the value of a timetable. It was a pity that the Lisbon conclusions did not call for a timetable. Experience in other areas such as telecom shows that Member States respond better to this incentive and I hope that the Commission will elaborate a specific timetable for liberalization in the months to come.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to justify this strategy of the full liberalisation of the electricity and gas markets, the report sings the praises of the supposed positive effects of competition, namely, reduced production costs, increased job opportunities and even goes as far as to praise its positive macroeconomic effects on the job market. By what mechanism does he hope this will be achieved, or rather by what mysterious means? </p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the liberalisation that has been carried out to date or is in progress has not generated employment and, in some public utilities, personnel levels have even dropped as a result. According to the trade unions in the ETUC, 300 000 jobs have already been lost and a further 200 000 are threatened. Everywhere you look employees rights are under threat. </p>
<p class="contents">I take issue with another assertion made in the report concerning the reduction in energy prices. Who will benefit from this and how exactly? It is commonly known that tariff reductions all too often only benefit large industrial users. As far as ordinary users are concerned, gas and electricity have become goods that one can either afford or not. Will users in the not too distant future be asked to pay for their electricity in advance, as is the case in Great Britain, and be forced to go without when their card runs out? </p>
<p class="contents">Energy is a basic need. Access to it must therefore be considered a fundamental right. In our view, only genuine public and democratic regulation would make it possible to rationalise both the production and use of energy while ensuring respect for the environment and basic equalisation. This would constitute the first step towards a European public service that met the needs of today’s users and employees. However, such concerns seem far removed from this report, which is why I cannot vote in favour of it as it stands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And having heard the contributions made today by the honourable members, we really can say that the liberalisation of the energy markets has progressed faster and more efficiently than we expected in the last parliamentary term. That is the first thing. Mr Caudron, it is no longer possible to reverse this and that is how it should be.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the energy liberalisation sceptics have been impressively routed. The prices of gas and electricity have sunk as the result of competition, Mrs Vachetta, including to consumers. You insist on portraying the large undertakings as the winners here, but you are completely wrong, that is rubbish. Security of supply to consumers and to the economy has been maintained and the competitiveness of jobs has improved considerably, not deteriorated. It has improved thanks to international competition.</p>
<p class="contents">We still have a whole series of problems to solve. Too little headway has been made liberalising the markets in individual Member States but we assume that the French presidency will make further progress here. Secondly, liberalisation must be controlled by the competition authorities and we have a European institution that can and does do that; otherwise private monopolies will replace state monopolies. Mr Mombaur pointed that out just now.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we need the strict division between energy generation and grid management. Even the problem of charges and access conditions are, in my view, better solved by a regulatory authority than in voluntary agreements between major associations. Fourthly, regulated grid access with set prices, following the telecommunications example, is the best way of ensuring that small and medium-sized companies and smaller works departments receive equal treatment. Both mergers and state aid must be controlled and approved in the future. Professor Monti has announced this. I think that this is right in principle, but I think that his deadline of five years is too soon and I think that we need to extend the deadline to ten years, so that European industry has time to develop fully and invest with good prospects in this important future market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not think that it, in fact, is. There must be some purpose to liberalisation, be it lower prices, security of supplies, increased competitiveness or sustainable technological development. Proceeding from that point of view and inspired, in fact, by the EU directives, we in Denmark have begun a complete liberalisation of the electricity sector. This entails major upheavals which are causing concern among employees. When you talk with them about liberalisation, they say, ‘We are happy to have liberalisation, but it should be the same for everyone in Europe.’ That is just the problem with this issue. We have obtained liberalisation in 15 different markets and15 different countries, but we have not in that way obtained complete liberalisation. It may perhaps be concluded that what we have obtained is liberalisation for liberalisation’s sake. Employees in the sector shake their heads, and ordinary consumers do not obtain the intended benefits of liberalisation. It is therefore right to continue with the liberalisation that is under way and implement complete liberalisation. Of course we should have liberalisation, but it should be on equal terms. At the same time, it is important to remember that liberalisation ought not to be carried out in isolation. In future work on liberalising the energy market, we shall make sure that energy policy as a whole is involved. There is a wide range of considerations to be taken into account. I am thinking here of consumers, the environment, competitiveness, renewable energy sources and the employees. There are a good many more agendas we need to engage with, and not only that of complete liberalisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The liberalisation of the energy markets is the only real way to safeguard consumers’ rights and the credible viability of the Internal Market. The Commission must take care that the energy market is opened up in a genuine sense and in a spirit of fair play. Various apparent barriers to competition, such as the bottlenecks created by the power grid operators, must be straightened out without delay. In addition, the largest European “energy players” must fall into line. For example, France, whose energy sector is among the most progressive, stubbornly protects its own markets. What does such a competitive country have to fear in conditions of free competition?</p>
<p class="contents">The liberalisation of energy markets also means that the Commission will have to approach various forms of energy on an equal footing. I cannot help wondering about the statements made by the energy Commissioner, Mrs de Palacio, which suggested that free-flowing water would not be on the list of renewable energy sources. The Commission must reconsider its position. Hydroelectric power in the Nordic countries is an environmentally friendly and natural energy source that can often be produced at a competitive price, as is the case at present, thanks to a good water supply. Hydroelectric energy can currently compete at a price that would even rival imported energy from Eastern Europe and Russia, so there is no call to label future imports of electric power from the east to the Nordic countries, at least, as dumping.</p>
<p class="contents">Protectionism among the big energy players in Central Europe is the main reason why cheap hydroelectric power is only getting to the Central European markets with difficulty. Certification systems will guarantee that consumer choice is in direct relation to the pricing of electricity.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The liberalisation of energy markets is an essential factor in the development of the economy. The objective of improving competition and lowering prices for all consumer groups, including the end consumer, must be pursued assiduously. The opening up of the market will lead to reorganisation on a European scale with common rules for all the countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Commission will submit comprehensive proposals to overcome the existing barriers to intraCommunity trade and ad hoc measures to deal with the Member States which do not apply the directives. We need to speed up the process of liberalisation in the energy and gas sectors by harmonising the Member States’ energy policies. To support the liberalisation process it will be necessary to introduce a benchmarking process, as we have done in other sectors, with the publishing of a Commission half-yearly report on the final price of European Union gas and electricity. This will allow us to assess the impact of liberalising the energy markets on the consumer directly. Guidelines will also have to be drawn up for harmonising the price observation criteria and processing the data gathered so as to ensure that maximum care is taken in comparing the situations of the different Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would support the rapporteur in stressing that competition does not prevent Member States from imposing public service obligations in the general interest on operators. Moreover, I would remind you that liberalisation does not just mean privatisation, where a company continues, in practice, to be managed in the same way as before: liberalisation must mean opening up, interchange and competitiveness. I do not consider that liberalisation will have negative implications for employment, for the lower cost of energy will allow companies more room for development and create a greater number of jobs than are lost with the end of the monopolies.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It also highlights some of the key facts in this matter, two of which I shall mention here. First, the Treaties provide for the creation of an internal market in the energy sector, which must be accomplished. Second, the achievement of this aim undoubtedly involves opening up the markets to competition, the process of liberalisation and division into separate activities relating to energy transmission, production and distribution.</p>
<p class="contents">As the French Presidency gets underway, it must be noted – and as a French MEP this is not something I am terribly proud of – that France has taken a long time to transpose several European directives into its national law. In fact, it appears that France comes bottom of the class as far as this matter is concerned. The European directive on electricity was therefore adopted rather late by my country and only in its most basic form. More generally speaking, I, like the rapporteur, deplore the fact that there are other countries that wish to implement the directive only in its most basic form. And yet, as has already been mentioned –and I too should like to reiterate the point – full liberalisation, as carried out by other States in the area of electricity, has produced considerable benefits for the user: need we be reminded of the 25-33% price reduction in the United Kingdom or the almost 35% drop in Germany? This is why I believe that we should support the Commission in its undertakings and, as Mr Mombaur’s report suggests, set a specific binding timetable for carrying out the full liberalisation of the energy markets in the applicant countries and of course, first and foremost in the Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">The ambition shown by the latest presidency of the Union for the advancement of Europe cannot simply stop at the defence of acquired or past situations. The completion of the internal market cannot be restricted to the European Union alone, which is why it cannot be put off indefinitely. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Mombaur on his report, which I believe broadly coincides with the Commission’s position. Secondly, I would like to thank all the speakers, although I do not agree with everything that has been said.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, I would like to point out that I agree with Mr Mombaur when he says that the liberalisation of the electrical sector has led to a drop in prices, improvements for customers, for homes and also for large industry, which means job creation, increased competitivity of the European electrical industry, development and work, although it is true that some jobs have been lost in the electrical industry. However, the benefits have outweighed the problems encountered.</p>
<p class="contents">It should also be pointed out that the Lisbon and Feira Summits have reiterated the need to move ahead with liberalisations. As regards what some have said, it is true that there is no timetable. This does not mean that there is not a strong will to move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, the progress made so far – which is very considerable – still seems to me to be insufficient. We must not create fifteen separate liberalised markets, but one single European liberalised market. To this end, there are still issues to be dealt with, such as the level of openness of the market, the separation of the operators of transmission networks from the production systems, the guarantee of non-discriminatory access in the application of prices. In this context, I would like to thank Mr Mombaur for his resolution’s support for the importance of the separation of producers and operators of transmission networks.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the efforts of the Florence Forum are invaluable and we must continue along that route. If they turn out to be insufficient, they will be supplemented with Commission initiatives. In that respect, there is a will to seek an establishment of tariffs which will lead to an increase in exchanges and clear access to the network.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also point out that the Florence Forum – with regard to electricity – must be supplemented by the Madrid Forum on gas. Both of these reflect an original institutional approach, since representatives of Parliament participate in them.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a physical aspect, the capacity for interconnection, which must also be developed and which currently lead to limitations in the development of this single market, both in the electrical sector and in the gas sector.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to continue to make progress with liberalisation, we cannot forget one key element: the public service role of electricity – and gas as well, although on a different level. This means that the supply must be guaranteed – as some of you have said – and there must be an adequate service for all citizens. This aspect will be included in the initiatives which I propose to present to the Council and Parliament at the end of this year, so that they may be ready in the Spring, for the European Council, in order to provide more impetus for liberalisation in the areas I have mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to say that the aspects relating to safety standards must also be developed soon and I am going to propose to Parliament and the Council that we hold a debate, not on the nuclear sector, nor on the coal or renewable energy sector, but on the guarantees of the European Union’s energy supply as a whole, when we will be able to consider the different sources of energy and the problems relating to each of them, because nothing is free, everything has its price, its pros and cons. We need to hold a reasoned debate on the possibilities available to us, in terms of sources and the guarantees of supply, in the light of the Kyoto commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider water to be a form of renewable energy, of course. Hydro-electricity is a form of renewable energy. The problem is that the hydro-electrical industry as a whole is not taken into account when it comes to subsidies, which are another issue. We believe that we have to support renewable energy sources as much as possible. This is an extremely important European technology, with industrial possibilities beyond our European borders, which we must continue to support. The Directive excludes hydroelectricity from the consideration of subsidies, which means that it is not sustainable. We must continue to include it within the broad consideration of renewable energy resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I do not have time to expand further. I would like to thank Mr Mombaur once again for his magnificent report and point out that we are going to present proposals in order to continue the progress in the field of liberalisation. We are going to deal with the social aspects of the electricity sector and its public service element. The assessment is frankly positive and we must continue to make progress in accordance with what the Council has told us, at both the Lisbon and the Feira Summits. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
