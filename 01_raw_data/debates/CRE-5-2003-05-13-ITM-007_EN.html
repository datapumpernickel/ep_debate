<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gill (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. –<span class="bold"> </span>Mr President, I wish to begin by taking this opportunity to welcome the observers. I am delighted to see them here in Strasbourg. We have spent many meetings discussing the arrival of observers in the Committee on Budgets. It is good to have them here to be able to listen to this important debate. This is one of the first issues in budgetary terms to affect them directly. I would also like to thank all my colleagues and the budget secretariat for their work and cooperation in producing these estimates.</p>
<p class="contents">2004 is an 'E-year': it is a year of enlargement, an electoral year and, if the 1999 election results are anything to go by, the end-of-term year for over 56% of Members. All these factors will have significant political, structural and budgetary implications. Thus these estimates for 2004 involve some profound changes that make budgetary planning a little more challenging.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the challenges posed by enlargement and the elections, Parliament will also face considerable changes in 2004, such as the possible adoption of the Statute for Members, the increase in the total number of Members, the revision of staff regulations and a reform of its administrative structure with a view to improving service to Members. The precise budgetary implications of some of these changes are not yet determined and, therefore, are not fully incorporated into these estimates and will have to be taken into consideration during the first reading of the 2004 budget in the autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to expand on some of the issues I have just touched on. Firstly, the Statute for Members: I very much hope that we will have a Statute for Members in effect next year. The lack of transparency in the travel regime and the general allowance regime does more to undermine the credibility of this House than any other factor. Therefore, I would urge this Parliament to do its level best to ensure that the appropriations put in reserve are actually utilised for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst I am on perks and privileges, I would like to refer to the amendment by the PPE-DE Group on the extension of the health insurance scheme to former Members. I am astonished that the right-wing British Conservatives have tabled this. They always claim that they are the champions of the fight against the gravy train and here they are, in complete contradiction, asking for an extension of the scheme, which is totally unjustifiable, which will only benefit a few Members at enormous cost to the taxpayer, and which will be extremely difficult to administer. What is even more disappointing is that the Quaestors have sent an e-mail to all Members urging them to vote for this. It is an absolute disgrace. I do not know how Mr Balfe and others can justify this particular expenditure to their constituents. The Bureau has had serious reservations about this, has not entered any funding for this and, owing to legal reasons, has referred it back.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also important budgetary considerations. We cannot simply look at the immediate impact of such a measure, but need to examine what this could cost in the long run. It could be very expensive. It is not just the question of the wisdom of agreeing a special deal for the outgoing Members of this Parliament that could be open to all sorts of legal challenges from every other former Member, but it is also morally wrong for us to go down this route. Therefore, I am advising this House to vote against paragraph 3 in my report, or to support the amendment tabled by the Verts/ALE Group. Let us not fool ourselves. These two issues are not just technical internal matters; they will run and run in the press of many countries leading up not just to next year's election but for many years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">Next year's election – apart from a huge turnover of Members in this House, combined with the increase in its membership by a fifth – will be one of the biggest transitions in the history of this Parliament. Whilst we have made preparations in our physical environment and our linguistic regime, in the hemicycles and so on, we have not adequately addressed many very important issues concerning information, communication and IT strategies. We need to ensure that we counter the democratic deficit argument in terms of our say in legislation. Therefore, for us, the electoral turnout is of paramount importance.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to do more to make the citizens aware of Parliament's work, to increase their interest in our work and to ensure greater participation. For me, information policy is of key importance. I know that the Bureau has now adopted a report of activities with a view to the European elections. However, this lacks ambition and innovation. Clear strategies and plans need to be in place now if they are to have any effect. This is not just Parliament's role.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to tell the Commission frankly that I have been disappointed with the lack of progress the Interinstitutional Working Group has made. It has failed to get our key priorities and messages across to the citizen. The Commission and the Member States have let us down. I urge them to act together and make greater progress in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst one of our main objectives in the last few years has been to get closer to the citizen, our technology is still somewhere in the 20th century. We appear to have a very slow, tortoise-like evolution in our information and communication policy, whilst our costs are haring away. Given that IT expenditure in Parliament is one of the highest compared with other institutions, I would like an explanation as to why the Europarl site is not state-of-the-art or very user-friendly, and why we have limited access to technology and video-compositing facilities. Where has this money gone?</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I am pleased to note that we are finally making progress in Internet broadcasting. I believe that our proceedings in this Chamber today are being broadcast live. We have temporary multilingual information panels across Parliament's building here. This is an important step forward on the eve of enlargement next May. However, concerning other issues, such as canteens, the environment in Brussels, accessibility of the buildings and the car service, we need to be a lot more ambitious.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of all of this, I welcome the efforts by the administration and the Bureau to modernise not just Parliament's staff policy but the way we deal with staffing matters. We need to move from a pure administration aspect of staff matters to a more modern, strategic and forward-looking staff management and also recognise that information technology has changed the way we work and look at our administration.</p>
<p class="contents">Although this will not have a major impact on the 2004 budget, I would like to invite the Secretary-General to continue to pursue his efforts in this area. I know there are some very difficult decisions that will have an impact on establishment plans, but it is important that we continue to evolve and look at the best way we can use our human resources.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to budgetary rigour. If this is to have real meaning, we have to have more rationalisation and leaner management structures and grasp the nettle of multilingualism to improve efficiency across a number of areas. Parliament must continue to apply this policy and provide the best value for money for the European taxpayer as well as to continue to make the best use of available resources in the current budget. We can only convince people externally that we are applying budgetary rigour if we can demonstrate it internally. We can achieve this through improved presentation and transparency of the budget. Yet there is very little evidence that a number of our requests have been taken seriously. We have a classic situation here where ideas are crushed not by suppressing them but by ignoring them.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two main areas I want to touch on briefly: we need to improve the presentation and accountability of the budget in every area, and that applies equally to the political groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, before we begin the vote I will announce a technical adjustment, namely the fact that we have reached an agreement with the Council on the adjustment of the financial perspective. There is no need for this phrase in the text any more. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With enlargement we have to be most careful that we use money to the best advantage, right across the board. I would like to go through one or two detailed matters before I tackle the issue of health insurance.</p>
<p class="contents">The car service is often abused and we have to make sure that it is very carefully controlled indeed. Concerning languages, technology and the Internet, we need to expand the services to ensure that we are ever more efficient and put our money to the best use at all times. Regarding staffing, we have already helped, as far as the PPE-DE is concerned, to trim down some of the expectations. This relates to assistants to the vice-presidents, where there was going to be considerable extra cost amounting to several hundreds of thousands of euros. We are making sure that whilst there will be upgradings in line with the promotion aspects of the service commitments, we will not be allowing the fast-tracking that was destined to lead to this enormous extra cost in the coming year or two.</p>
<p class="contents">We will also be making sure that there are no assistants helping out committee chairmen. We see no need for that. We will also be very carefully monitoring the number of assistants helping out Quaestors.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make sure that Amendment No 7 is adopted. This repairs some damage that was done in the earlier versions of this report by Neena Gill. It concerns the Association of Former Members. They have produced all the necessary reports, but they have to have meetings in June, which does not tie in with our budget calendar. It is no place of ours to criticise them and therefore I hope that we can pass Amendment No 7, which welcomes the decision of the Bureau, concerning the costs of meetings of this association. It is doing an excellent job in keeping former Members informed.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn now to the contentious matter raised and the reference to the Greens' amendment on health insurance. If we as Parliamentarians do not safeguard against illness of our Members, I do not believe we are doing our duty. We must ensure that the onerous duties placed on us of travelling extensively, lengthy debates and discussions and busy programmes in our regions and our countries throughout the European Union are reflected in a proper health insurance which is up and running and cost effective. I would like to read clause 3 in full, to show that this is not a final decision, but simply open-mindedness with a view to keeping this matter under review.</p>
<p class="contents">I quote: '…is willing to consider entering appropriations for the extension of the current health insurance scheme to former Members and looks forward to detailed proposals being submitted in due course.'</p>
<p class="contents">I would emphasise also that if the MEP Statute comes in, as mentioned earlier, this would probably be embraced within it. The final decision is one for the Bureau of this Parliament. All I am saying is that we, as the Committee on Budgets, should take the necessary steps to ensure that we have some allowance and that we will consider the figures in the next few months.</p>

<p class="contents">It is difficult to make estimates because parliamentary elections are to be held during the year and the EU will enlarge. In general, with parliamentary elections half the Members change, and next time it will perhaps be more, as the old Member States will have 56 fewer seats. At the same time we will have 162 new Members from the new Member States. Both these factors will increase Parliament’s expenditure, and at the same time they cause uncertainty with respect to estimates.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim is to keep Parliament’s share of administrative expenditure below 20%. The target is an ambitious one because a further EUR 46 million is to be budgeted for the Statute of Members. This expenditure item is new. For that reason exceeding the ceiling by this amount may be justified because it would not actually alter the old way costs are distributed between the EU and the Member States, as the Member States have been responsible for salaries up till now.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur is trying to improve services to Members in core activities, which is to say those duties that relate to legislation and the budget. The focus is the right one. Likewise, the rapporteur is calling for improved planning of meetings to avoid overlapping. This would cut costs, for example, through a simultaneous reduction in the number of interpreters needed, which would make interpreting arrangements for the new Member States easier in particular. At the same time that would allow Members to participate more in the work of all their committees. For that reason, the appropriateness of the constituency weeks must be assessed more precisely in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, however, we have to view new benefits for Members with some reservations. For example, there will be no possibility of expanding transport services, not at least before we have some definitive experience of the other new areas of expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">Extending the health insurance scheme to apply to former Members does not seem justified and my group is not in favour of this. Each Member State has been responsible for its previous Members’ social security matters when salaries have been paid. If Parliament applies the health insurance scheme to the current Members it is only reasonable, as they work outside their own countries and it counts as occupational health care. This argument does not apply to former Members, however, and it would be just another, somewhat covert, privilege.</p>
<p class="contents">Multilingualism will increase in Parliament, as the number of official languages will grow from 11 to 20. This means that the practice of using two separate interpreters to translate what someone is saying will increase. We should investigate whether we could impose special obligations to translate many languages directly into the ‘big’ languages, such as English, French and German, in which case most of the Members of Parliament would be able to listen to a speech that has been translated by just one interpreter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has made it the essence of her work to give the taxpayer value for money and I would very much like to support her in this.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most controversial points, as is evident from this debate, is health care costs. I am really hoping to be able to persuade Mr Dover not to extend the health insurance scheme to former Members. What is so wrong with it? The costs may and Mrs Gill has already gone into detail on this point be limited now, but over the years these costs will of course increase enormously. But then that is the financial side of the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">There is however also a matter of principle to consider, one that Mr Virrankoski has already touched upon. Until we have a Statute for Members, Members of the European Parliament will continue receiving the same salary as the Members of Parliament in their country of origin. The Court of Justice has decided that pensions and health insurance all fall under the heading of salary. I am not even in agreement with the present Members of Parliament receiving this health insurance because I think that it is a bonus on top of salary. But now to extend this bonus is really unacceptable, it is simply old-fashioned grubbing about in the European cashbox and that we must not do. Once we have a European Statute, it will be a different matter and then we can talk about it again. Until that time there is simply no question of us being able to assent to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, since we are talking of waste, the city of Strasbourg suddenly comes to mind. Which brings me to the fact that last time, during the voting on the calendar of meetings, we took the democratic decision in this place that next year there will be only 10 sessions in Strasbourg. Now I know perfectly well that a whole box of tricks is going to be opened up to ensure that it will again be 11 or 12, but this democratic decision that only 10 sessions have been scheduled continues to exist until that time. I therefore propose that tomorrow the President or the rapporteur actually corrects recital G. It must be stated under G that next year there are not 11 sessions scheduled here in Strasbourg but 10, as decided by this plenary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are delighted to have them here, to complete what has been a lengthy, at times difficult process, but at the end of which, I am glad to say, the desired result has been fully achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">The preliminary draft budget presented today by the Commission is, by force of circumstances, an atypical draft, in that it is to be considered to be in two separate parts. The first part will enter into force for the current 15 Member States on 1 January 2004. The second part, however, will apply to the Union of 25 and will enter into force as of 1 May 2004. Assessing it is therefore not an easy task, and there are some political aspects which, in my opinion, must not be underestimated: first and foremost, the age-old question of payment appropriations. At EUR 100.6 billion, the volume of expenditure has been increased by hardly 3.3% of the 2003 figure; moreover, the 2003 budget related solely to the Europe of 15. This extremely small increase is explained by a reduction of approximately 2% in the volume of expenditure laid down for the European Union of 15.</p>
<p class="contents">All this is absurd. Indeed, not only does the Commission not intend, once and for all, to concentrate on resolving the problem of the RALs, which has been one of Parliament’s priorities for years, but, what is more, it is presenting a draft which will lead to exactly the same situation being repeated with regard to the countries joining the Union as of 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the question of heading 3. The increase in the ceiling, obtained by Parliament, is a significant result, which will allow us to finance some particularly sensitive policies with an easy mind, but I still feel it is not sufficient. If we genuinely want a political Union, a direction for all the political groupings present in the Chamber – which we can all endeavour to follow – then we must also give them the working tools they need, the instruments necessary to achieve our goals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We warmly endorse the plea for strict budgetary discipline by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the forthcoming enlargement, Parliament will have to apply itself to its core activities more than ever. The primary task of this House, the supervision of the European Commission, must have priority, in addition to the responsibility for legislation in which the Parliament has the power of codecision. Reports and resolutions falling outside this scope should take up less agenda time and staff effort.</p>
<p class="contents">An important theme in this report is Parliament’s multilingualism. Diversity as an essential characteristic of European cultures finds expression in the existence of many languages. The accessibility and comprehensibility of European political debate for citizens from all the Member States is crucial for the quality of the democracy. Of course this does not affect the fact that we look critically at the expenditure for multilingualism. The Bureau of this Parliament should verify whether the scale of the translation and interpreting service for each language is indeed tailored to actual need. The workload for each language must be divided proportionally. I have the impression that it varies somewhat from one language to another and is certainly not proportional to the number of Members who speak a language. I understand for example that the degree of use of Dutch and Italian in this House is of the same order of magnitude. Any overcapacity must be scrapped or redistributed.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point, Mr President, is the very high average salary level of officials working for Parliament. The payment system conceals elements that for the most part stem from the early days and that are now no longer valid. The salaries of official staff should bear a reasonable relationship to the payments that the Members of Parliament receive, on which point I have to note that there is still no sign of the Statute for Members – a disgrace, for both the Council and the Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Closely tied up with this are travelling expenses, a topic in which voters have considerable interest. The importance of tighter criteria that are as objective as possible for allowances is evident. In view of the experiences in the current session, this House must make a critical review of the weeks in Strasbourg, which must, among other things, consider the additional costs involved with no additional results in return. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I fully agree with the majority of her views and proposals concerning this intermediary stage of the parliamentary budget. I would congratulate her in particular on having wanted to emphasise most firmly her wish to see increased use of new technologies in our institution, as well as in the institutions in general, in particular with a view to enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Gill, my dear friends here today, I strongly recommend that, tomorrow, we adopt the amendment concerning precisely these new technologies, which we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance tabled together with Mrs Buitenweg and which was adopted by a narrow majority in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">What does it involve? Our institution respects the principle of public debate. Moreover, the House is half-full today. We are pleased about this, as we feel less alone, but there are 150, maybe 200 people here, whereas an enlarged Europe will comprise between 300 and 350 million inhabitants. The Internet is a wonderful tool that is available to us. It is not an information tool in the strictest sense of the word, it is not for advertising, but it is a working tool for those who are interested.</p>
<p class="contents">Even today – we did not know this, Mrs Gill – Parliament is broadcasting our plenary session on the Internet. What are we asking? We, like you, are asking for the use of new technologies, including the Internet, to be encouraged, in order to allow each and every citizen to follow our plenary session from their own homes should they wish to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Why should our Parliamentary committees not also do this? Some have an interest in our debates on the environment. This way, they will be able to follow them. It is not very expensive. You have already expressed your desire to set a fixed sum for the 2004 budget. We call, by means of this amendment, for Parliament, from this year on, to be able to carry out tests to determine the cost – which we believe to be very low (other parliaments are already doing this) – of broadcasting committee meetings, not, I would emphasise, on topical subjects of major importance, but, I reiterate, on our daily work. In universities and other environments, there are always people who have an interest in all our debates, whatever the subject. That is the recommendation I would make to you for tomorrow, and I congratulate Mrs Gill once again on her report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been major, important and time-consuming work, because we in actual fact have demanding and important tasks ahead of us. During my time as budget rapporteur a year ago, I observed that we were in practice concerned with three priorities. The first of these was the preparations for the forthcoming enlargement, which was less certain then than it is now. The second was necessary institutional reforms. These reforms are just as important now as they were then. The third priority was to deal with all these matters within the budgetary framework.</p>
<p class="contents">A year ago, we gave Parliament and other institutions the ability to engage in the long-term financial management of these matters, especially by means of the frontloading carried out during the autumn of last year. The priorities were then to be converted into figures and the calculations into euros and cents. The situation is now exactly the same a year later.</p>
<p class="contents">When, last December, the Copenhagen European Council decided to adopt a big bang approach, there were no doubt many of us who thought that this was one of the finest moments of all in the entire history of the EU, with a further ten countries in line to become members in time for the next elections to the European Parliament in 2004. This was subsequently followed up by decisions here in Parliament on 9 April, the signing of the accession treaties in Athens a week later and a number of successful referendums, most recently in Lithuania, something that imposes extraordinarily large demands, especially upon Europe’s elected parliaments. We have no greater challenge than this. We have just had the great pleasure of welcoming 162 observers from all those candidate countries that have carried out their negotiations successfully. All this is taking place in accordance with the timetable we discussed a year ago.</p>
<p class="contents">That the EU and the European Parliament must put these things into effect is, of course, self-evident to all of us who see the reunification of Europe as the most important task of all. This applies especially, of course, to the present generation of politicians. There were therefore no great difficulties in supporting the majority of the proposals tabled by Mrs Gill. I have just one thing to say by way of warning: it is our priorities with which we must be concerned. We sometimes see a tendency on the part of rapporteurs, as well as on the part of other MEPs, also to want to smuggle in other aspects. This leads to a risk of the budget’s possibly becoming difficult to manage within the framework set. It is in this situation that both budgetary authorities need to be firm and decisive. I at least hope that Parliament and the Council will reach common, early agreement this year, in the same way that we did a year ago. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Those who seek re-election will no doubt be seeking to justify themselves on the basis of their record and new entrants will be of course arguing that they are better alternatives. Looking at this report, the phrase that stands out is 'best value for money'. How many prospective MEPs will be standing on this ticket? As a rule of thumb we calculate that each British MEP costs UK taxpayers about £1.2 million annually – that is of course pounds sterling – or just short of £100 million a year for them all.</p>
<p class="contents">When one considers value for money, however, this must be considered not only in relative terms, i.e. whether one or another MEP provides more value than the other, but in comparative terms, in comparison with what else could be bought. Given the great concern in the UK about health services, one comparison might be with the cost of health provision. For the price of our national representation we could afford to provide and equip and service a major teaching hospital – with some change left over. Another interesting comparison is that the money British taxpayers are spending on their MEPs would cover the entire operating costs of the police force of a medium-sized British county. Alternatively we could keep in service ten complete infantry battalions. I wonder which would give Britain more influence in the world. We could even pay for three Eurofighters a year, if they ever reach squadron service.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, if this House actually prevented some of the more insane regulations created by the Commission from reaching the statute books, thus slowing down the growing burdens on business, there might be an economic argument for MEPs. As far as I can see, this House acts mainly as a rubber stamp, but here again I could get one of those in a stationery shop for approximately £3.00 or EUR5.00, which would be slightly cheaper.</p>
<p class="contents">In all, therefore, I have the greatest difficulty in arguing that this House or the British representation provide best value. That is the message I intend to take to my electorate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
