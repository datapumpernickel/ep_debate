<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Giovanni Pittella (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, we have concluded the budgetary procedure with a success. It is a success for everyone but, if I may say so, it is above all a success for Parliament, which has been able to fight for its political priorities. I should like to thank all the political groups, all my fellow Members, the committee Chairman and secretariat, and all those whose competence and generosity have helped to bring the procedure to a successful conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">The outcome speaks for itself. We had asked for a decent level of payments in line with strict control over spending but also with the need to have sufficient funds available to carry out the Union’s essential policies. We have achieved a budget of EUR 112 billion and a joint declaration that an amending budget will be put forward, particularly for the Structural Funds, if spending picks up in the new Member States, as we think it will.</p>
<p class="contents">We had asked for the budget lines for growth, competitiveness, education, research, small and medium-sized enterprises, and youth, environmental and cultural policies to be prioritised, and we have achieved renegotiated sums for a good half-dozen codecided programmes and the allocation of EUR 100 million in additional resources. I feel particularly pleased that we have achieved our aim of sending out a strong political message to the youth of Europe through the reinforcement of the Socrates, YOUTH and Leonardo programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">We had asked the Council to reflect on the inadequacy of the Berlin spending levels for external actions, and we provided indisputable evidence in that regard. We reminded it of the solemn commitments made by the Heads of State or Government on issues such as Iraq, the tsunami, sugar and Afghanistan, to which Parliament intends to make its own contribution, without, however, sacrificing geographical programmes, humanitarian actions, essential initiatives on human rights and democracy, and inclusive development actions.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have achieved is that for the first time we have broken through the fateful EUR 200 million ceiling for flexibility in external actions. Let me be quite clear: having an extra EUR 275 million available for external actions and a protocol that better acknowledges Parliament’s competence in foreign and security policy is not a trophy for us to show off but a necessary response, a decision warranted by everything that we, together, are expected to do in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also pleased on other, more general grounds. In recent years the European Union has gained historic prominence; it has made and maintained peace on its soil; it has brought down borders without resorting to the use of force; it has proposed its values without imposing them; and it has promoted growth and cohesion in an often troubled and unstable world. Today we are experiencing a profound crisis in the European project, but it is not an irreversible crisis. As Henri de Saint-Simon wrote, at such times what is needed is a force able to unite desires, to focus movements and to make interests mutual and commitments firm. Our political project was rocked by blustery winds back in the 1980s as well; despite the impending storm, however, strong political leadership enabled us to weather the elements and emerge even stronger than before.</p>
<p class="contents">None of us is pretending to be a new François Mitterrand or a new Helmut Kohl but, if we cast aside selfish attitudes and if we adjust national budgetary priorities to the priorities of our European duties, we shall, all together, be able to stop the European project from drifting and crumbling. The right response to a downturn is a change of course and, after our setbacks, we have together scored a positive point this week – we have put the ball in the net – with the annual budget. As Minister Lewis and Commissioner Grybauskaitė know, we could have used the annual budget for leverage on the financial perspective, but we did not want to do so because we have a sense of responsibility and realise that the European Union does not need conflict among the institutions. The Council should understand, however, that it cannot offer us a tiny little Europe; nor can it think that the European Parliament will settle for miserly compromises that mark the end of the European dream.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has made an important contribution to the debate on the budget for 2007-2013 in the excellent Böge report, which has so far been unfairly ignored. The proposal from the UK Presidency, on the other hand, I am sorry to say, is unacceptable because it is the exact opposite of the worthy project that Mr Blair himself set out before Parliament, in that it releases the Member States from their duties towards Europe and gives out little sweeteners here and there, without setting a process of budgetary reform in motion or providing the Union with greater financial leeway.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not just a case of Robin Hood in reverse, as somebody suggested: there is also the danger, which I should like to avert, that we shall be responsible for burying any hope of a European revival. With the annual budget, however, we are making a positive response, and for that I am also grateful to Minister Lewis and Commissioner Grybauskaitė. We remain convinced that, at a time of uncertainties and concerns, the empowerment of Europe’s financial conscience is the only basis for fruitful and confident European integration.</p>

That being so, agreement to EUR 275 million for the use of flexibility also amounts to mutual <span class="italic">rapprochement</span>, and I ask the House to vote to adopt this report on the use of the flexibility instrument in relation to the 2006 Budget in its present form.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to take this opportunity to point out that this House did, in the course of negotiations on the Financial Perspective, make a proposal as to how we might in future take a more flexible approach, albeit one based strictly on budgetary discipline, and also observe that it is not only the issue of a globalisation fund that is on the agenda, but that we also have to respond much more rapidly and consistently in many important categories of European Budget policy. This House made it perfectly clear, on 8 June, that its negotiating position on this is in fact not itself subject to negotiation.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me add in conclusion that, for the British Prime Minister Mr Blair, as President-in-Office of the Council, to say, on the subject of the negotiations on the Financial Perspective, that either there is a deal in December or there will be no more agreement under the Austrian or Finnish presidencies, is for him to threaten a blockade. I note with satisfaction that, in interviews, he adduces Parliament as what one might call an argument, along the lines of: if the Council will not come to an agreement, then the decision on the budget will have to pass to Parliament. I can tell him that Parliament is ready for it.</p>

It is my duty to present amending budget No 8. As in other years, as we Members of this Parliament well know, we are facing the same budgetary problems relating to execution and political representativeness. With regard to the 2005 budget alone, 10% of payment appropriations have not been able to be used, appropriations that you, ladies and gentlemen, voted for in December of last year. Furthermore, we are going to have to return EUR 3 800 million to the Member States, since it has not been possible to commit that money in the decisions that we MEPs had voted for.</p>
<p class="contents">It is difficult to establish the extent to which the European Commission, the Member States or this Parliament are responsible for this situation, which is repeated year after year. We in this Parliament vote every year for budgetary appropriations in accordance with our own political debate and the interests that we believe our electors bring to this Chamber, and that is why we are here. We vote according to what we believe are the Union’s interests, in terms of foreign policy, internal policy and the Structural Funds. We must acknowledge that the European Commission makes more effort every year to better implement policies, the budgetary mandates that we are given as European parliamentarians. And we are aware that the Member States make an effort year after year both in order to fund the budget and in order to implement Community policies.</p>
<p class="contents">But it can be deduced from the execution figure every year that something is still failing in the process of budgetary allocation of the appropriations that we vote for and in their final application, both in the Member States and in Community programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Amending budget No 8, which I am presenting for your approval, includes, amongst other things, returning EUR 3 800 million to the Member States. We know that this is good news for the Finance Ministers of the Member States, since this is a sum that they do not have to incorporate into the Community budget in order to fund the 2005 financial year. Nevertheless, from a European point of view, it is not good news, because the saving results from a very significant under-execution in payment appropriations corresponding to the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">During the 2005 budgetary procedure, we agreed with the Council a significant reduction in the Structural Funds, below our first reading of the budget, and also below the preliminary draft budget presented by the Commission. We also agreed a joint statement with the other two institutions, in which the Council committed itself to presenting an amending budget which would include the payment appropriations necessary to pay Structural Funds, in the event that the execution was as expected.</p>
<p class="contents">During October, the European Commission presented us with a first draft of amending budget No 8, which talked about certain real budgetary needs; it also talked about EUR 600 million in Structural Funds, which should have been included in the Community budget. In the end, none of that happened.</p>
<p class="contents">During November, the Commission altered its figures on the basis of the news about budgetary execution reaching it from the Member States and, in the end, what were funding requirements have been turned into surpluses. Even with this return of EUR 3 800 million, there could be a surplus of payment appropriations in the Structural Funds at the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we can only interpret this as a bad thing. It is bad news, both for the 2006 budget of Mr Pittella, and for the negotiation of the financial perspective. The Union’s budget can never be drawn up solely according to the principle of saving, but rather according to the principle of effectiveness and European added value.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, where is the European added value in returning payment appropriations to the Finance Ministers year after year? This is not a good way to produce a Community budget or to build a truly effective Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The political message we are sending to the European citizens every year is very disappointing. Commissioner, representatives of the Council, when this Parliament votes for budgetary appropriations, it does so with the hope and desire that they are correctly executed by everybody. I believe that this is the lesson that we must learn this year, and let us hope that the execution is better during 2006.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ivan Lewis, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, it is an honour and a privilege to be back in this Chamber to represent the Presidency of the Council in this important debate on the budget of the European Communities for 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament’s second reading of the annual budget, culminating in the vote on Thursday, is a key part of the European Union calendar and is probably more important this year than ever before. The agreement between the Council and the parliamentary delegation on the main elements of the 2006 budget was reached in the end in the best spirit of cooperation and compromise. By putting that agreement into effect in the adopted budget, the European Parliament has the opportunity to send a clear signal to the people of Europe that, despite the challenges we face over the Constitution and future financing, the European Union is still operating effectively and in their best interest.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not need to remind honourable Members of the historical importance of this budgetary procedure. They will be acutely aware that the last procedure under the current financial perspective has a special role in bridging past priorities and future objectives to provide a measure of continuity and the basis for coherence between two financial perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the agreement we reached in Brussels two weeks ago broadly satisfies those objectives. But it does something more than that. The difficulty of reconciling our policy priorities with the core principles of budget discipline and sound financial management highlights the fact that the current budget structures are stretched to breaking point. The next financial perspective must offer the prospect of real reform and renewal in the future if the EC budget is to remain relevant and genuinely meet the needs and expectations of European citizens in the 21st century. It will not be easy, but if the two arms of the budgetary authority – the Parliament and the Council, which I represent today – can build on the spirit of cooperation we found in the end to deliver a 2006 budget, we have a chance to create a shared vision in the next few days for a better future in 2007-2013 and beyond.</p>
<p class="contents">Returning to 2006, honourable Members will be aware that the budget agreement between the Council and the parliamentary delegation focused primarily on three key elements. Each required some compromise from both sides, in some cases, frankly, going into uncharted budget waters, which perhaps explains why it was necessary to take a little longer over negotiations than has been the case traditionally. I stress that in each case, the parliamentary delegation drove a hard bargain and, as a consequence, several members of the Council felt unable to support our final compromise. But I believe that we reached a fair and balanced outcome in the end, one which I was able to steer through Council by a qualified majority.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we agreed to amend upward the financial envelopes for six codecided programmes in heading 3: Internal Policies. The Council did not see the need to propose these increases in its draft budget; however, the parliamentary delegation argued strongly that the six programmes concerned would be severely constrained without additional resources. In the spirit of compromise and consistent with the Interinstitutional Agreement, I was able to persuade the Council to accept these changes. This is the first time that has been agreed in the current financial perspective. It is perhaps fitting that it happened in the final year of that perspective, and I am sure that both arms of the budgetary authority would want to consider it as an exceptional event.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we agreed to mobilise the flexibility instrument for programmes in heading 4: External Actions, for a total of EUR 275 million. The Council took the initial view that it ought to be possible, with some reprioritisation, to finance all external actions within the budget ceiling. However, I stress that the Council remains firmly committed to meet the urgent needs of external partners consistent with promises made and commitments undertaken. Member States recognise the tight budgetary constraints in heading 4, demonstrated no more clearly than the Common Foreign and Security Policy, and the Council was ultimately persuaded of the need to mobilise the flexibility instrument to ease these constraints.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the outcome, which exceeds the Commission’s proposals by more than EUR 110 million, represents a fair compromise, ensuring resources for key urgent priorities, such as Iraq, tsunami reconstruction, traditional assistance for sugar protocol countries, and CFSP. It also recognises that further demands on the external actions budget are likely during 2006. However, I stress that this is the first time it has been necessary to exceed EUR 200 million in a single year. The Council considers this an exceptional event and some Member States remain convinced that it is an unnecessary step. I hope that honourable Members will appreciate the significance of this outcome and share with me the hope that more effective use of the principle of reprioritisation and reallocation will prevail in similar circumstances in future years.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as required by the Treaty, the Council and the parliamentary delegation agreed to set the level of overall payments for 2006 at EUR 111 969 million. This represents the Commission’s original proposal which, after taking account of Amending Letters 1, 2 and 3, is more than half a billion euros above the Council’s original position. I recognise that this figure is somewhat lower than some Members of Parliament would have liked. However, it is firmly based on the Commission’s estimates of what it is able effectively to spend. I am sure honourable Members will share my concern not to create an unnecessary budget surplus and so would recognise the case for prudence. Of course the budgetary authority stands ready to consider an amending budget to amend the level of payments, should that prove necessary during 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said earlier, I believe that this compromise agreement represents a fair and balanced outcome for all three institutions – Council, Parliament and Commission. There are no doubt elements of it that each of us might like to improve, but that is the essence of compromise. No one is entirely satisfied, each of us has made a sacrifice and modified our positions. Both the Council and Parliament had tough mandates this year and it was no easy matter to find common ground. Consequently, I commend this solution to you and look forward to your vote.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to touch very briefly on other aspects of the Council’s second reading, which honourable Members might like to take into account. In heading 1: Agriculture, the Council reinstated the EUR 150 million reduction from the first reading and accepted instead the Commission’s Amending Letter 2, which reduces expenditure on subheading 1a by EUR 361 million compared to the preliminary draft budget.</p>
<p class="contents">In heading 2: Structural Operations, the Council reinstated its first reading position for a reduction of EUR 150 million for payments compared to the PDB. This reflects the Council’s view of the expected implementation rate and is based on past evidence of implementation shortfalls, including amending budget 8 for 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">In heading 3: Internal Policies, the Council largely reinstated its first reading position but made some modest changes to a few key budget lines, including an increase in the payments for research lines, reflecting the increased emphasis on Lisbon from Hampton Court and entrusting the Commission to improve the implementation record in this area. This allows a 16% increase to research payments, compared to 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">In heading 4: External Actions, the Council reinstated its first reading and also accepted the Commission’s Amending Letter 1 concerning traditional assistance for sugar protocol countries, allocating resources from its first reading margin.</p>
<p class="contents">In heading 5: Administrative Expenditure, the Council partly accepted Parliament’s first reading amendment to the Commission budget in light of new evidence about vacancy rates. It also accepted the proposal to reduce EUR 20 million from Parliament’s budget. Otherwise it reinstated its first reading position, recalling the need for savings in operating costs from interinstitutional cooperation and economies of scale.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in heading 7: Pre-accession Strategy, the Council reinstated its first reading position.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, Parliament will need to make changes to the Council’s second reading position to implement our agreement on payments, codecided amounts and mobilisation of the flexibility instrument. I very much hope that Parliament will take account of the Council’s position, especially concerning commitments in headings 3 and 5, where there are clear opportunities to make savings and ensure there is a margin for the unexpected during 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the agreement we reached on 30 November provides adequate funding for the European Union’s various priorities. It broadly respects the important principles of budgetary discipline and sound financial management, of which the Council and Parliament are joint guardians. It deserves the confidence of the citizens of the European Union and will contribute to rebuilding public confidence in the Union and its institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope honourable Members will forgive me if I do not remain in the Chamber for the duration of this morning’s debate, as I need to return urgently to London. However, I will be staying to hear as many speeches as possible, which I am sure will be of the usual thoughtful and constructive nature. I intend to return to Strasbourg on Thursday for the vote and the adoption of the 2006 EC budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I wish to say that it has been a privilege and a pleasure to work through this process – although not on every occasion – and we can be rightly proud of the agreement that we are seeking to conclude during the course of this week.</p>

It is due to prudent and inevitable compromise that we are near our goal today – an EU Budget for 2006 that may play a decisive role not only concerning the financial possibilities of the coming year, but also in shaping the further financial fate of Europe. The approval of the budget may, and I hope will, become a vitally important message to the European Union that its institutions are still operational and able to function constructively, to make important decisions together and to achieve positive results. I consider the results of the 2006 EU Budget negotiations to be one of those optimal successes. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, regarding the positive outcome of the negotiations for 2006: overall, a successful result has been achieved and one with which Parliament can be satisfied and proud. I would like to thank Mr Pittella, Mr Lewandowski – the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, and all the rapporteurs involved in the process.</p>
<p class="contents">From the very beginning, the Commission strongly supported Parliament’s interpretation of the flexibility instrument which the Council, after hard negotiations, has now accepted. Despite the Council’s refusal to go over EUR 200 million, now, with the final outcome, EUR 275 million has been made available under the flexibility instrument, creating essential room for manoeuvre in heading 4.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the co-decision programmes, you have achieved an important EUR 100 million over 6 programmes. From the earliest stages, this was a strategy supported by the Commission in the process of negotiation, and now that agreement has been reached by both arms of the budgetary authority, the Commission will do its utmost to ensure implementation of the new amounts.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like also to thank Parliament, and in particular, Mr Pittella, for taking into account so many aspects of the Commission’s letter of executability of the amendments from the first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn to the level of payment appropriations. It is important that the payment appropriations in the budget can cover the incoming bills, and ensure that beneficiaries receive the payments they are expecting. The level of payment appropriations agreed for 2006 is accompanied by the agreed declaration, so that, if necessary and on the basis of the most up-to-date information, this will allow for any additional appropriations needed to be made available as soon as possible. In order to facilitate the deal between the two arms of the budgetary authority, the Commission has proposed Amending Letter 3, which is technically well founded, but the Commission will keep a close watch on the implementation of the 2006 budget and will not hesitate to use the budgetary tools at our disposal, if certain areas need to be reinforced. In the first instance, appropriations can be transferred, and, notably, we can also call on the provisions of the declaration agreed at the trilogue, should an amending budget be required.</p>
<p class="contents">I would finally point out that the total payment appropriations figure on the table today represents an increase of almost 6% compared to the 2005 budget. The budget agreed is optimal and fair, and it is necessary for Europe. I wish Parliament a constructive debate and successful vote on Thursday.</p>

Significant concessions were made by both the European Parliament and the Council, and thus, today we can expect that on 15 December the European Union budget for 2006 will be approved. The European Parliament Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, of which I am a member, should be satisfied with the results of the agreement, as we have succeeded in achieving our main goals. In 2006, allocations will be increased for codecision programmes, such as scientific research, SOCRATES, LIFE, small and medium-sized enterprises, youth programmes and European cultural organisations. Growth, competitiveness and support for SMEs have always been and will continue to be the priority areas of the European People’s Party. It is also very important that we have come to an agreement to use the flexibility instrument for external policies and new needs, allocating EUR 275 million to Iraq, reconstruction efforts in tsunami-affected countries and consequences of sugar reform in the ACP countries, of which EUR 40 million will go to the Common Foreign and Security Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The level of appropriations for 2006 was a very important subject of negotiation for the European Parliament, and the agreement reached on EUR 111.969 billion, or 1.01% of GNI, is within the limits of the Financial Perspective and therefore should be seen as a positive outcome of the negotiations. Although at the first reading Parliament voted for significantly higher appropriations, the compromise reached with the Council 2006 provides a good foundation for agreement on the new Financial Perspective, as well as for negotiations on the EU Budget for 2007. I congratulate my colleague and main rapporteur Giovanni Pittella, the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets Mr Lewandowski, the Commissioner and the Council for having reached this solid agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also do not wish to leave out our administrators and assistants.</p>
<p class="contents">In actual fact, we have ended up today with a smaller budget than we were hoping for, but one that has been drawn up quite legally and that adheres to the current financial perspective, namely 1.09% of commitment appropriations. That is important and exceeds the results obtained last year. Furthermore, we can use the flexibility instrument to adhere to the promises made by the Council. We will remember, though, the problems we had in securing this option when we embark upon the forthcoming negotiations. What is more, all the margins have been adhered to. In short, we have attained a modest and reasonable budget, which will do no damage to the revenue provided by the Member States. The budget adheres to the priorities we set and, thanks to several policies adopted under codecision, it mainly enables us to anticipate the Lisbon Strategy and to hold on to the bulk of external aid, the aid that we give to the poorest countries and that we value highly.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, however, to return to a number of points close to our hearts, which relate to the implementation of the budget. Today, the budget that we are presenting has a political dimension to it. It is up to the Commission, however, to make sure that this political dimension is maintained when the budget is implemented. Clearly, we must avoid having any surpluses next year. In fact, if the budget headings continue not to be implemented, then the European Parliament’s political commitment, as budgetary authority, is likely to dwindle.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we no longer want to see returns of EUR 2 billion on whichever Fund it may be. Everything must be implemented; we have given you the resources for this. If you encounter difficulties, let us know in due time.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say to the Council that, admittedly, we now have a proper budget for 2006, agreed upon in the wake of a whole host of problems. We are in this situation because the promises made by the Council are not often backed up with funds and because you had made a commitment, more than two years ago, to implement an information system on security policy. We are one of the two branches of budgetary authority, and we consider it disgraceful that the European institutions, and the Council in particular, seem to be unaware of this fact. The Committee on Budgets approved of the Council’s wisdom in seeking to make strong political decisions for this 2006 budget. We will harbour the same concerns where the forthcoming financial perspective is concerned. Today, we have the only legal proposal: the vote on 8 June, widely adopted by our Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then, we have been awaiting a genuine proposal from the Council. When this reaches us, we will be ready – ready to work and to negotiate, in view of our shared years of experience. The Committee on Budgets will work for a budget benefiting Europeans. It will adopt a similar approach in the negotiations on the financial perspective, and Parliament will support it with a view to providing the European Union with a budgetary framework that will enable it to fund the activities in which it is required to engage with a view to developing quality jobs and protecting the environment. We want this to be done in the context of real solidarity not only among the nations of Europe, but also with the poorest people.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the 2006 budget, Parliament rejects the intergovernmental approach in relation to the financial perspective. Our Parliament wants to represent Europeans. It wants us to be united in diversity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it good that we were able to reach a conclusion concerning the 2006 Budget, even though there is no clarification of the financial perspective for 2007-2013. It does show that, despite everything, the Council’s and Parliament’s positions on the 2006 Budget were not so far removed from each other, even though the negotiations were quite tough. My group does not, then, wish to support the proposal to reject the 2006 Budget in protest against the British Presidency’s proposals concerning the financial perspective. We too are angry that the British Presidency has proposed cutting back on aid to the poorest EU countries in order to give to the rich countries, but that is of course a debate to which we shall return later.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is particularly pleased that increased appropriations to development and research programmes – over and above what has been agreed in the past, moreover – were successfully obtained. We are delighted to have obtained more money from the flexibility instrument so that we can fund the post-tsunami reconstruction, together with reconstruction in Iran. Regarding the size of the payments in 2006, which in fact remained at 1.01% of gross national income, it will of course be the actual level in 2006 that will determine the budget over the next few years, if it should turn out that we do not obtain an agreement on the financial perspective. That is something we could, of course, easily live with. We should then approve annual budgets with only the Treaty as a framework, and we should then see how things went. My group wants a financial perspective, but not at any price. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our aim was to exercise discipline over expenditure while nevertheless showing an ability to shape policy, and I think we have succeeded in doing that. Mobilising the flexibility instrument for an amount of EUR 275 million has given us the leeway to help the victims of the tsunami to rebuild their countries, to promote reconstruction in Iraq and also to bolster the new market organisation for sugar.</p>
<p class="contents">I am equally glad that we have been able, through our codecision on the programme, to do more for young people and for education, for that too is all about the ability to shape policy. Our strategy of moving away from oil and towards more renewable energies, of benefiting research, small and medium-sized enterprises and culture too is the very thing for reaching people where they are – reaching, that is, their hearts and not just their heads. That is what makes me glad that our negotiations have produced this result. The prospect of the 2006 budget’s commitment appropriations amounting to 1.09% offers us the opportunity for an appropriate basis for the next financial perspective, and means that we are going beyond the figures proposed by the Luxembourg Presidency this summer.</p>
<p class="contents">I do, nevertheless, want to remind the House that difficult negotiations in the Council on the financial perspective lie before us. I appeal, as a matter of urgency, not only for the same single-mindedness in pursuing a single Europe as in the 2006 budget, but also for an awareness at Council level that it is our common Europe and its ongoing development that is at stake. What matters is that any agreement should be made with a view to the needs of the new countries and also to the way in which Europe can be made fit for the future, with new ecological products on the global market to give hope to young people and to us.</p>
<p class="contents">The negotiations that are about to begin must not be characterised by the sort of repellent haggling that gets up people’s noses; instead, all parties must see themselves as negotiating for the Europe we share and in a European spirit. I therefore appeal to France, to the United Kingdom, to Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands, to give a little bit of ground and come to a real agreement that makes for a better future for us all and does not ruin Europe’s image. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It came just prior to the negotiations to be held tomorrow and the guidelines for future budgets in the period 2007–2013 to be presented the day after tomorrow. Neither party negotiating the budget wanted to take the risk of allowing these talks to founder on account of the 2006 budget.</p>
<p class="contents">There are probably not many Members in this Chamber, apart from those representing the United Kingdom, who, within the context of those talks, would like to see Great Britain’s special rebate continue in the years to come. There are no good arguments for it.</p>
<p class="contents">Next year’s budget will follow the guidelines indicated by the Council. In payments the 1% limit is to be approached from above, without Parliament being able to defend its own territory. The very fact that there might not be budgetary harmony would, under Article 272 of the Treaty, have given Parliament the use of more payment appropriations than the proposal which the negotiating parties have agreed on.</p>
<p class="contents">At first reading, Parliament blew up the biggest balloon by increasing Structural Fund payments by more than EUR 3 billion. The Council burst this bubble in conciliation, without any special negotiations or Parliament keeping to its position. It is strange that the Commission did not feel the need to defend its own original proposal, but instead took the side of the Council. We in Parliament will remember this if there is not enough cash in the Structural Funds to make payments.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the EU Constitution the Union will be militarised to an astonishing degree, even though no EU Constitution yet exists nor will ever exist in the form which was rejected by the people of France and the Netherlands. In this way the EU will increase its powers, even though the Member States have not legally bestowed them. Our group takes a very critical view of next year’s budget. It may be that some members will agree with the proposal to reject it. We want a more social and less military Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President, the 2006 budget is a poor budget, and it should be rejected. A justified proposal to this effect has been tabled by members of the Independence and Democracy Group and of other political groups, and we would call on all Members of the House to lend it their support.</p>
<p class="contents">The facts are as follows. In 2004 10 new Member States joined the EU, which meant a rise of 20% in the number of EU citizens. A constantly increasing number of these Member States are in need of assistance, solidarity and subsidies because they are not sufficiently advanced. The European Union will gain another two Member States in 2007 when Bulgaria and Romania join, and the number of citizens will increase by 6%.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I wish to make is that the European Union has been experiencing falling growth rates of below 2% for many years now, whereas the growth rate of the US and South-East Asian economies is many times faster. The competitiveness of EU businesses is declining. Yet the 2006 budget fails to take account of these factors. The budget will increase by around 2% after inflation, which means that there will be less and less money for each EU citizen. What is more, no changes have been made to the way in which budgetary expenditure is structured, so as to provide more money for backward countries and regions, and for sectors that are highly effective in economic terms. The budget keeps the old mechanisms in place, and rewards economic sectors that are both costly and inefficient. A budget of this kind will turn backward countries into net payers.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, there are special reasons why the 2006 budget should be rejected. It is being used as a threat to force the less advanced countries to consent to the adoption of the British proposal for a reduced 2007-2013 Financial Perspective. If they do not adopt this Financial Perspective, they face the prospect of having to agree to an interim annual budget based on the 2006 figures, which would mean even less money.</p>
<p class="contents">If the 2006 budget is a forerunner of the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective, then it should also be rejected, because Parliament proposed expenditure of around EUR 1 000 billion for this period, whereas the current proposal refers to a figure of around EUR 850 billion. Given a difference of this magnitude, it is hard to believe that any Member of this House could fail to see that Parliament’s opinion counts for very little and that it is being treated with contempt, or that the interests of individual countries are being given precedence over common interests.</p>
<p class="contents">I think I can safely say that I speak for all the Members proposing that the budget be rejected when I say we believe that the declarations and slogans proclaimed by EU leaders and the actual policies they implement stand in fundamental contradiction to each other. Their policies are in fact simply an expression of the selfishness of the rich. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Our group will vote in favour of the agreement reached by the Council and Parliament on the 2006 budget, even though it is far from satisfactory. We find it hard to accept that the level of payments has been set at 1.01% of GNI. The compromise that has been reached on this issue is in fact nothing less than a capitulation to the Council. The latter cuts the EU’s spending with a tenacity worthy of a better cause, in so doing violating the principles of solidarity and cohesion in order to further the local interests of the net payers into the EU budget. The concessions granted by the Council on the flexibility instrument and on programmes adopted under the codecision procedure do not compensate in any way for this propensity to make cuts.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been disappointed by Commissioner Grybauskaitė’s position. During the conciliation procedure, she did not even remain faithful to the Commission’s previous stance on the budget level. This latter is now worryingly close to 1%, or in other words the symbolic, and indeed real, threshold below which achievement of the EU’s basic goals cannot be safeguarded. This is all the more alarming because the 2006 budget may become a point of reference for the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective, which has been extremely difficult in the making. The risk that this may happen increases the likelihood that negotiations on the Financial Perspective will end in fiasco, which would mean the 2006 budget serving as a basis for future annual budgets. The solidarity and cohesion policies could therefore suffer as a result of the Council’s position for many years to come. We must ask ourselves whether this is the kind of EU that we want.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the most inadequate of all the proposals tabled has been adopted. We must realise that a small budget cannot be a good budget. I agree that a large budget may not necessarily be a good budget, but it is impossible for a small budget to be a good one. This House has heard comments along the lines of, ‘the budget before us is small but good’. There is no consensus that this is the case, however, just as there is no consensus on a budget that will ignore the needs of countries, especially the new Member States. Solidarity is a basic concern for these latter.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, there are certain incidents that cause many EU citizens to lose their enthusiasm for Community policies, and their belief in the momentous idea which is the European Union. An example of one such incident is the position recently adopted by Mr Schröder, the former German chancellor, on the construction of the gas pipeline along the bottom of the Baltic Sea. There is much controversy about this pipeline in many of the new EU Member States, and it has received a lot of negative publicity in these countries. Indeed, it is not only in the new Member States that the publicity has been negative, for I have before me a list of German newspapers that have been extremely critical of the former chancellor’s decisions. If the intention is now to tell the new EU Member States that there will not be enough money for them to achieve their fundamental goals, even though the aim of these goals is to promote what could be termed a natural impulse of the European Community, and if such incidents, which ruin the reputation of leading EU politicians, are accompanied by cuts to funding for the new EU Member States, we must realise that this impulse of the European Community, which also goes by the name of solidarity, will be weakened rather than strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this is a poor budget. I say this not only because it is small. As I said before, it is a poor budget because it has implications for the future, and because it will destroy the natural inclination and impulse of the European Community, which should be the first concern of every one of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commitments, or potential expenditures, as a share of gross domestic product exceed 9%. This is a good springboard for negotiations on the long-term financial perspective. Payments increased by almost 6% compared with 2005, which is a substantially higher increase in budgetary resources than in many Member States of the European Union. Considering the fact that the expected rate of inflation and economic growth in the European Union in 2006 is around 2%, it is apparent that the proposed budget is also reasonable from the macroeconomic standpoint. The problem that continues to dog us is that the gap between commitments and payments is too wide. This gap is again nearly EUR 10 billion, which reduces the flexibility and efficiency of the EU’s budgetary instrument. I therefore still consider it crucial that issues regarding the effective use of budgetary resources be resolved, that mechanisms for accessing financial resources in structural and cohesion funds be made more flexible and that the extensive ‘cushion’ between resources available those that are actually used be greatly reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by expressing my appreciation for the work of my fellow Members and of the rapporteurs from the Committee on Budgets. The results of their work also give us hope for the long-term budgetary outlook. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The broad consensus reached within Parliament means that the final vote should hold no surprises, and so I will start by saying some ‘thank yous’, for which I will otherwise run out of time. I should like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Pittella, Mr Dombrovskis, Mr Böge and Mr Garriga Polledo, the political group coordinators and our secretariat, headed by Maria Fialho.</p>
<p class="contents">Our partners in this undertaking, or in other words Mr Lewis and Commissioner Grybauskaitė, are both well aware of the fact that this year’s budget was a challenge, and that tensions ran high during the negotiations. This does not diminish the mutual respect shared by the players in this EU institutional triangle, however. Parliament had to fulfil its mission and the commitments it entered into upon being elected, and indeed it did so. This was apparent from its endeavours to defend its priorities under the headings of internal and external policies, which was a far from easy task in the final year of a financial perspective. I am delighted that we have managed to find extra funding for six of the programmes adopted under the codecision procedure. It has also been necessary to mobilise the flexibility instrument, and even to exceed its annual ceiling. All these decisions were taken in accordance with the Interinstitutional Agreement, which is proof of the value of this latter.</p>
<p class="contents">I am quite sure that it will be a long time before we forget the team spirit demonstrated by the members of Parliament’s delegation during these nerve-wracking negotiations. This was an example of genuine unity in diversity, and a good sign for the future. Yet our joy at having a proper annual budget for 2006 is tempered by the uncertainty that surrounds the multi-annual Financial Perspective. By this I do not mean uncertainty on our part, since we have adopted a position and are now awaiting developments. I can only hope that we will finally see signs this week that the European Union is overcoming the crisis in which it finds itself, by reaching an agreement on the most challenging issue of all, namely money. I also hope that the agreement is not one that leaves poorer countries with their backs against the wall, since we are all aware that these countries need to be able to plan ahead in order to conduct sensible regional policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To a large extent, our group’s recommended priorities for 2006 have been incorporated. They include: creating an effective information strategy; providing an efficient service for Members and visitors; continuing to purchase property and buildings under the right conditions; streamlining manpower policy and improving activity-based budgeting, which focuses more on core operations; critically examining all forms of expenditure; making better use of our resources, thus reducing waste, and other inherent malpractices – so adding real value to our performance.</p>
<p class="contents">The successful conclusion of a very well structured budget becomes even more relevant considering the potential outcome of the 2007 to 2013 financial perspectives. In the budget conciliation process Parliament’s negotiating team went a long way to find a workable, balanced formula. Likewise, we should do our utmost to reach an agreement on the financial perspectives, but, as Mrs Jensen said, not at any cost.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not agree on a set of financial perspectives that would make it very difficult, if not impossible, realistically to deliver on our promises and to meet our commitments and objectives. We cannot, and should not, pay lip service to high-flown ideas such as growth, employment, research, social solidarity and enlargement and, at the same time, not provide the funds to achieve them.</p>

I think that what we have achieved, namely payment appropriations amounting to 1.01% of the gross national income, is especially significant in the light of the negotiations about the financial perspectives. It is higher than what Luxembourg offered under its Presidency and it is, if I am not mistaken, also higher than what is currently on offer by the British Presidency. I agree with the many who say that Parliament’s most important achievement has been the broader scope of the programmes relating to young people. We have received more funds in the framework of the flexibility instrument, which is also one of Parliament’s important criteria for subsequent financial perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to the common foreign and security policy, during the negotiations on which something strange happened. The Council wanted to teach us a lesson in cutting budget spending, and virtually every hour, the appropriations for this policy area increased. This I regard as particularly bad budget policy on the part of the Council in this area, and it has resulted in considerably higher amounts than first proposed at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">One possible explanation I could offer for this is the fact that we are now, for the third time, concluding an agreement with the Council on democratic control on the spending of common foreign and security policy funds. The Council ignored the agreement on the first two occasions. Third time lucky, we hope. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also apparent from the current debate that this House was very far-sighted in European agricultural policy and in initiating the reduction in export subsidies. In Cancún, it was at the behest of the European Parliament that Mr Fischler and Mr Lamy proposed that these export subsidies be suspended outright. We have also used the budget and codecision to foster rural development and to qualify the agricultural policy. Certain governments – the British one in particular, which is now proposing cuts – should take good note of the fact that this rebate will nullify the House’s qualification, in part through budget policy, in this area, and put the brakes on a modern agricultural policy founded upon rural development, which will be particularly to the detriment of the new Member States of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That would mean that the Structural Funds would account for 0.36% to 0.37% of Community GNI, which would suit the most economically advanced countries in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, a mindset has taken hold that oddly views every concession as a victory, in reference to each increasingly damaging proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am talking about the surpluses, which give us a small foretaste of what we can – unfortunately – expect on a larger scale later on.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, the Committee on Budgets was discussing something the presence of which on the agenda was cause for bafflement, namely the purchase, for the sum of EUR 3 million, of a building for the European Parliament in Valletta – it is worth mentioning that the intention was that the Commission should be a tenant. All five Maltese MEPs are against the idea, saying that it is too remote and difficult to get to, and that they would rather carry on renting at the present favourable rate. They have to accept it, though, since there is a surplus and it has to be spent. So along comes one of your colleagues, Mr President, the Vice-President Mr Onesta, and says, ‘that is a good property investment, and I promise you that, in three years’ time, if we find something better, we will be able to sell the building at a profit and move on somewhere else’.</p>
<p class="contents">We are forced to accept these benefactions, and the European Parliament is made into a property speculator by the mere fact of having too much money, and then people wonder why it is that, in Malta, the public wonder what this is all in aid of, what sort of waste this is, what sort of attitude this is to take. Away with such practices, and let us have proper budgeting – the sort that is not guaranteed by the draft budget we have before us, and so I, of course, will be among those voting against it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While this congratulatory reception is going on, though, I have substantial criticisms to make, notably that the second reading in the Committee went ahead without documents, so that resolutions were put together orally, and that the cutbacks and redeployments of funds neither were nor are justifiable. I am quite surprised to see, in the foreign policy sphere, that non-governmental organisations and democracy programmes have gained a great deal, more indeed than they have ever had before, while cutbacks were the order of the day almost everywhere else.</p>
<p class="contents">While I am on the subject of cutbacks, the Commission has, in negotiations with the Council and in the Committee on Budgets, proposed to make them, to the tune of over EUR 150 million, to the payments made from the Structural Funds, leaving EUR 70 million. It justified this by reference to an alleged lack of opportunity for implementation in the countries concerned. Looking at the programme of cutbacks, I wonder why it is that the Commission, and the Commissioner, have lost the courage to do the right and proper thing. The present cuts in the internal policy areas and in foreign policy hit hardest those areas in which the money could actually have been put to good use, and this is something of which I really do take a very critical view. We will look carefully to see whether the money remaining in the Structural Funds actually does get spent. What I find regrettable about this sort of thing is that it is yet more evidence of our inability to trust those who administer the funds, and so I ask, as a matter of urgency, that there be no repetition of it, or else we will see a great gulf opening up between old and new, between those countries that contribute and those that receive, and that is precisely what we cannot afford with the financial perspective and the debates on it in the offing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have just three points for the Commission and Council to reflect on.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, every year we have a similar struggle to agree the EU budget. It is increasingly a challenging task due to ever more exceptional demands on the EU at home and abroad. At the same time, the traditional priorities continue to require as much spending as before. I do not think, therefore, that we should worry if the budget requires a heated and lengthy debate to achieve a compromise solution. However, we should be concerned by the fact that, after devoting time, money and effort debating, negotiating and agreeing the budget, we then fail to use the funds. This is totally unacceptable and I know that many others, including Mr Garriga Polledo, have made this point. I would ask the Commissioner to take full responsibility for improving implementation, not only in the programmes that the Commission champions, but also in respecting Parliament’s will. The fiercely negotiated funds must have an impact on the lives of EU citizens and it is payments that have the most direct effect.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that collectively we need to be more aware of our public image and the importance of demonstrating the collaborative working habits that drive the EU project and inspire confidence in the European Union. These are currently clearly lacking. I would like the Commission to note that Parliament has improved resources for communication policy. Now it is the responsibility of Commission officials to be more imaginative. In this age of the competitive mass communications market, the need to sell ourselves and our EU vision and deliver a clear, simple and compelling message is absolutely imperative. That goes for Parliament too. Outdated, incomprehensible legacies such as our travelling circuses do nothing to help us win this game.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, a word on heading 4. As the chairman of the Delegation for Relations with the Countries of South Asia and SAARC, I am deeply disappointed with the reduction in amounts for Asia, even with the additional flexibility. The Council needs to think seriously about this dysfunctional heading. We have a knee-jerk reaction to major disasters. We have commitments to the MDG global health funds. We do not, however, have adequate resources. Let this be a priority for the Council Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The draft budget before us aims at improving employment in Europe. Certain multiannual programmes are to be started, on Parliament’s initiative, as a result. This particularly applies to the research framework programme and training programmes. In this way Parliament is showing the direction in which the work of the EU should be developed.</p>
<p class="contents">This budget is the last under the current financial perspective. The new financial framework should bolster European entrepreneurship and therefore employment. Research and development, and training and the promotion of cohesion will have key roles to play in this.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, however, the best laid plans can run into trouble. The proposal at Luxembourg back in June drastically reduced the appropriations intended to improve competitiveness by a hefty EUR 60 billion. Although Prime Minister Tony Blair promised improvements, Britain’s proposal is even worse. There has been no increase in appropriations for research and development whatsoever. Another EUR 12 billion has been cut from the Structural Funds in addition to the reduction of EUR 29 billion made at Luxembourg. Rural development, which is an important element in agricultural reform, is threatened with total collapse. At Luxembourg, EUR 14 billion was cut from the framework and now Britain is cutting a further EUR eight billion.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget should aim at the future and endorse action which no single Member State can afford on its own. This budget shows the way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Money from wholly disparate budget rubrics is used to fund the EU’s operations, whether of a military or police nature, and the so-called flexibility instrument makes an additional EUR 40 million available for the CFSP. What I would like to know is for what, precisely, these EUR 40 million are being used. The EUPOL operation in Kinshasa is funded by the European Development Fund, that is to say by EUR 4.3 million of development aid. The AMIS operation in the Sudan, which includes military training, is funded jointly by ten Member States, as well as by the fund called the African Peace Facility. The EUPM mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina is part-funded from the Commission’s budget, and the ALTHEA operation in Bosnia by means of what is termed the ATHENA mechanism, in other words, in an undemocratic manner and without Parliamentary scrutiny.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Brok is now proposing that there be an increase in this area, from EUR 100 million to EUR 300 million.

That is why the argument about the British rebate is about politics and not proper financial management. It is a continuing running sore, only because Mrs Thatcher was foolish enough to agree that it should be paid back by the Member States to what is now the fourth largest economy in the world and, since enlargement, it comes from some of the smallest and poorest in Europe.

<p class="contents">Secondly, I am delighted because an agreement was reached in time on the 2006 budget. In this respect, the British Presidency took the right decision, given that no one would have tolerated two major impasses at the end of a Presidency and Mr Blair wanted to close the 2006 budget in good time so that he would have more room for manoeuvre when negotiating the financial perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, payment appropriations for 2006 are 1.01, compared to 1 in 2005, while the British proposal makes provision for 0.98 for the seven-year period from 2007 to 2013. We have a slight improvement compared with this year, we achieved more than the British Presidency is discounting for the next seven years, but we have no reason to celebrate. We shall not achieve European integration with so little money. I should like to reply to the minister by saying that we do not agree with what he said here today about the heading 3 financing needed and legal use of the flexibility instrument supposedly being 'exceptional events'. I am afraid that the minister should not have said this in his intervention, because, on the contrary, we shall not achieve integration with less money, especially less necessary money. To divide the Member States into net contributors and net recipients of appropriations, when we are not going to spend more than 1% on Europe, when we are not focusing our overall synergies from common European action, does not do us credit and certainly does not testify to our regard for European ideals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">They have made great efforts and they have faced many problems. Having been rapporteur for the Union’s budget, I am well aware that it is not an easy thing to complete a successful budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to focus, Mr President, on the aspects that I consider to be of particular importance. Firstly, for the first time we have managed to apply a principle which this Parliament had always advocated: the sums approved during codecision are not sacred and they can be altered if the budgetary authority believes that to be necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">We all agree that, in order to improve the management of multi-annual programmes, the security of financial packages is an important factor. But we cannot turn what is no more than a tool into an objective. This is what differentiates us from the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps what separates us from the Council is the definition of the objectives. Perhaps the Council’s objective is simply the certainty that nothing is going to change once a decision is taken. What I believe we could call ‘the certainty of the accountant’.</p>
<p class="contents">To all of this we must add that the programmes whose funding has increased in the 2006 budget are hugely symbolic to the European Union. Both the Socrates Programme, which is well known to many citizens, and Youth, are examples of what a Parliament can do to create European awareness amongst the Union’s citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the LIFE programme, created by Parliament itself years ago, is one of those that enjoy the greatest acceptance amongst the European citizens and which demonstrate most clearly what kind of Europe we here in Parliament want to see.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased that the Council has not been able to impose the absurd manipulation, which they call ‘interpretation’, of the rules for mobilising the flexibility instrument. An unnecessary instrument within the interinstitutional agreement, which only exists because of the Council’s constant and almost legendary refusal to use the appropriate instrument for dealing with cases in which more appropriations than those provided for at the beginning of a period of programming of the financial perspective are required.</p>
<p class="contents">That appropriate instrument is called ‘revision’ and its use does not lead to chaos or to eternal damnation. The consequence of this more rational use of the resources available to us — the phrase should be familiar to you — has meant that the cuts we have been making since 2000 in the Union’s external actions are less than usual this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Since it has taken two to achieve all of this, and I do not want to be entirely negative toward the Council, I would like to congratulate the British Presidency, in which I must confess I did not have too much confidence at the beginning, but which in the end has been up to the job. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council orders more and more powers for the European Union, while being willing to pay less and less for them. The Council sticks up for the Member States. What the Member States want is for the EU to do more and more with the Common Foreign and Security Policy, to fight terrorism and crime, to subsidise agriculture, to organise policies for the protection of the environment and of consumers, for development aid and much else – the list is endless. It is getting longer, and, as we all know, that costs money – a lot of money. So let me tell the Council that it is time the simple truth dawned on it that more powers cost more money, and fewer powers cost less money. It is irresponsible of the Council to demand more powers while at the same time being less and less willing to spend money. Reforming the way the money is spent would do us all some good. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Markus Ferber (PPE-DE). – </span></span>  <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, there are just a few comments I would like to make at this point. I have been through quite a few budget debates, but none have been conducted in such a shameful manner as this year’s even though I did think that previous performances could not be surpassed.</p>
<p class="contents">When I consider the way the 2006 budget procedure went, and how the preparations for the next financial framework are progressing, I really do wonder, Mr President-in-Office, why your Prime Minister – to whom I ask you to pass this on – delivered such an incandescent speech in Brussels at the end of June. The words were fine, but action has not been forthcoming. It is not that it has been moderate, but rather that there simply has not been any. I am glad that the British Presidency of the Council has learned, in the course of this budget procedure, that this House knows what it is for and what it is about. I hope you will take that insight away with you and take account of it in your deliberations. You have an image of Europe as somewhere where a few Heads of State or Government announce how things are to go and steer them in that direction, and in which the Commission and Parliament are no more than decorative accessories that have to be tolerated; well, I have to tell you that that Europe no longer exists. If you have taken this lesson to heart, then I will be very satisfied with the British Presidency of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I will, however – and here I am addressing the Commissioner – make the critical comment that, as regards the role played by the Commission in the budget procedure, there has to be something of a rethink. It is not acceptable that the European Parliament should act as the Commission’s shield and defence, yet keep on getting the sense of being left in the lurch when the Commission withdraws positions in response to pressure from the Council. That is another thing to which we will, together, need to give very close consideration if we are to achieve anything together. Getting additional funds made available could have been achieved with less of an effort, but the fact is that presidencies sometimes need a bit longer to understand things and to come round to supporting them. This House, though, is patient and takes its time, for we do have a few things in the field of education policy that we want to hammer out with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">To you, Mr President-in-Office, I want to press home the point that the Inter-Institutional Agreement has proved its worth. We have agreed among ourselves on the ground rules, we have insisted on you keeping to them, and that was the right way to go about it.</p>
<p class="contents">I do, though, also want to say something self-critical about something that has bothered me for years, and since I myself once had the honour to present Parliament’s budget, and it is this: this House will, in the long term, have no credibility in negotiations with the Council or the Commission if we do not get a firm grip on our own budget. When I consider the unspent funds from the 2005 budget that we had to deal with yesterday when again transferring appropriations, or the struggle we had with our good friends the Social Democrats in order to get Parliament’s budget just EUR 20 million below the magic 20% limit – and I am obliged to the rapporteur, Mr Dombrovskis, for leading us in it – then we will have to give serious thought to what all this has to do with truth and clarity. A European Parliament that fails to manage 10% of the amount budgeted for in the manner prescribed, has a credibility problem, and it is one that we have to consider in a self-critical light.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to say something else about the financial perspective. I urge you to take home with you the lesson, which you have learned, that Europe consists of states with equal rights, not of old and new Member States. Europe adds up to a common interest, not to the sum of 25 national interests. If you bear that in mind, you will have a successful weekend; if you do not, it will be a flop. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This budget, while not perfect, is, in my opinion, relatively satisfactory, and I am delighted that the level of payment appropriations has been brought up to EUR 112 billion, that is to say 1.01% of GNI, and that our operating costs have been curbed and relatively stabilised. As permanent rapporteur for the Structural Funds within the Committee on Budgets, I might nevertheless have hoped that the Council would have granted more appropriations to all of these financial instruments, which remain the cornerstone of our policies aimed at reducing territorial disparities.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, I, like many of our fellow Members, am still waiting to hear the results of the European Council negotiations, and I should like to drive home the point that it is worth keeping in mind Parliament’s positions during these negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time now when we need Europe most, it is crucial that the Member States provide the European Union with genuine financial resources. We need Europe so that we can carry out an ambitious economic policy for its 450 million people. We need Europe so that we can carry out a common foreign and security policy, which is distinct from those of the self-contained empires throughout the world. To conclude – and contrary to the opinion expressed by some of our fellow Members with regard to brainwashing - we need Europe more than ever in order to build a project for society uniting us around shared values. That is my dream; I hope that it is yours too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are also 0.02% lower than the payments planned for 2005, which is now drawing to a close. This is certainly not good news, in particular for the new EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This fundamental objection notwithstanding, I should like to thank all those who have helped ensure that the 2006 budgetary procedure will soon come to an end. A total of two rounds of painstaking conciliation negotiations with the Council were needed to get this far, as well as the taking up of a firm position by both the negotiating group and Parliament as a whole. This is a particularly important message to send out at a time when the debate on the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective is ongoing, and when the positions of the Council and Parliament on this matter are unfortunately very different.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2006 budget sets a figure of almost EUR 112 billion to cover payments, which is the equivalent of 1.01% of the EU’s GNP. This is substantially higher than the level of payments proposed by the British Presidency for the individual years in the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective. As I see it, this should be one of our key arguments in the debate on the level of payments for the 2007-2013 period, given that the European Union, far from wanting to abandon the funding of any of its present activities, is currently seeking to increase its involvement.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by thanking the rapporteurs for having drafted the reports. I should also like to express the hope that we will succeed in implementing this year’s budget in its entirety, so that late 2006 does not see us complaining that we have failed to adopt a rational approach to the expenditure of such a modest sum. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union can only offer a successful response to global changes through unity and the exploitation of knowledge, innovation and creativity at a European level. This is the essence of the Lisbon Strategy. </p>
<p class="contents">All 25 Member States of the European Union have committed themselves to fulfilling the goals of this strategy. Its fulfilment will of course require adequate financial resources, both in the financial perspective and in the annual budget. A budget geared towards development is therefore extremely important for the common European future. </p>
<p class="contents">The budget for 2006 is not important simply for the coming year, but will also be of key importance in the event of our failure to agree on the future financial perspective. For this reason I would prefer the budget to be significantly more development-orientated. Most of the resources in the budget are still earmarked for agriculture and structural measures, within which we find agriculture once again.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the increase in comparison with the 2005 budget, it is the area of internal policies that receives the smallest amount of resources in the 2006 budget and thereby the developmental part of European policies. The ceiling set by the financial perspective has only been achieved for rural development and internal policies remain more than two percent below the threshold. </p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless I remain realistic, and I wish to congratulate the European Union negotiators for their perseverance with the priorities that were set and for the funds they managed to secure. The increase in funds, although lower than we would wish for programmes that are of great importance for the Lisbon Strategy, is significant, and says much about the direction we have mapped out for the future. In the event of failed negotiations on the financial perspective, this means more development-orientated spending of European financial resources than was set out in the Luxembourg and British proposals for 2007-2013.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like firstly to stress the fact that more than six programmes subject to codecision have been provided with EUR 100 million, which I believe to be very significant and stimulating. I believe that this is the direction that the Community budget should take over the coming years.</p>
<p class="contents">The effort that has been made in relation to small and medium-sized businesses is particularly relevant. We must not forget that, at the end of the day, we have 23 million SMEs in Europe, which represent no more and no less than two-thirds of all jobs in the private sector. There is therefore no doubt that the success of SMEs will mean success for growth and employment in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">However — and this is an important ‘however’ — research and development are also a fundamental pillar in terms of the competitiveness of our companies, of the competitiveness of our economies. And there is a very worrying aspect here: the current financial perspective does not include an increase in the fund intended for research and development. Despite the fact that the British Presidency quite rightly – very rightly in fact – stresses the importance of research and development over and over again, there is no parallel budgetary effort in that direction.</p>
<p class="contents">The British proposal — which is not an original proposal, it has already been proposed by the Commission — to increase the funds of the European Investment Bank and, by means of soft credits and guarantees, to enhance research, is not a solution to the problem, but it must be a complementary instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">It is fundamental, if we want to maintain the consistency and credibility of a debate which focuses on competitiveness in innovation, development and research, that the financial perspective provides for the funds intended for research. Otherwise, we will be moving backwards, once again, with regard to the Lisbon objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This will conclude the European Union’s budget procedure for 2006 and the existing Financial Perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that after lengthy debates with the European Council it has been possible to reach a compromise. This was also important because the 2006 budget serves as a point of reference in taking decisions on the next Financial Perspective, that for 2007–2013. I hope that this week the Member States’ governments at the European Council will also be able to agree on the Council’s position with regard to the Financial Perspective. I call on the European Council, when debating this issue, also to take into account the opinion and ideas expressed in the European Parliament’s resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">The main priorities of the 2006 budget for the other EU institutions are enlargement and the effective and highly targeted use of EU budget resources. The first priority is connected with the successful completion of the 2004 round of enlargement, as well as preparations for the next round of enlargement, when Bulgaria and Romania will join. Unfortunately, once again it is necessary to point out that, although more than a year has passed since EU enlargement, many permanent staff posts set aside for the new Member States still remain vacant. One of the problems to be emphasised in this connection is the excessive red-tape and slow procedures for taking on staff. In accordance with the decision taken at first reading, the proposal at second reading is again to support all the permanent staff posts requested by the other institutions in connection with enlargement, and also other additional expenditure connected with enlargement, in order to ensure the success of the next round of EU enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">The second priority is effective and highly targeted use of EU budget resources. This priority encompasses such matters as: focusing EU institutional expenditure on fundamental tasks; giving support to new budget requests and permanent staff posts requests only after having assessed the possibility of redistributing resources and staff within the framework of the existing budget; giving support to new initiatives only after having assessed their impact on the budget and interinstitutional cooperation with a view to economical and effective use of budget resources. Both institutions with budgetary decision-making powers – the European Parliament and the Council – endorse the principles of budgetary discipline and the rational use of EU taxpayers’ money. At second reading the European Council proposed reverting to its initial position and reducing the administrative expenditure of the other institutions by 15 million euro as compared with the institutions’ original requests. It must be said that in many cases this reduction was implemented in an ill-considered manner, without thorough examination of the specific nature and problems of the institutions’ work. Nonetheless, during the conciliation meeting a compromise was reached whereby the European Council will not object to the amount of expenditure by the other institutions set by the European Parliament at first reading. Therefore, the proposal at the European Parliament’s second reading is to retain the amount of expenditure fixed at the European Parliament’s first reading, restoring part of the reductions in expenditure made by the European Council – in total by 7.5 million euro.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I should like to return to the issue of the Financial Perspective. During the conciliation meeting on the EU budget for 2006 it could be seen that the European Council and particularly the UK Presidency focused excessively on just a single issue – the minimum possible figure for payment appropriations. It only remains to hope that at this week’s European Council summit the Member States’ governments will be able to deal with EU issues within a wider perspective, and not reduce everything to just one question – the minimum possible figure for payment appropriations. Particularly striking proof of this tendency is provided by the unacceptable proposal by the UK Presidency to find a compromise between the older Member States at the expense of the new Member States, by reducing by 10 per cent the amount of EU funds accessible to the new Member States. We must remember that the Luxembourg Presidency had already proposed a significant reduction in the amount of resources to be directed towards the EU’s regional policy, in comparison with what the European Commission had announced. Fortunately, this proposal by the UK has already been withdrawn. It only remains to hope that the UK Presidency is serious about reaching a compromise this year on the Financial Perspective, and that its next proposal will be an improvement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
