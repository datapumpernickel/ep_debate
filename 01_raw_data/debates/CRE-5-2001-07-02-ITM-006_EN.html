<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallis (ELDR),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, I was struck today by an article in <span class="italic">The Wall Street Journal</span>; the subtitle read: "Why do America and Europe differ on the importance of consumer interests?" It went on to say, from a US point of view: "when it comes to putting the consumer at the center of its economic model, Europe remains stubbornly old-fashioned." E-commerce, of all types, still lags behind in Europe. By 2005, 11% of US retail sales will be online, only 6+% in western Europe. Our hope must be that this Commission initiative for a European Extra-Judicial Network will help build consumer e-confidence and force those European figures up. These were the problems that we wrestled with during the passage of the Brussels regulation: how to allow Europe's consumers access to cross-border justice without over-burdening business and yet, at the same time, exposing business to necessary competitive forces.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be clear that this is an attempt to deal with a large number of low-value cross-border consumer disputes, outside the normal legal system. Alternative means that almost replace the lower end of our traditional court systems will be introduced. This is a very ambitious project, and such an exercise needs to be seriously undertaken and properly funded. One of my greatest concerns about this initiative is its funding, both substantively and in terms of its publicity. Our citizens know where their local courts are, but will they know how or where to access the EEJ Net? From what I have seen, I am not over-optimistic.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, is the system coherent and efficient? At the moment, progress is very variable in the different Member States. The Commission must get tough in this respect, hence our suggestion of a service-level agreement with each clearing-house. Only such an arrangement will ensure that our citizens get the service that they really deserve.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to the amendments. We can happily accept Amendments Nos 2 and 3, but we have grave concerns about Amendment No 1. Not to allow the clearing-houses to give legal advice flies in the face of reality. Some of the centres already operating as Euroguichets, have trained lawyers on their staff. They could not function without that. We cannot offer our citizens a second-rate service. Good legal advice, or knowledge, at the outset of a claim is essential if it is not to veer off in the wrong direction, causing aggravation, disappointment and denial of justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, let us turn to the legislative method, ADR and the EEJ Net, are examples of soft law or co-regulation. If this is the way of the future, it is important that Parliament be fully involved from start to finish. For example, most of us would applaud the other sectoral initiative in this field, the FIN Net dealing with financial services for instance, but when was this initiative referred to Parliament? If we are replacing or enhancing our legal system and access to justice, these issues are key to civil society and they cannot and must not be tackled without the input of democratically elected Members. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For this reason consumer protection matters at least as much. It comes in two forms. First, it provides legal protection, and, secondly, it provides a means of enforcing that protection. Clearly, especially as regards small claims across international borders – in other words, between different legal systems – conventional court systems will be of limited real help, as Mrs Wallis has just pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence we welcome this initiative to create a user-friendly, extra-judicial network across Europe. Indeed we believe it should go beyond the physical limits of the Union since the Net is no respecter of national boundaries. As is so often the case, the devil lies in the detail.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">McCarthy (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, Mrs Wallis' report is an important contribution to the debate on Community policy on out-of-court settlement of consumer disputes. I also commend her recommendations to this House, and indeed share her concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know from our own experience that lengthy and costly litigation through the courts is losing its appeal as a means to resolve disputes. The notion that most people want judges, well-dressed lawyers and fine courtrooms as a setting to resolve their disputes is no longer correct. People with problems, like people with pains, want relief and they want it as quickly and as inexpensively as possible. The success of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms is beginning to create a cultural shift away from traditional litigation.</p>
<p class="contents">In a recent case in the UK, an eleven-month trial running into millions of pounds was replaced and resolved by mediation in a matter of days. We see examples of this across Europe. But if the single market is to grow, then we need to make it easier for consumers to shop across borders with greater confidence. This will only happen if consumers can buy goods and services and be confident and secure that if problems arise they can be resolved easily. Not in the first instance in court where the average cost for a cross-border case is EUR 2 500 and it takes between 23 and 29 months to resolve.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, we know that consumers are not encouraged to shop on the Internet outside their own Member State and that national consumer organisations – including in my own Member State – are not advising consumers to go down this route because it is fraught with difficulties. My own personal experience with Internet shopping has not inspired me with e-confidence. After purchasing CDs from a renowned high street store, namely HMV, I received an incomplete order with a promise of further delivery. Most reputable shopping sites ensure that money is not taken from an account. Two months on I have still to receive outstanding items and my visa card has been debited the full amount. Yet the value of these items is small and court redress would be costly and nonsensical.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumers are also increasingly tempted to buy even more expensive items across borders, like washing machines, fridges, financial services and cars. ADR is a valuable way to access justice providing services and remedies which are appropriate to the cost of the item. But it is not the panacea to all consumer disputes. The consumer must still have the right to go to court as a last resort. In the absence of an agreement directly with the trader or the trading site, the consumer should be encouraged to look at the benefits of ADRs. It is vital, as Mrs Wallis, has said, that the consumer is aware and informed of this option.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own Member State, citizens advice bureaux are acting as a clearing-house. Consumers who make claims have, therefore, a local point of access and information. This is vital. For consumers in the UK there is an even bigger bonus as a by-product of boosting confidence in crossborder shopping on the Internet. We can shop in a larger market and often buy goods up to a third cheaper. This has to be a benefit in what we call "rip-off Britain", by driving down high prices in our own over-priced internal home market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not only can this be a means of coping with the ever increasing pressure on regular, judicial bodies; more than anything, it offers citizens a low threshold for the swift and inexpensive settlement of complaints.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, over the past couple of years, when dealing with different consumer issues, such as remote sales, I have time and again stressed the need for alternative ways of settling disputes in order for the internal market to function well. Consequently, the alternative settlement of disputes has been included explicitly in a number of directives.</p>
<p class="contents">The internal market has given consumers the opportunity to expand their horizons enormously, and they no longer rely on what is on offer within the national market. Certainly at a time when cross-border sales and purchases are increasingly being made via modern communications methods, the benefits of the European market are becoming apparent.</p>
<p class="contents">But the consumer may also be dissatisfied at times. This applies at Member State, as well as international, level. In the case of cross-border purchases, the complaints procedure is much longer but, above all, also more laborious. Many consumers are so put off by the complex procedures – not helped by the fact that they are drafted in a foreign language – that they do not pursue their complaints. That is deplorable.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this, I welcome the Commission’s proposal with open arms. I should also like to congratulate Mrs Wallis who has managed to pinpoint a few sore points in her report, with which I could not agree more.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to mention a few more key words with regard to the information desks to be set up. These need to be simple procedures, a low threshold for the consumer who is looking for legal solutions and sound regulations governing the use of the consumer’s own language. As for the latter, the Commission should reconsider how it intends to implement its plans practically speaking. I should also like to know when the information desks will be set up in the different Member States. The Netherlands plans to launch these in 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the information desks should focus on the role of offering guidance to the consumer. In that respect, I do not see eye to eye with Mrs Wallis. The real legal advice must therefore be given by duly qualified people. I also believe that the information desk should not, and cannot, act in the role of advocate, for then it would be responsible for the advice given. In my view, the information desk should be a facility and an effective guide and must act as a conduit to channel disputes to the alternative settlement of disputes procedure, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I believe that my amendment should be carefully re-read, also by the rapporteur. We run too many risks when we start issuing them with legal tasks. I speak from experience as Chairman of the Disputes Settlement Committees Foundation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This entails putting into place systems which will allow the 370 million consumers of the European Union to access justice promptly, and to secure redress when consumer rights are infringed. Justice delayed is justice denied. This is why I welcome this communication, which seeks to put in place procedures to deal with out-of-court settlements of consumer disputes. It is up to the 15 Member States of the European Union to implement the provisions of this recommendation. Each Member State will have to put in place procedures which can deal with out-of-court settlements of consumer disputes.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, these new structures will be able to help resolve cross-border disputes for aggrieved consumers within the European Union. Each government within the European Union will also have to set up central contact points, which will provide consumers with the requisite information about out-of-court resolution disputes bodies which are operational within their jurisdiction. Such central contact points will explain to consumers to whom they may address their complaints and seek appropriate redress. The central contact points will provide information and assistance with regard to the resolution of cross-border disputes within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge the European Commission to allocate substantial funds to ensure that this new scheme is widely publicised across the European Union. If we want these new structures to be a success, wide publicity is going to have to be put in place. These new procedures are also going to have to be monitored in a structured manner, so as to ensure that any discrepancies in the operation of these new schemes within the different Member States of the European Union are ironed out.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, this proposal is only part of a range of measures implemented by the European Union to protect consumer rights. Consumers need to be protected, both in the off-line world and in the increasingly important on-line world where consumers are purchasing many goods and services over the Internet. A new information technology age has arrived. We must ensure that consumers' rights are protected as these technologies continue. I congratulate the rapporteur on this fine report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, and the rapporteur, Mrs Wallis, makes this point very well, the best always arrives late and is often the enemy of the good, which appears in the meantime. We must, therefore, express our satisfaction with the Commission’s limited initiative. This indicates a possible way forward for the rapid and inexpensive resolution of often low-value consumer disputes. What is required, as we know, is the creation of a European Extrajudicial Network, which is capable of resolving these disputes by means of the credibility, probity, transparency and technical expertise of organisations that have arisen from the free association of consumers and which are able to form a chain of control that protects consumer rights and the average quality of life of Europe’s citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">This would enable us to move towards regulating the protection of the economic rights of private individuals and removing the burden of bureaucracy imposed on them by the cumbersome traditional legal machinery. Unlike the invisible hand, the internal consumer market is, in this case, organising its own self-regulation, which will be coordinated and supported by the European institutions, thereby enhancing the credibility of the Union itself and its closeness to the citizens. Mr President, the way ahead is clear; Mrs Wallis has explained how we must now progress and my group will therefore vote in favour of the report we are now debating. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This largely comes from my experience of legal practice, both in the area of domestic law in my own Member State and in the area of international commercial arbitration. I had the honour of being a member the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce for seven years, and drafted the last piece of legislation in my own Member State on International Commercial Arbitration, so I am a convinced advocate of the benefits of arbitration, as distinct from court procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I believe that the establishment of the EEJ Net is an essential step in ensuring that consumers have practical access to simple, low-cost and effective means of resolving cross-border disputes. It is the natural follow-up to the 1998 Commission communication on access to justice and the notification by Member States of their out-of-court bodies applying the principles set out in Recommendation 98/257. In addition, this is a significant step forward in fulfilling the Tampere Council conclusions in providing better access to justice in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The continuing expansion of economic activity within the internal market means more and more that consumers' activities are not confined to their own country. The continued growth of e-commerce, coupled with the introduction of the euro, underlines the urgency of the need to actively promote consumer confidence to ensure a truly competitive and effective internal market. The involvement and support of all the Community institutions, including the European Parliament, is essential to raise the profile of this initiative and to ensure its effective delivery and to guarantee its eventual success. Member States, in close cooperation with the Commission, have already made substantial progress since this initiative was proposed in March last year.</p>
<p class="contents">All, with the exception of Germany, have now informed the Commission of the body that will perform the functions of their national clearing-house and the process of setting up these bodies is under way. The Commission is providing financial assistance for the start-up costs and will examine how best to provide further infrastructure and targeted support. In addition, both Norway and Iceland have expressed their wish to participate and have been attending meetings with Member States' experts and with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also examining how best the enlargement candidate countries can be brought into the network. Much work has been completed with Member States' experts and with wider stakeholders to turn the network into a successfully functioning reality. In particular, one result of this work has been a Memorandum of Understanding, setting out the minimum functions and operational guidelines for the clearing-houses, which is now close to finalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">This document marks an important step in ensuring coherent cooperation throughout the network. It includes requirements for the provision of practical information and advice to be given to consumers, a general system for complaint handling, based on the European Complaint Forum, its translation, and monitoring to ensure the network operates efficiently, the requirement for either the clearing-house or the national authority to make practical arrangements with national ADRs to ensure smooth cooperation and the need to monitor their compliance with the principles in the Commission recommendation. Network cooperation is envisaged through regular meetings, the development of network strategies and continual review of the network to ensure constant improvement. Uniform methods for collecting data on the performance of the network, for its evaluation and to identify specific consumer problems are also part of the plan.</p>
<p class="contents">The group of Member State experts meets tomorrow to finalise these details. It is also provisionally agreed that the network should become operational on the 16 October of this year. This coincides with the launch in Belgium of their Euroguichet, which will act as the clearing-house, and with the Annual General Assembly of the Consumer Associations that takes place on 18 and 19 October. I see the EEJ Net initiative as a priority. It is an essential component of a number of initiatives currently being developed by the Commission aimed at creating confidence to enable consumers to actively take part in and benefit from the internal market. It will also be important for businesses in facilitating greater cross-border trade, particularly of course, for SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">It will put the practical framework in place to allow the ADRs' potential for resolving cross-border disputes to be fully exploited. The organic nature of this framework will enable it to be sufficiently flexible and adaptable to meet new challenges and be kept under constant review to ensure the delivery of an effective mechanism for all citizens and for the effective operation of the internal market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The others seem to me to be perfectly reasonable. For instance, Amendment No 3 makes reference to the involvement of the EEA states. Some of them are already involved and we want more of them involved, including the applicant countries. So the Commission fully supports this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
