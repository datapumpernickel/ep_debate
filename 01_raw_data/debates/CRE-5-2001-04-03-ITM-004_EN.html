However, this new system for budgetary and own resources calculation will not apply until the new own resources decision comes into effect. When ESA 95 was adopted, it was assumed that the new own resources decision would be adopted in 1999. We now know that in fact that did not happen until September 2000. It will probably come into force on 1 January 2002, if all the Member States ratify it without delay. So that is the legal position.</p>
<p class="contents">It is evident that the Member States have now adjusted their own national accounting systems and that data is no longer available on the 1979 basis. This means that the letter of the Commission's proposal amending the regulation on the determination of Member States' payments to the VAT-based own resource does not match actual practice. We, the entire Committee on Budgets, are assuming that the switch from ESA 79 to ESA 95 will have no impact on the level of own resources, that is neither on the balance between the Member States nor, of course, on the total volume of own resources. So far, so good. Honourable Members will perhaps think that this is a rather dry subject, but we have taken advantage of this opportunity under the codecision procedure, and we should never forego any opportunity to emphasise the importance of own resources in setting the European Union's budget and financial perspective. When you do that, it does not seem so dry any more, because it is no secret that Parliament, as one arm of the budgetary authority, would like to have full budget rights, that is to say codecision not just on expenditure but also on the revenue side.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we are now trying to take a tiny step towards that goal. The Commission is willing to actively support us in this task. I really wish to specifically thank the Commissioner very sincerely for that. It is willing to present a working paper on the state of play regarding the collection of own resources to us at the beginning of the budget process. This document will also provide information on good and in some cases not so good collection practice in the Member States. And it will provide us with a good basis for discussion, for a debate with the Council on EU revenue.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is also no secret that on this issue the Council's approach is just as unwieldy as the rather long title of the regulation whose amendment we are discussing right now. Not only will it not consider codecision with Parliament on own resources, as was apparent at Nice, it does not even want to talk with us in either a formal or informal trialogue. And please note that we are not talking about negotiations here, just discussions. The Council is simply refusing to cooperate with Parliament on this – and not just refusing to cooperate but refusing to grant Parliament some of its parliamentary rights.</p>
<p class="contents">This not only affects the budget, it seems to be a general trend at present. Members are having to fight for their parliamentary rights as regards the framework legislation on financial services. We are having to fight as regards the directive on the European Company statute. We are having to fight over human resources for the common foreign and security policy. I really do not claim that this is an exhaustive list, but one thing is clear: safeguarding Parliament's rights is not something that can be taken for granted in 2001 – Members themselves have to constantly fight to secure these rights. That is why I am utterly convinced that my colleagues, including the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, will firmly support us when we insist that there should at least be a discussion with the Council on our own resources.</p>

This Parliament has tried, through every means possible, to influence the Council on its new decision on own resources. Unfortunately, and despite the fact that Mrs Haug last year played the roles of both general rapporteur for the 2001 budget and permanent rapporteur for the European Parliament on own resources, we were not able to make progress in the conciliation procedure with the Council in a manner which was satisfactory to us. The Council continues to believe that revenues are its exclusive prerogative and does not allow any significant progress in relation to Parliament’s participation. This is an unfortunate circumstance which those of us who deal with own resources have to face. Our role is purely consultative, and we believe that this involves the very definition of Parliament’s competences. The modification of the European System of Accounts, from the replaced 1979 system to the more representative 1995 system, is a good measure which will allow a more realistic and representative revenue since it will provide a more accurate reflection of the accounts of each Member State. We fully accept the first amendment, in particular because it refers to the neutrality of this change in the system of accounts. And, since our powers as MEPs are so limited in the field of own resources, the rapporteur’s request for more information, even of a quarterly nature, will improve our position. We therefore also fully recommend the second amendment. The third amendment, if we take account of the comments of our Chairman, Mr Wynn, may be a little more complicated, but I believe we must vote in favour on this amendment and then we see what result it has later. The result will possibly be the same as always: they will ignore us.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, the Interinstitutional Agreement of 1999 allows us to hold a dialogue on own resources. These amendments increase the possibility of such a dialogue and must therefore be accepted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work.</p>
<p class="contents">The collection system for contributions is a complicated political game that results in Member States attempting to maximise their own benefits and minimise what they pay out. Although the size of EU contributions is determined as a share of GNP the structure of the contribution is very different from one country to the next. In Member States where there are large ports revenue from customs duty is considerable and, for that reason, the amount of duty paid in contributions is substantial.</p>
<p class="contents">In Berlin there was a lengthy dispute regarding contributions. As a result, EU financing is becoming more dependent on fourth resources, i.e., direct transfers of funds out of national parliaments’ budgets. The increase in portage from 10% to 25% was a clear concession to the countries with large ports. The resulting gap in the EU budget is to be bridged by increasing the GNP share. The other change is the progressive reduction in VAT-based contributions, which will also increase the GNP share. This is leading to a situation where EU contributions are becoming tied more than ever to budget transfers from individual Member States and gross national earnings, which must now probably be considered only fair.</p>
<p class="contents">Only the question of the reduction in contributions made by the United Kingdom will remain open in the future. In the future enlargement will wreak havoc on the EU budget. There are a hundred million inhabitants in the new Member States, representing only 4% of GNP, however. As a result, the contributions from the old Member States will clearly increase from what they are now, and may even double. In any future decisions taken we must ensure that a rise in contributions does not jeopardise development in the old Member States, especially in the matter of increased regional and social inequality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although these common technical platforms appear to be somewhat removed from the common reality, they are important instruments for tax harmonisation in the Union, which I hope will be a first step towards genuine Europe-wide tax federalism. We must realise that reticence was clearly displayed on this point in a number of quarters at Nice as well. In fact, when we talk of federalism and subsidiarity, we must remember that the traditional distribution of roles, powers and competences should always be accompanied by the requisite level of financial resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This data, which is collected via the integrated economic accounts system, is used for various important purposes, such as the own resources ceiling, the calculation of gross national product, the share according to which Member States' contributions are collected and for determining Member States' payments to the VAT-based own resource. The legal basis that we are discussing now relates to the last of these.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are talking about now is instead of using the old 1975 basis to use the new statistical basis so as to avoid statistical double counting or costly re-accounting procedures that lead to many errors. Here in Parliament this has been dealt with by the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. The latter supports the Commission proposal without reservation, whereas the Committee on Budgets has now formulated various amendments. Amendments Nos 2 and 3 do not relate to this proposal concerning the statistical basis. Amendment No 2 requests a document on the collection of own resources and Amendment No 3 calls in particular for the trialogue to consider own resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Haug, the Commission cannot accept these last two amendments, although we have agreed to comply with Parliament's wish – the wish of the Committee on Budgets – to provide more information on the collection of own resources in a working paper. This will mean a delay in the whole decision-making process. The Commission regrets this, as the Court of Auditors and also the Committee on Budgetary Control have repeatedly criticised the Commission for using the old statistical basis for calculating VAT contributions when collecting own resources.</p>
