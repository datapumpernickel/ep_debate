<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fernández Martín (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Thank you, Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation. I take the floor to defend the European Community’s contribution to the fight against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, a bittersweet task.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that we have contrived to approve a significant financial contribution by the Union to the creation of a Global Fund as suggested by the United Nations’ Secretary-General. The aim is to fight against the three most common contagious diseases in the world. They affect the least developed countries who find themselves trapped in a vicious circle of poverty and disease. The higher the level of poverty, the greater the risk of contagious diseases. In turn, a higher level of disease aggravates the degree of poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">It is pleasing, too, that we have achieved this in record time, through the codecision procedure, with urgency and at first reading. A number of amendments were tabled and negotiated with the Council. In our view, these improved the text of the original proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I have to say how much we regret that the Council and, especially, the Commission, have put us in such a difficult position. They have presented us with a text which, as originally drafted, bypassed Parliament and denied us the right to exercise our responsibilities as a budgetary authority. No account was taken of Parliament’s repeated statements on the need for much more energetic action in the context of a global strategy to fight against poverty, and, in particular, against AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. I refer, in particular, to the report by Bashir Khanbhai, who is with us today. A lot of time and energy went into it. It was approved by a resolution in plenary on 4 October this year, yet the initial document put before us did not even refer to it.</p>
<p class="contents">In their common declaration last May, the Council and the Commission welcomed the United Nations Secretary-General’s proposal to set up this Global Fund. Back in July, the Commission announced its intention to commit EUR 120 million to finance it. It was only last month, however, that Parliament received the documentation enabling it to begin its work. Furthermore, the documentation was incomplete and did not allow us to work properly.</p>
<p class="contents">It is only fair to note that, in the last fortnight, Parliament and the Council have demonstrated more of the willingness and flexibility required to reach agreement on the amendments we wished to introduce. I trust the latter will be adopted tomorrow morning.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, the additional nature of the contribution to the Fund is a key issue. As stated in our Amendment No 2, the first EUR 60 million from the 2001 budget should be added to existing resources and not withdrawn from other budget lines already earmarked for development programmes. As stated in Amendment No 3, the EUR 60 million in question should not pre-empt or impose conditions on future annual contributions. This is clearly stated in our Amendment No 4. I shall probably be tabling an oral amendment on this tomorrow, Commissioner, prior to the vote.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view too, given the very nature of these diseases it is crucial to maintain the Union’s contribution to the fund over a period of time. The fight against AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria must continue to be pursued energetically in the years to come. If it is not, it will be unsuccessful and the EUR 60 million we are contributing will be to no avail.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament cannot abrogate its responsibilities as a budgetary authority. In Amendment No 6, we therefore request the Commission to make all the necessary information available to Parliament. As stated in Amendment No 7, the last of our amendments, we shall then be in a position to guarantee the suitability, transparency, sound management and working practices of the Global Fund. A report will duly be prepared, and should be included in future annual reports on contributions to external aid that the Community will be required to present. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In September last year the Commission held a conference on the subject in Brussels but no action followed. Four million of the poorest people died in one year. In July 2001 another meeting took place in Genoa and Mr Prodi announced to the world's media a donation of EUR 120 million.</p>
<p class="contents">My report, unanimously approved on 4 October this year has been sitting on the shelf collecting dust. The Council adopted a proposal for a legal basis for the fund to be implemented but so far not one euro has been given, and a further 2 million people have died. When terrorist bombs cause death the victims attract money very fast but the 3-4 million people who die from diseases are not in our minds.</p>
<p class="contents">Why does it take the Commission so long to present a plan for implementation when they know that every day 10 000 people are dying? We promise with pride but we fail to deliver. Do these people not matter to us?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioners have gone. There is no interest. Look at the audience in this Chamber, hardly anyone is here. That shows what priority the European Union gives to such an important project. This is not FYROM or Macedonia. This is AIDS affecting the poorest people in the world and it is about time that the EU contribution is not just EUR 20 per person dying, not just 1% of what is required, but that it is EUR 6 billion per annum. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If anything needed a visionary, innovative and international response, it is the prevalence of these communicable diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to support, in principle, this global fund to fight communicable diseases. We want to see it concentrate on prevention as well as treatment of all three diseases. We want an innovative and workable governance framework. We want a true international partnership so it is not just seen as donor business as usual. We want funding mechanisms that fast-track funds so that we can maintain the political commitment and mobilise further resources.</p>
<p class="contents">These are difficult issues and I sympathise with the Commission for the delays that have been forced on it in bringing forward this request for a legal base. But it should reflect also on why the second reading proposals on our own support through the poverty diseases line were cut back from Parliament's demands, and why President Prodi announced EUR 60 million of support from the global health fund from the ACP countries, which it was not his right to do and, as we heard in this Chamber from their President-in-Office they oppose. We must be concerned that this money actually adds to the global efforts and does not simply go into the pockets of the pharmaceutical companies.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments that we have constructively negotiated with the Commission and Council improve this proposal: the recognition that we need additional money, the fact that this is simply a first payment and the request to the Commission both to bring forward a legal base for future contributions and to provide a report so that some of these information issues can be dealt with.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask Commissioner Nielson if he can give us a time-scale as to when that might be brought forward during the course of next year so we can deal with it properly in the budget process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We were naturally very encouraged by the decision to release a further EUR 120 million. However, the proposal put before us today, after some prevarication, only amounts to EUR 60 million. Furthermore, this will come from the existing budget. This is not extra money. These funds are not ongoing. We also wish to question the allocation of this money to a single international fund. What is the aim of this fund? Is it only for prevention? Or will it also provide access to treatment for people living in the countries of the South? Will it provide health care infrastructures and medicines? These are the questions we must ask. How will this fund be managed? How will those that need this money, namely the countries of the South, be involved in these decisions? It is not simply up to the donor countries. I think that we must ask ourselves all these questions because people are dying everyday, but we have money and it is up to us to help them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to the WHO report published today, 40 million people have so far become HIV positive and 3 million will die before the end of this year. It is clear that the majority of the people affected by this disease live in Sub-Saharan Africa. AIDS is not just a crisis in terms of human health; it also constitutes an ecological and economic disaster. The WHO predicts that the least developed countries will lose a fifth of their GNP between now and 2010 because of the disease. In countries like Zambia, one million children will die. The funds announced may appear to be substantial, but as my fellow Member said a moment ago, some questions remain to be answered. Who will manage these funds? Will the money really reach the people in the greatest need, for whom it was intended?</p>
<p class="contents">As we are all aware, work to combat these diseases must involve the provision of infrastructures such as dispensaries, social support structures and doctors. This cannot be done when we have diktats from the IMF and the World Bank which do not allow us to employ civil servants and doctors.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again Mr President, I would like to call for the cancellation of Third World debt and for this money to be allocated to education, prevention and health. This is the right way to combat AIDS in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish by saying that we can no longer tolerate the arrogant attitude the pharmaceutical industry adopted last year in relation to certain countries. This is totally unacceptable. We know that pregnant women who are given AZT give birth to healthy babies. I hope this arrogance will cease once and for all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Let me first of all thank you for the kind reaction from Parliament. The Commission requested the urgency procedure to establish a legal base for a financial commitment to the fund under this year's budget amending the legal base of budget line B7-6211 Aid for Poverty Related Diseases in Developing Countries. We proposed to transfer EUR 60 million to this line.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal is of high political importance as the fund has attracted wide interest and these are high hopes for its success. I agree with the content of comments by Mr Sylla and Mr Rod reflecting the fact that there are indeed many questions to be asked. We still have many unanswered questions. This is the real reason why it has not been easy or possible for the Commission to move this dossier forward in a very nice, elegant and timely manner. It has not yet been negotiated at international level, but we still need the budget operation that we are discussing tonight. I regret that the proposal was transmitted so late in the year to the budget authority but this reflects the fact that we did not have anything good or clear enough before that.</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate your determination in Parliament to make this process a success, despite these procedural hurdles. I welcome the outcome of the discussions last week between the three institutions. I note that Parliament has made further efforts to take account of Council's wish for further changes in the recitals. The Commission can accept the oral amendment proposed by the honourable MEPs here today and for which you will vote tomorrow, in order to obtain a timely agreement by Council.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards accounting, auditing and reporting, we want this to be totally transparent vis-à-vis Parliament. I would however, for the sake of transparency, like to express some sort of warning because if the idea is to pool resources in a global fund, we must avoid becoming such a difficult partner in this work by insisting on our systems of reporting, our auditing and our accounting procedures. This is the problem we have already with other international organisations and where the Commission is an inadequate partner in many cases.</p>
<p class="contents">Some adaptability is also needed if we are to be a well-functioning partner in this endeavour. The Commission has no reservations as to the actual amendments presented here but we need to keep in mind that this is a collective effort and that is the whole core of the idea.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to Mr Khanbhai's remarks that not one euro has been given here, let me say that every day we are pumping money into the fight against AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis. It would be a big mistake to think – and even worse to express – that the only thing we are doing is in relation to this fund. Everybody knows that this is not the case but we hope this fund will add something to the other ways in which we are working. That is what we are essentially trying to ensure in the negotiations taking place right now, to see if we can straighten out these contentious issues.</p>
<p class="contents">We are preparing a revised regulation for the B7-6211<span class="bold"> </span>budget line. This longer-term legal basis will serve as the base for implementation of the Programme for Action on Communicable Diseases in the years 2003-2006. It is proposed that future support to global initiatives such as the global fund would be financed from this budget line. We still have to discuss the level of funding. In the first reading of the Budget for 2002, Parliament proposed a new specific budget line for the fund from next year onwards but we have now agreed to regroup this specific budget line with the one for poverty diseases and use one integrated legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">As I indicated before, the Commission wishes to continue exchanges with Parliament on the modalities and working methods of the fund over the coming period. The fund is expected to be up and running from January 2002 and all members of the fund's transitional working group are in discussion, trying to achieve consensus on a large number of outstanding and difficult issues. The Commission is trying to play a constructive and active role in these discussions and I look forward to reporting to Parliament on this process. I also look forward to working together with Parliament to make this new fund something which will actually increase the efficiency of our response to the struggle against these diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me reconfirm our proposal to allocate an addition EUR 60 million from the 9th EDF funds once the Cotonou Agreement is ratified and discussions have been finalised with the ACP Group. These funds will be earmarked for activities in ACP countries. I agree, this complicates, to some extent, the administrative function of a global fund, but I do not think we have any choice here. This is a fact of life and it is not the biggest problem we are facing.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you once again for the cooperative manner in which Parliament has handled this matter in spite of the difficulties that we have had. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
