In reality, it is a directive which modifies five other directives, specifically four Council directives and one European Parliament and Council directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The motor insurance sector has become very important from economic and social points of view as a result of the significant role cars play in our lives. From an economic point of view, it is significant because of the importance of the insurance companies and, from the citizens’ point of view, because of its possible consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, it is a sector in which there has been significant intervention from the Member States, with the creation of minimum services of an obligatory nature, which everybody must respect, and with compensation from Member States for cases in which there is no insurance cover.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission presented the proposal on 7 June 2002. It was discussed in this Parliament with Mr Rothley as rapporteur – who is no longer a Member of this House – and following approval by Parliament at first reading in 2003, the Commission and the Council made an amendment which lead to a Council common position which is now very close to the amendments proposed by Parliament at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now at second reading. Specifically, the Committee on the Internal Market approved a text at second reading on 14 December and we hope that this Wednesday we can hold a final vote on the text.</p>
<p class="contents">On certain points, there are still differences between the position of Parliament and the common position of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, with regard to trailers: what do we do about these vehicles that may or may not be identified with the main vehicle? Furthermore, this is a sector in which vehicles that have not previously been insurable could become so, which would have a series of legal and economic consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to legal costs, Parliament wants these to be included in the damages paid to victims.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, with regard to the amount of damages, I believe that at the moment we are discussing more than one difference with regard to the formulation of the amount itself, so that Parliament’s proposal cannot be interpreted as implying a restriction in the amount, but rather the principle for damages.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, direct action against the insurer. Parliament wants the insured party, the victim, to be able to pursue the insurer through their local courts rather than through the insurer’s local courts.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, we have the issue of vehicle imports, in relation to which Parliament wants the State that the vehicle is destined for, to be the State responsible for the insurance of imported vehicles rather than State from which it originates.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, at the end of this debate, Parliament will have a picture of how the situation stands. We are very interested to hear the representative of the Commission, in order to find out the extent to which Parliament is keeping these amendments or accepting any other compromise amendments which may bring us closer to an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, I hope that Parliament and the Council will soon reach an agreement allowing us to adopt the directive, which would prevent us from having to follow a long formal co-decision procedure and would allow us, by means of an informal co-decision process, to resolve this problem within a very short space of time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">McCreevy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Medina Ortega, for a report prepared to a very tight schedule.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me recall that the area of motor insurance is a very good example of efficient cooperation between Parliament and the Commission. Parliament’s resolution of July 2001, prepared the ground for the Commission to bring forward its proposal for a fifth motor insurance directive. This shows very clearly that Parliament and the Commission are both aware of the practical importance of this legislation and I would like to thank Parliament for its support in improving the legislation in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal before us aims to introduce legislation that will affect millions of European citizens: drivers and potential victims of accidents, as well as, of course, insurers. It will make it easier for drivers to obtain insurance and will improve the protection of accident victims.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress that the common position adopted by the Council is a balanced and coherent text that retains the key elements of the Commission’s proposal and meets most of the concerns expressed by Parliament at first reading. I therefore recommend that Parliament accept, insofar as possible, the common position as it stands. We have to realise that we cannot achieve everything now. This is the fifth motor insurance directive and it will not be the last.</p>
<p class="contents">Before 20 July 2005, the Commission must submit to Parliament and the Council a report on the implementation of Article 6 of the fourth motor insurance directive. As part of its review, the Commission could also examine other points which cannot be resolved in the context of the fifth motor insurance directive. It is in this spirit that I would like to respond to the amendments currently before Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission could accept Amendments Nos 4 and 11, which improve the wording of the text. However, the Commission is not in a position to accept any of the other proposed amendments as tabled. Further work is needed before these amendments can be accepted and the Commission stands ready to discuss these amendments with you and the Council before your vote on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me explain the reasons why I see difficulties with the other amendments. The Commission already pointed to these at first reading. Amendments Nos 7 and 14, which aim to create a public Internet site in each Member State that would collect police reports of accidents, interfere with matters relating to police or judicial legislation. I understand the concern and welcome the efforts to improve the amendments by replacing the creation of a central body with an Internet site. However, as drafted, this proposal still goes beyond the specific scope and the legal basis of the motor insurance directives. It may also interfere with requirements governing the protection of personal data. The Commission is nevertheless ready to examine this matter further with a view to improving access by the parties involved in an accident to the official records of the accident, particularly if the accident occurs in a state other than the state of residence of the parties concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Amendments Nos 2, 9 and 13, which aim to ensure that the cost of legal proceedings should be covered by compulsory insurance, we must bear in mind that this would overlap with the voluntary insurance regulated in the directive on legal expenses insurance (87/344/EEC). Moreover, making such insurance compulsory would increase the cost of insurance for all consumers and could encourage abusive lawsuits instead of an out-of-court settlement of accidents. This would increase the cost of insurance in a number of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission recognises the need for insured persons to have access to legal redress if necessary. The costs of this could be prohibitive if not covered by an insurance policy. The Commission is therefore willing to consider the possibilities for making the offer of such insurance more widespread.</p>
<p class="contents">The intention behind Amendments Nos 1, 5, 8 and 15 on trailers is unclear. Trailers, independently of their weight, are already expressly covered by the insurance directives within the definition of a vehicle and therefore are subject to compulsory insurance. Any problem relating to the identification or registration of vehicles cannot be solved within the framework of an insurance directive. It also appears that the problems concerning trailers do not exist in a number of Member States where untowed trailers are registered and separately insured. If it is helpful, the Commission would be prepared to examine this matter further as part of its review of the fourth motor insurance directive.</p>
<p class="contents">As for Amendments Nos 3 and 10, I am afraid these will lead to a reduction in the insurance cover. Indeed, a combination of EUR 1 million per victim and EUR 5 million per event would be less favourable than the text in the common position, which creates an option and refers to 'claim' rather than to 'event'. I therefore believe that the text of the common position is better.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am not sure that Amendments Nos 6 and 12 are really needed. The possibility for victims of motor accidents to bring legal proceedings against the insurer in their Member State of residence is now covered in Recital 24 and Article 5 of the common position following the concern expressed by Parliament at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that with further effort it will be possible to find common ground and avoid an unnecessary conciliation procedure. The Commission is ready to help and counts on your support to bring this matter to a successful close. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sure my colleagues very much look forward to further encounters. If he adopts the constructive approach he has this evening in response to our amendments, then I believe we shall get on very well together and do a lot of successful work.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make a few introductory remarks before moving on to the substance of the second reading. Given that it is quite some time since the first reading, it is important to pay tribute to our colleague, Mr Rothley, who retired from Parliament at the last elections but worked on these insurance directives over a long period. I was closely involved in this work from 2001, but am a mere junior given the amount of work he has done. We should put on record, on behalf of Europe's motorists and unfortunate accident victims, our tribute to him for his persistent work in pressing the Commission and the Council to keep improving the motor vehicle insurance regime.</p>
<p class="contents">As you said, Commissioner, we are on the fifth directive, but we are already thinking about the sixth directive because this is a complex subject. In many ways it goes to the heart of the mission of those of us who want to see the internal market completed, because it has been very much a policy of continuous improvement. As we have moved forward, so issues have cropped up. We have asked you to tackle them and I am pleased to say that you have.</p>
<p class="contents">You identified in your speech, Commissioner, a number of the real benefits to the consumer, which we do not want to become obscured in detailed discussion. For example, in the single market, where people are becoming more mobile and taking their motor vehicle with them, they will be able to take their car with them without insurance problems when they move for temporary stays as students or in their professional lives. We hope there will be a lot more benefits once the Internal Market for Services Directive is approved – as I am sure it will be – because there will be many more people travelling around, delivering services from one country to another.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, if people want to buy cars during the course of their professional or personal life and bring those back, that will also be made easier. Their rights, when moving from one country to another, in respect of retaining their all-important no claims bonuses or their policy statements, are important details to get right. I believe we have done that.</p>
<p class="contents">As shadow rapporteur to my friend and colleague Mr Medina Ortega, I wish to thank him for picking up the reins on this. I see Mrs De Vits is here. She has also been very helpful in our work to move this matter forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we look forward to meeting with you and the Council before we vote on Wednesday because, as you said, I am sure we can reach agreement on the substantial points. I warmly welcome your suggestion that the whole issue of trailers should be looked at by you in conjunction with your mid-year communication. That is the right way to treat this subject. We have not had full information. I share your worries that the amendments we tabled actually worsen the position and are rather confusing. So, a time for reflection would be helpful. We should take up the Commission's offer in that respect.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to a number of the other details, we will sit around the table with you tomorrow, and am sure we will be able to deal with these because, above all, we are so close to agreement. Given the lapse of time since the first proposal by Mr Rothley, I want Europe's motorists, Europe's consumers and the unfortunate victims of accidents to have the best possible service.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope we will move forward on the database and Internet proposal to make information readily available, but overall I believe that the proposal we have is a good one. I commend it very much to my colleagues and look forward to reaching agreement tomorrow so that we can move this matter forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a first for the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, a first for the Commissioner, and perhaps also a first for a new style of politics in this Chamber, where we are now, in a way, engaging in anticipatory politics and attempting to reach agreements ahead of, or at the point of, second reading, rather than looking forward to the trench warfare that traditionally followed in the codecision procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">If we can make progress tomorrow on that basis, it would be a very happy augury for the way – as Mr Harbour puts it – that we do business with you, Commissioner, and with each other. I do not need to repeat Mr Harbour's encomia – I merely endorse them. But I would just say to the rapporteur that we should salute him for returning from Asia and seeing and experiencing the tsunami at first hand. It is not every day, or every year, that one would want to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we want to be here, every day, doing this. I entirely agree with what has been said by other speakers. Again, I do not need to repeat that this ideally combines both the processes of the internal market and the way in which we all provide employment and interest for each other in the age of the motor car, but it also brings a measure of consumer protection in all aspects of this fifth directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point to three things here and say to Commissioner McCreevy that, in a way, this process resembles the training of spies. There was a procedure called 'following from in front', and, in a way, we are following him from in front. We are trying to anticipate now what he will be saying to us over the rest of the week.</p>
<p class="contents">We hear very clearly what he says about trailers. Many Member States have different definitions, but we all know that if a declaration is forthcoming, we will be able to reach some kind of agreement, over time, on a common concept of 'trailer' among the Member States. It is rather like that nice American film 'The Straight Story', where it was established that if a lawn mower travelled on roads it became a road-using vehicle, even if it was not before. Road-using vehicles have to be covered. They have to be insured. We have to make quite a gentle start on the issue of insurance. We must not pile draconian penalties on 25 Member States which, at the moment, have very different systems of insurance and, indeed, very different income levels. So we hear what you say there.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point is on the issue of the third pillar. Here too, in terms of the alternative wording which I know you are going to put to us tomorrow, we have secured realistic options. I am confident we can find a compromise which achieves what all of us want, and can avoid what some of us fear by way of third pillar considerations. If my Member State can be relaxed about that, then anybody can. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Motor insurance directives deal with the greatest incidence of cross-border activity that directly affects the lives of many of our citizens, especially when problems occur: when they have an accident in another Member State. It is this issue of accidents that I wish to concentrate on. It seems to me that there are two outstanding items on which there are still differences between us, which I too hope we can solve.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to highlight the practicality of what Parliament's amendments seek to achieve by reference to the case of one of my constituents, which is sadly by no means a unique story and shows why we have to deal with these issues. This lady and her partner had a motorbike accident five years ago in another country. He was killed, she was seriously injured. The other party was the subject of criminal proceedings. After five years of lawyers' costs and problems, still there was no offer of compensation. Finally, with pressure on the insurers from myself, we got an offer. She has huge lawyers' costs in two countries. She has trailed backwards and forwards to a foreign country for medical examination. That cannot be the way that these matters should have to be dealt with, but it is not an uncommon story.</p>
<p class="contents">The Legal Aid Directive that we have is so minimal that it will not help with legal costs in these sorts of cases. Most insurers offer some form of legal expense insurance for a fairly minimal premium – say, EUR 15 per year. Why not make that compulsory? If we cannot make the insurance compulsory, can we at least make the offer of such insurance compulsory, so that there is some hope for people like my constituent? We have to make sure that the amount of cover is sufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Linked to this question is that of being able to bring proceedings in your own Member State. If my constituent had been able to do that, life would have been very much easier. That right exists if you read the motor insurance directives and the Brussels Regulation together – it is a matter of fact. If it is a matter of fact, why are we not prepared to be transparent about this and tell our citizens, in the <span class="italic">body</span> of this directive, that they have that right? I do not see the problem. These amendments are founded on a genuine wish to make our citizens' lives better when they find themselves in these tragic and vulnerable circumstances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today’s debate deals with a very important directive on car drivers and accident victims, which standardises rules and regulations throughout Europe, thereby creating legal certainty and simplifying procedures. This directive can affect any one of us, and so I have prepared myself for amendments, both at its first and second readings, by having many conversations with insurance companies, motorist associations – such as the ÖAMTC – and people who have suffered accidents.</p>
<p class="contents">Both today and in tomorrow’s discussions, there are four points that I would like to highlight. The first is compensation for legal costs. Our experience, Commissioner, is that failure to compensate for lawyers’ fees and court costs is at present, in a number of countries, making access to the courts more difficult for victims of accidents, or indeed, putting it beyond their financial reach, and that it results, in many cases, in the cost of going to law exceeding the amount of compensation they can expect. This is a valuable and long-needed addition to the directive, and I am glad that action has been taken to take it into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is minimum insurance cover. I believe that the proposed minimum cover for material damage is as inadequate as the one that already applies.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I would like to say that I very much welcome the introduction of the provision according to which injured parties can bring legal proceedings against the body entrusted with the settlement of claims in their own country. I see this as particularly important.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the proposal to establish a central body and to post all traffic accident reports on an Internet site is essential, for practice has demonstrated that the lack of any specific provision on this subject can result in the settlement of claims being delayed by months.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we can reach agreement on these four areas by tomorrow, as all the parties concerned urgently need this directive and, in consequence, greater legal certainty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was a reference to the public telephone booths in Ireland, which were allowed to continue in service thanks to a European directive on account of them being recognised as a service of public interest. It was immediately obvious to the Irish that we in this European Parliament are concerned with very concrete matters.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also applied this test to the Motor Vehicles Directive, and I think it has passed with flying colours, because it is a directive that benefits the public. Anyone involved in transport and traffic is bound to gain. The directive has practical and positive consequences that are important to the citizens. Despite this, I should like to draw your attention to a specific point that has already been mooted in this debate. There is a submission deadline for insurance claims in the various countries, which, moreover, is different in every country. Before victims of a traffic accident can submit an insurance claim, they must have the official report at their disposal. However, in some cases, it takes months before this official report reaches the victims. That is why I think the provision we included in Article 14 is so important. I should like to thank Mr Harbour, Mrs Wallis and Mrs Medina Ortega for the openness they have displayed in producing a compromise text on this subject. I think, though, that it is vitally important for the Member States to make every effort to provide the victims, or their representatives, with the necessary information at the earliest opportunity, with a view to submitting their insurance claims in time.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the text drafted is a good compromise, and I hope, as Mr Whitehead has said, that we can find the Commission and Council open to finding a solution that is satisfactory to everyone. This is, to my mind, a really distressing problem, which should be tackled, by means of this directive, as a matter of urgency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact is that this House played a decisive part in bringing this legislation into being, and so it is only proper that we, in the last stage of the lawmaking process, should be pressing for further improvements to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it is a pity that solid benefits for the public should be concealed behind positively technocratic expressions like the ‘Fifth Directive relating to insurance against civil liability in respect of the use of motor vehicles’, this should not prevent us from giving these successes the publicity they deserve, for we are dealing here with truly tragic cases of people who, through a road accident, have lost the wherewithal for their economic survival, their ability to work, who have been ruined by court cases lasting decades, quite simply because the accident occurred in another Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">What is most important is that this amending directive manages to increase the minimum cover from EUR 350 000 to EUR 1 million, to abolish derogations and improve the regime for service representatives.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the consequences of the internal market, of course, is that people move around more, whether they be students, tourists or engaged in providing services, and to all of these we are giving a bit more security when they cross a border in their motor vehicle. The security we are giving them is that they are, to a substantial extent, still covered by insurance when they are away from home.</p>
<p class="contents">What made the previous directives so successful was surely the fact that we created an unbureaucratic, uncomplicated and straightforward system, and that helped to reduce the flood of paperwork. I do, though, take Commissioner McCreevy’s call very seriously when I say that we must re-examine very thoroughly whether all the amendments we have proposed do not make matters too complex, bureaucratic and more difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not, for example, think it makes any sense whatsoever to include trailers in the definition at the same time as making it possible for the Member States to make insurance of them optional. I also ask myself whether this directive is the right place for rules on legal costs, limitation periods and so on, when it is actually meant to deal with other cases. Although I would regard it as sensible to have an Internet site as the central source of information for accident victims, I do not imagine that a collection of accident reports in their hundreds and thousands, or even in ones and twos, on a single Internet site is something that members of the public will regard as practical or will be of real use to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
