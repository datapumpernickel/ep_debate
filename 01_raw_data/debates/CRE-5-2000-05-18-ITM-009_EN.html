The European Union, the United States and the United Nations have all displayed considerable concern about the developments in Sierra Leone. We are not prepared to make any sacrifices. The United States is paralysed by the Somalia syndrome. The Union hides behind Washington’s back. We Europeans even leave the initiative to the Americans who send Jesse Jackson and let him loose in Freetown like a bull in a china shop.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations’ intervention has once again turned into a fiasco. Only thanks to the United Kingdom were we able to stop the rebels in their tracks and arrest their leader, Sankoh. This offers opportunities for a peace deal which far outstrips the laughable one which has been shot to tatters. More than anything, we now need a watertight diamond boycott. </p>
<p class="contents">To complain about cruel massacres and mutilations becomes very hypocritical if we ourselves allow the diamond industry to earn a fortune on the back of blood-stained diamonds.

<p class="contents">The impunity enjoyed by the rebels in Sierra Leone and the weakness of the peace-keeping forces, who can neither leave the country, for political and humanitarian reasons, nor effectively confront the armed rebels, are a threat to any future United Nations peace mission. At the same time, this would be the third failure, after Somalia and Angola, of the Blue Helmets and the United Nations in Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">Africa, where the cruellest conflicts are taking place, is also, as far as peace is concerned, a forgotten territory. The mandate of the United Nations mission in Sierra Leone is, by any reckoning, insufficient to achieve its objectives. Its reinforcement, requested by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, depends on a decision by the Security Council, the same Security Council which gave the Blue Helmets the resources they required in East Timor and Bosnia, but which is much more reluctant to do the same in Sierra Leone at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States and Great Britain have only sent forces to the United Nations mission in order to guarantee the safety of the evacuation. The only solution to the difficulties of the United Nations mission, in terms of achieving compliance with the peace agreement, is to entrust the political negotiation to the leaders of Liberia and Libya, whose record in seeking peace is very doubtful and also very worrying.</p>
<p class="contents">The liberation of some of the hostages and the arrest yesterday of Sankoh do not put an end to this conflict, but rather they may be a cause for even greater concern.</p>
<p class="contents">Only clear and decisive action by the international community as a whole can put an end to it: the arms embargo; the control of diamond trafficking; the deployment of a rapid intervention force, under the mandate of the United Nations; and the prosecution of the perpetrators of crimes against humanity, the savage attacks against civilians, against international peace and security as well as against the United Nations forces.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must therefore support all these types of measures, within the framework of the CFSP. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This agreement not only lets the leader of one of the world’s cruellest terrorist movements off the hook but, to cap it all, also rewards him with the vice-presidency and authority over the diamond mines. But even that was evidently not enough for the rebel leader Sankoh. He turned the disarmament pledge into a farce. Murder, mutilation, abduction and rape simply continued as before. His strategy is very much akin to that of his godfather, Charles Taylor, in neighbouring Liberia, who, by means of terror, forces the population to vote for him in the forthcoming presidential elections and establishes a new Mafia state in the heart of Africa’s diamond industry. </p>
<p class="contents">The UN peacekeeping force, mainly comprising ill-trained third-world troops, is in danger of heading for a fiasco similar to those back in Somalia, Rwanda and Srebrenica. Sierra Leone has made it clear once more that it urgently needs a permanent, international peacekeeping force which is well trained and equipped, and led by top commanders from the world’s best armies. It is a good sign that the rebel leader was arrested yesterday and that more than 200 UN peacekeeping troops were released over the past couple of days. But the question remains of how the rebels will react to this and how the peace agreement will take shape in future. In any event, the arms embargo must be supervised more effectively and perpetrators must be brought to justice. More than anything, however, an embargo should be imposed on diamonds smuggled illegally from the country, estimated at USD 60 million annually, which is what is at stake for the rebels in their warfare. I will call for a ban on these precious stones, which are stained with blood from thousands of innocent citizens, in my own country, Belgium. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a dangerous trend towards the escalation of armed conflict, especially as the United Kingdom has now become militarily involved outside international law and the United Nations. We demand an end to this military escalation and the immediate resumption of negotiations. One-sided recriminations are neither appropriate nor helpful in this situation. The RUF is known for its extreme brutality, but we should not overlook the fact that the government and the militias associated with it are little better.</p>
<p class="contents">We demand that the sources of the conflict should finally be tackled, by which we mean stopping the arms trade, halting the RUF’s diamond trade via Liberia and Burkina Faso, and ending the interference of states that want to secure national objectives in Sierra Leone under the guise of humanitarian action. I have the feeling that, economically speaking, the United Kingdom is acting in a neo-colonial way and that in political and military terms it is now acting like a colonial power. It is very easy to get drawn into a war, but it becomes almost impossible to avoid the next logical step, military intervention, once the atmosphere escalates. The military imposition of peace by international troops working with government militias against the RUF will not bring peace at all. Quite the contrary, it brings with it the risk of uncontrollable escalation. It is high time that the causes of this situation were addressed and a political solution was found. Because of this, we need de-escalation in Freetown, not escalation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us remember that amongst the objectives of the common foreign policy are the maintenance of peace and the respect for human rights, principles which are being totally disregarded today in Sierra Leone. This Parliament must therefore urge the Member States to support the call of the Secretary-General of the United Nations so that the deployment of a rapid intervention force may proceed in order to re-establish stability in Sierra Leone and thereby contribute to preventing the danger of a new civil war which today hangs over that country.</p>
<p class="contents">However, our commitment must not end with this call. We must also fight for an end to the impunity with which acts of genocide and war crimes have been carried out and for the people responsible for them to be brought before the Tribunals so that they may be judged. We must also eradicate the cancer which has given rise to the destabilisation of that country. That is why this Parliament must urge the OAU, the European Union, the Commission and the Government of Sierra Leone to adopt and promote whatever measures are necessary to end diamond trafficking and the control of that country’s abundant natural resources by those people who, thanks to diamonds, have become men of war.</p>
<p class="contents">We are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Schuman declaration. The best tribute we could pay to those people who, through that declaration, sowed the seed which has borne such abundant fruit in terms of peace and well-being, would be to commit ourselves to the cause of that beleaguered country, to decisively help the people of Sierra Leone to re-establish peace and, through peace, the full respect for human rights and the possibility of economic development which will lead it out of poverty and allow it finally to live in dignity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We stand here in moral indignation and are, at the same time, filled with a huge sense of powerlessness. Politically speaking, in Europe, Mr Chris Patten and Mr Solana are two people from the European Union whom, in the event of foreign security conflicts, we can call on to use their political resourcefulness to both intervene in the region and to support the UN. With everything which has been said about diamond trafficking and the halting of other dealings which finance the local war, and with everything which has been said about the need to intervene, what we need at the end of the day is a political solution. As Mr Solana occasionally visits the Philippines and Mr Patten is actively involved in the Balkans, I would like to ask them both, on behalf of all of us, to jointly commit their efforts once more, focusing on political support, to reach an active final agreement there with the local regional authorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We can condemn and we can make demands, but what we need to do, and can do, as a Parliament, is to come up with new ideas. As was said earlier, we need a long-term strategy for Africa but also a Schuman-style plan for the joint management of those of Africa’s resources which are being fought over, for example in Sierra Leone or in the Congo, so that the struggle does not lead to conflicts with fundamentally undemocratic warlords. </p>
<p class="contents">What do we now have to learn, fifty years after 9 May 1950, that is to say fifty years after the Schuman Plan? We need an equivalent plan for Africa’s resources, just as we need a movement in opposition to the diamond trade. I feel that, from a human point of view, this is much more important than any amount of movements in opposition to the fur trade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should congratulate the British Government on taking effective action in a peace-keeping capacity. This is exactly the rapid reaction we are asking for within the European Union.

Certain kind souls are already pointing the finger at misgovernance and ethnic causes and indicating the culprits who should be eliminated. As with the oil of Congo-Brazzaville, Angola or Nigeria and the mineral resources of Chad, Niger or the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and as in the latter generally or in Angola, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the causes are indeed economic and the fight for control of the diamond-producing areas is the basis and reason for this continuing conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">We are right to condemn the Revolutionary United Front or RUF for unilaterally resuming hostilities and for involving thousands of child-soldiers in the horror. However, the Sierra Leone army and its militias should also come in for criticism. We are right to condemn the use of diamonds by the RUF for war purposes. But what are the economic interests behind the government’s actions? We are right to condemn Liberia and Burkina Faso for their involvement in the arms trade and the recycling of diamonds. But who is selling arms to these countries and who is buying the diamonds?</p>
<p class="contents">We are right to send in a UN Implementation Force and to want to disarm those who are fighting. Yet without proper distribution of the wealth of these countries, as in other African countries, and if we continue to allow mining and oil companies to pillage these countries and to fund the groups controlling these resources, our intervention will once again be in vain as it will not tackle the real causes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We understand he was arrested by the Sierra Leonean police and that he remains in government custody.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure we all hope that Sankoh will now accelerate the release of the remaining hostages. There are apparently about 360 of them. We understand that has already commenced, but there is a long way to go.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, it is to be hoped that Sankoh will now honour the commitments he entered into last July when he signed the Lomé peace accord and that will allow a long-awaited peace and stability to return to Sierra Leone.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has been following closely and with very considerable concern the recent events in Sierra Leone which have derailed implementation of the Lomé peace agreement and called into question the commitment of the RUF towards restoring peace and stability in Sierra Leone. That, if anything, is an understatement.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has issued two statements condemning the RUF’s violations of the peace agreement and the abductions of UN peace-keeping personnel. The statements have both called on the RUF to adhere strictly to their commitments under the Lomé agreement and, in particular, to the disarmament process.</p>
<p class="contents">We remain convinced that the Lomé agreement still offers the best chance for lasting peace in Sierra Leone. We will continue to support the legitimate government’s attempts to restore peace and stability to the country and to implement programmes of economic and social recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent support provided to the UNAMSIL peace-keeping force by the United Kingdom is welcome – the honourable Member, Mr Titley, made the point well – as is the release last weekend of 139 of the 486 hostages, following the intervention of President Taylor of Liberia.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware of the reports concerning the involvement of neighbouring countries, in particular Burkina Faso and Liberia, in the smuggling of diamonds and in providing support to the rebels in Sierra Leone. The Commission, together with Member States, is currently examining the regional dimension to the conflict with a view to formulating an appropriate regional response.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission stresses the role to be played by regional organisations, for example ECOWAS, in the prevention of conflicts. The Commission is financing with EDF regional funds the ECOWAS conflict-prevention mechanism, which could provide an appropriate channel for dialogue on this question.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards humanitarian assistance, through ECHO we are continuing to finance programmes in support of displaced and refugee communities through international NGOs. Since the beginning of 1999, ECHO has provided some EUR 14m of assistance, covering the supply of medical aid, therapeutic feeding, water and sanitation and psychosocial support to children affected by war. In addition, this funding has covered support to amputees – the all too many amputees in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">This month the Commission will be seeking approval for a new EUR 12m programme of assistance to Sierra Leone, principally covering refugees and the internally displaced. This programme will concentrate on providing support first to refugees in neighbouring Guinea and Liberia, second to internally displaced populations and, thirdly, to women and children affected by the war and, of course, the amputees. Ex-combatant children will again receive psychosocial support.</p>
<p class="contents">For me the most interesting point to come out of this debate was not just the expressions of concern about the situation in Sierra Leone – one would expect that – but the number of honourable Members who have expressed very clearly and cogently their views on the diamond trade. I say with some feeling that I very much hope that Member States will take account of what has been said in this Chamber.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
