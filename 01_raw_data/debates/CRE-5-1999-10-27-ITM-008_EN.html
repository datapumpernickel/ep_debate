<p class="contents">Thanks to the activities that were developed within the respective frameworks, access to a vast range of cultural products and values has been provided for many European citizens who would not otherwise have had this opportunity. As a single financing and programming instrument for cooperation, CULTURE 2000 declares a range of objectives which aim to provide a response, more of a response and a better one, to such needs, and this, then, is able to represent a decisive step in the direction of a European cultural policy that is worthy of this name. By this I mean an instrument which will permit repeated, interactive and fruitful contact between the cultures of the various Member countries in such a way that the variety of areas looked at and the multidisciplinary nature of the events become an ever more vitalising element in the very soil of European identity without threatening pluralism and the essential diversity of these cultures. </p>
<p class="contents">Although all the participants in the various phases of the process bore these concerns in mind, it became clear that the attitudes of the Council and the Commission on the one hand and of this Parliament on the other were not completely attuned with one another. But although we have come a long way, we should nevertheless mention some of the main areas of disagreement. </p>
<p class="contents">These are, of course, the budgetary question, the question of a supposedly excessive fragmentation or disintegration of the Union’s actions, which is considered likely to reduce its visibility and, as a result, the question of an option in the sense of there being privileged lines which would support initiatives of a greater scale and of a more spectacular kind. The participation of agents and operators had been foreseen for this, which would involve a greater number of countries as a minimum which, as we see it, would carry a serious risk of hypertrophy in some networks of cultural operators. This would give them an excessive concentration of means and powers and, as a result, threaten the normal functioning and even the very existence of many others.</p>
<p class="contents">Consistent with the Mouskouri report which this Parliament was right to adopt, the recommendation to which I am honoured to put my name, maintained its aim of seeing the budgetary appropriation strengthened, from the EUR 167 million initially provided, and raised it to 250 million. There is no doubt that both the Council and the Commission are sensitive to the great needs that are being experienced in all the sectors covered by the programme, nor that there is much good will in the sense of trying to find satisfactory solutions. </p>
<p class="contents">Moving now to other points of disagreement, I will say that experience shows that the greater the number of States participating, the greater the risk of each initial project losing its own character. Now, in principle, each initial project corresponds to needs experienced specifically by a given group of citizens. On the other hand, it seems obvious that there are great imbalances as a result of extremely varied conditions of time, method and place, in terms of the opportunity for access to the enjoyment of cultural values that the citizens of various European countries possess.</p>
<p class="contents">This aspect tends to become even more complex with the perspective of enlargement which has, to a large extent, been prepared and anticipated at exactly the level of cultural contacts. This is why the possibility was foreseen of supporting medium- and even small-scale actions so that the greatest possible number of European citizens benefit, who will, as a result, be able to become more directly involved. Visibility will not count for much unless it relates intimately to life and to what culture has to offer. </p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, more concessions were made, and a minimum number of three was accepted for States involved in the joint organisation of specific projects and of five for States involved in the large-scale cultural cooperation agreements. Attempts were also made to find a way towards making the framework mechanisms more flexible. There was also the intention to stimulate the emergence of new synergies and of new thrusts for creativity without wanting to favour a sector-based approach to action. </p>
<p class="contents">It is becoming a matter of urgency that we move ahead. There are countless cultural operators and agents who will be deprived of any kind of means for the action that they are developing, which will be of inestimable value if this dossier is not concluded before the end of the year so that we can allow the programme to come into force at the beginning of next year. The figures calculated for conciliation will make this possible, as we know, moreover, that this conciliation will be conducted in parallel with the conciliation relating to the YOUTH programme, although it will be completely autonomous in relation to this programme. </p>
<p class="contents">We all know that our cultural coordinates are related to our sense of identity as Europeans. We also know that fundamental action linked to cultural life in its multiple forms is an indispensable factor for the strengthening of an awareness of European identity. Until this dimension is fully achieved, political union itself will have feet of clay. Culture on its own can be one of its strongest foundations. In order to achieve this, there will have to be greater participation on the part of the citizens, and greater access to culture. I shall close my speech with the hope that this Parliament’s actions will make an important contribution to achieving this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pack (PPE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, I wanted to sincerely thank our colleague, Mr Graça Moura, for taking over this report and really being content to take forward what we had already decided in the last legislative period and which was the work of Nana Mouskouri, whose warm greetings I am to pass on to you today. She is very happy that things are finally moving forward. </p>
<p class="contents">The model of society which forms the basis of this report by Mr Graça Moura is a deeply humanitarian one. Culture plays an important role in this model, and partly for the purpose of facilitating respect on the part of our citizens for each other’s different cultures, as well as for national and regional traditions. </p>
<p class="contents">This new programme sets out the framework for the European Union’s cultural policy for the next few years. It must be added that a genuine policy on culture and education is needed today more than ever, since it is the actual basis of European politics. Above all, however, it gives a human face to the distant and bureaucratic politics of Europe and puts the citizen in the centre of activity and debate, as is also happening with the “Youth” programme and with the “Socrates” education programme. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Union should not just be a question of figures and statistics, for example. Only the genuine participation of its citizens makes it a living whole. When we see that the European Union has precisely 167 million ecus left for cultural policy, we naturally regard this as a ridiculous sum. As insiders, we know of course that what we are doing in terms of cultural policy is not confined to the area covered by this sum. We are also working in the cultural sphere when it comes to the areas covered by the regional funds. However, EUR 167 million is too small a sum. Even EUR 250 million would not be enough in view of the scale of the work which awaits us. I consider that the cultural sphere, to which we have the task of giving a higher profile, requires a much larger sum of money. But that is how it is everywhere in the European Union. Everyone gets up on their soapbox and says that Europe must be given a soul. That is a wonderful catchword. Everyone hides behind it but, unfortunately, not a lot of money is spent on it. I believe it is the same in every country. </p>
<p class="contents">This cultural programme can basically make only a small contribution to realising this desire that neighbours should be made genuinely aware of each other’s respective cultures. </p>
<p class="contents">In the form in which we now have the report, extensive parts of the former Commission’s proposal have been changed. We have responded more to the will of our citizens and have been that much less inclined to go in for big events. I know that this is also the attitude of the new Commissioner. I hope that the quality of the projects which we are now to have will make up for the lack of financial resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And Mr Graça Moura deserves the congratulations of the Socialist Group, which I pass on to him with pleasure.</p>
<p class="contents">Culture 2000, for the reasons which have just been expressed, is an extraordinarily important programme. The joint position of the Council has not yet accepted the Parliament’s criteria and the rapporteur, reasonably, has retained in this second reading the ones which he considers to be essential.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly I must highlight funding. We do not understand, given the margin within the Financial Perspective, why a third of the resources which we considered minimums have been cut.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we agree with the Council on the need for the activities of Culture 2000 to be visible to the public, but the best way to achieve this is through small and medium scale events, in diverse locations and close to the citizens, rather than events on a grand scale. The Council confuses public reaction with media reaction and forgets that in the latter case the reaction is almost always ephemeral.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council, or rather, a small part of it, has ignored the spirit and the letter of the Treaties and specifically Article 151. It is still afraid of expressions such as “European Policy” and “European Cultural Area” etc. and prefers to carry on speaking of “partnership”.</p>
<p class="contents">Legislating and taking action in the field of culture and education directly shapes the European soul which has so often been elusive. The system of knowledge, the human emotions which only the Arts and Letters can produce, in other words, our culture, are deeply based on what the Europeans have in common and therefore form the basis of European citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the steadfastness of this Parliament, on the one hand, and the help of the new Commissioner on the other, together finally with the understanding of the Council, will all come to act together to this end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The liberal group warmly endorses the amendments that he has submitted. As far as the level of the Budget is concerned, the liberal group too feels that the Council’s efforts fall short of the mark. There are a few points that I would like to emphasise.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the cultural networks. The Council’s text literally states that financed projects must operate with the aid of networks. According to this text cultural networks ought only to be able to make claims of the Framework Programme on culture for individual projects. However, they should also be able to receive support for some of their recurring expenses. For if there is money available for the project, but not for keeping the network’s office running, then there will be no support for the project and the experience gained will be wasted. </p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that the programme now takes full account of the importance of reading and translation. However, I am rather concerned as to whether the money will be distributed effectively. There must be proportional representation as far as promotion, translation and cultural exchanges are concerned, and these must not compete with each other. The literary translation establishments, which play an important part in making our cultural heritage accessible, are particularly at risk. That is why I intend to see to it that they continue to receive some of the money.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point, Mr President, is that I was not happy with the budgetary procedure. The members of the Committee on Culture have a better understanding than the Committee on Budgets as to how the money should be distributed amongst cultural and educational institutions.

I await with interest the discussion that the budget rapporteur has announced which will take place on the way in which the financial resources in chapter A 30 of the budget for 2001 are allocated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although everyone appears to agree that culture is important in theory, in practice the situation is often quite different in Europe. Europe seems to be more interested in agriculture than culture. They only differ by four letters but that certainly makes a very big difference at the budgetary level.</p>
<p class="contents">Any MEP with cultural sensitivities is still moved to read the European Council’s declarations of love when it comes to cultural matters. But this emotion soon gives way to disillusionment when the words are not followed by deeds, particularly where budgets are concerned. For there is nothing that the European Union spends so little on as culture and savings even have to be made in the little that we do spend, notwithstanding the fact that everyone always agrees that promoting culture is probably the only way to make the EU popular with its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think that it would be particularly misguided of this Parliament not to follow the rapporteur’s recommendations, for you cannot keep saying that you think it is a shame that an ever-decreasing number of people vote in European elections, or that you regret that every inquiry shows that the EU appears to be ever more distant from the people of Europe, only to go making cutbacks in projects whose precise intention it is to bring the EU closer to the people.</p>
<p class="contents">We certainly feel that we ought not to finance large-scale, expensive projects, but rather small-scale projects that the people of Europe can identify with and which could make a tremendous contribution at the socio-economic level in terms of job opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that we are talking about the Europe of the next century, a new, wider Europe, an enlarged Europe, would it not perhaps be useful to pursue a bold cultural policy at long last, for culture is not something that should be talked about in the way that all the other “important” matters are discussed. Now that everything appears to be discussed in economic terms, perhaps it is time for us to start showing more interest in what are, after all, the origins of Europe, notably our culture. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The construction of a cultural Europe is now proving to be just as great a necessity as the construction of a political Europe, which has until now been an economic and monetary Europe. Whether we are aiming for a cultural policy or promoting cultural activities, the findings are the same. The budget allocated to the “Culture 2000” programme is ridiculously small. Is it acceptable that the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, Media and Sport has been given EUR 167.33 million per year when it is asking for EUR 250 million? Community expenditure on culture stands at 0.003%. Is it really appropriate to welcome the adoption of such a budget? </p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Reding herself, in the September hearings spoke of cultural action in a way that suggested it was being recognised belatedly. Let us find a way of making up the lost time that is obvious to everyone, with an adapted budget. The rapporteur also stresses the link between culture and citizenship. I think in fact that greater balance is necessary between the budgets allocated to ambitious cultural events and the targeted projects. The construction of European citizenship will come about as a result of the involvement of individuals, not only of institutions</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this reticence where budgets are concerned, I would like to make a concluding observation. What can we say about a Europe which is proud, and rightly so, to defend its cultural diversity at the forthcoming WTO negotiations if we are not capable of giving real support to this cultural expression? I would not like the budget for culture to become inversely proportional to our cultural ambitions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, at this delicate stage for the European Union, while we begin to enlarge eastwards, while all the economic and financial changes linked to the creation of the single currency are already underway, we must not forget the value of culture, the specificity and diversity of European culture, its enhancement and its diffusion. Culture, which also means history, languages and traditions, must remain a fundamental and indispensable bond for European citizens. We must therefore welcome the new Culture 2000 programme, but reiterate some considerations which, moreover, most of my fellow Members have already done. Firstly, we need to encourage and stimulate the European citizens and European associations and small businesses in this sector to make as much use as possible of this programme, but avoid concentrating the meagre funds on only a few large events, to the advantage of a few privileged networks which, in the long run, as past experience has taught us, end up monopolising these funds. Secondly, in any case, we would need to make an effort to increase the funds laid down for this programme. </p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Europe must not forget that investing in culture does not mean simply preserving a great legacy and our identity as Europeans, but also the creation of many new jobs. Mr President, I think that the European citizens are currently in great need of this.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In this same respect, I wish to communicate to the Commission my concern about the development and subsequent implementation of the programmes, in all their fields. The success of Culture 2000 will depend largely on its capacity to implement new working methods and to bring these offers of cooperation closer to a citizens’ Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that the Commission itself and the Member States achieve greater efficiency in communication, expand their advice and information services and cooperate in the task of guiding and advising possible beneficiaries. The announcements of grants must be published with sufficient notice and must reach all points of Europe, allowing applicants sufficient time to find partners and seek supplementary aid. If we intend culture to be active at a grassroots level and for the majority of individuals to be involved in it, it is necessary for the European Union to come closer to them and for the details of the grants to be published in the sections of the media with the widest audience.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I believe there is a consensus amongst all of us who have been involved and all the parties that small-scale creative elements should be supported. At the same time, it would be appropriate to favour, through the selection criteria, the proposals of individuals and groups, since it is necessary to compensate for the tendency of institutions to become the protagonists in terms of cultural production.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it is easier to operate through the procedures of agencies and institutions, the basic purpose of the programme will be to break this barrier and favour culture at the grassroots of society, given that their function is not to create an official culture.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, Mrs Reding, I would like to offer you my full support with regard to funding: I am conscious that pressure must be exerted on Mr Prodi and the College of Commissioners and I know that you will strive earnestly to achieve this improvement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe should take pride in its linguistic diversity. The European Union has done much to promote its wealth of cultures and I congratulate Commissioner Reding on her work in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Many in this new Parliament might not remember that in May 1998 budget lines for minority languages were frozen because they had no legal basis. Will the Commission now guarantee that a legal basis for these projects is introduced? The situation of 1998 cannot be allowed to arise again. Lesser-used languages must be granted the funding they deserve, otherwise excellent innovative projects – drama, the translating of literature following the end of the Ariane project – the teaching of languages and so on will all suffer.</p>
<p class="contents">As a Welsh speaker, I have seen the significant benefits of European funding but also the threat to many excellent projects when financial support is withdrawn. As the budget has already been frozen for 16 months it is unlikely that any schemes under the Culture 2000 programme will come into being until 2001. It is crucial therefore that the Commission uses its preparatory measures to ensure that current projects do not now suffer. Languages are more than mere words. They are the vehicles by which the cultures of Europe are expressed and celebrated also.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us hope that Commissioner Reding’s words become reality and that every language is respected and promoted regardless of the numbers who speak it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to tell you how much the Commission appreciates the fact that the rapporteur for the “Culture 2000” programme is one of today’s major poets. I would like to tell you, although this is perhaps only anecdotal, that one of Mr Graça Moura’s books is to be translated into Swedish this year thanks to the Ariane programme. That just shows that European culture does travel! </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Your rapporteur has submitted a very constructive report, based on an in-depth analysis of the needs of cultural cooperation. The report clearly shows, if it were still necessary, Parliament’s commitment to this programme and to the cultures of Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">The “Culture 2000” programme is the first framework-programme for culture. It will enable us to develop a common cultural area designed to encourage creativity, cooperation and exchanges, one which will safeguard the heritage and history of the European peoples, generate a greater understanding of them, and which will encourage cultures to flourish. You have stressed, both in your speeches and even, previously, during our brief encounters in the corridors of Parliament, the positive aspects and the things which can be improved in the day-to-day running of this programme. I have taken careful note of the problems relating to the breakdown of funds, the implementation of specific programmes and the treatment of languages. I would like to thank you above all, though, for the speed with which you have worked. This is in the interests of our citizens because, as you know, the conciliation procedure between Parliament and the Council must begin quickly so that our citizens will be able to feel the benefits of our “Culture 2000” programme in the year 2000. </p>
<p class="contents">I am aware of Parliament’s expectations and I want to say quite clearly that I share them. This is why the Commission can accept most of the amendments introduced by Parliament. These are amendments 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 14. I am not now going to repeat the content of these amendments, as you know them better than I do. I would just like to say that, in principle, the Commission accepts amendment 4 on commitology, on condition that there is a simple cross-reference in the text to the management procedure laid down by the decision of the Council on 28 June 1999, which sets out the conditions for exercising the competences for implementation granted to the Commission. I would also like to make an observation on amendment 12: The Commission accepts this amendment although we would like to maintain a certain degree of flexibility in order to be able, in the conciliation phase, to bring the positions of the Council and Parliament more into line on this specific point. </p>
<p class="contents">I propose to partially accept amendments 7, 11 and 13. Amendment 7, on integrated action within the transnational cultural cooperation agreements, consists of two parts. The first concerns the role of the committee and, more specifically, the obligation of the managers of projects that we have financed, to submit a report of the action it has undertaken directly to the committee, because supervision is the task of the Commission, which must also take responsibility for the management of the programme. Secondly, there is the part that envisages specifying “heritage specialists”. The Commission cannot accept the use of this very general term, which would make the list of the programme’s potential beneficiaries much longer, with practical consequences that are impossible to foresee. This does not mean, of course, that we do not accept the preservation of our heritage, quite the opposite. This has been well provided for in the Parliament amendments which we have accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">I have just one observation regarding that part of amendment 7 which the Commission has accepted, and this concerns terminology. We should actually use the terms “Member or Associate States”. This is quite a small correction.</p>
<p class="contents">We can accept amendment 11 relating to the role of information by means of cultural contact points on condition that their regional activities, which can be conducted as a complement to their national role, are done so on the basis of the measures in force in the various Member States and that they do not involve any increase in the Community’s overall financial contribution. The Commission will obviously discuss with the Member States the breakdown of this aid between the national and regional levels. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission accepts amendment 13 which proposes criteria relating to the distribution of the budget among the main cultural fields, whilst raising from 9% to 11% the percentage in favour of activities in the books and reading sector whose annual subsidy would decrease slightly in relation to the Ariane project. This will certainly please your rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">I have listened carefully to all your demands for the budget. I agree with you wholeheartedly, but we cannot ignore the <span class="italic">Realpolitik</span> and, as you well know, the budgetary authorities do not always share our views. I am therefore forced to maintain my original position on amendment 3 and cannot accept the proposal seeking to raise the budget from EUR 167 million to EUR 250 million. The three institutions are in fact committed to respecting the budgetary programme and only the budgetary authorities can implement a modification. Of course, if such a modification were to be implemented, the Commission would be delighted, but given the current state of affairs, I feel compelled to refuse this amendment. </p>
<p class="contents">Rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that we are able to vote for “Culture 2000” today. This will be a new starting point for our citizens who expect us, in addition to taking economic action, to make the people, the culture, the roots and the diversity that contribute to the richness of Europe our central concern. </p>
<p class="contents">It is from this perspective, and in the hope that we will be able to make rapid progress in the direction our citizens wish, that I ask you to vote for this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
