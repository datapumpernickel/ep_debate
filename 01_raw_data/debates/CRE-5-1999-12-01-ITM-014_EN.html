In 1974, the States around the Baltic got together to form what is known as the Helsinki Convention in order to safeguard the marine environment. The Convention was developed further after 1992 following the extensive political transformations which had occurred at that time. Of the European Union countries, Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Germany at present subscribe to the Convention. Moreover, the European Union is itself one of its signatories. The three Baltic countries – Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – together with Russia and Poland are also involved in the work. </p>
<p class="contents">The Baltic is an inland sea with very significant environmental problems. The areas in which the rivers that run into the Baltic originate are extensive and are located in several different countries. The outlets into the North Sea and the Atlantic are small, and discharges from agriculture, industry and private households are significant. The salt content of the Baltic is relatively low compared with that of other seas. What is more, there are major problems involving low oxygen content in large parts of the Baltic. This creates a special environment, and it also creates quite a few problems for marine life. One example is the very large variation to be found in fish stocks from year to year. </p>
<p class="contents">Very extensive work is already being done to clean up various sources of discharges around the Baltic. In particular, clean-up facilities are at present being constructed in a variety of locations in Eastern Europe. These are largely being financed by the European Union. </p>
<p class="contents">This report is about revising two of the Helsinki Convention’s Annexes, namely Annexes 3 and 4. Annex 3 concerns agricultural discharges. The changes which come about through this revision are to be implemented partly in order to reduce discharges of nitrogen, phosphorus and pesticides. This can have a big effect, especially upon the situation regarding eutrophication and lack of oxygen in the Baltic. Annex 4 is aimed at reducing discharges from boats and ships. This part regulates, among other things, equipment for gathering up oil, waste and waste water in various harbours. Both these changes are very welcome, and it has been self-evident to me as rapporteur that we should support them and say that we should vote for them. </p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to dealing with waste from ships, work is in progress within the European Union on a proposed Directive concerning plant for receiving waste in harbours. It is, however, important to appreciate that there remain a very great many problems within the framework of Annex 4. This especially applies to the monitoring of waste at sea. Even when such monitoring in fact takes place, for example from the air, it has proved to be very difficult indeed to hold those responsible to account and to penalise them for the offences against the environment which are in fact being committed in the Baltic. </p>
<p class="contents">Where agriculture is concerned, I have looked for some kind of description of the effects which the new requirements are having upon the European Union’s sets of regulations, partly in relation to the expected enlargement of the EU to include a number of countries bordering the Baltic. I have not found any such descriptive report at the Commission, but I believe it would have been useful to see one. </p>
<p class="contents">The changes to these Annexes will come into force at the end of the year. It is therefore high time to take the decision in question. It would have been an advantage if the European Parliament had been involved in this work earlier. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Quite recently, however, extensive new data has been collected covering areas right in the vicinity of the coastline, in the shallow coves of the Baltic. No corresponding eastward growth in the amount of nutrients is discernible, but instead the areas with high levels of nutrients clearly point to local causes: agriculture, industry and the presence of summer cottages. There are especially high levels of nutrients in the vicinity of rivers flowing into the sea, which shows that large amounts of nitric and phosphoric compounds are being carried from the land to the sea.</p>
<p class="contents">Nutrients have a greater effect on the fairly closed ecosystem that exists along the coast than they have in open sea areas. For this reason, many areas of inland water near the coast need revitalising. The coastal areas are particularly strategic from the point of view of human activity and enjoyment. For this reason, it is vital to take action to substantially reduce the volumes of local effluent due to agriculture, housing or recreation.</p>
<p class="contents">For the protection of the Baltic we thus need on-going fine-tuning, with smaller-scale measures, which are also dealt with in Annexes III and IV of the Helsinki Convention now being discussed. The report that has been prepared recommends, in addition, that the Commission should produce an analysis of the possible effects of the changes on Union legislation. Furthermore, we should clarify whether the legislation that is being drafted, for example Agenda 2000, can have an impact on Union action under the Helsinki Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">The harmonisation of environmental considerations, viable agriculture, policies on livelihood, recreation and, for example, enlargement in a manner that is sustainable for the Baltic area, will naturally be a great challenge, both administratively and politically. We need a conscious attempt at coherence. Perhaps an initiative on the northern dimension could provide the comprehensive angle on the Baltic region we need to consider all these important areas of policy simultaneously and in a mutually compatible way.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to believe that, if it works well, the northern dimension would provide a forum to which the EU will find it appropriate to invite other key players as well, for example from the Baltic region. For example, the Nordic Council has a long history of shaping environmental policy in the Nordic countries and in neighbouring regions. The Nordic Council is involved in organising a parliamentary Baltic Conference, for all the countries of the Baltic to attend. It would be natural for the EU to embark on closer talks with these countries. The Nordic Council has shown initiative and expressed the wish to start such a dialogue with the EU. I hope that that the northern dimension will prove to be a good, viable model for an ecologically sustainable and comprehensive development of a policy for these areas, which can be used for other areas of the Union.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The new agreement covers the whole of the Baltic Sea up to the coastlines of those states surrounding it. In addition, and this is important, the states to sign the agreement are committed to action throughout the entire catchment area of the region, which considerably extends the impact of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Helsinki Convention has been a pioneer in the multilateral cooperation process among the Baltic countries. At present there are a good number of players in the region involved in a cooperative arrangement that extends to every sector of life, from the economy to culture. The tradition of bustling interaction that existed in the Hanseatic era is thus being revived, and before long the Baltic Sea will be an internal sea of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme of environmental cooperation in the Baltic region is a part of the Union’s northern dimension policy. As we are often asked what the northern dimension policy in practice means, it is, for example, taking care of the delicate environmental conditions that exist in the Nordic regions.</p>
<p class="contents">The commitment in the Convention to protecting natural diversity is a necessary addition to the Convention on Fishing in the Baltic Sea. With regard to the future, we should consider how the structures underlying the protection of the environment in the Baltic region could be organised efficiently and simply. I myself believe that the Helsinki Commission could provide a framework, not only for the main area of focus, the protection of the marine environment, but also the implementation of the Baltic Sea Agenda 21 programme, and the possible coordination of sound regional planning. The long-term aim on the whole could be to extend the Helsinki Convention to cover the whole of the Baltic region with the objective of applying in practice the principle of sustainable development. The revised Convention could also serve as a model for other regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every necessary measure needs therefore to be taken in order to improve the situation. I think that Mrs Myller expressed a lot of points of view in her statement which we must make good use of. I think it is important for us to see what opportunities we have to renew the Baltic Commission’s work in conjunction with the water planning directive, which we are also discussing here. I have tried on a number of occasions to bring together these two areas of expertise on the basis that we should be looking at both at the same time and at the ways in which effective use might be made of the Helsinki Commission for this purpose. My hope is that it might be possible to bring together at least those who are now here in the Chamber in order to look into this. </p>
<p class="contents">Annex 3 itself, relating to agriculture, does not perhaps inspire particularly great hope that it might entail anything new compared, for example, with the environmental strategies and programmes we already have. On the other hand, I hope that, next week in Helsinki, we can, as has been said, approve ambitious objectives for agriculture and the environment. </p>
<p class="contents">As we think of renewing the work, it is also important that the Helsinki Commission’s efforts should be open to public scrutiny. We were therefore very disappointed to see that the results of the work carried out a good year ago on <span class="italic">hot spots</span> was not published because Sweden opposed any such publication. This was a small blemish on what was otherwise very sound work.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add that the work on creating plant for receiving waste is extremely important. I believe that we must watch our step so that we do not jeopardise what we have here in this Convention and that we should not in any way be trying to achieve something else – a ‘best’ which would in actual fact be the ‘enemy of the good’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Just as the rapporteur pointed out in his report, and also here, the changes to Annexes 3 and 4 to the Convention on the Baltic’s marine environment have already been adopted and will come into force in a month’s time. Consulting the European Parliament is therefore a procedure which cannot have any real effect. That is naturally a little odd and also rather annoying. Fortunately, the changes to the Convention are very good indeed for environmental work. They are aimed at reducing agricultural discharges of nitrogen and phosphorus and, especially, pesticides and at reducing discharges from ships and pleasurecraft. We know that some very single-minded environmental work and some purposeful political decisions are required in order to restore the ecological balance of the Baltic. </p>
<p class="contents">Changes to the Helsinki Convention contain general rules which will also certainly have an effect on EU legislation, especially with regard to agricultural policy. It would have been interesting if we had had an opportunity to discuss this issue and express views on it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all, of course, to thank the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and also rapporteur Sjöstedt for the work he has done on elucidating the changes to Annexes 3 and 4 of the Helsinki Convention. </p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection adopted the report on 19 October 1999. I think it is good that we have had the opportunity to discuss this in the House today. It is with satisfaction, of course, that I note that the rapporteur welcomes the proposed changes to the Convention. The proposal in fact moves that the changes to the two Annexes should be adopted by the European Community. </p>
<p class="contents">As mentioned, Annex 3 is mainly concerned with agricultural discharges. The proposed changes are, in fact, aimed at reducing discharges of nitrogen, phosphorus and pesticides used in agriculture. The purpose of the other Annex is to reduce discharges from ships. </p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Mr Sjöstedt’s concern that the Commission would not look adequately at the changes that need to be made and his concern about the effects which this would necessarily have on EU legislation, he is worrying unnecessarily. There are no major problems. The Commission has naturally made sure that we can make these changes and shall do so. If the Commission signs a Convention, we must also ensure that we can honour the commitments in such a Convention, something which will not cause any problems. </p>
<p class="contents">There was also a Finnish front here which I have to say I agree with. I think there is an important link with the northern dimension and that we should ideally be marrying the Helsinki Convention and the work that is being done under the heading of the northern dimension. I therefore think that remarks of this kind are in order. The Commission is also working along those lines, that is to say to ensure that we can coordinate, and benefit from, the work that is being done in different places. This can reinforce the environmental work being done in connection with the Baltic. In addition, the Helsinki Convention ought to support the work by means of sustainable development for the Baltic. Discussions to this effect have begun. We in the Commission are therefore aware of the need for increased environmental cooperation in the Baltic region. We are convinced that the changes to the Convention constitute an important, albeit small, contribution towards achieving that goal. </p>
<p class="contents">The report criticises the way in which the adoption procedure was carried out. The rapporteur maintains that the changes had already been adopted on 1 January 1999 and that the work carried out in the European Parliament was therefore meaningless. It is true that the Convention’s executive body, HELCOM adopted the changes on 29 March 1998 and that the parties to the Treaty were given the deadline of 1 January 1999 to produce changes. However, the Commission lodged an incidental objection to make it possible to consult with the European Parliament and the Council. That objection still applies. The Commission’s interpretation of the situation is therefore that, as long as the Commission has not withdrawn its incidental objection, the changes have not come into force. The consultation procedure is therefore valid, and I should also like to thank you in the European Parliament for your contributions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
