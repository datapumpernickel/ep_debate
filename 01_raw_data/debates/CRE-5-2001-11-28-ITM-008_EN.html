<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hautala (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FI)</span> Mr President, I am here, this evening, to present a report which relates to the improvement of the quality of fuels. The European Parliament was involved in drafting this legislation, which was originally approved in 1998, in other words, over three years ago; and Parliament was quite successful in using the co-decision procedure to push through cleaner fuels, which significantly facilitate a reduction in traffic emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">Even at that stage, the European Parliament noticed that one crucial factor in improving the quality of a fuel is a reduction in its sulphur content. In the course of the co-decision procedure and conciliation, we accomplished a significant lowering in the sulphur content of both petrol and diesel, despite the way in which the oil industry stridently emphasised the costs of this programme. On the other hand, we can state that the motor industry and catalyst industry considered it absolutely essential that these low-sulphur, cleaner fuels would be introduced to the market, since, otherwise, it would not have been possible for them to bring about cleaner, better and more advanced engines which feature lower emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now at the directive revision stage, at which the Commission, quite rightly, has noted that sulphur is an even more strategic ingredient in the quality of fuels than we then understood. The Commission proposes that by 2011 both petrol and diesel fuel should, for all practical purposes, be sulphur-free. We are talking about very low contents. This is of essential importance, since it has been observed that the consumption of fuels also falls when the sulphur content is reduced, and, in the meantime, climate policy has become a central objective in the European Union. We must find all possible means by which we can reduce car fuel consumption. This is, indeed, one of the most important aims of this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Hopefully, then, the European Parliament will come to the decision tomorrow that we will attain one hundred percent of the target of getting these sulphur-free fuels on the market as early as 2008, rather than by 2011 as the Commission is proposing. In our judgment, this is entirely possible, and it will be a positive influence on the development of cars. The motor industry will be able to develop better and more advanced engines, which will use less fuel.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also proceeding from the assumption, which the Commission also proposes, that this introduction to the market shall start in 2005. It is important that Parliament decides that sulphur-free fuels should be available (by stages) throughout the area of the Union, with the first steps being made in 2005. We are also demanding that this availability be geographically comprehensive. Previously, the situation has been that the various Member States have proceeded at slightly different rates with regard to this improvement in the quality of fuels. The Environment Committee proposes that the Member States be offered the possibility of certain transitional periods or derogations when this directive is next revised. Parliament is proposing that this revision take place a year earlier than was decided by the Commission: we would like the revision to take place during 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the demands of certain parties, the Environment Committee has decided that in this connection no topics other than sulphur should be involved. We can then return to the question of fuel quality parameters other than sulphur during the course of the revision in 2005. In my opinion, this is a well-justified policy, since the Commission will have time to study this topic in the meantime.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to stress that a transition must be made to using cleaner fuels also in work machinery, or <span class="italic">non-road</span> machines of this type. This is entirely possible: in eight Member States diesel fuels are already being used in work machinery. Hopefully, Parliament will decide, tomorrow, that these work machines must begin to use cleaner fuels to the same extent as vehicles on the roads. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The hotter burn of modern vehicle engines delivers higher efficiency and thereby cuts CO2 emissions. However, the resulting increase in nitrogen oxide has to be dealt with by catalysts and the virtual elimination of sulphur renders the catalysts effective in dealing with these. A further benefit is a reduction in the emission of particulates, so the Industry Committee is in favour of the Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">A majority vote in the committee demanded a rather faster implementation than the Commission proposed even if some of us were concerned at the Commission's assertion that this will, in fact, produce a net increase in CO2 emissions. So please tell us, Commissioner, if you stand by your warning or whether you can accept the quicker implementation requested by both the Environment and the Industry Committees.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also point out that the EU standard of 10 parts per million of sulphur contrasts with an American standard of 15 ppm of sulphur. This will make it difficult for us to import fuels from the USA in an emergency. We would also suggest that the Commission instigate research into the implications of ultra-fine particle emissions from gasoline diesel injection engines.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of fuel quality for non-road and off-road machinery is still outstanding. We understand that proposals on this matter will be forthcoming in 2002. This is surely urgently needed but we urge the Commission to give full consideration to the interests of those in industry and agriculture who operate such machinery.</p>
<p class="contents">We give this proposal a fair wind. Indeed, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy would suggest that the Commission hoists a spinnaker and speeds up its implementation. Is the Commissioner prepared to accede to this demand? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I refer to the Auto-Oil I and Auto-Oil II programmes. This work resulted in a balanced proposal which is well-documented from a technical point of view. Congratulations are due to the Commission. I should also like to commend Mrs Hautala, the rapporteur, very warmly on her excellent work.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with her that it is important to make low-sulphur fuels available as soon as possible. This is because technological advances in the automotive industry permit fuel saving, and, more especially, a reduction in polluting emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, nonetheless, true that refineries need to consume more energy and emit more polluting gases in order to produce these fuels. Also, the environmental advantages of low-sulphur fuels will not be felt until vehicles currently on the roads are replaced. It is a matter of balancing out the emissions. We must therefore be pragmatic as regards schedules and adjust the pace of the introduction of the new fuels to the rate of renewal of the existing vehicle population. Otherwise, we would be forcing users to change their vehicles, but that is not an option.</p>
<p class="contents">I do agree that it would be appropriate to reduce the transitional period during which the various fuels could coexist. For the reasons I adduced earlier, however, a degree of flexibility should be afforded to certain countries. My group therefore proposes that, whilst bringing the date forward, we should retain the option of granting temporary derogations to those Member States who can demonstrate that the balance of air quality will prove negative.</p>
<p class="contents">The new fuel ought to be brought in for non-road mobile machinery as well. It should, however, be introduced more gradually in this case, for the same reasons as I outlined in relation to cars.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the reasoning behind our Amendment No 40. I invite you to support it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They do not have to be converted, there are no parts to be fitted or retrofitted. That is a big difference from the debate about leaded and unleaded petrol that we had a few years ago. So any car can take low-sulphur fuel and it has a positive effect, especially with older types of diesel engines. Zero-sulphur fuel reduces particle emissions from these older vehicles too.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of all, however, we need zero-sulphur fuel because we want new technologies to come on to the market, not in order to reduce conventional emissions but to consume less. We need direct injection diesel engines and direct injection petrol engines that have a wide range of lean burn. With lean burn, where little fuel is used, the proportion of nitrogen oxide is greater and we therefore need particular technologies to collect nitrogen oxides in the exhaust system. Look at it which way you will, sulphur prevents that. To save fuel and reduce CO2 in the transport sector we simply need zero-sulphur fuel as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot see, either, why a diesel vehicle with an almost negative particulate value – the air behind is cleaner that that drawn in at the front – is allowed on our streets while on the same street there are tractors and excavators giving off particles en masse because of the poor quality fuel. I believe these vehicles must be required to use clean fuel, too, if we want to cut particle emissions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with most of what the rapporteur has written. Above all, I want to emphasise the importance of bringing this proposal forward from 2011 to 2008. It is very good indeed that we should include fuels for non-road mobile machinery and treat the latter in the same way as all other vehicles. There is no reason at all to accord special treatment to machinery we do not normally see on the roads, but the Commission’s proposal would, if anything, postpone the day when anything advanced could be done in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the rapporteur proposes a thorough review of alternative fuels and also suggests that we can mix in more ethanol than the five per cent permitted under the present ceiling is also very much to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a problem. This concerns the financial incentives. I understand the rapporteur’s train of thought, but I think the proposal is wrong in the way we have written it because, according to the Treaty, we can have financial incentives right now. If we insert this into every directive we now adopt, there is a risk of our creating a horizontal approach whereby we instead restrict the opportunities, as interpreted by the Council, of obtaining financial incentives. Through what we have written today, we are therefore doing ourselves a disservice. That is something I want the rapporteur to think about. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, honourable Members, I am very pleased to be able to address the European Parliament in this debate on behalf of my colleague, Commissioner Wallström. I am pleased in one sense, because it enables me to return to a former stamping ground. I used to be an environment minister in the country I know best. But I am also unhappy I have to be here because the reason is that Commissioner Wallström is not well. I wish her a speedy recovery, so that she can perform for me on the Balkans on some future occasion, or even on Egypt. Can I say as a non-official admirer, as it were, that I recognise that the report by Mrs Hautala contributes significantly to a Commission proposal which will, I would judge bring a combination of environmental and economic benefits to our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The availability of fuels with a maximum sulphur content of 10 parts per million will remove any remaining technical barriers to the introduction of the most fuel efficient vehicles, which will in turn provide a basis for further reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide. When used in older vehicles, there would also be substantial reductions in emissions of conventional pollutants leading to better air quality.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to the key issues which are raised in the proposed amendments and first of all deal with the timetable in terms which I suspect the honourable lady will find fairly familiar. Several of the amendments propose that the final date after which all petrol and diesel sold would be subject to a maximum sulphur content of 10 parts per million, should be advanced by three years to the 1 January 2008 with the possibility of derogation for those Member States where that seems to be justified.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission chose the date of 1 January 20ll, with the date for diesel subject to confirmation by 31 December, five years before in 2006, so that all Member States would enjoy a mix of air quality benefits and some reductions in CO2 emissions resulting from 10 parts per million fuel. Although the Commission is willing to consider some advancement in the final date from 1 January 2011, the Commission does not favour Parliament's approach linked to possible prolongation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission therefore, cannot accept Amendments Nos 5,11, 15, 18, 23, 31, 32, 38 and 39. However, the Commission can accept Amendment No 30 related to advancing the date for the review. The Commission can also accept Amendments Nos 22 and 46 and in part, Amendments Nos 8, 17, 42, 43 and 45, relating to defining in greater detail the availability of petrol and diesel with a maximum sulphur content of 10 parts per million fuel, during the introductory period.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the question of the quality of fuel used in non-road mobile machinery. A number of other amendments refer to the need to improve and harmonise the quality of fuel used in this machinery across the Community. The Commission acknowledges that the relative importance of emissions in this sector continues to grow as the environmental performance of engines used in on-road applications improves.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, it is already clear that the fuel used in this sector in some Member States will have to be improved in the future. However, as the work on the next stage of emission standards for compression ignition engines used in non-road applications is not finalised, nor is the required fuel quality for such standards yet identified, the Commission cannot at this point accept Amendments Nos 3, 12, 26, 37 and 40.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to some other amendments. The Commission does not accept Amendments Nos 10, 19 and 27 on fiscal incentives in view of the legal basis of this proposal, nor given the possibilities available to Member States under other Community legislation to fiscally promote cleaner fuels through tax incentives.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of alternative fuels, and bio-fuels in particular, the Commission is pleased to consider this subject in more depth, as work on this subject evolves. The Commission can therefore accept Amendments Nos 33 and 48 and in principle, Amendments Nos 14 and 44. The Commission can also accept Amendment No 47 in part, relating to other issues to be taken into account in the review and Amendment No 28, in principle and Amendment No 29, relating to reporting. Concerning the remaining amendments, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 20, 21, 24, 25, 36 and 41. We can accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 6, 7, 9, 16 and 34. We can also accept Amendments Nos 4, 13 and 47, in part and Amendment No 35, in principle.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that the Parliament has significantly contributed to improving this proposal. There is humility for you! I therefore would like to thank the rapporteur once again, for her efforts, her professionalism and her dedication and I would like to thank the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy for its input, as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
