<p class="contents">That said, we need to understand the reasons for the gaps highlighted in the management of projects and identify risk factors, in order to improve the situation as much as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the rapporteur’s position in inviting the Commission to take greater care when evaluating the risks of fraud, corruption and non-compliance and efficiency for specific projects. Therefore there needs to be greater transparency and responsibility in the use of EU funds, and Member States and other donors need to be helped in order to avoid making common mistakes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The assistance provided by the EU must be subject to sufficient budgetary control. This does not only mean accounting concerns, but also the means to ensure that the best possible use is being made of the funds. With the same aim in mind, better coordination is needed among donors, including on the reporting and auditing side. I wish to point out Article 22, which sets out extremely useful proposals on this subject. I should also stress Romania’s commitment to the security and stabilisation efforts in Afghanistan, as is demonstrated by the involvement of nearly 2 000 troops in operations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One might say that is a little glitch, a little twitch or knob in the single market – though at GBP 500 million it seems quite a big one – but the single market has always had these imbalances, these national peculiarities.</p>
<p class="contents">It has always operated on the basis that some states have essential national interests. You cannot easily reform the common fisheries policy without this receiving a Spanish veto, or the common agricultural policy without a French veto. Germany has particular interests in its heavy industries and, of course, my own country has an interest in the financial services sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The difference is, however, that our interest is in preserving the single market, and not in having some protectionist exemption. It was extraordinary to hear in the debate yesterday that the UK was somehow turning its back on the single market when all it was asking for was a guarantee that the single market would apply evenly to financial services and would not be applied asymmetrically, to the detriment of the main financial services sector in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not the UK that has abandoned the free market principles which the Treaty of Rome enshrined, but rather the Member States which are pursuing this new union. This makes the UK’s departure, I am afraid, more or less inevitable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">All too often we are witness to accidents that pollute our seas, which are under constant threat also from the rise in the transport of dangerous goods and materials by sea, often in maritime areas protected by special rules due to their naturalistic importance, such as the Bocche di Bonifacio.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I particularly appreciated the rapporteur’s focus on development of the CleanSeaNet service and the SaveSeaNet network. The text was very balanced despite being multi-faceted, recognising the need to define EMSA’s tasks also by taking on more staff, without putting too much pressure on the budget, and underlining the importance of innovative tools such as the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security programme (GMES), while also launching a positive message on support in the sector for gender equality policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A new financial framework is required, as well as a clearer assignment of competences to ensure that the European Maritime Safety Agency operates as effectively as possible. I think that it must promote cooperation between specialist border police departments not only in Member States but in third countries too. I should mention at this point the series of naval exercises carried out by the Romanian border police jointly with the Turkish coastguard in September 2011. This helps strengthen cooperation between the countries located in the Black Sea basin and reduces the intervention time in the event of maritime incidents.</p>

The European Maritime Safety Agency has already done a particularly important job in protecting the seas.

An additional role which I support is supporting Member State action to combat piracy. A system for reducing administrative barriers is also an acceptable use of that Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I cannot support the widening focus of its role to inland navigation and recruitment of seafarers. Moreover, I believe the suggestion of it having an anti-pollution role is too controversial and thus cannot be supported. In particular, in my Member State, the UK, we have reservations regarding the extension of the Agency’s role in the analysis of the safety of mobile offshore oil and gas installations. I firmly believe that the Maritime Safety Agency should not have competence in this area and that this is completely unnecessary, given that the UK’s North Sea oil field already has high offshore exploration safety standards in place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should point out that, at EU level, the transport sector provides roughly 10 million jobs, accounting for around 5% of GDP. The disparities need to be reduced between the EU’s eastern and western regions in terms of infrastructure development level. Stable funding must be provided for projects.</p>

This explains the need to combine different modes of cross-border transport in an efficient way in order to meet the requirements for safe, sustainable and environmentally-friendly transport. It is particularly necessary to extend Trans-European Transport Networks. Seventy-five per cent of transport is by road. Measured against gross domestic product, the transport sector accounts for 10% of the prosperity of the European Union and creates over 10 million jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Although a lot has improved, European infrastructure is still suffering from the after-effects of the Iron Curtain, and it is vital that the transport connections from East to West and from North to South should be significantly improved. Investment in infrastructure is crucial in order to generate economic growth into the future. That is why I have voted in favour of the motion and I am looking forward to the amendments that will now be produced. You have my thanks for this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is every reason to be very worried about the situation in Uzbekistan with respect to human rights, democratisation and the rule of law. There is systematic use of forced labour in the textile industry there, involving children in particular. It has been completely impossible to monitor the health, working conditions and age of children and students, and the punishments they receive for disobedience, because Uzbekistan forbids foreign inspectors and human rights representatives to come into the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Uzbekistan’s actions violate international human rights obligations and the rules of the International Labour Organisation. Fortunately, retailers of textile products in Europe have now decided to stop buying cotton from Uzbekistan. That is an indication of the ethics and morals of European businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">However, on its own, this is still not enough. Parliament should not approve any trade agreement until the Uzbek authorities have allowed ILO observers into the country. It also needs to be confirmed that the country has implemented reforms and achieved notable results regarding the complete end to the use of forced labour and child labour, at national, regional and local level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Crucially the report takes into account the concerns of the EU Presidency, UNICEF and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) with respect to the alleged use of forced child labour in the Uzbek textile industry.</p>
<p class="contents">It also quite appropriately requests the Commission to conduct a feasibility study on an effective traceability mechanism for goods produced, which would go some way to address the issue of forced child labour. The proposed agreement would also give Uzbek cotton the most-favoured-nation status thus allowing trade with the EU which is free from quantitative restrictions, which can only be good for the long-term development of Uzbekistan.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally the report quite rightly calls for an ILO investigation into the alleged forced child labour breaches. Such an investigation should happen without delay.

<p class="contents">It is difficult to think of a more textbook case of a repressive regime than that in Uzbekistan. That beautiful country with the ancient cities of the Silk Road is being treated more or less as the personal property of the president’s family and of some of their cronies. There is an almost Caligulan tyranny there, and a regime which is involved in drug running and repression – two opponents of the regime were boiled to death while in prison.</p>
<p class="contents">And yet the West has tended to hold back from criticism because in the uncertain days immediately after 9/11 the Karimov dictatorship had the wit to declare itself an ally in the war on terror and to make its bases available for use in the Afghan campaign.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the error we make again and again in Muslim countries. We made it with the Shah in Iran, we made it in Egypt and we are making it in Saudi Arabia. There is no, or very little, fundamentalism in Uzbekistan. A traveller there does not see beards, does not perceive headscarves and does not hear the call to prayer. However, if we define every opponent of the Karimov tyranny as a fundamentalist, we will eventually make that prediction come true and we will create the very thing we purport to fear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the other hand, we should always be watchful for the negative consequences of this process because nothing will be achieved by these people simply migrating from one social system to another. That is why there is just one thing I would like to see: namely that we should pay due attention to this process – which I would again emphasise we all support – so that we do not overlook its negative effects, but rather make simple adjustments as and when necessary. After all, there is no disputing the fact that the European Union can only develop successfully if its people enjoy free movement, if they can seek work in other regions and if they can contribute to economic prosperity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, there is also a principle that applies not just within the European Union, but also under the rule of law, namely: <span class="italic">pacta sunt servanda</span> – treaties are to be honoured. According to the Treaty, a clause applies to the free movement of workers, setting down a period of three years, plus two years, plus two years. Accordingly, I was unable to support this resolution today, as it is just a symbol of a willingness to alter treaties while they are still in force. In my opinion, it should be up to the Member States themselves to decide. This is what it says in the Treaties. That was correct. Nonetheless, when the Treaties lapse and all restrictions run out, there will be no wave of mass migration to the old Member States from the other Member States. I am absolutely convinced that it is by working together that we will achieve progress in the European Union and that no more barriers should be imposed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I realise that there are people in this Parliament who avoid debates on a report that does not say anything or does not say a great deal, which is the case with this strategy on Central Asia. Although the European Union adopted a strategy in 2007 and this Parliament has two resolutions, the report does not actually assess the way in which this strategy has been applied. It is a litany of problems, expressed in terribly stilted language, which very clearly proves that no one is even familiar with the situation in the area. It mentions a security situation, ignoring that there are also neutral countries in the region. Nothing is known about these countries’ involvement in the situation of the conflict in Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in addition to this, this report sets out a certain type of thinking which, as I see it, is damaging to this Parliament. It gives guidelines and attempts to export economic and cultural models to a region which is totally different, thereby continuing to abandon this region to the sphere of influence and interest of Russia, which wants to recreate a former Soviet Union. I believe that there is no place for this superficial type of approach, characterised by a lack of information and preconceptions, at least in our relations with Central Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Central Asia may become a priority and is a priority for many Member States. The fact that we are setting the human rights situation as a condition on signing a number of agreements in the region is a must, but setting this condition must go beyond just fine statements. It must be followed up by our involvement in this area, by an attempt to export our models and good European practice, and backed up by cooperation with these countries in the education sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are fighting for better working conditions; they are fighting for an increase in pay due to the very harsh conditions they experience – which I saw for myself; they are fighting for the right to have independent trade unions; and they are calling for nationalisation, under workers’ control, of all enterprises in the oil extraction sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The Kazakhstan Government and the oil giant Kazmunaigaz have completely ignored the just demands of these workers and have effectively refused to engage in meaningful negotiations. Instead, the workers have been met with very severe and brutal repression. One trade unionist has been murdered; another worker’s daughter has been killed and their lawyer has been jailed for six years. Violence continues against these workers.

The potential they offer has not been fully tapped at EU level, including from an economic and commercial perspective. Cooperation with the European Union means for the countries in this region access to a huge outlet market, an alternative export destination and new opportunities for technological and industrial development.</p>
<p class="contents">From an EU perspective, economic relations offer opportunities for diversifying our supply sources for energy and raw materials. Efforts need to be stepped up to implement Nabucco. At the same time, I should mention the importance of launching other projects aimed at interconnecting energy and transport networks.

The economic crisis has led Member States to seek new ways to increase labour productivity. One way to do this, and to prolong the working lives of employees, is to invest properly in health and safety at work. Increased labour productivity and longer working lives, however, will both be impossible to achieve unless we take into consideration the human needs of employees. Well-being at work and labour productivity always go hand in hand.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, there is already a realisation in many organisations that people’s heightened state of good physical and mental well-being reduces costs.

I would like to emphasise three points that I consider particularly important. The first is paragraph 82, which we approved today. I would have preferred it if we had given an even clearer signal in regard to work-life balance, everything relating to occupational health and how we regulate work, the rhythm we provide workers with, including, above all, the protection of Sundays as a day of rest. I myself have launched an initiative in this regard and I believe we can all play our part in supporting March 3 next year as a Europe-wide day for Sunday as a day of rest.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe paragraph 16 is particularly important. After all, burnout is one of the illnesses that generates the highest costs in Europe. We urgently need a burnout strategy, and next year the European Commission is to publish a relevant study, as well as holding out the prospect of a Green Paper. This is something we urgently need to discuss in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as the rapporteur for the European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations 2012, I would like to make the following call: let us work together in Europe to ensure we respect everyone, both workers and employers alike, in health, vitality and dignity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Afghanistan is amongst the recipient countries receiving the most civilian aid from the EU general budget. In the period 2002-2010 the combined EU (European Community and Member States) budget for aid to Afghanistan totalled around EUR 8 billion, but a significant proportion of the EU aid was lost along the distribution chain. The main reasons for this are: waste, excessive use of intermediaries, security costs, overbilling and corruption. I strongly believe that the EU must ensure transparency and accountability in relation to the financial assistance provided to the Afghan Government, international organisations and local NGOs, in order to ensure the coherence of aid and the success of Afghanistan’s reconstruction and development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Until then, the EU, which supports more than 50% of Afghanistan’s foreign aid, will need to continue to have a budgetary appropriation available, not just to cover personnel costs, but also to fund all the projects that it has underway in this country. As such, the EU should continue to help the Afghan Government overcome this tragic situation and establish a fully democratic state; in other words, one with respect for minorities, for gender equality and for the values enshrined in the International Bill of Human Rights.

This country is amongst the recipient countries receiving the most civilian aid from the EU general budget. It is of great concern that a large proportion of international aid goes astray in the distribution chain, in particular through waste, excessive intermediary and security costs, overbilling and corruption. It is therefore necessary for the Commission to supervise and monitor the cost and effectiveness of all EU aid to Afghanistan, with a view to ensuring that it is used more efficiently. The overall objective of EU development assistance to Afghanistan should be to assist in the long-term sustainable development of the country, including the improvement of socio-economic standards, facilitating job creation and the proliferation of small and medium-sized enterprises, strengthening the education sector and ensuring gender equality. Such aid should further facilitate capacity-building in public administration, strengthen the rule of law and reduce corruption, thus facilitating the transfer of responsibility for security to the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. I believe that there is an urgent need to increase the efficiency of aid, as many development indicators still show no significant improvement, and corruption and the long distribution chain of international aid remain the principal obstacles to the provision of essential services to the people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I firmly believe that, with strict financial controls on such funding and with experience, whether it comes from EU Member States or from our US partners, we will be able to arrive at a solution that really will help Afghanistan. I think that the most important area, apart from the independence of the judiciary – as pinpointed by Mr Geier – is to improve the situation in the field of education. Only in this way will it be possible to achieve sustainable development and to resolve the situation in the long term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For these reasons we need to identify best practice in relation to expenditure. A cause for concern remains the issue of coordination of the aid.

With a plethora of international originations operating in theatre complementing the NATO ISAF mission, it is essential that partners coordinate their efforts to avoid duplication and therefore the needless squandering of resources. Of particular relevance here is the relationship between the EU and UN agencies and the direct EU budgetary support for Afghanistan, where there is a serious risk of duplication. The seemingly ubiquitous problems of government corruption, tribal nepotism, the hazardous security situation for EU officials as targets of the Taliban and poorly trained Afghan officials must be addressed with renewed vigour, and monitored closely. Audit bodies administering financial aid must be transparent and accountable. My hope is that EU financial assistance will assist in the creation of robust institutions and democratic mechanisms within Afghanistan in order that, following the 2014 withdrawal of foreign troops, Kabul can maintain internal security and adequate counter-insurgency capabilities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the report mentions, there is no single approach to which model of funding to use, as this depends in part on the objectives to be achieved.

The result of this evaluation was that enormous discrepancies were uncovered. In a comparative analysis of the administration of financing by the EU and US, the rapporteur refers to the benefits of major leverage and effective coordination of aid under the ‘Common Administration with International Organisations’ financing form, while also pointing to the need for negotiations on accountability and transparency as disadvantages. This analysis concludes that “direct budgetary aid to the Afghan national budget” should be chosen as the future method of providing aid, something I cannot agree with. Although the rapporteur recognises the problem of susceptibility to fraud and corruption, he seems to believe that there are sufficient safeguards in the clause permitting the discontinuation of budgetary aid to poorly performing administrative institutions. Accountability requirements are not sufficiently met and the actual aid in individual cases can be described as mediocre at best. It is not easy to redress the disadvantages of ‘Common Administration with International Organisations’: it should be stated clearly that NGOs that receive EU funds to administer must produce regular accountability reports to indicate clearly and unambiguously how much they have spent and where and these reports must also be published on the institutions’ websites. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With specific reference to state aid in the financial sector, I agree with the rapporteur in his invitation to the Commission to link the extension beyond 2011 with more stringent conditions related to the reduction of the balance sheet composition and size of certain financial institutions. While I appreciate the role the Commission has played thus far in minimising the distortions in the banking system thanks to a balanced interpretation of the European law on state aid, I believe that we need to introduce a new permanent regulatory system for in the application of state aid rules, in particular as regards the financial sector, and to quickly come forward with the relative legislative proposal to address at European level resolution of the problem of failing banks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report rightly places the emphasis on the need to keep the European economic panorama as wide open as possible, not least because in times of crisis the economy can only recover though free enterprise, not protectionism or government interference. I agree that it is appropriate to promote the exchange between the Commission and consumer associations, and I wholeheartedly approve of the proposal to introduce new rules to regulate state aid in some key areas like that of finance.

The European Parliament welcomes the fact that the Commission responded to the outbreak of the crisis in a prompt and reasonable manner by approving special State aid rules and using competition policy as a crisis management tool. Sizable amounts of state aid granted during the crisis in the form of, for example, guarantee schemes, recapitalisation schemes and complementary forms of liquidity support on bank funding have contributed to severe imbalances in public finances. The Commission should continue to investigate the competition situation in the retail sector, in particular the consequences of alleged abuse of market power by dominant retail chains with negative consequences for small retailers and producers operating in the agricultural and food market. The European Parliament also takes the view that competition policy should contribute to the promotion and application of open standards and to ensuring interoperability in order to prevent the technological lock-in of consumers and clients by a minority of market players. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is noteworthy that, while the environment in which EU competition policy operates is undergoing profound changes such as rapid technological development, expansion or globalisation, time does not affect the various provisions of the 1957 Treaty that prohibit certain anti-competition agreements and abuse of a dominant position, and likewise does not affect the provisions on state aid, which testifies to their inherent ability to be applied in a variety of circumstances. Given the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commission in the area of competition policy, which was confirmed by the Treaty of Lisbon, the Commission is entitled to adopt detailed rules on how it intends to use its main instruments – the provisions of the Treaty relating to antitrust policy and provisions on mergers and state aid. Since implementation of the competition policy began, the EU has been characterised by two principal features in particular: its contribution to the building and maintenance of the internal market and its contribution to the interests of consumers. At the same time, the competition policy supports the main objectives of the European Union enshrined in the Treaties: a competitive market, economic, social and territorial cohesion and sustainable development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For four decades, from the very beginnings of the creation of the Community, competition policy has been the essential basis for economic cooperation. Today we must also find a solution to the market movements distorted by the crisis, by using fair regulation. The Commission has attempted to react effectively to the economic crisis; it has approved rules on state aid while remaining within the framework of competition policy. I agree with the opinion of the rapporteurs, that we also need a global approach to competition regulations. The report addresses a number of sectors, which is why the call for a prompt implementation of the internal energy market package is justified, in order to create an open and competitive single energy market. The introduction of effective cost analysis in all phases of the food supply chain is equally important for consumer interest protection. The Commission’s guidelines aimed at rescuing and restructuring the banking sector are also unavoidable, and the observance and application of these guidelines will have to be monitored. I agree with linking future temporary state aid for the banking sector to stricter conditions; furthermore, appropriate attention should be paid to a more ethical consumer credit provision. The market distortions created by the crisis can only be resolved through joint EU action. I voted for the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, as in my opinion competition policy is a key factor in developing the EU into a dynamic, efficient and innovative internal market and in strengthening its competitiveness on the world market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with the opinion that protectionism and the non-enforcement of competition rules will not contribute to solving the crisis in any way. On the contrary, a properly conceived competition policy should help to build a dynamic and innovative internal market that will successfully face global competition. Even in times of crisis, cartel agreements remain the most serious threat to competition, consumer welfare and the proper functioning of markets, and therefore it is justified to impose fines as a tool for enforcing the applicable laws. I believe, however, that the Commission should examine individual cases with special care and ensure that the amounts of fines imposed do not irreparably jeopardise the economic viability of the enterprise concerned, which would lead to its bankruptcy, liquidation and, consequently, large job losses. The crisis situation means that the responses to the challenges arising must take into account the complex economic and social context and must not penalise EU citizens even more. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since 1 May 2009, the scope of the EGF has been expanded to include support for workers made redundant as a direct consequence of the economic, financial and social crisis. At this time of severe crisis, one of the principal consequences of which has been an increase in unemployment, the EU needs to use all the means at its disposal to respond, particularly with regard to providing support for those who find themselves without a job.

Today’s vote was, controversy aside, a vote for or against the EGF. As we work on extending this fund beyond 2013 – which, it should be pointed out, is one of the EU’s only concrete actions to tackle the social consequences of the crisis – it seemed important to me to express my support for the EGF. It certainly appears that, in Renault’s case, not all the rules have been fully respected (funding of so-called passive training rather than active training) and that the French company has shown a certain reluctance to provide the information it was asked for. It is therefore vital to find a solution for the workers who now find themselves in difficulty. In the long term, this French case shows us that we need to improve management of the EGF in the forthcoming budgetary period. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This application concerns the automotive manufacturer Renault, in which the French Government also has a stake. Despite the economic crisis, Renault is still making large profits; however, it has been using money from the national and European budgets for years for the purpose of mass redundancies. It hopes to do likewise in this particular instance, for 3 000 workers, without using its own funds or profits for the bonuses and ‘social plan’ which are compulsory under French law. As the French trade unions have complained, for years Renault has done nothing to defend the rights of workers or to maintain jobs. </p>

However, we cannot support this; every Member State is obliged to provide and all workers are entitled to receive a decent pension, meaning that the solution lies in public support for viable insurance funds, not in passing ‘charity’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, the satisfaction of the application was made more complicated by the fact that the employees who had been made redundant chose an early retirement plan, which resulted in a conflict with present European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) regulations. The pension rights of people who have been made redundant, however, changed during the pension reform, and it was bona fide employees who suffered. I do, however, recognise the efforts made by the French Government and all parties to solve the situation, and I nevertheless consider it appropriate for Renault’s application to be financed from EGF funds. I consider the existence of this fund to be very important, as it offers extensive support to those who have been made redundant as a result of the economic crisis in finding new jobs through retraining. Hopefully those Member States that have not yet received support from the fund due to high cost-sharing or insufficient administrative capacity, will also receive support from the EGF. One positive example, however, is Holland, which has set the objective of taking maximum advantage of European Union subsidies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Redundancies at Renault in France, while very unfortunate for the workers, have nothing to do with “globalisation” and everything to do with corporate policy. The Renault Group is not in economic difficulties and, if business is slow in some markets, this is due to internal problems within the company relating to service and the delivery of new cars. In addition, Renault has also moved production capacity to ‘Dacia’ because it can produce more cheaply in Romania, and is planning significant foreign investment (for example in Brazil). If French workers lose their jobs as a result, I do not see this as a reason to reward this conglomerate with approximately EUR 25 million from the European budget, instead of being called to account by the French State for its share in providing social cover for its former workers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU is still suffering from its decisions not being understood by its citizens, who still feel detached from them. The challenge of bringing Europe and its citizens closer together is more relevant than ever: guaranteeing transparency of the decisions issued by the EU as well as free access to the documents of the three institutions is vital if we want to rise to the challenge. The European Parliament is already an open and transparent institution that widely publishes its meetings and reports. Indeed, it is thanks to more transparency that citizens can take part in the democratic process with full knowledge of the facts. I therefore voted in favour of this report, which seeks to strengthen public access to documents and democracy in the European Union. This opening up of access to documents in particular gives national political stakeholders the chance to check the acts of the European institutions, and it integrates all content whatever its medium concerning a matter falling within the sphere of responsibility of a Union institution. We can thus make progress towards transparency with the aim of clarifying the opacity of ‘Brussels’ decisions for all European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Transparency, which is an expression of the right to good administration, also represents an excellent tool for its control. Extending the definition of a document to include any electronic media may make it significantly easier to access them. The practice of broadcasting Parliament’s plenary sessions and committee meetings online is a good example of transparency and openness of activities. The Commission should also give a clear indication of its willingness to ensure greater transparency in the functioning of the EU’s institutions, bodies, offices and agencies. Various restrictions on access to documents, including while they are being drafted, may equate to a blocking of public information. The decision to refuse access to a document should therefore be made on the basis of clearly and precisely formulated rules, which also set out special exceptions.

<p class="contents">First of all, it must be highlighted that public access to EU documents increases the level of transparency of the EU institutions, with the upshot of a higher level of public confidence and a sense of closeness to the EU. I am pleased to see that the report contained a number of ambitious amendments to the Commission’s proposal. The suggestions made offer citizens wider access compared with the Commission’s text, which ignores some aspects of the jurisprudence of the CJEU (for example, in the Turco v. Council case). Secondly, the definition chosen for ‘documents’ is much more suitable than the Commission’s definition. Third-party documents held by institutions must be accessible under the current system which has worked fairly well. I also support the document classification system proposed by the rapporteur and I think that it is adequate for maintaining the level of protection required to ensure the smooth operation of EU institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As an example of democracy in action, the European Union felt the need to demonstrate to its citizens that it has nothing to hide, so it adopted its first regulation on transparency 10 years ago. This report, drafted by Mr Cashman, concerns the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission regarding public access to the documents of the EU institutions. Access to information and the documents of public bodies – while it can be embarrassing at times – is a fundamental right of the public and should be treated as such. Nevertheless, there is a need to safeguard a level of confidentiality on certain subjects, both for personal and copyright reasons, and to prevent those with privileged access to certain information from making improper use of it.</p>
<p class="contents">I voted for this report, because I believe there should be transparency on all the decisions of public bodies, provided that exceptions remain – as they seem to be – safeguarded: classified and confidential documents, and those relating to private life under the terms of the Statute for Members and the Staff Regulations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The principles and limits governing this right of access have been determined by Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents, which became applicable on 3 December 2001. However, as a number of substantive changes have been made to the regulation, it should be recast in the interests of clarity and better comprehensibility. Transparency in the legislative process is of utmost importance for citizens. Therefore, institutions should actively disseminate documents that are part of the legislative process, and dissemination should also be encouraged in other areas. On account of the highly sensitive content of certain documents, it should be borne in mind under all circumstances that they should be treated in a special and responsible manner.</p>

Citizens have a right to know that not only the European Commission and Parliament but also the Council of Ministers are accountable to them. At times, there is an unfair perception that important decisions are simply taken in Brussels and then ‘imposed’ on national governments. Making clear how ministers and prime ministers vote in the Council will allow citizens to be better informed about how decisions are made on EU policies that affect them. The report should also be welcomed because it clarifies rules and imposes limits on which EU documents can be classified. Parliament inserted a rule stating that EU documents can only be classified where their disclosure would undermine the essential interests of the EU or one of its Member States, most notably on public security and defence matters. My hope is that we can now have constructive negotiations with the Council and Commission to reach an agreement and enhance the EU’s accountability and credibility with citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report goes far beyond the objective of achieving greater transparency by improving public access to documents. Existing legislation and interinstitutional agreements are ignored and the protection of intellectual property, sensitive and personal data is treated with contempt. Administrative processes and decisions, including those relating to personnel issues, should be published. The same applies to the protection of trade secrets and sensitive information within the framework of approval procedures, court proceedings and competition procedures. The report contains definitions that are vague, lack clarity and cast their net too widely. Any data or content connected in any way with the policies, measures and decisions of all bodies and institutions of the EU is defined as a document. This largely also includes preparatory, confidential and secret documents, as well as all associated information. Thus, the definition covers not only documents, but also information. The publication of information from ongoing interinstitutional processes, such as informal trialogue negotiations, enables public access to the procedure. This would open up the possibility of external influence. Lobbyists would have direct access to the legislative process. This report does not benefit our citizens.

The European Parliament is the most transparent of the EU institutions with agendas and legislative documents, including amendments, available online prior to any vote.

Plenary sessions and committees are also web-streamed, allowing all EU citizens and journalists to follow sessions live. Voting results are published, including details of which MEPs voted and how they voted in the case of roll-call votes. Decision-making in the European Parliament in the absence of a standing governing coalition (like most national parliamentary systems) requires a permanent search for possible compromises. This ‘space to think’ needs to be safeguarded to preserve the functioning of the EP’s system of compromise. The Cashman report confuses access to documents with administrative procedures and goes beyond the remit of its legal base. This also puts into question the interinstitutional agreement on the use of classified material. The Irish EPP delegation fully supports transparency but public access to documents must also meet legal requirements.

The rapporteur, Mr Cashman, was also responsible for the proposal for revision of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001. There he put forward some crucial modifications to the European Commission’s proposal presented on 30 April 2008. The European Parliament voted on and supported those on 11 March 2009. After the EP’s election in June 2009 Mr Cashman was reappointed as rapporteur on the dossier. On 1 December the Lisbon Treaty entered into force and to a large extent modified the legal framework for the revision of this regulation. Already in 2006 he drafted the resolution of the European Parliament approved overwhelmingly by MEPs, containing a list of recommendations for improvement of the current regulation. In this perspective, when the Commission presented its proposal for revision in 2008, expectations were very high as to how the standards on public access to EU documents could be improved. However, despite some positive modifications inserted in the proposal which are clearly justifiable, like the extension of the beneficiaries of this regulation, and conformity with the Aarhus Convention, others would, in my view, represent a step backwards for transparency, especially if we consider that most of the European Parliament’s requests of 2006 have not been taken into account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Bureaucratic procedures and decisions, which also comprise aspects regarding the staff, will be published. The same goes for intellectual property, business secrets and sensitive information in the context of admission procedures, trials and competition proceedings. The report provides woolly and vague definitions. Documents are taken to mean any data or content connected in any way with the EU’s policies, measures or decisions of the bodies and institutions. This also broadly includes preparatory, confidential and secret documents as well as all related information. Hence the definition comprises not only documents but also information. The publication of information about ongoing interinstitutional proceedings, e.g. informal trialogue negotiations, creates a public access to the procedure. This would open those negotiations to direct influence from outside, e.g. through lobbying. The report is not in the interests of our citizens.

However, we note in many Member States the inability to satisfactorily deal with the problem of waste management. In recent years, waste management has become a social problem of the utmost importance. The difficulty of managing these issues has negative effects not only on human health and well-being, but also on the environment in the broader sense. Although the Union adopted draft legislation to guarantee a suitable legal framework to deal with the problem, analysis of waste management policies yields conflicting information. Some Member States, including Denmark, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden, are very advanced, while other EU countries have been very slow to implement strategies on waste, which has led to serious breaches of European legislation. It is clear to me that we need urgently to implement a consistent policy on waste management in Europe. I therefore agree with the rapporteur that the Commission’s proposal to establish a more proactive waste management monitoring procedure together with an early warning system in the area of compliance is a good one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EMSA also provides Member States and the European Commission with scientific and technical assistance so that they are able to apply Community legislation. The activities of this agency are important because it has, since its inception, conducted more than 100 investigations of various kinds relating to safety, security and the prevention of pollution from ships.

The European Parliament and the Council adopted Regulation 1406/2002 on 27 June 2002. The regulation came into effect in August of the same year, while EMSA started operating in March 2003. In accordance with Article 22 of that regulation, its Administrative Board commissioned an independent external evaluation on the implementation of the regulation in 2007. Based on this evaluation, it issued recommendations regarding changes to the regulation, to the Agency and its working practices in June 2008. Certain provisions need to be clarified and updated and, in addition, EMSA should be given a number of further roles reflecting the development of maritime safety policy at EU and international levels. The extraction of oil and gas and offshore production activities pose risks to maritime transport and the marine environment.

I fully support the proposal to provide the EMSA with greater scope to assist neighbouring countries as search and rescue operations know no geographical or political boundaries. However, it is regrettable that the Commission has yet to undertake a study into the creation of a European coastguard despite the adoption of the directive on ship source pollution which mandates the Commission to do so.

EMSA has already been given new tasks as a result of the implementation of the third maritime safety package. It has concluded a number of ‘stand-by oil spill response vessel contracts’ with private operators who will switch from their regular activity into pollution response mode in case of emergency. The Commission proposal would make clear that such vessels could also be used to combat pollution from other sources, including oil rigs.

In my opinion, however, we should amend the legislation as little as possible. Secondly, the aim of the proposed amendments to the Regulation is to expand the tasks of EMSA. I, however, consider the proposed set of tasks for the Agency to be too wide, and it seems to me that the proposed Regulation lacks a clear specification of competences. Thirdly, I have concerns over setting the budget.

It should remain the rightful organisation for guaranteeing security and safety in EU maritime areas.

Originally created to prevent disasters like the loss of the <span class="italic">Erika</span> being repeated, the Agency is fundamental to the protection of our seas.

I applaud the courage and determination of the Syrian people, particularly its women, in their struggle for freedom, dignity and democracy. The Syrian opposition should seek to establish a united platform committed to achieving freedom and democracy and respect for human rights for all in Syria.

However, President Bashar al-Assad and his regime, despite all the condemnations made by the EU and various international institutions, in particular the Arab League, insist on ‘riding out’ a totalitarian regime that does not respect a bare minimum of human rights. Indeed, there are reports of persecution of doctors simply for having treated victims of the regime, and of blocking access to detainees and the entry of humanitarian aid to a population whose situation is worsening because of the cuts in the electricity and water supplies. The brutal repression of thousands of civilians is unleashing an arms race. Civil war and the massacre of the population are feared. There is therefore an urgent need for the Syrian regime to stop the violence and accept the constitution of a single platform, with the participation of the regime’s opponents, so as to prepare the transition to democracy.</p>

An increasing number of Syrians are facing a deteriorating humanitarian situation that is leading to a humanitarian crisis, systematically increasing violence, and violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms. It is essential that the Syrian authorities and military and security forces immediately cease all acts of violence, torture, persecution and repression against the civilian population and immediately release all political prisoners held in arbitrary detention.

<p class="contents">The series of events known as the Arab Spring has shown that people in the Arab countries do not in fact support a situation in which the leaders have no democratic mandate. The way of thinking in the West during the Cold War, where dictators were tolerated, if not even favoured, if it only suited the political aims of one’s own camp, was so deeply rooted, that the speed of events came as a surprise to Western countries used to realpolitik. If Muammar Gaddafi had succeeded in quashing the revolution in Libya when it began, it would inevitably have been followed by large-scale and thorough acts of revenge against the civilian population. There is a real danger that something similar will happen in Syria, if foreign pressure eases off and those currently in power re-establish their position.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, from the historical point of view, economic sanctions alone have only worked in a handful of cases in modern times, and, on the whole, have mainly targeted that section of the population whose interests one is trying to promote. We therefore have to prepare for the possibility that military intervention is unavoidable. After all, Turkey has already unilaterally established a security zone close to its border, which the international community has, at least implicitly, approved.</p>
<p class="contents">United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, which freed the people of Libya, was epoch-making. With it, Europe adopted a long-term, real initiative in global policy. If no peaceful solution is found for the crisis in Syria, we will have to prepare for a situation in which there will once again be a need for a similar initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When one considers developments such as the recent general strikes, it would also seem that resistance is growing among the population.

The Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left considers that this particular economic governance package is the wrong response to the crisis. Its objective is not economic coordination, as it maintains; it is to impose a permanent austerity memorandum throughout Europe, on all the workers. It is clear from the results of the scoreboard in question that convergence is being translated into an increase in competitiveness, by institutionalising austerity and making cutbacks to wages, pensions and rights. Indicators relating to income imbalances and the reduction in poverty are missing from the scoreboard and the unemployment indicator has very little weighting. The euro area is dealing with massive structural problems that are creating imbalances that are being shouldered mainly by the workers both in the countries in surplus and in the countries in deficit. As the economic governance package – and hence the scoreboard of macroeconomic imbalances – cannot provide fair and radical solutions in terms of getting the euro area out of the crisis and ensuring that it functions viably, I voted against this specific motion for a resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thus, in order to ensure the problems and the solutions to be implemented are correctly identified, a macroeconomic framework is essential for the whole Union.

On 16 November 2011, Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011 of the European Parliament and the Council on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances was adopted, as part of a series of regulations on economic governance. This motion for a resolution follows the question for oral answer, pursuant to Rule 115(5) of the Rules of Procedure, and is based on the Commission services working paper entitled ‘Scoreboard for the surveillance of macroeconomic imbalances: envisaged initial design’. In order to prevent certain Member States from experiencing further financial slippages which could lead to a new crisis, and in line with the proposals of the ‘six pack’, there will be ‘macroeconomic surveillance’, with a focus on countries with current account deficits and surpluses. I am therefore voting for this motion for a resolution, since I believe there should be greater rigour in the management of public money, so that the markets – particularly the financial markets – will regain the confidence that they have lost, and the EU will eventually be able to take up a position of leadership in terms of economic growth and job creation, thus working towards the goals outlined in the Europe 2020 strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the current economic situation, it is essential for a framework for macroeconomic supervision to be created as soon as possible and for it to start functioning as soon as possible. Member State governments must be prepared to act with regard to any problems, since only in this way will it be possible to ensure that the supervisory framework has the desired effect. In connection with the creation of future macroeconomic tables (which may contain a wide range of indicators), these indicators must be based on independent and verifiable official statistics from the European Statistical System and the European System of Central Banks.

The declaration made by the Commission on the data sources and statistic transformations it wishes to use is to be welcomed, I believe this is the correct way to go, and I support it. Besides this, of course, it is also important for the Commission to take into account the most up-to-date data available and to ensure complete transparency with regard to what data is being used. It should also be emphasised that it is important for the new macroeconomic imbalance surveillance mechanism to be harmonised and integrated with the upcoming European semester. However, we should not forget either that the scoreboard plays an important role in relaying information, as the selection of indicators sends a clear attitude-forming message to political decision-makers and stakeholders about the types of macroeconomic developments that may give cause for concern and therefore need close supervision.

In order to ensure that this legislative package can function as effectively as possible, an appropriate set of macroeconomic indicators need to be identified, as well as associated alert levels which would trigger the application of preventive and corrective mechanisms. These mechanisms would guarantee the possibility of an early detection of external and internal imbalances in the economies of the Member States and enable the European Commission to respond appropriately. The European Parliament’s resolution is a response to the European Commission’s proposal for such indicators, and points to the areas where the Commission's proposal can be improved. Particular attention should be paid to the failure to take adequate account of spillover effects and the dynamics of the unemployment rate. It should also be noted that the European Parliament has not been consulted on this matter, so that the motion for a resolution drawn up by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is the only effective way for Parliament’s to be heard on this issue. I therefore voted in favour of adopting the motion for a resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This procedure is based on a punitive approach that is unacceptable. In this case, it is all the more unfair as it penalises trade deficits, but the same does not happen with surpluses, which can be just as harmful to the overall economic interests of the Union.

This White Paper, adopted by the European Commission in March 2011, sets out a detailed strategy for the development of a competitive transport system and key objectives to be achieved by 2050. I support Parliament’s opinion that the EU’s high degree of dependence on imported fossil fuels entails significant risks in terms of the Union’s economic security and in terms of the flexibility of its external policy options. I believe that it is necessary to ensure the successful development of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T), effectively link the transport networks of all EU regions and eliminate disparities between the levels of infrastructure development in the EU Member States. I agree that Member States should commit themselves to eliminating the main known bottlenecks in every transport mode and to ensuring that, by 2025, the transport infrastructure of the new Member States reaches the level of the other Member States. The Commission should increase the stability of funding of TEN-T projects. EU cofunding should be based on the “use it or lose it” principle. We must take decisive action to clearly formulate, develop and implement the future goals of an effective and competitive EU transport policy.

At the vote on recasting the directives on the rail sector during the last plenary session, I was opposed to the idea of asking the European Commission to make proposals in 2012 to separate infrastructure management and transport operations as well as to open up the internal passenger rail transport market. This idea was restated in the Grosch report. I believe, however, that, despite the fact that it was adopted in November in the previous report, it is still a bad idea. I therefore voted against this own-initiative report, which also contained provisions aiming to promote the circulation of ‘gigaliners’ as they are called, the ecological benefit of which is debatable, to say the least! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, I agree with many of the points it contains. I refer in particular to the paragraphs recommending liberalisation of the railways, which would especially benefit the Italian railway market. However, the report’s unquestioning support for the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) project is a problem. More and more critical issues are continuing to emerge with regard to this project, which involves the construction of trans-European rail, motorway and river networks. It is an immensely ambitious project, and there are concerns about its feasibility, from the point of view of both finance and planning, as the slow and uncertain progress thus far has shown. As <span class="italic">Lega Nord </span>has always maintained, our region does not need grandiose projects that are impossible to bring to fruition, but greater attention to its actual, immediate needs. At the moment the way the TEN-T project is being managed appears to be totally superficial and badly planned, and therefore I was unable to vote in its favour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The transport sector is particularly important and has great potential to develop and deliver innovation in areas such as transport, logistics and mobility. EU transport can also play a role in other areas, such as innovation, research, the environment, sustainable economic growth and energy. This sector can also make a major contribution to achieving the goals of the EU’s “Europe 2020” economic growth strategy. Taking into account economic, employment, environmental, social and territorial aspects, the aim should be to complete the European internal transport market by further opening-up transport networks and markets. The European Commission should ensure that proposals on the opening-up of services in all transport markets do not lead to social dumping or poorer quality services, or create the conditions for the emergence of monopolies or oligopolies. In order to address properly the problems of transport and mobility, in particular those arising in urban areas, an integrated transport policy for the entire transport and logistics value chain is needed. Coordination of the work of policy-makers in the European institutions should be enhanced and there should also be permanent dialogue and consultation with representatives of the logistics industry, transport service providers and customers in a European logistics and mobility forum. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On this point, I should mention that the IMF and European Commission have granted loans to Romania on the condition that it gets rid of more than 1 500 kilometres of railway lines.

It is of crucial importance for the internal market and the living standards of citizens, enabling them to travel freely, and it aids economic growth and job creation. However, it must be sustainable in the light of the new challenges facing society. Since it is global in nature, the effectiveness of individual actions requires strong international cooperation. The future prosperity of the European continent will depend on the ability of all of its regions to maintain full and competitive integration in the global economy. Efficient transport plays a very important role in meeting this objective. There are still obstacles to the smooth functioning of effective competition in the internal market. A goal of the coming decades should therefore be to create a genuine Single European Transport Area by removing all remaining barriers between the individual modes of transport and national systems.

Intermodality is also important to increasing the sector’s efficiency, as the various forms of transport should complement each other. Another key aspect is the importance of coordination among the individual policies and the various stakeholders, as macro-regional strategies can also have a not insignificant role to play in this. Climate change, switching transport to alternative and renewable energy sources, safety and providing an infrastructure that is accessible to people with disabilities are just some of the challenges facing the sector for which comprehensive solutions should be proposed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with the rapporteur’s view that the Member States underestimate the European added value of transport policy and obstruct it by implementing directives and projects incorrectly or late. In times of economic and financial crisis, investment in TEN-T projects is not sufficiently promoted. The transport networks of the new and old Member States should be effectively linked up, and disparities between the levels of infrastructure development in the EU Member States should be eliminated in order to establish a Single European Transport Area.

Such demands in the current uncertain period may deal a fatal blow to the European economy and its global competitiveness. The transport sector makes a significant contribution to competitiveness and growth in Europe, and we should therefore support and not hinder it. I therefore consider it important to complete the European internal transport market by opening further transport networks and markets. I therefore support the proposal to stabilise the funding of construction of a Trans-European Transport Network, and I particularly applaud the proposal to include EuroVelo, the European long-distance network of cycle paths, in the Trans-European Transport Network. I generally consider this a good report, but I am concerned about the Trojan Horse that was unfortunately smuggled into it in the form of unrealistic environmental targets for reducing CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions in transport, implementation of which would harm European competitiveness. As I do not consider it a good thing for the many good steps proposed in the report not to be implemented on account of the Trojan Horse, I have given the report only conditional support.

In order to address these problems, towns should establish sustainable mobility plans, and financial support for projects should be made dependent upon the submission of such plans. Under the principle of subsidiarity, towns will, of course, decide themselves what urban projects to plan, but these projects will have to comply with the standards of European transport policy, meaning that they will have to provide for efficient multi-modal passenger and goods logistics chains which reduce not only traffic in towns but also environmental impact. For this reason, mobility plans will also have to provide for increased infrastructure for pedestrians and cyclists and lead to the doubling of the number of public transport users.

This is why I welcome Mathieu Grosch’s report, entitled ‘Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area', which supports the interoperability targets for Europe’s transport systems and the reduction of their environmental impact. On the basis of the proposals set out in the Commission’s White Paper published in March, it adopts perfectly valid, indispensable ideas for improving Europe’s transport systems, such as the principle of co-modality, increased development of rail, river and maritime transport and the promotion of environmentally-friendly urban transport. This must, of course, be carried out whilst respecting the workers, service quality, safety standards and the environment, and whilst maintaining prices that are affordable for all and development must be technologically neutral.

Transport is very important for EU citizens because it defines mobility. EU citizens are the beneficiaries of the European transport area, as it helps them to be mobile in all situations in daily life, allowing them to benefit from their right to free movement across Europe for professional and private purposes. On average, 13.2% of the budget of private households is spent on transport goods and services. Furthermore, passenger and goods transport provides jobs for many Europeans and serves the completion of the European internal market, as it accounts for some 5% of EU wealth (in terms of GDP) and employs over 10 million Europeans. Transport is an important factor for towns and regions, as it not only connects towns and regions but also contributes to the EU’s status as a research and innovation centre and is therefore an important factor for the development of the EU and its regions, with immediate influence on the social cohesion of the regions. The creation of a Single European Transport Area as a goal of the future European transport policy is thus directly linked to regional, environmental, economic, social, and employment policy. Owing to this link, the transport sector can make a significant contribution to the EU 2020 strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European transport sector has reached a crossroads. Old problems are still unresolved, and new problems have already arisen. The internal market for transport is not yet completely developed, and solutions must be found to the questions of how to better fulfil residents’ travel desires and satisfy the economy’s freight transport needs while resource and environmental requirements are becoming more stringent. The transport systems of Eastern and Western Europe must be integrated in such a manner that they reflect the transport needs of our entire continent and its 500 million inhabitants. Although transport has become more energy-efficient, in the EU 96% of its energy needs still depend on petroleum and petroleum products. Transport has indeed become more environmentally sustainable, but due to increased volumes it is still the main source of noise and local air pollution. Environmental restrictions are often portrayed in the transport sector as a constraining issue that create expenses, but one must look farther into the future – these restrictions serve as an engine of innovation and improvement, and are also accompanied by a better living environment for our citizens. And of course efficient transport is also a precondition for fuller and more competitive participation in the global economy, upon which Europe’s future prosperity depends. At the same time, member states underestimate the added value of transport policy for Europe, and often inhibit it by implementing directives imprecisely or belatedly. I supported this report, as I sincerely hope that this report will help us move in the desired direction and guarantee the functioning of the transport system that is so essential to us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Progress made towards achieving the submitted aims should be assessed annually, so as to have an understanding of possible failings in advance and to tailor measures to the situation of each Member State. The transport sector is an area that interacts with all European policy. Implementation of the single market and free movement of goods and people will only be fully realised once there is a network of infrastructure and transport services. However, the strategy must take into account the different situations of the Member States and the European regions themselves. As such, investment in modes of transport should take into account the specificities of each region.</p>
<p class="contents">The outermost regions, given their geographical and morphological characteristics, are far removed from the European internal market. Investment in maritime transport and regional airports is key to their full integration. There is also a need to coordinate the instruments of trans-European networks with regional policy funds, to enable the development of the infrastructure central to making the European regions more competitive and to reducing existing differences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The text points the finger at the failure of many Member States of the European Union to comply with European regulations on detention, resulting in prison overcrowding, a high number of suicides and much physical and mental suffering. The resolution also requires the Commission and the Council to recognise certain categories of detainees as being particularly vulnerable, including children and illegal immigrants, and to transform this recognition into rights. The European Union, as the champion of respect for human rights, can only gain if it ensures that its own fundamental rights are respected, even in our prisons.

We must insist that the European Union only give the go-ahead to the agreement if Uzbekistan accepts the International Labour Organisation (ILO) monitoring missions. The agreement in itself would favour the economic interests of our businesses, which would get raw materials on favourable terms.

Whilst in practice the trade in textiles between the Union and Uzbekistan has continued smoothly since 1 January 2005, this issue has become more politically sensitive than the strictly technical nature of the proposal would lead one to believe. In fact many accusations of forced labour have been made, in particular accusations of child labour in Uzbekistan's cotton production sector. I therefore voted for a suspension of the approval procedure so that the International Labour Organisation (ILO) can carry out new investigations into the real situation regarding forced child labour in this country.

The PCA in force between the EU and its Member States, on the one hand, and the Republic of Uzbekistan, on the other, does not include the trade of textile products, which were covered by a bilateral agreement that expired in 2005. A protocol to the PCA intended to include the bilateral trade of textile products is currently in its final stages. When establishing agreements and partnerships, the EU includes binding clauses – Article 2 of the EU-Uzbekistan PCA – on ‘respect for democracy, principles of international law and human rights’. As the EU imports up to 23% of Uzbekistan’s cotton and is the country’s main customer, it is essential that we use all the means at our disposal to help it on its way to democracy and to abandoning inhumane practices such as using child labour. I voted for this resolution for this reason, and I hope that the children of Uzbekistan will soon be able to devote themselves exclusively to study and will no longer be forced to go and work in the cotton fields. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since the EU had a bilateral agreement with Uzbekistan, it decided to include Article 16 in the partnership and cooperation agreement, explicitly excluding textiles from the agreement. For other sectors, the partnership and cooperation agreement provided for mutual most favoured nation status. In economic terms, however, this agreement should not be overestimated. Uzbekistan is the world’s fifth-largest producer of cotton and its third-biggest cotton exporter. In Uzbekistan, the political and economic systems are under state control. Although cotton is produced on private farms, the harvested cotton must be handed over to state-owned firms for a price dictated by the state. Moreover, government employees mobilise children as a cheap source of labour during the cotton harvest and send them out into the cotton fields. Schools are closed during the harvest period. Over the years, many international organisations have expressed concerns regarding the use of forced child labour in Uzbekistan.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is necessary to insist that the Uzbek Government comprehensively implements the formal prohibition of this practice in Uzbek legislation and the international conventions.

This protocol sets out to include textiles in the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, whereby the two parties grant each other most-favoured-nation status, thus putting an end to the legal uncertainty for exporters. On the basis of the principles and goals of the Union’s external actions, the Union, as one of the main trading partners and largest importer of cotton from Uzbekistan, has, I believe, a moral obligation to use its leverage to stop forced child labour in this country.

On behalf of my political group, I put down amendments to this report in order to strengthen it and to avoid any ambiguity. My position is that no consent can be given to the Protocol until after the ILO had been granted access to Uzbekistan and child labour has effectively been eradicated. Another amendment that I tabled concerned the reforms in the agricultural sector which need to be done in the interest of the Uzbek population and the need to introduce high-level labour, social and ecological standards. Unfortunately, this amendment was defeated and a position adopted in favour of privatisation and market orientation which I strongly reject as they will not lead to an improvement in the living conditions of farmers and children in Uzbekistan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At present, the main issue on the table is that of deepening cooperation, particularly with regard to trade in textiles. Uzbekistan is the third-largest exporter of cotton in the world. It is in the harvesting of cotton that we encounter the biggest obstacle. The issue of forced child labour in cotton harvesting is a topic that has still not been resolved. Uzbekistan has made significant progress in combating this problem in recent years, and UNICEF observers have noted and appreciated these changes and reforms, but unfortunately this is still not enough. One of the last measures that Uzbekistan must carry out is to permit monitoring by observers of the International Labour Organisation (ILO). I have personally visited Uzbekistan several times and have seen that the country is willing to cooperate in this area and is interested in ensuring the complete cessation of forced child labour. I therefore call upon our Uzbek partners to allow access to ILO personnel, so that we can finally move forward. I firmly believe that together we will find the path to agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thus, Member States which wish to extend the restrictions on citizens of those countries to entering the labour market must provide specific, detailed and appropriately justified reasons for any such extension. They must also clearly indicate what risks and labour market disruptions have arisen in their country because, if the reports of other Member States and the Commission are anything to go by, Bulgarian and Romanian workers have only a positive impact on the economy and have not caused any harm to the labour market.

The right to live and work in any Member State is one of the fundamental freedoms of the EU, which also recognises the right to freedom from discrimination on the basis of nationality and to equality of treatment.

On the contrary, the Member States with the greatest number of Romanians and Bulgarians have seen increases in gross domestic product. Their economies have grown and there is no evidence that they have been a burden on the social security system or health services. As such, they have contributed to recovery from the crisis. I voted for this resolution, as we are all European citizens with the same rights and obligations.

Yet two Member States face obstacles regarding the right to work in another Member State. The free movement of workers is a positive socioeconomic example for the EU and the Member States, a milestone in the process of EU integration and economic development and a counterweight to the negative effects of economic crisis, and contributes to the creation of a stronger economic power that is prepared to face the challenges associated with global changes. Member States that did not implement transitional arrangements regarding the free movement of workers from Member States that acceded to the EU in 2004 and 2007 do not report any negative consequences. Many Member States have, however, decided to continue to apply restrictions in their labour markets (with regard to Romanian and Bulgarian nationals), which stem more from political pressures than well-founded negative impacts on their economy and labour market. I think it is necessary to repeal the restrictive transitional periods to allow Bulgarian and Romanian citizens to enjoy the right of equal treatment enshrined in the Treaties, thus ensuring fair competition between businesses and avoiding social and economic dumping. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Coordination at EU level is in the interest of every European worker, and, at the same time, it is also the key to the implementation of real workforce mobility. It should be stressed that the expected immigration wave did not take place, the actual data do not even come close to the forecasts. The number of workers appearing on the Western European labour market since May this year, when the restrictions imposed on the citizens of Central and Eastern European countries that acceded to the European Union in 2004 were completely lifted, was significantly lower than expected.

That is why I voted against it. I am, of course, in favour of the free movement of workers within the EU area, but the unprecedented crisis that we are currently experiencing and the significantly high unemployment levels, affecting young people in particular, force us to target all of our efforts at national level to get our citizens back on the path to employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following this logic, the states which are imposing restrictions will attempt to extend them, thereby turning them into electoral instruments. The European Union should take bolder action, especially in the current economic situation. We are in economic deadlock because the European perception of many Member States is in a state of deadlock, and many European governments have abandoned their pro-European statements under the pressure of elections.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that we have been having such a lively debate on this subject in the European Parliament. I hope that the upshot of the two resolutions adopted this year will be the lifting of the labour market restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians. I would like to end by mentioning that the decline in economic activity does not exclude the need for growth. Romanian workers are excluded by austerity, but are in demand where any serious growth plan is involved. For example, a Romanian bricklayer can lay around 5 000 bricks a day in London. British construction companies have noticed the difference and prefer Romanians as it is more difficult to find British bricklayers, and they do not have the same output. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every day, I support the free movement of workers in accordance with the EU Treaties as a member of the European Parliament’s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. However, the unprecedented crisis that we are currently experiencing and the significantly high unemployment levels, affecting young people in particular, force us to target all of our efforts at national level to get our citizens back on the path to employment. As permanent rapporteur on the European Social Fund (ESF) in the 27 Member States, I am firmly committed to supporting European citizens’ integration into the labour market to help them achieve social integration.

After joining the European Union in 2004, the Eastern European governments were disgruntled to find their citizens denied the fundamental right of free movement for workers by some of the older Member States by means of exception clauses in the accession treaties. Now our eastern neighbours are doing all they can to encourage well-trained workers to stay at home. It no longer makes sense to continue to exclude even workers with lower qualifications, particularly in Germany, where unemployment is still in decline. The figures show that people from the ‘new’ Member States only account for about 0.7% of the workforce of the ‘older’ Member States. In contrast, people from non-EU states make up around 5% of the EU population of working age – a much higher proportion. Naturally, the situation varies from Member State to Member State. In Germany, the figures are 1% from the ‘new’ Member States and 7% from non-EU states. Experience elsewhere shows that the economy will benefit from free movement for workers.</p>
<p class="contents">According to new calculations, economic growth in Ireland in recent years would have been about 0.4% lower without such movement. I intend to vote in favour of the resolution because I am convinced that the European Union and Germany would benefit from free movement for workers.

There has been a great deal of activity: the Member States are directly involved in implementing the EU strategy and the European banks (European Investment Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development) now cover the region. However, I should like to draw attention to the fact that since 2007 major changes have taken place in the world: against the background of the global economic and social crisis, a series of Arab revolutions has taken place, and the international coalition is beginning to withdraw from Afghanistan without any clear idea of what the outcome of the war will be after ten years of military engagement.

Now is a good time to summarise what has been achieved by the EU’s strategy for this region, since it has been in operation for four years. It is particularly encouraging to see the regularity of meetings and the strengthening of relationships between high-level representatives, particularly in the face of major events such as the global crisis. At the same time, there are only three EU representations in these countries, which is concerning, and I am therefore pinning great hopes on the proposal to create a regional interparliamentary forum. Another important consideration is the need to increase the EU funds available to implement programmes in this region. This also entails the development of an appropriate strategy for their absorption.

The European Parliament considers that the revision of the Strategy for Central Asia needs to take into account the need to back its objectives with sufficient financial resources and to establish appropriate distribution patterns that reflect the realities of every country in the region. Given the financial constraints, the focus should be on those medium- and long-term programmes that may have the biggest impact on the development of the region, notably youth and education, technical assistance to support economic development and the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as ensuring water security and combating drug trafficking.

Despite problems such as the high level of poverty and drug production, which is often linked to human rights violations, it is a region rich in natural resources and could diversify supply routes, so playing a key role in increasing trade. The EU should therefore review its strategy for the countries of Central Asia, taking into account the conclusions drawn by the report, particularly through supporting projects and initiatives promoting the defence of universal values and human rights. The experience the EU has in terms of inter-regional cooperation gives it the facilitative role of mediator between the five countries in question, and could help stimulate economic development and combat unemployment.

When the strategy was implemented four years ago, the EU launched important initiatives and programmes to support priorities such as good governance, the rule of law, human rights and democratisation, education and training, economic development, trade and investment, transport and energy, environmental sustainability and water management, and the fight against common threats and challenges. Since 2007, however, substantial changes have taken place in the world. Central Asia has seen important, and unfortunately tragic, events, and new political influences have emerged in the region. All of this has prompted the European institutions to look again at their policy towards Central Asia, to take stock of what has been accomplished and to suggest new approaches tailored to the needs of a region that is facing many threats that could have repercussions for Europe. In this respect, the EU should use the appropriate means to reassess its approach to Central Asia as it did in the case of its immediate neighbourhood. It cannot promote ethical considerations in one part of the world while failing to react to violations of its values in another. This would jeopardise its credibility. In all European activities and initiatives, however, human rights and the rule of law in particular must be supported under all circumstances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thus in 2007 the EU introduced a strategy towards the five Central Asian countries, aiming to strengthen and improve the structure and relations between the two regions. This strategy included high-level periodic meetings, cooperation with civil society, resources management and more. Due to changing regional dynamics in Central Asia, caused by inter-ethnic riots, new geostrategic configurations as well as the NATO operation in Afghanistan, the EU has asked to review its 2007 strategy and evaluate its success. The results of this review indicated shortcomings in the 2007 strategy, as standards of good governance and respect to human rights have only slightly improved. In the current state of affairs I welcome the EU’s review and desire to reshape its approach towards Central Asia. Yet I remain hopeful the new strategy will prioritise democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law above any economic, energy or security interests. This is vital for yielding positive results and for maintaining the EU’s credibility. The new strategy for Central Asia genuinely demonstrates EU’s dedication to the region, for enforced and better cooperation can lead to significant social, economic and political achievements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the conclusions of the report by Ms Kiil-Nielsen appear to suggest that Europe is not moving in the right direction. Progress has certainly been made, but not enough for those who wish to establish a long-lasting partnership: we provide limited economic support to these countries; corruption is rife in their political regimes; and there is insufficient respect for fundamental rights, with systematic cases of torture, repression of political opposition and child labour.</p>

The rapporteur reminds us that since 2007 the EU has strengthened its relations with the countries of Central Asia, which are of strategic importance to Europe, and has introduced regular bilateral dialogues on human rights and national water policies.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the EU has not succeeded in incorporating its various objectives into programmes that are effective and suited to the realities of the region and the — often tragic — events in Central Asia which could have repercussions for Europe. The rapporteur takes the view that the EU must take steps to strengthen its engagement in Central Asia, avoiding an operational mode that gives the highest priority to maintaining the stability of existing regimes in the name of a variety of considerations such as the remote possibility of a diversification of our gas supply or the establishment of military bases to supply the European forces in Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">In its new approach the EU must act as a mediator in order to ensure that fundamental human rights are respected by Central Asian governments and that there is real regional cooperation between the countries of Central Asia. Equally important in monitoring these objectives will be the establishment of an <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> EU-Central Asia parliamentary forum. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From now on, human rights must form the cornerstone of all our external actions. In order to promote regional cooperation and dialogue between these countries, we recommend that an ad hoc interparliamentary forum be set up.

Geopolitically, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan provide land transport corridors for troop transit to support the ISAF mission in Afghanistan. I strongly agree with the Kiil-Nielsen focus on environmental policy – in Uzbekistan, for example, decades of Soviet environmental mismanagement for purposes of cotton growing have damaged the Aral Sea, and in mountainous Tajikistan, soil erosion through deforestation for agricultural development has led to desertification. A good and sustainable water management policy is indispensible for development in the region.

The way in which work or production activities are organised must not breach this absolute requirement of European policies. It is important that the actions of European institutions are aimed at monitoring occupational risks and diseases, by attempting to integrate the definitions and instruments of the health policy applied by Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the objective of the policies must be, in line with the provisions of the Europe 2020 strategy, to avoid discriminatory treatment or any differentiation between categories of European workers in terms of access to health-care services. Likewise, these policies must also consider the position of more vulnerable professional groups exposed to additional health risks.</p>
<p class="contents">The policies must therefore meet the interests of young or elderly employees, foreign workers or those employed on a temporary contract basis. Another priority is the importance of establishing a single European legislative framework regulating subcontractors’ obligations to their employees in terms of insurance and health-care services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The increasing number of employees on sick leave for physical or psychological reasons highlights a serious problem in Europe’s current world of work. Ensuring health and safety at work is therefore one of the major challenges with regard to employees’ daily lives. Good working conditions are needed to enable there to be trust in the employer-employee relationship. I fully support the values promoted by Ms Delli’s own-initiative report, which was adopted by a very large majority on Thursday 15 December. The recognition and assessment of the possible risks of using and having new technologies – such as nanomaterials – in the workplace is a significant step forward. Above all, the increased awareness of the challenge that stress at work represents is crucial. Stress is a major barrier to productivity in Europe and is characteristic of the genuine sense of unease felt by many workers. In order to combat this phenomenon, awareness and understanding of the issue must be strengthened among employers, workers and their representatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the Community Strategy 2007-2012 makes clear that this is not sufficient, but that the legislation needs to be developed to adapt it to new risks, such as psycho-social risks. In my view the implementation of policies and practices promoting health at work has beneficial results in all areas, economic, social and personal. I believe that labour inspectorates verify that OSH legislation is properly applied and therefore they have a crucial role in preventing and monitoring risks. In my view inspectors also play a positive role in improving the provision of information and the level of expertise in an enterprise. The Member States should therefore strengthen the staff and resources of their labour inspection services. In this context, it is important to identify the categories of workers at risk so as to determine the appropriate responses so they enjoy effective respect for their fundamental right to health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition, greater attention should be paid to risk prevention, which is necessary in order to reduce the number of occupational accidents and illnesses. Good management of workers’ health and safety systems has a positive impact at both national and European levels and for specific companies. Thus, the branches of occupational health and safety policies must be harmonised at European and national levels and be comprehensively reflected in other public policies, such as health, employment, industry, the environment, transport, education, energy, regional development, public procurement and the internal market. Gender-mainstreaming should also be implemented in all policy areas in order to better reflect the specific risks faced by female workers.

However, this fact is far from adequate to guarantee occupational health and safety as reality is forcing us to take increasingly into account psycho-social risks. These risks are not covered well enough by EU or national legislation. At European level, companies address these risks by providing occupational training programmes. However, workers suffer most often due to the organisation of work and an unsuitable management style.</p>
<p class="contents">This makes it necessary to examine the connection between the drawbacks of the workplace and the organisation of work. I must mention the positive role played by staff who legitimately warn about unrecognised risks within a company. Whistle-blowing should be protected, as it is in some countries in Europe and elsewhere in the world. In the United Kingdom whistle-blowers have been protected against dismissal and any form of pressure since 1998.

Furthermore, I underline the need for an integrated approach to monitoring, taking into account both the career paths of current employees and the state of health of those who have retired.

Thousands of people die, at huge cost to people, businesses and social security. We have to guard against occupational diseases, both physical and mental. The text under consideration concerns the mid-term review of the European strategy 2007-2014 on health and safety at work. According to this report, 168 000 EU citizens every year die victims of accidents at work or of occupational diseases and 7 million are injured. It is a subject that requires a new approach, so as to reduce the risk of occupational accidents and diseases, which would bring considerable savings, and would improve productivity and quality of life. The potential risks of new diseases due to new technologies and new substances, like nanomaterials, should be taken into account in the legislation in force, as should work-related stress. Furthermore, it is crucial that workers feel at liberty to blow the whistle on any situations liable to cause an accident and do not feel constrained to keep quiet. That is why I voted in favour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It also seeks to put a greater focus on stress and on psychosocial risk factors. It stresses statistics broken down according to gender and risk assessment reflecting gender differences. It aims to improve worker participation in the conception, support and implementation of prevention policy and calls for stronger links with the Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals, advocating a ban on asbestos, and reemphasises the International Labour Organisation recommendation about risk prevention inspectors and work inspectors. </p>

Thanks to the adoption and application, in recent decades, of a large body of EU laws, it has been possible to improve working conditions in the EU Member States and to make considerable progress in reducing the incidence of work-related accidents and illnesses. For both economic and human reasons, health and safety at work deserves considerable attention in the EU’s policy agenda, since it plays an important role in increasing the competitiveness and productivity of enterprises and contributing to the sustainability of social security systems. It results in reduced costs for injuries, accidents and diseases and enhances worker motivation. Occupational accidents and diseases represent an enormous burden for public and private social security systems and require an integrated, coordinated and strategic response, as well as cooperation between the main parties involved in the EU. I think that it will be desirable to focus in future health and safety legislation on the promotion and use of technologies that reduce the risks posed by dangerous substances, in the case of occupational injuries. It would also be advisable to consider whether these technologies could replace the use of chemical and radioactive substances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the important aims of the strategy should be the reduction of the proportion of accidents and illnesses occurring at the workplace. I find the protection of workers in high-risk categories to be especially important. These include people working in hazardous sectors, such as construction industry and chemical industry workers, people with disabilities, young workers and women. Nowadays, the psychological pressure caused by work-related stress and deadlines is a negative factor of exceedingly great significance. This is primarily caused by poor work organisation and management style. I completely agree with the view that we must be careful not to allow the austerity measures caused by the economic crisis to be implemented at the expense of safety at work under any circumstances. It is important to use uniform standards in all EU Member States.

Investigations into links between health problems in the workplace and labour organisation will change nothing in this regard. Many psychosocial risks are also linked to the increasing stress of a globalised working environment and developments in modern society. As the rapporteur rightly points out, not all problems can be resolved through legal provisions. There is reason to suspect that Brussels has not grasped this fact, however. After all, the protection of workers has been used as the pretext for an attempt to regulate the consumption of cigarettes in restaurants, instead of openly admitting the underlying concern for the health of non-smokers and seeking solutions acceptable to our citizens and workable in everyday situations. I took these considerations into account when deciding how to vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Awareness of this issue needs to be raised with employees, employers and trade unions in order to help increase productivity in the workplace and ensure the wellbeing of workers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This needs to be adapted to encompass new risks, however, such as psychosocial illnesses. Furthermore, high-risk groups, such as construction workers or those in dangerous jobs, must be afforded particular protection. This is why there is a need for more information for employees in relation to preventive measures, as well as regular training for employees in hazardous professions. Better protection for workers will also have positive consequences for work productivity and the competitiveness of businesses, as well as reducing costs for social security systems. I have voted in favour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
