I was certainly rather surprised to hear Mr Bangemann say that he would not be unduly upset if he were unable to complete his term of office. That would not be a matter of indifference to me if I were a Commissioner bearing responsibility for Europe. And perhaps I would work inside the Commission to ensure that the cases criticised by Parliament did not give any further cause for criticism.</p>
<p class="contents">But let us move on to the bananas. Our debate on my report at second reading deals with bananas at a time when this subject is in the international spotlight once again because of the possible escalation of the dispute between the EU and the United States, as well as some Latin American countries, and because of the threat of a trade war. The report, which was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Development and Cooperation, deals with one aspect of the banana problem; although it is undoubtedly relevant to the WTO issue, it only deals with the payments to banana producers in ACP countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1997, the United States and several Latin American countries applied for a WTO panel investigation. The WTO panel found that the EU market organisation of that time did not conform to WTO rules. The Commission then submitted a proposed amendment package, which was accepted in 1998. As part of the package of proposals, the Commission suggested that additional payments be made from the EU budget to the ACP banana producers. There is still some controversy, even within the WTO, as to whether the adjustments made to the actual organisation of the EU markets meet WTO requirements. I believe I speak for everyone here when I emphasise that it is not for the USA to take this decision, but rather the competent WTO authorities. It needs to be emphasised time and again that the USA has no right to take unilateral action in this matter. Speaking personally and on behalf of no one, however, I must also say that the European Union will surely have to prepare itself to accept the WTO ruling, and that further adjustments may have to be accepted at some future date.</p>
<p class="contents">The report, however, is only concerned with the package of compensatory payments proposed by the Commission, even though they are not part of a legal framework. It asks the question how these compensatory payments are to be made, in what form and to which producers. Here too, there are various positions within the European Union. There are differences between the Council and Parliament. The Council has rejected some important amendments which Parliament tabled at first reading. Some of these decisions are beyond my comprehension as the rapporteur, and I am sure the whole committee finds them equally baffling.</p>
<p class="contents">One of Parliament's main priorities was to support ‘fair trade' producers. This has always been a parliamentary priority and should also play a very prominent part in the allocation of funds to producers, rather than the minor role suggested by the Council in the common position. We believe that payment should depend on compliance with minimum standards in terms of working conditions, and we believe that grower and producer organisations, the farmers' organisations, should be involved in the allocation of the funds. The committee also decided by a majority vote to increase the funding of the programme and to diversify the funding targets in some respects, as set out in Amendments Nos 19, 9 and 15. As the rapporteur, I voiced my opposition to this, but I had to bow to the majority of the House.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the key amendments, in my view, is our exclusion of multinational corporations from eligibility for support under this financial instrument. It surely cannot be right, when everyone believes that Europe's purpose in this market organisation, in everything we do in the banana business, is to protect the small and independent growers against the large multinationals, if we table an amendment to precisely that effect, specifying that support payments are to be made to small and independent growers and not to multinational concerns, and if this amendment is then rejected. That, however, is exactly what the Commission and the Council have done, even though Parliament adopted the amendment by a large majority at the first reading. The committee has tabled it again, and I would ask the Commission to reconsider its position very carefully, because the European Union will forfeit all its credibility if we operate on the basis that it is all right to support the multinationals as long as they are working in the ACP countries, but if they are working in Latin America they are evil, and we must erect a wall of bureaucracy to keep them out of the European market. That, in my opinion, is hypocrisy. It divests our entire policy of any credibility. I believe the European Commission should express itself quite clearly on this. Otherwise, I shall be more convinced than ever that our policy on the banana issue is rather too deeply steeped in hypocrisy. There is a principle involved here, and we must apply it consistently.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Carlotti </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, on behalf of the Socialist Group I must endorse Mr Liese"s report on the establishment of a special framework of technical and financial assistance to help traditional ACP suppliers of bananas to adapt to the new market conditions. I support this report because it takes account of the interests of the most disadvantaged suppliers. Small independent producers must be given special assistance and the multinational firms which possess banana plantations in several countries should not be eligible for assistance. I also support this report because it stresses the importance of respecting social standards, working conditions and the environment and because it stipulates special support measures for fair trade bananas.</p>
<p class="contents">We socialists hope that assistance will be granted to improve quality and we believe that it is essential to help diversify production because, for many ACP countries, the banana is the only source of income. Thus the contributions made by MEPs, added to the proposals accepted by the Council at first reading, such as taking into account the particularly dramatic situation of Somalia, will, I believe, all help to produce a very satisfactory regulation, provided that we are able to allocate a budget to the tune of approximately ECU 500 million for more than ten years, depending on how the ACP countries and the market develop.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what concerns us, as you suspected Commissioner, is the new line taken by the United States of America at the WTO, with threats of sanctions against numerous European products and delaying tactics and stratagems which do not befit a great country. In a few days, the WTO will rule on the import regime for bananas and therefore on the possible sanctions that might be taken by countries which consider themselves to be prejudiced by this regime. I fear that the World Trade Organisation"s decision may once again serve American interests. I hope that these decisions will not be imposed on the European Union without us having a chance to respond or at least show our political will to defend our own producers and the producers of the poor countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific at any cost. I believe that we have more than trade agreements with these countries: we have moral commitments.</p>

<p class="contents">Now as then, Parliament, by a substantial majority, supports the Commission"s proposal in principle. Some amendments have been put forward, and we would like to see them incorporated at the second reading. In the interim, however, a critical event has taken place in the progress of what has become known as ‘the banana war", and as a result, the debate has become political rather than technical. What happened was that the United States showed its true colours and is now openly threatening the Union with trade reprisals against a list of European products if we do not modify our policy on protecting the banana production of ACP countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Weakened by certain developments at home and abroad, the United States administration has been unable to withstand the enormous pressure exerted by a number of American banana multinationals, and is preparing to take the law into its own hands. The most extraordinary scenes were played out only yesterday at Parliament"s REX Committee meeting. In this very House, the ambassador of the United States gave a splendid example of how that would‐be empire understands WTO regulations, demanding they are complied with when it suits it but disregarding them whenever it sees fit.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate Commissioner Brittan on his forthright defence of the legitimacy and legality of our regulations at yesterday"s REX Committee meeting. Given the uncertainty of the current situation, I would ask the Commission, at the second reading, to accept Parliament"s suggestions as they appear in Mr Liese"s report.</p>

The stress on diversification, Somalia"s special position, and not least, socially sustainable production and fair and supportive trading conditions, are definitely some of the report"s strong points.</p>
<p class="contents">These very points indicate the philosophy of the European Union, which gives us the right idea of the free market. It is wrong to think of the free market as a market without rules and where everyone competes regardless of relative strength. Obviously that kind of free market would see abuse of power by the strongest economic operators or countries to the detriment of the others. That is exactly what the European Union must do everything possible to prevent, by all necessary, useful and appropriate means.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely because we support this view of the free market that my group opposes Amendment No 9 to Article 1(2) of this report, tabled by the ARE Group. The original text talks about a special framework for banana producers, to be implemented for a maximum period not exceeding ten years starting on 1 January 1999. We believe that text should be maintained. We must take action to put the ACP banana‐producing countries in a position to stand on their own feet and not keep them in a state of permanent immaturity, which in our view would be the result of accepting the ARE amendment.</p>

Though it may be too early to establish whether ACP banana suppliers have been adversely affected by the changes made, appropriate preventive measures should be taken, based on the values which underpin the principle of fair trade. These values should be extended and applied to the promotion of alternative economic activities for those producers least able to adapt to the new market conditions, and should include technical and financial support for ACP suppliers who are in a position to adapt, enabling them to do so under the best possible conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim is not only for the special aid regime to reflect the Union"s desire to meet its obligations to its traditional suppliers, but also for it to contribute to the fight against poverty. At the same time, it should send a clear and unambiguous message that the Union will not bow to unacceptable pressures, such as those currently exerted by the United States with its list of reprisals.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge the Commission to take into account the amendments contained in the Liese report, particularly those inspired by the principle of fair trade, which only received cursory attention in the common position. This is most disappointing. It is also unfortunate that the large multinationals may be able to receive aid from Union funds in ACP countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It simply would not make sense to help the rich instead of the poor.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Martinez </span> <span class="bold">(NI).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, we have two symbolic issues before us this evening. On the subject of laying hens, we will shortly be discussing the Kindermann report on the revolting practice of battery rearing which is symbolic of hyperproductivity. With Mr Liese"s report on bananas, this is symbolic of globalism.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue has been around for many years in this House. Europe produces around 800 000 to 830 000 tonnes of bananas from Guadeloupe, Crete, Martinique, the Canaries and Madeira. We buy around 830 000 tonnes of bananas from the ACP countries, including the Côte d"Ivoire and Cameroon. And then there are the dollar bananas from Central America which the Germans particularly like. Initially there were two million tonnes of these, and they were subject to customs duties, as were cereal substitutes. Then, under the pretext that Sweden, Austria and Finland were joining the European Union, thereby prejudicing the United States, we agreed to import 2.5 million tonnes of Latin American bananas without customs duties or with reduced customs duties.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet all this is not enough for the United States. They referred the matter to the World Trade Organisation, we went through various panels of first instance and appeal, we amended our legislation and the issue was referred again to the WTO; this evening, now that we have given in, we are even going to have to compensate the poor ACP countries that are going to lose out.</p>
<p class="contents">This smacks of hypocrisy, given all our talk of defending the financial interests of the European Union. Mrs Cresson and Mr Marín may have redirected a few pence here or there, like any good socialist, but in this case, 14 billion francs have been given as gifts to a multinational firm, Chiquita. Who are we to talk about the financial interests of the European Community?</p>
<p class="contents">We are calling into question our regional policy in Crete, Madeira, the Canaries, Guadeloupe and Martinique. We are calling into question our cooperation policy with the ACP countries because the import licences are being called into question. We are calling into question our human rights policy because, in Honduras, it is the multinational firm United Brand, now owned by Chiquita, which keeps order. We are calling into question our social policy because the people producing these bananas are slaves earning only EUR 35 per month. We are calling into question the superiority of European law because we are submitting to the law of Geneva and the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">And once again, faced with the United States" Section 301, our Europe of 370 million inhabitants, of the euro, a Europe with new power, is submitting in Kosovo, in Iraq and now on the issue of bananas. We are toeing the US line. I hope that we can slip on this banana skin in order to get back on track, but I doubt it.</p>

On the whole the common position of the Council improves the original proposal for a regulation, thanks primarily to the European Parliament"s action at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular I would mention that there is now a stronger possibility of using some of the resources provided under the regulation to promote diversification by suppliers unable to continue banana production in decent conditions. On other points Parliament will back its own amendments, above all with a view to ensuring that small and independent producers can use the resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council"s common position accepts Parliament"s amendments designed to take account of the special position of Somalia and its banana producers. This is the only commodity that unfortunate country can export to the European market and its fate largely depends on being able to maintain and strengthen banana production.</p>
<p class="contents">That is positive, but I would still point out that for the last two years, despite clear recommendations from the European Parliament, the Commission has frequently appeared to want to boycott Somali banana exports. The country"s banana regions have been seriously damaged by the natural disaster which has struck in the last two years but, incredibly, the Union has decided not to respond with aid.</p>
<p class="contents">So the Union must immediately undertake to give Somali banana producers direct access to the assistance provided under the regulation we are debating.</p>
<p class="contents">This would be a very tangible way to encourage the rebirth of Somalia and prevent its definitive departure from the Community ‘Banana Club'.</p>

Just how disproportionate the current reaction is with regard to this product can be seen from the fact that the European Union has been pursuing a protectionist agricultural policy with regard to various goods produced in the United States itself for four decades now. As there has never been such a reaction before, we can only conclude that the US administration is more concerned about one or two multinational firms producing bananas in Latin America than about its own farmers. Having said this, its reaction is also disproportionate in view of the production claimed by the European Union, which is relatively small and comes from peripheral regions such as Madeira and the Canaries or from poor ACP countries where there are no alternatives capable of supporting the rural population with a minimum decent standard of living.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not therefore talking about rich regions but areas which understandably deserve some support. This applies to the financial support currently being suggested, the level of which is to be determined shortly, thereby removing any doubt about the seriousness of our proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the retaliation that has been announced of limiting the imports of various products is also disproportionate and inappropriate because it will indiscriminately penalise countries, regions and sectors which have nothing to do with bananas. Looking at the list, we can see that in order to defend one major multinational whose name has already been mentioned several times, European sectors where small and medium‐sized businesses predominate are to be condemned, to a large extent involving the poorest countries and regions. It seems to us to be in even worse taste that attempts are being made to divide the European Union by granting an exemption to Denmark and Holland, because of their alleged good behaviour, when this is a common policy which we accepted jointly once it was decided.</p>
<p class="contents">Disregarding this sad episode – which we hope will rapidly enter into obscurity – we must now look at the basic question of whether this will be the pattern for the future, with the two major world powers with very particular responsibilities in international trade being at loggerheads?</p>

I would stress, with satisfaction this time, that the Council regulation finally takes sufficient account of this problem, which was something I highlighted in vain as rapporteur for the banana COM, when we debated the general problem as well as certain particular issues in this House. Somalia is emerging from a couple of seasons which have been disastrous to say the least, in terms of environmental calamities piled on top of those of the past. Between October 1997 and January 1998, 70 % of the banana plantations were destroyed by a flood which submerged the plants for four or five months, permanently undermining their ability to survive.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite desperate appeals, the European Commission decided not to intervene in any way, either with European Social Fund money, STABEX resources, or any other kind of resources. From the first, during the debate on the COM, it has refused to recognise the civil war, endemic and uninterrupted for some 30 years now, as <span class="italic">force majeure</span> , a disaster like those which have secured lavish compensation for producers in the Caribbean islands, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Since last June all exports of bananas from Somalia have been suspended. Either there are no supplies or such as do exist are not cheap enough, in short, they are not marketable. Now with this regulation Somali producers can finally lift up their heads. But they should be able to have direct and immediate access to the financial benefits through their independent association, which was set up to counter the old excuse that there were no clear and authoritative recipients for aid in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, now the organisation of Somali producers exists and is recognised at both continental and international level. DG VIII, especially, must take this into account.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Pinheiro, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission</span>. – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like firstly to thank the Committee on Development and Cooperation and in particular Mr Liese for the hard work put into this dossier. Before turning to the amendments, I should like to remind you briefly why this proposal is so important for the Commission. Last year the Council adopted the measures necessary to bring the common market organisation for bananas into conformity with WTO rules. These have now been applied since 1 January and will radically alter the market conditions for traditional ACP banana suppliers. In our opinion this will jeopardise their continuing viability on the EU market, in particular since the special important licence system has been dismantled and there will no longer be a mechanism to bridge the gap in competitiveness between ACP and dollar bananas.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to enable traditional ACP suppliers to maintain their presence on the EU market as agreed under the Lomé Convention, the Commission has in parallel put forward this proposal establishing a special framework for technical and financial assistance. This support is intended to help them to adapt to the new market conditions and in particular to enhance the competitiveness of their production. I think we are agreed on the need for this regulation and for the need to get it in place as soon as possible so that the traditional ACP suppliers can continue their efforts to improve their competitiveness. This action is required whatever the outcome of the ongoing discussions in Geneva.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the matter in hand, I should like to emphasise how much we see eye‐to‐eye on this proposal. We have taken on board four specific amendments but our agreement goes much further than that. Let us take diversification. We agreed that funding should be available for diversification projects where improvements in competitivity would not be feasible or sustainable. We all know that there are parts of the banana industry in the traditional ACP countries where production will probably not survive in a more competitive EU market. These farmers should be given assistance to diversify into other crops. There is now new wording introduced in the common position to provide for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Another area is social and environmentally‐friendly banana production, so‐called fair‐trade bananas. This is an important facet of an ACP country strategy to improve its competitiveness. This is why specific wording was added to the common position but I must stress that this is not a regulation about fair trade. There are many other methods by which an ACP country can improve its banana sector in a sustainable way. These include improving transport links and distribution, designing new marketing strategies and providing training and technical assistance to farmers. It should also be recalled that the list of programme criteria is not a prescriptive nor an exhaustive one. The wording has been kept simple to allow for the necessary flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Another area where we agree is the need for open and transparent consultations. This is part of good working practice to ensure that producer groups and banana growers associations are involved in the process of designing strategies for the banana sector. We are already encouraging these discussions. They are also an integral part of the ACP‐EU partnership. Specific wording does not need to be added to the regulation on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">There are one or two areas where we have somewhat divergent views. This is where we have not been able to accept your proposed amendments. Our arguments are the same as they were for the first reading in June. One of these points is the provision of the direct aid to farmers, a form of income support. This concept does not reflect our overall objective of improving the level of competitiveness of traditional ACP banana production. Providing income support will postpone the day when non‐competitive producers must leave the market. It is a short‐term measure. It will not produce a sustainable industry. Investments must be made to the infrastructure of the banana sector to unblock the bottlenecks, to produce an efficient industry for the countries as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">To give you an example, one of the important producers, where the banana is very important to the economy, is St Lucia. For those who do not know it, St Lucia is a very hilly country in which it will take you more than an hour to drive a distance of 20 km. There the key to improvement of banana production, competitiveness and productivity will be to be able to water the crop on a drop‐by‐drop basis. As some of the farms are relatively small, to do this they would have to get together. So we started very early to try to form a strong farmers' association so that they could share this kind of watering system. But this also requires the support of the government so some infrastructure related to this major work will also be taken up by government. Therefore, the provision of such aid runs the risk of a challenge from our trading partners for being incompatible with international trade rules.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe that regulations should not include specific budget figures in order not to prejudge the annual budgetary discussions as agreed in the Joint Declaration of 1982. The annual figure of EUR 45m is the correct one and additional money should not be set aside for urgent measures. This will create expectations. We would need to discuss what constitutes an urgent measure and in my opinion it will delay the implementation of this project.</p>
<p class="contents">All projects should be integrated as part of a country strategy within the global envelope envisaged. Nor should the door be left open to extend assistance beyond the ten years proposed. This is not because I am absolutely convinced that ten years will be sufficient but because at this juncture we must have some radical changes as soon as possible in order to gain that competitiveness. To give the idea of an extension at this stage would be to send a wrong message.</p>
<p class="contents">One final issue is the position on multinationals. In this regard, the only one concerned, if I am correctly informed, is Fyffes in Surinam, Belize and the Windward Islands. The reason we have some resistance is very simple. It is not because we want to finance rich multinationals. It is because quite often it is important not only to have joint financing for some projects but also because, on the specific allocation of funds, one should look at the specific situation of the one who puts the demand and on the merits of the project. This would give us greater flexibility and would in the end be more effective regarding the country. If you ask me if I expect multinationals to have a large share, the answer is No. But we should allow this joint effort to be made if the multinational – in this case, Fyffes – wants to contribute. I do not see why they should not co‐finance such efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say a word or two on Somalia. This country, as you know, has been without a government as such for a long time. Therefore, it was impossible for it to ratify the revised Lomé IV convention, the one which was revised in Mauritius. So, in principle and in theory Somalia was not entitled to any aid from the European Union. The Commission proposed that, bearing in mind the conditions prevailing in Somalia, and the fact that in some parts of the country the situation was more peaceful and the people were willing to make efforts for the development to continue our assistance, including in the case of bananas. And so we did.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the current difficulty in Somalia? It is not the definition of a quota or providing funds for assistance. It is to identify who should be the one that should a grant a certificate for exporting bananas from Somalia. There are some indications conveyed to us that one of the factions that is at war in Somalia is willing to have the possibility of certification. This would be equivalent to financing the war effort of that specific faction. That we cannot do. That is the reason why discussions are continuing. We want the association of producers to be the ones issuing the certificate rather than any political faction in Somalia. I am confident that with the support of our Member States and in particular the efforts that Italy is deploying, we will be able to overcome these difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally on the WTO panel, I am absolutely in agreement with those who say that it is not a technical problem any more. It is a clear situation in which the economies of different small countries – and if you visit them you would understand why they depend so much on this product as there are not many options – are being absolutely ignored in comparison with the interests of two multinationals. On top of that, the fact that the United States is apparently not prepared to accept the rules of the WTO means that we will have to rethink this concept of globalised liberalisation. My feeling is that if we leave this we turn a blind eye to the interests of the small and the poor and I do not think that Europe would be fulfilling its duties. So far the Commission has stood very firm in this dispute. I fully agree that Sir Leon Brittan has done a very good job. But we must be aware that if we do not stand united, be it in Parliament or especially in the Council, we will weaken our position very much. I sincerely hope that will not be the case.</p>
