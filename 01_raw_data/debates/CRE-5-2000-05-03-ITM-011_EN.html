<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Carraro (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, this draft recommendation marks the end of a political and institutional process which began 10 or so years ago under the auspices of the then President of the Commission, Jacques Delors, who, as far back as the early 1990s, predicted the entry of the Swiss Confederation into the then common economic area. </p>
<p class="contents">As you are aware, this project was blocked by the Swiss referendum in December 1992, when, albeit by a very narrow majority, the Swiss citizens decided to block the entry of the Swiss Confederation into the European Community. </p>
<p class="contents">That was the beginning of a period of uncertainty, of widely sectoral agreements, which is being brought to an end by this package of seven agreements, which are closely related to the economy but which are also wide-reaching and of general interest. The seven agreements govern the free movement of persons, air transport, the carriage of goods and passengers by rail and road, scientific and technological cooperation, public procurement, agricultural products and, in relation to these, mutual recognition in the area of conformity assessment. They are also characterised by a specific simultaneous enforcement clause to the effect that the agreements will enter into force only insofar as they are approved or rejected en masse. </p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, although the draft legislative resolutions are separate documents, they have to be tabled and approved en bloc because, and I stress this, they have to be enforced en bloc. </p>
<p class="contents">The agreements were signed as early as June 1999, ratified by the Swiss Parliament on 8 October 1999, and tomorrow they will have reached the stage of ratification by the European Parliament. However, I would also like to point out to the House that the citizens of Switzerland will, once again, be called upon to pronounce judgement on this package of agreements, and, therefore, also on relations with the European Union, in the referendum on 21 May next. Nevertheless, it is as well to remember that this declaration will certainly be different from the 1992 decision in form and substance. In 1992, the people of Switzerland were called upon to pronounce judgement on Switzerland’s accession, whereas on 21 May they will be asked to approve or reject a package of strictly economic agreements which do not have the political implications of the 1992 agreements. </p>
<p class="contents">However, I feel it is highly significant that Parliament is voting on and approving the texts – if that is the decision of the House, as it was the largely unanimous decision of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and as it is the desire of all the parliamentary committees which have expressed their opinion – and giving its assent before the Swiss referendum on 21 May. Not, of course, in order to undermine the sovereignty of the Swiss people’s vote in any way, but, on the contrary, to give a further sign of confidence and conviction that the development of a common European economic area and growing integration of the markets and economies of this Europe – of which Switzerland is, clearly, at the heart owing to its central geographical position – are a concern which we share and which we consider more important than disputes over procedures. </p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, it is politically significant – and, for this, all thanks go to the Chairman of the Committee on Industry and the staff which have made it possible – that Parliament is going to vote before 21 May, for this will present the Swiss citizens with a sure, well-defined legal framework on which to pronounce judgement. The opinion of the Committee on Industry is wholly favourable and I recommend that the House votes unanimously for the motions during tomorrow’s sitting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has produced a very coherent opinion. I also want to thank the Commission for its good work in connection with the negotiations. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to my committee’s area of responsibility, that of citizens’ freedoms and rights, this agreement is welcome. I also want to emphasise that it is important to view the agreement in its entirety. In the course of my work on the opinion, I in fact became aware of quite a number of problems and difficulties for EU citizens who live and work in Switzerland. In certain cases, it has been a matter of discrimination pure and simple. There is no doubt that the agreement we now have provides great opportunities to solve those problems which exist and to prevent new problems from arising. In this connection, I would just mention, for example, the right of entry, the right of establishment, the opportunity to enter the labour market, the coordination of social security systems, the right of establishment for non-gainfully employed people and students, together with new opportunities for cross-border workers. </p>
<p class="contents">I want to emphasise, as the rapporteur for the committee responsible pointed out, that it is important for our opinion to be made available before the referendum in Switzerland – not because it is for the Swiss to say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the opinion, but to show our desire for cooperation, that is to say further cooperation, with Switzerland. Our committee has pointed out possible future areas of cooperation, for example operations to combat trafficking in women and to combat organised crime and economic crime. We view these agreements, especially the agreement concerning the free movement of persons, as being very important in the context of cooperation between the EU and Switzerland. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism as a whole is pleased about this agreement because it was well known how very difficult it was to reach a transport agreement which established a fair balance between competition and the environment and which would also produce a satisfactory solution for both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">The two agreements that directly concerned us, and that we have analysed, concern air transport and road and rail transport. Here we must note, with regard to air transport, that Switzerland is, of course, already a member of numerous international conferences and organisations and has therefore incorporated in its legislation quite a few aspects of what we in the EU regard as the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire.</span> Its adoption of the regulation on the liberalisation packages is the most practically significant measure. The Transport Committee regards it as a small weakness that the duty-free agreement is not applicable to Switzerland in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">The road-rail discussion is a more difficult and also a more interesting one. We think the experiment being proposed here is most interesting. On the one hand, Switzerland will gradually forego reducing the number of heavy goods vehicles. It will allow vehicles of 34 to 40 tonnes up to the year 2004; on the other hand, it will abolish the quotas accordingly. Eventually it will replace this system with a road tax, of approximately EUR 200 on average. So you can understand why the transport operators are rather critical of that.</p>
<p class="contents">And in my view their criticism is fair because we believe these road taxes do not take sufficient account of the fact that the transport operator may invest in environment-friendly lorries. But what the Transport Committee considered even more important was that this agreement points the way to a transport policy entirely in line with that of the EU: reducing the burden on the roads while supporting transport by rail. We believe the proposed agreement between the EU and Switzerland is a pilot agreement; the same applies to the analysis of the means by which what we regard as a theoretical transport policy may subsequently be put into practice.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a step in the right direction. After all, Switzerland is located at the heart of Europe but is not yet a member of the Union. The conclusion of the bilateral negotiations with Switzerland will put the Union’s relations with Switzerland on a new footing, and we all hope that, in a few weeks’ time, the Swiss people will give their assent to these agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">But there are a few aspects that still need clarification. I am not referring to what I usually refer to in this connection, namely closer cooperation to combat tax evasion at the cost of the European taxpayers. Tonight I will confine myself solely to the question of freedom of movement and will specifically address the subject of cross-border workers. In all, there are 140 000 cross-border workers in Switzerland who come from Germany, France, Italy and Austria. These cross-border workers are very seriously affected by the most recent deteriorations in Swiss pension schemes. Prior to the tenth review of old-age and surviving dependants’ insurance there was a so-called spouse’s pension, which was paid without regard to the place of residence of either spouse.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the tenth review, which recently came into force, this rule was removed. It was replaced by educational credits, which were, however, tied to residence in Switzerland. As a result, cross-border workers from the European Union had to pay the same contributions as Swiss residents, but received a 30% lower pension. The forthcoming eleventh review even provides that only widows resident in Switzerland are entitled to a widow’s pension, which, of course, once again makes the situation worse for cross-border workers from the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, European Union governments have paid too little attention to this issue until now. I hope all this will change in the near future. The current rules on old-age and surviving dependants’ insurance conflict with the principle of equal treatment and equal status. Cross-border workers pay in just as much pension insurance as their Swiss counterparts but receive considerably lower pensions. I hope that this unilateral discrimination by the Swiss Government will be remedied in the wake of this bilateral agreement. I am extremely grateful to the rapporteur for touching on and bringing up this question in his explanatory statement.</p>
<p class="contents">A glance at the map shows that these are probably not the last negotiations and agreements we will see between the Union and Switzerland. That makes it all the more important to abide not just by the letter but also by the spirit of the agreements we are deciding tomorrow. For that can only be to the benefit of future negotiations and future agreements which we will be negotiating and deciding bilaterally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the opinion of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party that the European Parliament for its own part should support their adoption. Switzerland’s position illustrates the curious nature of Europe’s present arrangements for integration, and the need to aim to change them, especially now that the EU is expanding throughout the whole of Europe. The merging Europe has organised itself into a series of concentric rings, at the core of which has been the founder members of the European Union. First there was the Council of Europe at Strasbourg, which divided in two when France, Germany, Italy and the Benelux Countries formed the European Coal and Steel Community. The attempt to form a political and defence community came to nothing, but the European Community was created. The Outer Seven, as opposed to the Six, formed the European Free Trade Association, EFTA.</p>
<p class="contents">The expansion of the Six into a Community of, in the first instance, eight, and then twelve, went relatively smoothly. Since these instances of enlargement, a debate has begun on differentiated integration. At the end of the 1980s, a plan was drafted in the European Commission whereby the then European Community would consolidate as a federation and the other countries of Europe would join the Single Market via the European Economic Area arrangements. The first Agreement on the European Economic Area was offered to the EFTA countries. It was then that concentric circles were being spoken of for the first time. The EEA Agreement was established, although for Austria, Sweden and Finland it turned out to be a short-lived arrangement. EEA membership was rejected in a Swiss referendum. So the only countries remaining in the EEA were Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. Bilateral agreements began to be drawn up for Switzerland.</p>
<p class="contents">Negotiations are now under way regarding the future accession of twelve countries to the European Union. It is strange that neither Switzerland nor any of the EEA countries are among them, although they would be the best suited of all to join. There is a simple reason for this, however. They do not want to join the present Union, nor that of the foreseeable future. Now that the Union is growing fast, it is reasonable that it should be subject to internal differentiation. Just as Jacques Delors, Valery Giscard d'Estaing and Helmut Schmidt, among others, recently proposed, the core countries of Europe should go further along the road towards integration than the others, while the rest of the Union could develop as a confederation of independent states and differentiate. In this way, we could ease and speed up accession for the countries of Eastern Europe and this would also make membership possible for Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and even Switzerland.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope this hole will be filled sometime in the next few years with the accession of Switzerland to the European Union. For then we would not have to negotiate and decide seven different agreements but all this would be a matter of course. I very much hope we will make progress in this regard over the next few years.</p>
<p class="contents">But perhaps these seven agreements are a preparation for that debate and I very much hope that just as Parliament will be approving these seven agreements by a large majority tomorrow – or so I assume – the Swiss people will also approve them by a large majority on 21 May in order to make it clear that Switzerland is part of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say a few words about the agreement on scientific and technological cooperation because I myself have been repeatedly involved in that area of cooperation with Switzerland over the past few years. I warmly welcome that agreement because basically it means that Switzerland will take part in the European Union’s framework research programme on an equal footing. To that end, it will pay a contribution in line with its GDP yet participate fully in the programme. That is a major advantage for both sides. Yet there is one drawback: it is the European Parliament and the Council that decide the content of this programme, not Switzerland. That means that Switzerland, like Israel, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland, which also take part in this framework research programme, can only participate in something that is decided over their heads. They have no say as regards its content.</p>
<p class="contents">So I would propose that we take our time preparing the sixth framework research programme and that we at least hold informal talks with the Swiss parliamentarians – just as we do with Israel, Norway and so on, i.e. states which do not belong to the EU but which do take part in the framework research programme. That is something the European Parliament could organise. Parliament could take the initiative and invite parliamentarians from these countries, so that we can know in advance what input the Swiss can contribute, what problems they may have, what proposals they may have. In fact, this would also be a step towards bringing Switzerland and the European Union closer together. I would very much hope we could do that. Aside from that, let me thank Mr Carraro again for this excellent report. Anyone who wants to learn will find a great deal of information in his report. Once again, many thanks and I hope we will adopt it by a large majority tomorrow.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We want closer cooperation in Europe. We want more dialogue. We want to analyse problems pragmatically, find compromises, although on the basis of democracy and the rule of law, and we want, at the end of the day, to vote in the proper manner. We often see the Swiss people voting on issues and as a democrat I am constantly delighted by the democratic attitude of Switzerland.</p>
<p class="contents">The peaceful settlement of conflict – i.e. democracy – versus the declaration of war. In fact, war never has been a solution for the people of Europe. We need ground rules for democracy, and in the end we must also abide by them. After over 50 years of a policy of peace, the German Foreign Minister acting as President of the Council has called on the military to take a decision. That should set us thinking. I believe it is important that we use democratic methods to safeguard peace. Now he, as President of the Council, and the 12 prime ministers have taken an arbitrary decision without any legal basis against a Member State. It has no legal basis and in particular it goes against the European institutions. The decision with regard to Austria was taken without any <span class="italic">de facto</span> participation by the Commission, without the participation of the Council and, of course, without the participation of Parliament. In my view, that raises a number of problems, especially for Switzerland. And I regard the signs of weakness the euro is currently showing as a judgement by the international community of this conflict within the European Union. The crux of the matter is that this is a conflict between the prime ministers and the European institutions, a conflict that is putting a spanner in the European works and creating insecurity.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, Austria was always seen as the blue-eyed boy in matters of human rights and democracy. I think Austria has fared very well with its neutrality over the past decades, a neutral position between east and west. In joining the European Union we clearly committed ourselves to the west, with the aim of preventing any future military conflicts. But that means talking to each other, meeting each other, analysing things pragmatically, finding compromises. I must say that in Austria, too, it is now time to review the situation for, when it comes to their referendum, the Swiss people will be looking very carefully at how the 14 prime ministers decide.</p>
<p class="contents">In Austria, Mr Haider resigned on 1 May. He no longer plays an active role in Austrian politics. I think it is high time the sanctions against Austria were lifted and I believe the prime ministers should also apologise to the people of Europe for choosing to go down a road that is unacceptable to Europe. I demand the immediate suspension of the sanctions against Austria and I believe this decision with regard to Austria will be of the utmost importance to future plebiscites and referenda in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I totally agree with the remarks of the honourable Member, Mr Linkohr, about the quality of the report. I am also grateful for the authoritative comments made by the honourable Member, Mr Carraro, and by representatives of other relevant committees during this debate and the other contributions we have had as well. One or two honourable Members have been able to bring in subjects about which they care passionately like the honourable Member, Mr Rübig, and I commend them on their inventiveness. But it has been a useful debate which has reflected the importance of the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">We are extremely satisfied that Parliament has given this verbal approval to the seven agreements with Switzerland. They are the result of four years of extremely difficult and tough negotiations. The outcome of those negotiations has been excellent and I am delighted that Parliament has reacted in the way that it has.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreements are very important. They are very important politically and they are very important from a technical point of view as well. They unblock the stalemate in the relations with one of our closest neighbours and our second biggest trading partner. They open the way to closer relations and, I hope, to further integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Through these agreements the biggest problems in our bilateral relations will be resolved in a number of key sectors: technical barriers to trade, public procurement, research and development about which the honourable Member knows so much, agriculture and air transport. Equally important, a viable solution has now been found for alpine transit. The European standard of free movement of persons will also be introduced in relations with Switzerland.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that Parliament has found the result of the negotiations to be in general so positive but we have also taken note of some more critical remarks, especially regarding cooperation in the fight against transit fraud, cigarette smuggling and other fiscal crimes, where you want to see our Swiss friends doing much more. Parliament has repeatedly called for better cooperation and the problem will be further investigated I know by a special delegation of the Budget Control Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to make it absolutely plain that the Commission shares these concerns. Losses of several billion euros are caused to the Community budget every year because Switzerland does not apply the relevant Council of Europe protocols on judicial cooperation. The Commission has repeatedly stated that we see a rapid solution to this problem as the prerequisite for any further agreements in other areas. It is a point that I am looking forward to discussing with the Swiss Foreign Minister when he comes to Brussels a little later in the summer, as well, I hope, as discussing more positive matters with him.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to assure all honourable Members that we have taken account of the detailed concerns that have been expressed in this useful debate and of the other comments that we have received on these negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">As a number of honourable Members have said, the Swiss Parliament has already approved the seven agreements. They did that in October last year. We very much hope that the Swiss people themselves will give their blessing in the referendum scheduled for May 21. It would be constitutionally indelicate I am sure for me to urge them to vote in one way or the other but I do very much hope that these negotiations which have been conducted in good faith and have led to very satisfactory outcomes will be endorsed by the people of Switzerland.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that the assent of the European Parliament will be very helpful in this respect in encouraging people in Switzerland to vote on May 21 in what we all think would be the right way. So I very much hope that the vote which the Parliament holds tomorrow does not surprise any of you and does not surprise the Commission either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
