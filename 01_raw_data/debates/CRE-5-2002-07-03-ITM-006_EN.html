<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Medina Ortega (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, with regard to this report I must say that my only job – to use a bullfighting metaphor that the House may not understand – was to go in for the kill, because for a year – between 1 January 2001 and 1 January 2002 – the rapporteur was Mr Marinho and then he had to leave it, and it was therefore he who did all the preparatory work and it simply fell to me in the final phase to take up the amendments proposed and bring about some kind of compromise. In the end there were some sixty amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Under Mr Marinho there was a hearing with the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and there was a first stage and a second one with amendments. My job was simply to bring all the strands together.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive on the use of immovable property on a timeshare basis was approved in 1994 by means of the co-decision procedure and I was Parliament’s rapporteur on this directive. The directive took three years, in principle, to enter into force, but in many countries it was postponed for one year. By the way, I am pleased to say that recently the Spanish Supreme Court passed the judgement that the Spanish Government should compensate private Community consumers for its delay in applying the Directive. I believe that this is a good legal precedent which increases the validity of Community directives.</p>
<p class="contents">The current Directive is a minimal directive. Certain information obligations were established and also the opportunity for the purchaser to change their mind within a period of ten days, with the sum paid being refunded. But it is clear that, being a minimal directive, it was not going to be able to resolve all the issues raised. In the discussions on this issue in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market over the last two years, it has become clear that for many Community citizens the current system is doing harm and that we should therefore increase the arsenal of instruments at our disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">From the point of view of Community law, perhaps we will be faced with difficulties. And the difficulty lies in the current concern in all the Community institutions with regard to simplifying the regulatory procedure. We have the Council’s Mandelkern report, we have the proposals of the Commission on European governance and on the improvement of Community regulation and finally we have the agreements of the Seville European Council, which insist on the need to make progress in this area with the participation of the European Parliament. Furthermore, the present Directive is peculiar in that it involves the field of private law, contract law, property law, which are traditionally considered to fall within the competence of the Member States. Therefore, the road before us is not easy. On the one hand, I believe it is a clearly Community field, in that it involves property sold in one country to Community citizens and with responsibilities which may arise at a later date, and, on the other hand, it is – as I said earlier – a question of private law which would not normally be considered a Community matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the question is raised of the possible use or limitations of the legislative procedure. It has been suggested for example that other types of measure may be useful in this field, such as measures for cooperation between Member States to combat the forms of money laundering that appear in certain types of timeshare companies or simply certain types of fraud. It mentions the possibility of employing co-regulation or self-regulation procedures, for example through the accreditation of operators in this field and there are a whole series of difficulties reflected in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s report is a compromise report. There is an exhaustive study by the Commission, but it dates from 1999. I believe that the main conclusion is that the Commission must be asked to study the issue again and to present proposals to us as soon as possible which may be either legislative or non-legislative.</p>
<p class="contents">Specifically, on reviewing the report approved in committee, we detected an error in paragraph 20, which referred to certain infringement procedures which have already been concluded and therefore that paragraph 20 no longer makes sense and should be removed. And there are also some unnecessary repetitions in paragraphs 6 and 7. I would propose that the House vote against those three paragraphs, 6, 7 and 20.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the amendments presented, there are three – Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 4 by Mr Bradbourn, Mr Lehne and Mrs McCarthy, which relate to the stipulation of specific days – which I believe to be too precise for a non-legislative text. And finally, there are three amendments by Mrs McCarthy, which clarify certain aspects in the field of information and responsibilities, which I believe to be very good.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end my speech here, Mr President, and I hope the House can adopt the draft report tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In November last year the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market instigated a public hearing on timeshares and a number of my constituents were able to come and explain their experiences directly to that hearing. I am very happy to say that many of the problems raised at the hearing, both in the oral presentations and the written dossier of evidence I submitted at the time, have been addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">A particular concern has been the increase in holiday club, or points club operations, which, by the very nature of their membership rules, take advantage of current legislation, which does not cover contracts of under three years. I would therefore commend to the House the proposal to cover all contracts of this nature, thus shutting off the loophole that currently exists.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I am pleased to see that we have proposed that the handing over of credit card details be subject to the same cooling-off period as a deposit by any other means. I have heard in surgeries in my own constituency of stories of innocent holidaymakers unwittingly giving timeshare touts their credit card details, only to find on their return from holiday that significant amounts of money have been debited from their accounts. Similarly, it is also vital that once contracts have been definitively signed, consumers are adequately protected against unreasonable increases in maintenance costs and, in cases where there has been malpractice, holidaymakers have easy recourse to legal redress.</p>
<p class="contents">A significant hurdle to such redress is the cost of complainants undertaking often lengthy legal procedures in a country where they are not completely at ease with the process. We must therefore look at new ways of simplifying this procedure, perhaps allowing complainants to use their own national judicial systems if necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">These measures represent essential steps towards genuine consumer protection for European holidaymakers purchasing this type of holiday. However, the current report is not a complete solution to all problems. I hope that Members will be able to support my amendment to extend the cooling-off period to 28 calendar days from its current 10. This would give a real opportunity for people to consider, in the cold light of day when they return from holiday, whether they wish to go ahead with their purchase.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope now that the Commission can come forward with appropriate proposals for legislation as quickly as possible so that our EU citizens can enjoy all forms of timeshare holidays in complete peace of mind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A large majority in the Committee on Legal Affairs agreed with this approach, which is why we should adopt it unanimously.</p>
<p class="contents">The new legislative proposal to come out of the report should: first, provide an integrated response to the problems which consumers have faced in the past, secondly, abolish the practice of circumventing the guarantees set out in Community legislation and, thirdly, protect all the parties involved.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that all new contractual forms for the enjoyment of immovable property on a timeshare basis should be included in the scope of the directive, without any reference to fixed time limits as regards either the minimum duration of a contract or the annual period of use. In addition, we need rules: one, that guarantee that agents will honour their contractual obligations in the long term, even if they go bankrupt or are insolvent, and restrict the number of agencies licensed, two, governing the right of the consumer and the obligation of the undertaking to allow the consumer to purchase his timeshare on the basis of a specific price and, three, on the system for exchanging timeshares.</p>
<p class="contents">Problems have arisen in practice, as has the question of international jurisdiction and applicable law, which is why jurisdiction clauses referring to offshore jurisdictions or simply to jurisdictions other than in the place in which the property is situated should be banned, as should clauses referring to the law of a third country.</p>
<p class="contents">As we have already said in connection with the need to avoid unilateral regulations, the question of the property owner's interests still needs to be resolved. In addition, this system needs to be treated as a way of developing tourism and providing jobs. Finally, given past experience, we need to look at the possibility of a new information campaign at European level promoting reliable timeshare companies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You return home to find that you have waved goodbye to the deposit of several thousand pounds and the company you dealt with is a worthless shell, constituted in some offshore haven. You have no chance of redress. Yes, this is a true story. How many of us have heard hapless tales like this from our constituents, despite the existence of a timeshare directive?</p>
<p class="contents">This report is timely. Its contents need to be acted on now, not delayed for further studies and reports.</p>
<p class="contents">But let me sound a note of caution. Whilst it will have the support of the Liberal Group, I am not totally convinced that this raft of rather complex and different legislative and non-legislative initiatives will answer the problem. The simple problem, to my mind, is this: these timeshare scams are one of the most appalling signals that we do not have, that we have not created a single European area of justice. Cross-border access to justice within the internal market is still fraught with many barriers for our citizens. Few, if any, of these scams are perpetrated against citizens in their own Member States. These rogues are only too easily able to profit from the lack of a single European civil area of justice. If they knew they would be pursued in their own countries they would think twice.</p>
<p class="contents">I commend paragraph 15 of the report as a good starting point for bringing these contracts within the definition of consumer contracts. It is this sort of horizontal approach that will eventually provide the answer. If we have proper cross-border access to justice then the timeshare scam bandits will think twice before they prey on our holidaying constituents. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Marinho (PSE). </span></span>  – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, I wish first to express my gratitude for the warm words of the rapporteur, Manuel Medina Ortega, but I must say that the report has lost nothing with my replacement.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the sharing of opportunities provided by the use of property with the time being shared – what is known as ‘timeshare’ – has not actually resulted in the happiness of all users. The problems that these products have experienced in the past and that still remain are well known and it was as a consequence of these problems that, in its time, Directive 94/47 was adopted, in the aim of providing protection against flagrant abuses of trust. Some problems, nevertheless, persist. The directive adheres to the principle of minimal harmonisation, establishing a low level of consumer protection measures that the Members States could then extend if they so wish. This has not, unfortunately, been common practice.</p>
<p class="contents">As a consequence, consumers now face a hotchpotch of laws, which afford greater protection in some States than in others. Since the directive was amended, the number of complaints received from European consumers has increased rather than decreased, as acknowledged by the Commission in its implementation report. There are, as a matter of fact, increasingly sophisticated methods of offering timeshare products, such as contracts of less than three years, normally of 35 months, thereby falling short of the minimum duration covered by the directive and evading Community discipline.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the directive covers only property that is used at least seven days per year, which has led to an increase in timeshare<span class="italic"> </span>contracts for periods of less than seven days. As Mr Medina Ortega quite rightly states, the directive, therefore, clearly needs urgent revision. Consumers require an effective measure of protection for their transactions, in particular those that take place in more than one Member State. The industry needs guarantees that fair practices will be encouraged and supported, through a reworded directive that eliminates the scandalous practices that we have been seeing.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, either we come up with standards that, without involving excessive regulation, of course, allow this activity to develop freely, or we leave everything the way it is and we accept, in the open society – and the information society – in which we live, all the attacks on this industry, be they well-intentioned or otherwise, that wish to destroy the competitive framework in which it must operate. Our decision must come down on the side of consumers, of tourism, of leisure activities, of the opportunity of holidays for all and of respect for responsible and honest promoters and this is why I wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Manuel Medina Ortega, whose text clearly exposes the shortcomings that need to be overcome in a future legislative text. It now falls to the Commission to take responsibility and to say what needs to be said. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Medina referred to action that had to be taken to implement this directive throughout the Member States and the laggardly way in which they have done so. It has all been too little, too late. There is a fringe of fraudulent activities – the timeshare sharks. There are practices that exploit the time limits of the directive itself, the growth of holiday clubs, points clubs and so on. There is avoidance of the limited protection of the very brief cooling-off period which is, I fear, not universally implemented, again by the different Member States. My colleague, Mrs McCarthy and others join me in recommending a proper cooling-off period of 28 days where the contract is signed outside the buyer's country of residence, as is the normal procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own country the victims of timeshare fraud have banded together to try and demand action. One of my constituents, Claire Griffiths, who attended the public hearings here, organised boycotts of the agents in her area. They were successful in terms of the diminished business of those people, but the group is still waiting for proper redress and their money back.</p>
<p class="contents">The Association of Timeshare Owners is today organising a co-regulatory body to deal with the management of timeshare resorts, which has been one of the other matters at issue. Our quarrel is not with them. I appreciate anything which is done in the field of co-regulation. However, they, and we, need action from the Commission, either by a resolution or by a directive. That is the only way we can demonstrate our power here to protect the vulnerable against exploitation that is not merely callous but very often criminal as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, first I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Medina Ortega and the members of the Committees on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer policy for all their helpful work on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I take the timeshare issue very seriously. Transactions are almost exclusively cross-border and often involve very significant sums of money. It is, therefore, essential that we aim to provide a high level of protection for consumers in this field. The present EU directive has made a significant contribution to consumers' rights, establishing minimum harmonisation. However, I am well aware that a number of consumer protection problems still exist. This, in my view, is not due to the transposition of the directive, the Commission has already withdrawn all the infringement procedures in relation to that – but to its application. Therefore, more needs to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumers can be vulnerable to several problems when they buy rights to use immovable properties on a timeshare basis. Firstly, certain unscrupulous vendors and agents use aggressive marketing techniques, which either mislead or place undue influence on consumers so as to induce them to buy, often to their detriment.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, new practices have emerged under which timeshare deals are offered through certain packages such as club points schemes or shares in a company, which effectively circumvents the obligations stipulated by the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, consumers miss out on access to the required level of information and on cooling-off periods.</p>
<p class="contents">I attach great importance to your resolution. Its conclusions, together with the Council's conclusions and the reactions to the 1999 Commission report on the implementation of the directive provide a solid basis for further action.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I am sure you will agree that we need to act immediately given the numerous complaints that our institutions have received on this issue. I believe that the more general problems could be tackled within the context of a framework directive on fair trading.</p>
<p class="contents">Further harmonisation of laws is necessary to achieve a uniform, high level of consumer protection throughout the EU. This is outlined in the follow-up communication to the Green Paper on consumer protection, which has just been adopted by the Commission. The marketing practices which could be tackled using this approach include those based on misleading claims or failure to disclose material information to consumers prior to the conclusion of the contract, those involving harassment, coercion or intimidatory techniques and those relating to after-sales customer assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, in order to address the most urgent problems, we should establish links with leading associations and members of the timeshare industry in order to make self-regulation more effective. The timeshare codes of conduct could be used to raise standards and to address those unfair and opaque practices not caught by the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I have recently been informed that a European trade association has taken legal action against certain holiday clubs in Spain for violation of Spanish timeshare law. The association in question has provided information to the public authorities on dishonest practices, which have subsequently been investigated. Several holiday club companies have been closed within the past few weeks and their principals have been arrested as part of the investigation.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus a more systematic cooperation between the industry and the relevant contact points in the Member States could and should be encouraged. Such cooperation should aim to identify companies with which problems have arisen and against which enforcement action can be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will therefore draw on the experience of the European centres, the Euro-Guichets, and work with the newly established clearing houses of the European Extra-Judicial Network and with the International Marketing Supervision Network to address current outstanding problems and encourage them to cooperate closely with the industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Specifically, the points that have been raised by Mrs Wallis in relation to access to justice are of significance and the cross-border nature of that problem is highlighted by her, in my opinion rightly.</p>
<p class="contents">Our proposal contained in the follow-up paper on fair trading specifically refers to the need for law enforcement cooperation among Member States. In our consultation process with Member States and others, there was a very strong response to that part of the paper focusing on enforcement cooperation. With this in view, it is the intention of the Commission to bring forward a specific proposal in relation to that particular issue by the end of this year or the beginning of next year.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore issues such as reciprocal injunctive powers between Member States would also, in my view, be of significance and could be effective. In effect, EU-wide contract and consumer law needs to be looked at, which we are doing in my DG at the moment, as I am sure many of you are aware, and we will bring forward proposals in that area also in due course I hope sooner rather than later.</p>
<p class="contents">These are our plans but if, after taking action as I have outlined, problems still remain that cannot be solved by these actions, I will not hesitate to review the timeshare directive as indicated in the consumer policy strategy recently adopted by the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
