<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lange (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, motorised two and three-wheel vehicles, that is motorcycles and scooters, are mainly used in two areas. Firstly, to respond to the need for mobility in urban areas and, secondly, for leisure purposes, particularly in sensitive areas of countryside with many attractive bends. In both areas, and I say this as a motorcycle enthusiast, the drivers of these vehicles have a special responsibility, because two-wheel vehicles should not have a greater impact on urban areas or sensitive areas of the countryside than motor cars have. It is therefore both legitimate and essential for us to ensure that motorised two and three-wheel vehicles should have the same level of emissions as motor cars. The European Parliament has set a very successful example through its input into legislation reducing emissions from motor cars, with the introduction of EURO III and IV, and also emissions from both light and heavy commercial vehicles, with a view to improving air quality in Europe's cities and sensitive environmental areas. We cannot therefore make an exception for motorcycles and scooters. Hence this proposal that there should also be a two-stage approach for motorcycles and scooters, with the first reduction stage being introduced in 2003 and a second reduction stage, and this is the important thing, coming into force in 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">Industry naturally needs time to develop new engines and new exhaust emissions cleaning systems. We must give industry this time, and that is why the second stage in 2006 is important. The Commission's proposal for 2003 is essentially the current state of the art – vehicles complying with these limit values are generally speaking already on our roads. There is already a list of registrations which indicates that over 80 vehicles already comply with the 2003 values. We do not want to tinker about with that – what we want is a second binding stage for 2006, applying the EURO III 2000 motor car levels to motorised two-wheel vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we want to see one thing start in 2003 that already applies to cars and to light and heavy commercial vehicles. I have in mind concentration on the sustainability of emissions-related parts. Of course, it does not make much sense if a two-wheel vehicle achieves marvellous emission limit values on the test bench if in practice, after just a few thousand kilometres, these limit values are history. That is why we want to see a start made on sustainability for motorised two-wheel vehicles in 2003 and why we also want to create a situation whereby if there is a serious suspicion that particular models are not complying with emission limit values on a long-term basis, the authorities are empowered to check this using in-service surveys to ensure in-use compliance.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been told that it is not yet possible to do anything as regards 2006, because we do not yet have a new motorcycle test cycle, and because the test cycle needs to be revised before we can do anything. I do not agree with that. As with heavy commercial vehicles, we have said that it would be good if we had a worldwide cycle, but we want to stick to our objective. That objective is that by 2006 we should achieve a level corresponding to the motor car level for 2000, allowing a little more time for motorcycles, but they must reach that level by then. If there is no other test cycle by then, we will just have to use the same cycle that applies to cars.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Goodwill and I have built in a slightly longer lead time for certain smaller manufacturers who would have particular problems in converting their production lines. I think that is appropriate and does not affect the overall result. I believe that that if we accept the proposals of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and enter into the conciliation procedure with the Council, motorcycle riders will in future be able to exercise both their responsibility and their freedom, and that should be our common objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This forces us to confront the seriousness of the situation that the motorised transport sector is currently facing. Transport accounts for a huge proportion of CO2 and NOx emissions, road transport being the worst culprit.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that two and three-wheel motor vehicles only constitute a very small percentage of total road traffic volume. It is therefore all the more striking that their contribution to emissions is relatively high. According to the forecasts of the Auto Oil Programme II, unless there is a change in policy, this proportion will only increase.</p>
<p class="contents">The current generation of two and three-wheel vehicles still satisfies the requirements placed on other older vehicles. However, these categories are regularly confronted with more stringent emission standards. In order to allow two and three-wheel vehicles to perform to optimum effect, it is desirable to adapt emission standards on a continuous basis. Therefore, I personally am content with the line proposed by the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I am pleased that the rapporteur has advocated a longer period, although not as long as our committee would have liked, for the smaller manufacturers of two and three-wheel vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, all in all I am delighted with Mr Lange’s report. The implementation thereof should mean a step in the direction of a sustainable transport system, and, of course, that is what Parliament wants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I cannot wait for the other directives coming along on small pleasure craft and the small spark ignition engine which will complete the story.</p>
<p class="contents"> Motorcycles constitute a very small percentage of traffic volume. Advances in engine technology for cars and trucks coupled with a 6% rise in motorcycle mileage in the 1990s have meant that the proportion of pollution from bikes is increasing. I therefore welcome this proposal but with certain reservations.</p>
<p class="contents">My major concern is the short time between 2003 when the new standards will apply to new models and the date when that is extended to all new motorcycles. This will put tremendous pressure on the smaller European manufacturers, like Triumph and CCM in the United Kingdom. Although these modifications are technically feasible, small companies do not have the resources to do the work in only 12 months and the development costs would have to be recovered from a smaller volume of vehicles. This would put European manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage as compared with the big boys from the Far East. I am pleased, therefore, that the rapporteur has recognised this by extending this transition phase to two years.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to congratulate the rapporteur by leading by example by converting his own classic Harley Davidson motorcycle with a retro-fitted catalytic converter. It is not a case of saying one thing and doing another from that side of the House.</p>
<p class="contents">I have some reservations regarding on-board diagnostics and in-service testing. Regarding on-board diagnostics, a motorcycle is often the first vehicle that a young person buys with limited resources and therefore this will make the vehicle more expensive. Secondly, I am rather cynical about what the owner of the bike will do when that little green light comes on saying that the exhaust system is not performing to standard. I suspect he may be tempted just to take the bulb out. Maybe at this stage of the game we should keep these two balls in play and see how the game progresses towards second reading and possible conciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, on the subject of fiscal measures. Whilst I support market solutions like tax incentives, these should be applied by Member States according to national criteria if they so wish. This proposal is to be made under Article 95, that is to say qualified majority voting, and despite the 28 vetoes given up by Tony Blair at Nice, the UK has not yet given up its right to determine its own taxes, and therefore this should not be within the scope of this directive. Subsidiarity is something that should be protected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are currently in a paradoxical situation: although motorcycles represent only 2-3 % of the total volume of transport, motorcycle emissions account for an increasingly high proportion of the total emissions. The amendments tabled by Mr Lange, like almost all those adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, enhance the Commission's proposal. In particular, the insistence on the development of Europe-wide test cycles specifically for motor vehicles, but also the call to make type approval subject to confirmation of the effectiveness of the anti-pollution measures<span class="bold"> </span>are indications of the European Parliament's will to take firm action in such a sensitive area as this.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, it would appear important to stress that the majority of these objectives are widely endorsed by the sector's businesses. This means both that Mr Lange's negotiations with them have been successful and that awareness is growing among producers too of the need to contribute to improving our environmental conditions. Therefore, the decision to fix, as of now, not only the date for revising the initial limits set – 2006 – but also the limits for the second stage, is an indication of Parliament's decision to apply continual pressure to industry to make progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the introduction of the opportunity to revise these limits in line with the hoped-for technological developments is evidence of the will to continue the dialogue with manufacturers in the future as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So I hope that when it comes to tomorrow’s vote, all delegates will vote in favour of equipping new motor cycles with a catalytic converter in 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have a question for the Commission. I believe it is now high time we abolished the exemption for diesel motors, i.e. for trains from 1978. Trains too, must, and could, be far cleaner. I hope the Commission is prepared to respond on this point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Lange’s report, whose environmental concern our group shares, constantly compares 2- and 3-wheel vehicles with 4-wheel vehicles. However, their ease of use, the fluidity that they give to traffic in cities, their simplicity for parking and the low cost of purchasing and maintaining them should be more than sufficient reason for the necessary anti-pollution measures not to decrease their use. The European industry needs more time to apply the proposed measures. I therefore ask that the Commission, in cooperation with the manufacturers, evaluate the applicability and the cost-efficiency relationship of these measures and essentially of the periods proposed, as we run the risk of indirectly favouring the large companies in the sector, which are precisely not the European ones.</p>
<p class="contents">We need tax incentives to facilitate the sale and use of less-polluting vehicles that are easy to use, improve traffic and are more integrated into our cities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that two and three-wheel motor vehicles are particularly fashionable and in vogue at present and we should therefore make a point of ensuring that they comply with the latest exhaust emission standards.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been great progress in research in this field, and it is now up to us to implement this research. The inventory of emissions drawn up by the Commission demonstrates very clearly the progress that has been made with NOx emissions: up to 80% for four-stroke engines as against a maximum of 70% for two-strokes. These values really look quite respectable. That is why I am in favour of staged reductions which, if they are reasonable, will certainly mean great benefits for motorcycle drivers and others using these engines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur recommends the adoption of the Commission’s proposal on limit values to be implemented as from 2003. The rapporteur, however, is suggesting a second stage for mandatory limit values to apply from 2006. This stage would be based on a test cycle for passenger cars. The Commission acknowledges the need for this second stage. We shall be putting forward a separate proposal for this by the end of 2002. The forthcoming proposal will be based on additional research into the technical performance and economic viability of equipment that is more advanced with regard to reducing emissions. In this next stage, emissions will have to be measured in relation to an improved test cycle. The situation will thus be made to match the real driving dynamics of motorcycles. The Commission has not included mandatory limits to apply from 2006 in its proposal, as it does not yet have access to the information that would give the right sort of scientifically persuasive support to the introduction of test cycles.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission actively supports the development of a worldwide, harmonised test cycle for motorcycles. The work was started in 1999, and in May of 2000 the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe extended an official mandate for this, having the support of the Member States of the EU, Japan and the United States. The work programme is progressing according to schedule. For that reason, we believe that the new cycle will be introduced in sufficient time for it to start being applied in 2006. This is in line with Mr Lange’s views. Consequently, the Commission cannot support the amendments proposing that a decision be now made to start the mandatory second stage in 2006. The relevant amendments are Amendments Nos 3, 5, 10, 11, 23, 24 and 25. However, the Commission is obviously prepared to take part in formulating a general Interinstitutional Agreement as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur mentions several measures to ensure more reliably that emission control equipment functions efficiently throughout a vehicle’s lifetime. The Commission recognises the importance of these if we want to make sure that there is a genuine reduction in emissions whilst driving. A motorcycle, however, is a very different product from a car in technical terms. In applying requirements for motorcycles attention has to be paid to the consequences, meaning there has to be a careful appraisal made of technical feasibility and cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">I might reply to the question put by Mr de Roo regarding rail transport that the matter is also being looked into but no proposal has yet been made.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission in principle accepts the amendments in which the Commission is urged to examine the points of view mentioned earlier. However, we reject the amendments which propose dates for the mandatory application of requirements, or provisions that take no account of the final results of research. This is a reference to Amendments Nos 6, 13, 14, 15, 20 and 22. The Commission adopts the same position with regard to Amendments Nos 8 and 17, dealing with carbon dioxide emissions from motorcycles.</p>
<p class="contents">The report contains several amendments the Commission would be able to support, such as Amendments Nos 4 and 12, if Member States were given the opportunity to encourage the retrofitting of emission control equipment and parts in older motor vehicles. The same holds true for Amendment No 1 and the latter part of Amendment No 9, in which it is proposed that a year-long exemption be granted for the special class of trial motorcycles, and the first part of Amendment No 9, which recommends application to present models to start, not from January, but from July, 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission nevertheless rejects Amendment No 26, which would delay application to present models by a whole year. In principle, the Commission also supports Amendments Nos 7 and 16 on requirements for defeat devices and by-pass arrangements, and believes it is able to include such requirements in its current proposal. The Commission can thus accept Amendments Nos 4, 9, 12 and 18, and, in principle, Amendments Nos 2, 7, 8, 16 and 21, and, in part, Amendments Nos 1, 4, 19, 20 and 22. The Commission cannot, however, accept Amendments Nos 3, 5, 6, 10, 11, 13, 15, 17, 23, 24, 25 or 26. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
