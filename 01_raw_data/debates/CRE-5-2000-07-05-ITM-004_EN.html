The reason for this is that the Danube river at Novi Sad is blocked by the remains of bridges destroyed by NATO's bombing last year. This, as well as the fact that the river bed is now lined with unexploded mines and bombs, is threatening both economic and humanitarian development in the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">The task is to clear the river of three collapsed bridges and unexploded mines and bombs along a five kilometre stretch of Serbian territory. The help of the EU is required for this. It is important for this clearing work to be started before the summer. We should have preferred it if it had been possible for this to be a part of the Supplementary and Amending Budget that we have just debated, but for reasons of time this has not been possible. Therefore, the Committee on Budgets is nevertheless lending its support for funds to be freed up so that the Danube Commission can begin its work as soon as possible. One problem is that part of the work will be carried out on Serbian territory, once we have satisfied ourselves that the sanctions against Yugoslavia will be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as carrying out the work, the legal basis and the financing of the project are concerned, we have been in contact with the Commission and our queries have been resolved. As regards the provision of this EUR 22 million, the Commission has suggested that 7.5 million be taken from Phare, 7.5 million from ISPA and 7 million from Obnova. I should just like the Commission to confirm the following, and that is that the Commission will contact the Committee on Budgets if any problems should arise with the financing of this project. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My political Group and the intergroup SOS Democracy therefore recommend that we postpone the vote and give the agreement a proper reading in all committees, especially in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the Committee on Budgetary Control. We agree with the criticism from the chairperson of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mrs Theato, that the agreement directly contravenes Article 276 of the Treaty, which guarantees us access to information as part of the discharge procedure. Now, the Commission is being given the opportunity to decide what it will hand over for inspection. It is the same procedure as applies in connection with the ombudsman. The framework agreement also contravenes our own rules of procedure. Article 64 requires express equality between the Council and Parliament in the legislative procedure when the Commission transfers documents. Now, it is only the President of the Parliament and the committee chairmen who are entitled to see different types of non-public documents. The rapporteurs cannot demand them, and MEPs certainly cannot. As MEPs, we ought to be legally entitled to have documents made available to us whenever they have been issued to others by the Commission. That was something all the group chairmen agreed about when we began negotiations with the Commission. Now, a compromise is being proposed whereby those who are to be inspected can decided what they will have inspected. This compromise does not correspond with Mr Prodi’s pledges. I would therefore urge that we reject the proposal today and arrange for it to be improved so that we can vote for an improved version next time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we cannot accept the way in which the Council has interfered in relations between the Commission and Parliament now that the talks are over. The Council asked, pressed, and actually forced the Commission to remove from the agreement the text that would have required that Member States, the institutions and international organisations would, under this agreement, have had to explain their unwillingness to release some confidential information. In our opinion, this is absolutely intolerable.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I have reason to suspect that this is the direct consequence of the Feira summit. There it was decided that NATO would release secret information for the purpose of making joint military plans, which would appear to be a clear attempt to exclude both the Commission and Parliament from a common security and defence policy. We thus need a clear explanation from the Council as to why this is happening. In addition, Madam President, we have to improve the rights of rapporteurs to acquire confidential information, and perhaps a deferment would also provide the opportunity to establish this aspect of the matter. We thus do not support this text such as it is now since the last changes were made to it, and it would be wisest if we were to take a little extra time over the issue.</p>

My Group called for this framework agreement, and it is very much committed to it. Relations between the Commission and the European Parliament will be put on a very firm and clear footing, and it is our common goal to support the building of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is the executive, we together with the Council are the legislative, and this framework agreement will create means for the European Parliament to exercise its parliamentary control function more effectively. It goes without saying that future regulations which become Community law in the European Union will not be affected by this framework agreement. As legislators we are of course free to set these in train.</p>
<p class="contents">This framework agreement is based on the principles of parliamentarism, democracy and transparency. The Commission has once again incorporated in this agreement, in a legally binding way, the concessions that it made to the European Parliament last September before it was elected – the ‘five points’. These items relate to the annexes on the legislative procedure, and the involvement of and provision of information to Parliament regarding agreements and on enlargement issues. They also concern the passing on of confidential information. Of course not everyone’s requirements have been met, including some of our own, but it is not always possible to achieve everything. However, taken as a whole, this agreement does represent progress, and I would sincerely like to thank everyone involved in it – you, Madam President, Vice-President Loyola de Palacio, the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, and also the political group leaders, who showed great commitment in their work on it. The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats will be unanimously voting for this agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the justification for the fact that the code of conduct – whose negotiation it fell to me to initiate in 1990, when Parliament was much weaker, which President Hänsch continued and which was concluded under his presidency – has been given a greater dimension, since the correlation of forces has changed. Parliament is more powerful and must therefore act more responsibly. In this respect, we believe that we have taken an important step. The negotiation has been very long. It was expected that the framework agreement would be concluded in December of last year. There has been a very intense tug-of-war with the Commission, which led us to urge two of Parliament’s committee chairpersons, whose work I am grateful for, Mr Napolitano, of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and Mrs Theato, of the Committee on Budgetary Control, to make progress in the negotiation, especially in relation to the third Annex. Madam President, it falls to you to conclude. I believe that thanks are due firstly to you, Madam President, and to the chairpersons of the committees I mentioned, to President Prodi and the Vice-President, Mrs De Palacio, for the fact that today we have this code of conduct.</p>
<p class="contents">What we now have to do is adapt our internal regulations to this new reality. I would like to end by making a last observation to the Council, which has not taken part in this negotiation. It would perhaps be a good thing if the Council were also in a position and willing to adopt a standard of good conduct with Parliament in the budgetary field and in the political field. Madam President, that would be a step forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have taken steps to try to inform myself as to the equivalence that exists among governments and among national parliaments. Exceptionally, there may be one state of the 15 where more things that are conceded by way of openness to its parliament than in other states. But in the large majority of cases, there is no near equivalent and that is a significant element in this document.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we had a major debate in this House last year that centred among other things on the question of commissioners accepting individual and personal responsibility for the exercise of their high office. In this document there are significant clauses interpreting the mutual relationship between our institutions that also constitute significant progress.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two points of criticism that my colleagues and my Group have asked to seek clarification on today. Article 1.4 in annex 3 regulates which persons or bodies within this House may request of the Commission access to confidential documents. Many of my colleagues are upset that no explicit reference is made to the rights of rapporteurs. We have brought the document as far as we can with the Commission, but I would say that, if we vote for it today, you must immediately instruct our Committee on Constitutional Affairs to take up the question of delineating the rules in the House that will make it easier for rapporteurs to make requests either of their chairmen or of the other bodies named in this document. If we include this, then many of my colleagues who have reservations, will vote yes.</p>
<p class="contents">One final comment: this House has now begun its work on the question of transparency and the regulation on access to documents. Many of my colleagues have said to me – without anticipating the outcome of that work – that, should we ultimately need to review our framework in the light of any emerging trends in this regulation, the Commission President, Mr Prodi, should declare on the record, before the vote, that the Commission will be open to the idea of reviewing the document in the light of any evolving policy on transparency.</p>

This spirit of co-operation is depicted very well in the agreement in those points which concern, for example, the right of Parliament to be involved when international agreements are being discussed, not only with regard to the end result, but at every stage of such talks. This we regard as a genuine step forward, and the same is true of the fact that the Commission is promising to do its best to keep the European Parliament informed on the intergovernmental conference. This symbolises the new spirit we are now creating with the Commission, and it is very important that the Commission and Parliament have mutual agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, however, Madam President, the Council has not approved of the process whereby these relations have come closer. My Group is very concerned about the developments that are under way in the Council. We hope and demand that the Council gives a public and open explanation about whether in future it intends to respect relations between Parliament and the Commission, or whether it intends to interfere in them in the future. The Council particularly seems to be aiming for secrecy in the matter of security and defence policy, and it would appear that not just the European Parliament – and via it, the public – will suffer from this attempt at secrecy, which entered the arena after these talks on agreements, when there was a call to amend the text, but also the European Commission will suffer as a result. We must support a strong Commission, and we must support the idea that in future the Commission will have a fixed role to play in the development of a common security and defence dimension, as these days no one area can remain exempt from the demand for transparency, and that includes a security and defence policy.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we assume that this agreement will serve to strengthen the relationship between the Commission and the Parliament, a relationship based on trust. You may be sure that if this House approves the framework agreement, Members in my Group will watch very closely to ensure that it is actually adhered to.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make two critical comments and I am in agreement with the other members of my Group here. Firstly, the issue of openness and transparency as regards documents and information is extremely important for my Group. We assume that the agreement stipulated in point 13 will be strictly adhered to, in accordance with which the Members of this House will, as the only institution which has democratic legitimacy, be the first to be provided with information – and I mean all information – as only in that way can we exercise our mandate as the public expects of us.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that this point 18, which relates to the exceptional provision of point 13, will never need to be applied.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we too have a comment for the Council. We were astonished by the Council’s intervention. I think that this really amounted to a very dubious form of interference in an agreement between the Commission and the Parliament, and, at that, by an institution that has quite rightly attracted criticism itself for meeting behind closed doors. Furthermore, given that the common security and defence policy is referred to here, at a time when we are aware that Europe is involved in establishing emergency armed forces for military intervention, this really does not bode well.</p>
<p class="contents">One final comment: we all heard President Chirac address this House yesterday. He promised that the Council’s modus operandi would change in future. I believe that we will all be paying very close attention to what happens during the French Presidency and to whether the Council operates in a more transparent and democratic way in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is very important that all the EU institutions operate effectively and efficiently and the 370 million citizens of the European Union must support and have confidence in the Union's internal legislative processes.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the key legislative organs is the European Commission, which has the power to initiate the enactment of directives and regulations. The European Council represents the interests of the fifteen governments of the Union and has very strong legislative powers.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament is a democratically elected legislative body which has the overriding power of supervision over other key institutions. If the European Union is to operate more effectively then it is very important that the relationship between the Commission and Parliament is well defined and that is why the framework agreement between the Commission and Parliament is being put in place.</p>
<p class="contents">The negotiations for this framework agreement have been tortuous. It may not be a perfect document but it is certainly a step forward. It is more exacting than the agreement that has existed between the two institutions over the past five years.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn to some of the key provisions of the agreement. The two institutions will now agree to extend constructive dialogue and political cooperation, to improve the flow of information and to consult and inform Parliament on administrative reform within the Commission. There is also agreement, albeit not very extensive, on the EU legislative process, international agreements and the enlargement negotiations and procedures are put in place for the transmission of confidential Commission documents and information.</p>
<p class="contents">One could argue that much of this framework agreement only clarifies existing provisions under the present EU Treaties. For example, I know that the Commission is required to keep Parliament informed of the enlargement negotiations to enable it to express its views in good time through appropriate parliamentary procedures. That is right and proper, in view of the fact that the European Parliament has to approve the right of any Member State to accede to the Union as a new and full Member. The Parliament also has the final say as to whether or not international agreements such as the WTO talks are approved. Parliament cannot be expected to make important decisions on such matters unless the necessary and appropriate information has been forwarded to the Members for their consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Commission must set in train open procedures to transmit up-to-date information on the whole range of regulations, directives and international accords being discussed and enacted by the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am satisfied there is always a need to clarify the procedures for the transmission of confidential information.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was difficult to achieve this compromise, and the Council’s last minute attempts to water down the agreement are evidence of how ambitious it is and of the way it places Parliament and the Commission in a relationship of cooperation, where Parliament performs a monitoring function in line with its prerogatives while the Commission has a range of tasks to add to its primary role of guardian of the Treaties and proposer of initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">I am certain that the right balance has been found. In my opinion, which, I know, differs from that of the Members who criticised the agreement, this was the best agreement that could have been achieved, including in terms of the transmission of documents, and I regret the fact that a slight excess on the part of some Members may well have prevented us from taking the mechanism regulating the transmission of documents further. However, I feel that this is a great step forward, and we look forward to the adoption and signing of this framework agreement in a few minutes’ time.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are certain that a proper reading in the committees and further negotiation with Mr Prodi himself will produce a better result which we shall be able to vote in favour of. I should like to begin by correcting a misunderstanding. We do not want to prevent the Commission from being able to deliberate in confidence. It is important for every authority to have an internal phase of its proceedings in which any ideas may be discussed and any proposals appear on the table, without its being obliged to make them public. The Commission should also be entitled to have confidential drafts on the table throughout the preparative phase. Our demand to exercise supervision applies from the time when the Commission sends documents out or in the case of their being leaked, as happens not infrequently. If a proposal is no longer within the confines of the Commission, then the latter ought not to be able to refuse to let us see it. In that way, there would be equality for all, and that is not the case with the framework agreement. There are two humiliating situations in particular which we should like to avoid. In the legislation process, we sit, as we all know, in committees and debate draft bills. Behind us sit students, interns and people from the Permanent Representations with the confidential drafts marked ‘restrained’, while we MEPs cannot obtain them. The lobbyists, who sit behind, also have them, but we elected representatives cannot obtain them. It also often happens that we read in the newspaper about a leaked Commission proposal. We are asked to comment on it, but we cannot obtain a copy. It is a humiliating situation which is completely unacceptable. When he took up his post, Mr Prodi promised to bring this situation to an end. We should be legally entitled to obtain documents when they are no longer within the confines of the Commission. And it is as individual MEPs and rapporteurs that we should have this legal entitlement and not by going down on our knees before the President. What is more, a President might come along to whom one preferred not to kowtow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A great deal of progress has been made since we agreed to work together to draw up a new interinstitutional agreement. We have worked extremely hard in order to produce a high quality agreement, and I would like to express my heartfelt appreciation of the constructive way in which you led the negotiations, Madam President, with the support of the Conference of Presidents and Mrs De Palacio from the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the framework opinion before us today represents a practical, balanced approach to the relationship between our institutions. It includes a number of things which you as Members of Parliament consider to be important, such as the presence of representatives of the Commission at your meetings, the crucial issue of the exchange of information and the need for Parliament to be involved in trade and enlargement negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">The concept of close cooperation between the institutions is clear and prominent in the agreement but this does not affect the balance between the institutions at all, for that is based on the current regulations, such as the regulation on access to confidential documents. In fact, I would like to make my intention today clear and stress that any future amendments to these regulations will be duly included in our agreements.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, the agreement has been recommended to the respective institutions, and, earlier this morning, the College authorised Mrs Palacio and myself to adopt and sign it on behalf the Commission. If you vote for the motion this morning, we will proceed together to the signing of the agreement and so enter a new stage in our relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">As I stressed yesterday, we have a number of major deadlines before us and it is essential to ensure that our respective institutions focus on issues which are now crucial for the future of Europe. This agreement will consolidate each institution’s role in the construction of Europe and, what is most important, increase the efficiency of our joint action.</p>

I think that we also need transparency in our debates. Consequently, before an important vote such as that which are about to take, we must not be under any illusions as to what is at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, if you will allow me, to make two basic comments. First, the Echelon system was treated somewhat tritely in a number of parallel discussions, including at the Conference of Presidents. It was said that surveillance took place anyway, it was even added, some even said that it was important to have surveillance systems in order to track down serious criminals. This is undoubtedly true, but surveillance must take place within a legal framework first of all, which is not the case with Echelon.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, an important distinction needs to be made: Echelon is, in fact, a surveillance system which targets not specific communications but all communications and data transfers. Consequently, all communications are intercepted and then analysed by super-computers and classified on the basis of a lexicon of key words. This global bugging strategy clearly infringes the confidentiality of private communications and, as such, violates the Treaty and directives …</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Lehne (PPE-DE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Madam President, this is exactly the point I am seeking to have corrected. I had already brought this to the attention of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs. This amendment relates to Article 6(3) of the 1991 directive which is to be amended and to Article 1(5) of the present directive, which is to amend the old directive. In the middle of the second subparagraph, the German version correctly reads: “... for the purposes of representation in legal proceedings or in the context of legal advice”. The German version is the authoritative version as far as our consultation is concerned, as German is the rapporteur’s language. The English version is incorrect and simply reads “in order to be able to represent him in legal proceedings”. The “legal advice” aspect is missing from the English version. I pointed this out during the discussions in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, but for some reason this error of translation has still not been rectified. This is of particularly critical importance, because the Council conducts its proceedings on the basis of the English text. I would ask you to instruct the officials to rectify this and to correct the English text by basing it on an accurate translation of the German text. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is with regret that we have supported the compromise reached during the conciliation procedure with the Council. I say with regret, because Parliament was expected to be satisfied with the few crumbs thrown at us by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The bonus granted out of the EUR 850 million demanded is roughly the equivalent of about twenty kilometres of motorway in France!</p>
<p class="contents">I only hope that the size of this budgetary line is not a pale reflection of the Union's environmental policy, not that I am questioning the considerable work carried out by the directorate-general for the environment or the Commissioner, who do the best they can with the means at their disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">But we shall continue to repeat until we are blue in the face that a real European environmental policy can only be applied, or even constructed, with the necessary funds.</p>
<p class="contents">The environment will never be taken seriously with a budgetary line of this size, compared with the budgets for agriculture or the Structural Funds which still often have an adverse impact on the environment. LIFE is just a drop in the ocean of European policy.</p>
<p class="contents">That aside, is the environment not the only European sector to have shown no real improvement? With the explosion in road transport within the Union, we are also seeing an explosion of all sorts of pollution and emissions, especially of greenhouse gases.</p>

It is possible that the railway industry has not been quite up to scratch because, for the time being, it has largely lost the competitive battle to road transport and aviation. This is why it is sensible to find out how the railway industry could function better and how its market share in Europe can grow. </p>
<p class="contents">I can think of different ways to achieve this. French rail is currently expanding considerably, with growing employment, by doing the exact opposite of what Mr Jarzembowski proposes in his report. </p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, the root of the problem is different from how the rapporteur sees it. The real problem is that politicians have for years neglected the railway industry, mainly because they considered it to be a crumbling vestige of the 19th century which would not make it into the 21st century anyway. All new investments were poured into a dense network of motorways and increasingly large airports. </p>
<p class="contents">Only when the environmental consequences of this policy became apparent did attention shift back to the railways. But at that time, the concept that freedom for the economy was more important than democratic input in politics had already taken hold. Politicians no longer wanted that input in public enterprises and, with it, shirked the responsibility of acting as inspector on behalf of the consumer and as guardian of employment. </p>
<p class="contents">Public enterprises started to shape up as private companies, increasingly so, where growth, profit and market value were considered more important than the social consequences of their actions. </p>
<p class="contents">Taking care of public transport and the environment should be of concern to all of us, including therefore our democratically elected government. Whether or not it is judicious to separate infrastructure from the operation of the railway industry is to be decided by the national or regional governments and is not a task of the European Union. And it is certainly not up to the European Union to implement forced privatisation of urban or regional transport companies, as is in danger of happening in the short term. </p>
<p class="contents">For my Group, these considerations are sufficient to reject Mr Jarzembowski’s proposals out of hand and to express the hope that they could never be translated into policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no point in talking about projects to extend the European rail network until complete liberalisation has taken place. This is therefore a matter of urgency. Projects such as the Brenner base tunnel can only compete if freight transport can be offered at competitive rates. Adopting this directive would give a clear signal about liberalising rail transport. If a clear split is not made between the trains operated by the railway companies on the one hand and the management of railway infrastructure on the other, the objective of this directive will be seriously undermined. I have therefore rejected the solution opted for in Article 6(4) of the common position.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I believe that this objective can be achieved after a reasonable transitional period, in accordance with the principle of gradual liberalisation, without it necessarily requiring a statutory split between the provision of transport services by train operators on the one hand and infrastructure management on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot therefore support the recommendation for second reading as presented by a majority of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. In my own small country of Luxembourg, splitting up the railway company in this way would, for many good reasons, but not least safety, transport quality and railwaymen’s working conditions, be inappropriate to the point of absurdity.</p>
<p class="contents">We find the Council's common position much more acceptable, because it does more to take into consideration the specific geopolitical and geographical circumstances of individual Member States, yet without undermining the unity of the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also impossible for me to accept the deletion here at second reading of the provision under which Luxembourg, as a Member State with a relatively small rail network, does not need to apply the requirement to award the functions determining equitable and non-discriminatory access to infrastructure to an independent body until 31 August 2004. Article 6 of the directive in fact obliges Member States to establish independent bodies performing these tasks.</p>

<p class="contents">According to the conclusions of the Jarzembowski report, the revision of Directive 91/440 throws the door to privatisation wide open by proposing that infrastructure management and the provision of transport services be separated and that every undertaking be given access to infrastructure in the medium term, the objective being to open up all freight and passenger transport to the markets and to competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The approach taken in the Jarzembowski report is to bring the management of railway undertakings into line with private sector management as much as possible and to introduce the pressure of competition. It uses shortcomings in the operation of the public service as a pretext and highlights the superior performance of the private sector on the basis of imperfect comparisons which fail to take account of all the factors and all the missions that have been accomplished.</p>
<p class="contents">The logic behind the Jarzembowski report will inevitably lead to a deterioration in safety standards, poorer quality services, a reduction in services to customers and a loss of social rights for employees. This report turns its back on what the European public really needs: a public service that is coordinated and harmonised at European level, which could guarantee a high standard of efficiency, safety and equity for employees and users alike, right away.

It needs to operate within a large-scale European network instead of just within the individual Member State borders. </p>
<p class="contents">Long waiting and transfer times at borders and the fact that direct international connections have ceased to exist are a cause of frustration. </p>
<p class="contents">We would all like to see ineffective, conservative and bureaucratic procedures brought to an end. Indeed, they cause frustration amongst users and unnecessarily drive freight and passengers onto other types of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">I indicated yesterday as well as during previous debates that cooperation between the railway companies of the different Member States should be stepped up, so as to offer joint solutions for cross-border traffic. This cooperation should have been sought a long time ago. </p>
<p class="contents">If this had been the case, there would have been fewer opportunities for those intending to elbow out existing railway companies by introducing newcomers onto the market which offer price reductions to the detriment of the working environment, working conditions and the environment in general. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Swoboda is right in stating that years of lack of investment in capacity, infrastructure and technology must now be rectified. He entertains the possibility of authorities offering financial compensation in order to make the use of railways safe for public transport and does not rule out a role for public companies in future. </p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, however, his statement that, in this line of industry, rights must be available to all to an equal extent, makes him a hostage to liberal ideas. This is borne out in his ideas that we should aim for full recovery of costs rather than expect extra charges for each additional train. </p>
<p class="contents">One unintended consequence could be that passengers and freight are forced to use alternatives which, can, on this basis, compete structurally at lower prices. These are cheaper for the consumer, but cost society as a whole more dearly because these alternatives cannot afford to care as much about workers and the environment. </p>
<p class="contents">In addition, Mr Swoboda has deleted the exemption rules for islands and Member States which do not have cross-border railway connections, as formulated in the Council’s common position. In his opinion, everyone should be affected by liberalisation to the same degree. In our view, this deletion does not constitute an improvement on the Council’s position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We support the Council’s common position because it represents a balance which marks a new stage in the opening-up of the rail market, pending the adoption of provisions ensuring balanced competition between and within modes of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">The railways are the product of a permanent and technically efficient combination of activities carried out by different operators – infrastructure managers, railway undertakings, station managers etc – with many different functions. These operators can perform the roles of both infrastructure manager and railway undertaking if this is economically more efficient. There is nothing to indicate that completely separating these functions improves the openness, efficiency or safety of the system.</p>
<p class="contents">Complete separation is not a necessary condition for opening up the European single market railway market. The existence of firms which perform the functions of both infrastructure management and railway undertakings at the same time is not a barrier to the opening-up of the market, in that transparent, non-discriminatory procedures are established and monitored by an independent regulator.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, an integrated company is generally in a better position to develop new technologies relating to both the infrastructure management and the railway undertaking.</p>
<p class="contents">A railway company whose decisions are oriented towards achieving the best possible technical and economic situation is in a position to implement the necessary innovations rapidly and to assume the responsibility of the investment risks.</p>
<p class="contents">The railway system is a technically diversified system which, in any case, whatever the organisational solution adopted, requires substantial coordination. There is a greater guarantee of safety when the management of the railway system is entrusted to an integrated company for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="contents">- the company controls all the elements of the system and their interaction;</p>
<p class="contents">- it receives quicker and more detailed feedback regarding events affecting the system;</p>
<p class="contents">- it gives the authorities the security of there being a single body responsible for the safety of the system.</p>
<p class="contents">Respect for the principles of fairness and transparency in the allocation of capacity or in pricing is essential, but it cannot just be assumed that the separation system is the best way of ensuring that these principles are respected. In effect, an integrated company system, a railway authority, as provided for in the common position adopted in March, would be perfectly capable of guaranteeing non-discriminatory network access and guaranteeing fair line prices.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the contribution of the State supervisory organs which already exist to some extent, more effective and extensive supervision of competition in the European railway transport sector would thus be provided by the railway authority envisaged in the Council’s common position.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to the derogation, I fully support Mr Collins’ view.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The common position represents a delicate balance which supports the principles of liberalisation of the industry while giving due consideration to the particularities of individual Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Part of this common position includes a complex derogation in respect of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Greece as well as further considerations for Luxembourg. In the case of Greece and of both parts of the island of Ireland there are obvious geographical obstacles to full participation in a single rail market.</p>
<p class="contents">In these circumstances, full implementation of the Rail Package would result in a considerable burden on the administrations of these Member States without any of the benefits to consumers that the Package is designed to bring about.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments which I tabled to Mr Jarzembowski’s and Mr Swoboda’s reports aimed at restoring the equilibrium established by the common position. The Council position is, I believe, in the best interests of both the rail industry and the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">I would further like to point out that the derogation for Ireland, Northern Ireland, Greece and Luxembourg only covers those elements of the package where implementation would serve no real and practical purpose. Furthermore, there are even in-built safeguard clauses in this derogation which would cause the whole derogation to lapse should any new entrant to the rail markets of Ireland or Greece appear.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, colleagues, as a member of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism I recognise the desirability of developing a single market in rail-service provision and the potential benefits for the consumer. The granting of a derogation to the geographically-separated rail networks of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Greece does not in any way undermine this principle.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, removal of the derogation would impose unnecessary administrative burdens and costs in these Member States without bringing any visible benefits to anyone concerned.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can only welcome such an objective, which is doubly desirable, both from the economic and the ecological point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we are against total liberalisation of the railways in the form recommended. We do not want to have a single model imposed on us!</p>
<p class="contents">Railway transport in France is a precious public service, a real tool for regional planning in the broad sense of the term, above all, from the rural point of view. The model of the French railways is also a factor in social cohesion. In fact, it is perfectly normal to maintain services to unprofitable stations by funding them from much more profitable stations. That is why, as a French member of the EDD Group, I feel it is important to defend the notion of a public service in this procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, absolute and compulsory liberalisation of the railway infrastructure might hamper the development of the Community railways as a result, for example, of the instability and uncertainty which it would introduce into a market which needs a high level of technical expertise and investment both for the railway undertakings and the local authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would remind you that, as a Member for the EDD Group, I support maintaining employment and social cohesion, especially in rural areas, in order to safeguard activities. It is even more important to ensure that the public services provided in our villages do not disappear. If the railways are liberalised, we can kiss rural life goodbye, which is why we are opposed to this blind liberalisation and its consequences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The heavy goods traffic on the roads creates problems in the form of congestion, noise and emissions of environmentally harmful substances. In order to curb this development, goods transported by road ought to be transferred to the railways. However, the system that we have in Europe today with fifteen separate railway systems makes it impossible for railway traffic to compete on the same terms as road traffic. Therefore, the railways in the EU need to be liberalised and the market for the transportation of goods by rail needs to be opened up.</p>
<p class="contents">The members of the Swedish Social Democratic Party, Pierre Schori, Anneli Hulthén, Jan Andersson, Maj-Britt Theorin, Göran Färm and Ewa Hedkvist Petersen would like to stress the following points of view in connection with the consideration of Mr Jarzembowski's and Mr Swoboda's draft recommendations for second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most important measures for reducing the competitive disadvantages faced by the railways is to separate those responsible for the infrastructure from the transport firms. Such a separation must be effected as quickly as possible, as it is a prerequisite for different transport firms being able to compete with each other on the same terms as apply within other forms of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Fair competition also requires rail fees to be based on the principal of marginal costs. The fees must be based on the traffic-related costs arising during transportation in connection with, for example, noise, effects on the environment, risks of accidents etc. The aim is to create a system of fees that is neutral with regard to competition and does not discriminate against any form of transport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In fact, having been contacted regularly by students who have come up against the recognition system introduced in the 1989 and 1992 directives, I would say without exaggeration that the situation is desperate.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not realise just how obscure the mechanisms are. Total legal insecurity is the overriding feature in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Too many students come up against a brick wall when they apply to administrations in the Member States to obtain validation, precious validation, of their qualifications. This is mainly because it is difficult to identify which department they need to address, but it is also because the staff in these departments have insufficient training to meet their demands. As a result, they are sent from one department to another, which of course slows down the whole procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">All too often they meet unsubstantiated refusal, putting them in an absolutely intolerable situation which prevents them from accessing the job market in another Member State. As a matter of principle, this is a flagrant violation of their freedom of movement. In human terms, these people are denied the right to exercise their profession, thereby negating all the effort which they have put into obtaining their professional qualifications in the first place.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the problem of the cost of the recognition procedure, which appears to me to be far too high.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore delighted that steps are finally being taken which will allow the theoretical freedom of movement of persons to be translated into practice, albeit still far from perfect practice!</p>
<p class="contents">Specifically, the proposal for a directive contains a number of welcome provisions clarifying existing legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, provision is made for host states to take account of experience acquired by interested parties after they obtained their diploma and they can no longer demand compensatory measures (aptitude test) as a matter of course. A new provision also allows the required two years professional experience to be avoided. What is also needed is to provide legal security with regard to the recognition of training obtained by Community nationals in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament proposed numerous other provisions at first reading, mainly seeking to extend the information requirements of the Member States. The Council rejected all our proposed amendments. That demonstrates and says a lot about the lack of political will in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Parliament has not even had the opportunity to discuss or amend this agreement. A government which keeps information from its citizens is unreliable but a government which does not even take its own parliamentarians seriously is not ready for democracy yet. </p>

This is a fundamental requirement if we are really to take our job of scrutinising the Commission’s actions seriously. I fear that this framework agreement will basically perpetuate the policy of inadequate transparency that we have seen in recent years, instead of seizing a genuine opportunity and finally attempting to do justice to our remit by ensuring greater transparency and preventing the Commission from continuing to take refuge behind confidential documents.

Nevertheless, like 145 other Members, especially those who are members of the SOS Democracy intergroup, I did not vote, for two reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">First, Annex 3, which restricts the transmission of confidential information to the European Parliament, represents a step backwards in comparison with the current situation. It is true that the European Parliament cannot always be relied on when it comes to questions of confidentiality. But, conversely, the Commission may use these provisions to cloud delicate questions relating to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, and more importantly, the framework agreement makes absolutely no mention of the fundamental issue of the policy governing relations between the Commission and journalists of its liking. Documents should not normally be given to the press before being sent to the Council and Parliament. But this is a far cry from what actually happens. We frequently read in the newspapers about Commission proposals which, officially, are still confidential. This puts Members in the ridiculous position of having to comment on texts which they know nothing about.</p>
<p class="contents">These incidents are no accident. This is a deliberate policy on the part of the Commission to win journalists’ favour by leaking texts to those who qualify as friends, so that they can benefit from them. Anyone not on the list of friends goes to press a week later and therefore appears not to be at the cutting edge, which is obviously very bad for them. So, logically, everyone tries to please the Commission in order to get on its list of friends. This is one of the ways in which the Commission keeps everyone under control.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, a framework agreement which wanted a minimum code of conduct would have needed to clearly prohibit the Commission from leaking documents to journalists before sending them to members and would have needed to make provision for officials guilty of infringing this rule to be punished. With no such provisions, we feel that the Commission's good resolutions on transparency are seriously misleading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Article 276 of the Treaty states that the Commission should submit all the necessary information to Parliament in connection with the discharge procedure. The framework agreement restricts this provision. According to the framework agreement, it is only the Conference of Presidents, Parliament’s President and the chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control who can ask the Commission for information. Rapporteurs and ‘ordinary’ MEPs can therefore be denied access to information. </p>
<p class="contents">From a political point of view, it is unacceptable that the chairman of the Committee should be able to decide which information can be passed on. It is also problematic from a legal point of view because, according to Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, liability is delegated to the rapporteur. From a practical point of view, it will lengthen the discharge procedure. According to the framework agreement, Parliament and the Commission are to come to an agreement as to which documents are to be handed over. It is unreasonable, however, that the Commission (which is to be supervised) should be involved in deciding which information is to be made available. Moreover, the procedures governing confidential documents are very protracted and may be misused by the Commission to avoid making information available. We hope that a better agreement will successfully be reached regarding the provision of information as an integral part of the discharge procedure. In its present form, the agreement constitutes a restriction on Parliament’s right to information, as guaranteed under the Treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to be able to make a well-founded decision, Parliament needs the information that it considers to be necessary. The way the framework agreement, and in particular Annex 3, is worded, it gives the Commission the final decision in any dispute as to whether a document shall be handed over to Parliament or not. It is completely unacceptable that the body that is to be inspected should make its own decision as to what information the inspector is to have. </p>
<p class="contents">We consider this agreement to contravene Article 276 of the Treaty which clearly stipulates that Parliament shall have access to the information it requires. The agreement also applies to other areas of cooperation with the Commission, and in these areas, too, there are retrograde steps in relation to promises that were previously made.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards information on international agreements, there had been a step forward in this area before the governments of the Member States intervened and changed the text for the worse. Even the Nordic governments have supported a change for the worse that has now resulted in Member States not even needing to give reasons why they do not want the Commission to pass on documents that they themselves have given to the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The vote on this issue will be held during the July part-session, but Members of Parliament will not be given the opportunity to discuss it or to table any amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Without any more detailed examination or discussion within the groups, the group chairmen have adopted this framework agreement which transfers the power of decision over which documents Parliament shall have access to the Commission. This means that the elected representatives will not obtain any real insight into the legislative proceedings, but will be left in the background or on the sidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">The group chairmen unanimously requested the Commission to grant the Members of Parliament the legal right of access to the documents which are issued in other connections. On 8 June, however, they accepted that Mr Prodi would not fulfil all the promises he made when he took office.</p>
<p class="contents">As Members of Parliament, we ought to have the legal right to complete information.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there may be justifiable exceptions that must be respected. There is no doubt that the Commission, as an executive body, is fully within its rights to investigate different points of view and prepare drafts in the form of internal working documents without the obligation to publish them. However, it ought to be beyond all doubt that, at the same time as a document is given to someone outside the Commission, Parliament should have the right to the same information.</p>
<p class="contents">If a newspaper publishes material from documents that have been leaked, Members of Parliament cannot get access to the documents in question. Trainees at the Council of Ministers or at the offices of the Permanent Representations of the Member States have access to documents which Members of Parliament have no opportunity to consult, not even the committee and group chairmen or the rapporteurs.</p>
<p class="contents">When Romano Prodi visited Parliament last spring to introduce himself before the present Commission was installed in office, he promised that Members of Parliament would have access to documents if they were passed on to authorities or organisations outside the Commission or leaked to the media.</p>
<p class="contents">Because the framework agreement involves certain improvements upon current practice, it should not be rejected in its entirety. It should, however, at least contain the promises Mr Prodi made on behalf of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The closed door policy is unacceptable to the public, the elected representatives and journalists alike. Members of Parliament must fight for their rights as elected representatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has just refused to set up a committee of inquiry into the ‘Echelon’ surveillance system set up by the United States, a worldwide system which violates civil liberties, distorts economic competition and attacks the basic interests of the countries of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In return, Parliament has appeased its conscience by adopting a greatly watered down procedure, a temporary committee which, under the terms of our Rules of Procedure, will have far fewer investigative powers than a committee of inquiry. And, in order to be really sure that it will be ineffectual, Parliament has drowned its mandate in vast questions such as risks from secret services in general to individual rights or the value of the protection offered by coding to the private lives of our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">And yet, 172 Members – including us – took the initiative and called for a vote in favour of a committee of inquiry; however, the Conference of Presidents, under the influence of the Socialists and Christian Democrats, is taking its orders from someone – I certainly do not know who – who has managed to run this procedure off the pitch. This attitude contrasts with that of the French public prosecutor, who recently and courageously instructed our security service to investigate the Echelon network. For us, this illustrates the fact that, despite its proclamations, the European Parliament, cut off as it is from the people, is the weak link in the chain of civil protection and bends too easily under pressure from foreign interests.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I should like to reiterate what I called for in my intervention on 30 March, i.e. that the ‘Echelon’ network should be neutralised or, if it is felt that it has a part to play in the fight against organised crime, its remit should be divided between the countries or entrusted to a properly controlled international organisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It has been established from and confirmed by numerous sources that this wholesale bugging of all telephone signals has had considerable economic and commercial repercussions, to the detriment of European companies such as Alcatel or Airbus, which have lost huge contracts to American multinationals privy to privileged information obtained fraudulently and illegally.</p>

<p class="contents">Luckily, we still have sovereign states in Europe to defend European interests, states with sovereign justice which can unilaterally open an investigation into the activities of this network, a leftover from the Cold War which has now been turned into an industrial spy tool at the expense of certain companies and certain Member States in the European Union. Clearly, for the majority in this House, transparency and the fight against distortion of competition are the stuff of words, not deeds. I hope that other Member States will follow France's example.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a crying shame that the Conference of Presidents has decided, at the instigation of its Socialist and Christian Democrat majority, to put the lid on an important debate. It is likewise a crying shame that the President of our Parliament, Mrs Nicole Fontaine, felt compelled to prevent the chairman of the Group of the Greens, Mr Paul Lannoye, from reminding the House of the huge difference between a temporary committee of inquiry and a temporary committee before the vote: the first is a serious investigative tool, as the parliamentary committee of enquiry into the mad cow crisis demonstrated; the second is merely a smokescreen and will not brook any investigation into the Echelon installations located in several Anglo-Saxon Member States, including Great Britain and Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">If ever we needed a clear illustration of the fact that real European interests are best defended by fully sovereign, resolute Member States, rather than by an assembly which is cut off from the people and indifferent to the threats to which they are exposed, then the European Parliament's dodging of the debate on the Echelon global spy system is it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Lehne and the entire group for the work they have done. The document is very sound and strikes a fine balance. The Green Group as well as the regionalists have voted in favour of this report because it is an instrument for fighting laundering practices, and fighting money laundering is the best way to tackle organised crime. </p>
<p class="contents">The 1991 directive confined itself to examining money laundering practices with regard to drugs money. But organised crime embraces a great deal more. Hopefully, the proposals submitted by the rapporteur will open up the possibility of adopting a forceful approach in the fight against organised crime, such as trafficking in people and smuggling, but also fraud and corruption in the art trade. It is important that the exchange of information should be compulsory and we also set great store by the fact that a standard set of rules will be imposed on Member States and candidate countries in the fight against money laundering, thus guaranteeing minimum measures. The rapporteur also states, by way of justification, that the new directive provides for the possibility of requiring proof of identity from estate agents, notaries, external accountants and legal consultants, unless they represent their clients in legal proceedings or provide legal advice. This report can be used as a basis for further action. Our Group welcomes it with open arms, and I do not think that organised crime will receive this report with too much enthusiasm. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This directive was in serious need of revision in order to adapt it to the new international economic and financial climate.</p>
<p class="contents">France, which is a key figure in the fight against this scourge, has clearly indicated that it intends to make this issue a priority item on the European Union's working agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Just a few figures suffice to substantiate this position. Money laundering accounts for between 2% and 5% of the world's GDP each year. This phenomenon is now a threat of the first order. Financial crime has adapted to the globalisation of the international economy and now has two overriding features: more and more complex techniques are being used to launder dirty money and criminal financial flows are being internationalised. </p>
<p class="contents">Discussions have been reopened at international level with a view to proposing effective new measures to fight this scourge. As a result, a United Nations seminar on the prevention of crime and criminal justice was held in France in April last year in order to discuss the fight against international financial corruption circuits. This seminar culminated in the ‘Bercy recommendations’. This action is being relayed through work undertaken in the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) and the financial stability forum.</p>
<p class="contents">At European level, the European Parliament has been calling for the 1991 directive to be updated since 1996. The European Commission's proposals follow on directly from the proposals made at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the list of offences needs to be extended. Money laundering as defined in the directive should no longer apply solely to the proceeds from drug trafficking, it should also apply to activities linked with organised crime, such as fraud, corruption and any other illegal activity which affects the financial interests of the European Communities.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the obligations imposed by the directive have been extended unreservedly to various non-financial activities and professions, such as auditors and accountants, estate agents, traders in precious stones and metals, money carriers, managers, owners and directors of casinos. They also apply to notaries and other independent members of the legal profession engaged in activities which involve a high risk of money laundering.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea is to ensure that the parties concerned identify new clients and store documents and evidence. Credit institutions and financial institutions are required to cooperate with the authorities; in other words, banking secrecy is lifted where there is any suspicion of money laundering.</p>
<p class="contents">I have therefore voted in favour of this directive, which forms part of the general action plan to fight organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to close by stressing the need for the debate on tax havens to culminate quickly in specific measures to dismantle them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The great advantage of this directive was that its adoption led to all the Member States declaring money laundering an offence subject to criminal prosecution. By virtue of its overall preventive effect, it has helped to protect the financial system by discouraging those who might be interested in money laundering from exploiting the financial system to that end, by obliging credit and financial institutions to inform the relevant authorities of anything which might indicate money laundering.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of widening the directive’s scope in this way is to reinforce efforts to combat potential money laundering outside the traditional financial sector. The directive, which applied to various financial sectors, including banks, insurance companies, and so forth, is to be extended to other non-financial activities and professions which are nevertheless extremely vulnerable to money laundering. In the case of lawyers, there are to be clear safeguards, particularly as regards maintaining the right of confidentiality. The fact of the matter is that although there is an awareness of the enormous impact of money laundering and other forms of corruption, it is necessary to safeguard our citizens’ right to legal advice and assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is also intended to extend the list of defined offences. In addition to income from drug trafficking, it is also necessary to include activities associated with organised crime, and we need to find a uniform definition of organised crime not just at European level but also at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">Efforts to approve definitions, types of crime and common sanctions with a view to harmonising criminal law are intended first and foremost to apply to particularly important areas such as money laundering. Because the world is becoming ever more sophisticated, many organised crime syndicates can take advantage of legal loopholes and differences between legislation in the Member States to exploit anomalies between the various systems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Each of us I am sure would wish to see action being taken to tackle the proceeds of cross-border crime and money laundering. This directive will go some way to linking cooperation and exchanges of information, as well as extending the scope and range of the offences.</p>
<p class="contents">In Ireland, where there is already existing legislation, the Criminal Justice Act 1994 is presently being updated to take into account some of the proposals contained in this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst I voted in favour of the report, I must confess to having some disquiet with regard to two aspects contained within it.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the continuing attempt to create a European Public Prosecutor's office, is something which I am resolutely opposed to. We already have at our disposal many agencies at a national level, which are most efficient and which are able to deal with the vast majority of cases – and also the Court of Auditors, OLAF and other departments to deal with these issues at a European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the new disclosures requirements on lawyers, I believe, would seriously undermine the long established precedent of lawyer/client confidentiality. We must not interfere with the rights of individuals to a fair defence, trial, or prejudice the doctrine of presumed innocence.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in spite of these concerns, which I hope to alter by amendment later via the legislative process, I vote in favour.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, the proposal for a directive is not without its controversial aspects, particularly in so far as it undermines professional secrecy in certain sectors, notably the legal profession, whilst failing to impose a corresponding obligation to declare suspicious activities relating to high-value business transactions on professionals such as those selling luxury items, auctioneers, customs officials and so on. The rapporteur of this European Parliament report accordingly puts forward certain approaches which are slightly different to those contained in the proposal for a directive, but he basically supports it.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, one important and central issue, that is the growing liberalisation of financial markets and movements of capital, is not addressed, which means that the practical effects of this liberalisation will continue to be weakened.

<p class="contents">We all agree on the need – and Parliament has called on several occasions – for a review of the 1991 directive, which already goes much further than the 40 recommendations made by the FATF in 1996 and which has been applied successfully by the Member States. But those responsible for money laundering are highly ingenious when it comes to finding ways of disguising the criminal origins of their money, which is why it has been proposed not just to update the directive but also to extend its scope.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out the following so that we avoid using a sledgehammer to crack a nut by succumbing to the risk of making the scope of the directive so vast that it becomes ineffectual. That is why the criminal activities associated with the concept of money laundering need to be very clearly defined, in order to prevent the requirements of the directive from being extended to fraudulent activities in general in relation to money circulating legitimately in the financial system. We must not forget that the Member States have their own national laws for dealing with such offences. <span class="italic">Subsidiarité oblige!</span></p>
<p class="contents">As for extending the obligations imposed by the directive to certain non-financial activities and professions, especially to members of the legal profession, we must not infringe the right of clients to professional confidentiality, the right of clients to access the justice system and the right not to incriminate themselves and, finally, the confidential role of lawyers in preventing crime.</p>
<p class="contents">As several French Socialist Members have claimed the right during the debate on the fight against money laundering to put certain countries in the hot seat, including mine, on the basis of an erroneous, approximate and aberrant appraisal of the practices of Luxembourg as a financial centre and the Luxembourg political powers, I am anxious to refute here in the House, and as vigorously as our Prime Minister and the chairmen of the finance, budget and legal committees of the Chamber of Deputies of the Grand Duchy have done, the allegations which the French Socialist Members have become guilty of during their so-called ‘assault course’ against dirty money.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who feel the urge to denounce the black sheep in the fight against money laundering and put pressure on tax havens should go right ahead; but they should at least exert pressure on those who really baulk at helping in the fight against money laundering and, more importantly, they should refrain from automatically classifying countries which respect banking secrecy as ‘turntables for dirty money’.</p>
<p class="contents">You do not need banking secrecy in order to become a turntable for dirty money. The proof is that the Russian mafia tried to invest its dirty money in several European financial centres before deciding on New York, which does not recognise banking secrecy. This proves that abolishing banking secrecy is no guarantee of protection against the ravages of drug trafficking, organised crime and corruption and we would do well to remember that! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is important that an advocate/lawyer should not be covered by the reporting obligation when he/she represents a client in a case. However, it is more difficult to determine in which situations a lawyer/advocate shall be subject to the reporting obligation when he/she has access to relevant information in relation to so-called legal advice.

The tightening up of the visa requirements that has been carried out over the last few years has unavoidably led to more cases of people smuggling and to an increase in so-called illegal immigration to the Member States of the EU. The people who have been smuggled in, or have found their way into the European Union in some other way, have often suffered terrible tragedies on the way here. Once they have arrived in the EU, they are completely lacking in rights and social protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The list of countries whose citizens require a visa for entry into the EU contains more than 130 countries. There are not even as many as 50 countries among the states whose citizens are exempt from the requirement for a visa. This practice, i.e. of having the requirement for a visa as the rule rather than the exception, is not worthy of a democratic Europe. The basic rule must be that people have the right to enter the EU freely, not the opposite.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe needs to change its attitude to immigration. Within the next few years there will be an acute labour shortage in the EU. It is therefore important that we recognise and welcome people who are seeking a better future in the EU’s Member States. A more generous visa policy is also a prerequisite for pursuing a common and humane refugee and asylum policy. By means of a policy that affirms the value of immigration, we can put a stop to the organised crime and the human tragedies that people smuggling is to blame for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First, we feel that it fails to make a distinction between the debate on the 2001 budget and the debate on the revision of the financial perspectives, which we refuse to revise. Who could forget the circumstances under which the financial perspectives were drawn up at the Berlin summit. No French delegation from the European Parliament could possibly question the compromise which resulted from the difficult negotiations in March 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">A revision appears to be even less in order now that the European Union has opted, having itself bombed Serbia, to cut off any Community aid to it. We therefore need to subtract EUR 2.3 billion from the 5.5 billion announced by Mr Prodi for the reconstruction of the Balkans from 2000-2006. The situation then appears to be quite manageable: there is enough money, the financial perspectives do not need to be revised and nor does the ceiling on the agricultural line need to be lowered. As far as the figures announced by Romano Prodi last November are concerned, the Commission may take them back today, it knows full well that these sums are not, alas, based on an accurate analysis of the region's needs and, in its own words, it is a ‘political’ sum which, by the way, has never been approved either by Parliament or, more importantly, by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore possible to find a substantial sum of money for the Balkans without revising the financial perspectives. The fact that we have seen a chronic surplus of over EUR 3 billion at the end of the year demonstrates that the sum of appropriations voted for does not correspond to real needs, whilst it is possible to make substantial savings as the result of the patent under-implementation of certain programmes. This surplus also shows that it is better for efforts in the Balkans to be funded in part by redeploying appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">We also reject Mrs Haug's report for its proposals on the Union's special envoys. This is, in fact, tantamount to a reduction of what still comes under the intergovernmental conference for the benefit of Community integration. The Amsterdam Treaty, which we fought against, states that, as of this year, the administrative costs of the CSFP will come under the Council, while operational expenditure will be financed from chapter B8 under heading 4.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we refuse the differentiated appropriations for rural development which the resolution appears to recommend because this would inevitably create difficulties in settling payments. We would simply remind the House that the agricultural guideline still applies, the ceiling decided at Berlin notwithstanding.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the ceiling is reached if you add market expenditure (1A), rural development (1B) and pre-accession agricultural expenditure, to accept differentiated appropriations for rural development is to run the risk of having the Commission propose substantial commitment appropriations and far fewer payment appropriations, to the detriment of our farmers yet again, and this we cannot accept. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Estimates show that a significant surplus will be available in the agricultural budget under heading 1a. As a great part of the programme for reconstruction of the Western Balkans is still not financed, we believe that it would be wise to transfer part of this surplus to heading 4 in the budget, should a revision of the financial perspectives become necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">The reconstruction of the Western Balkans is on top of our political agenda. It is also one of the most important tasks for the European Union in the coming years. We agree with the intention of the Haug report that the financing problem cannot be solved only by redeployment in the Union's existing priorities in external policy. Funds must be found elsewhere, but this does not necessarily create a need for ‘fresh money’ from the Member States. Since a significant surplus will be available in the budget for agriculture, a reduction of the ceiling in heading 1a in favour of an increase of the budget for external policy would be a reasonable solution.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In view of this we fundamentally and above all reject the prospect of cuts in the cooperation policy, as implied in the Commission’s preliminary draft. The same applies to the cuts they propose in the areas of employment and the environment. In the same way, we reject the cut of EUR 300 million for agriculture. Indeed, as regards agriculture, we believe that it is vital to set up a fund to tackle the enormous problems in the primary sector.</p>

<p class="contents">First of all, I wanted to vote against Amendment No 11. It was purely a mistake that I voted in favour of that amendment, since any amendments to the Commission proposal were very bad and endanger the whole procedure of getting the safe harbour agreement enforced.</p>
<p class="contents">We have negotiated with our US counterparts for over two years. We had a very good compromise but now the work here in the European Parliament means that European consumers and citizens have to wait until the new compromise proposal is made. It is not certain that the new compromise proposal will be as good as this was. We are now going backwards. I voted against the committee proposal along with other members of my Group. We are all very sorry that we have to wait for this agreement to come into force.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am therefore summing up the key points during the explanations of vote.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the rapporteur’s concerns that this proposal does not provide Europe’s citizens with an appropriate level of protection as regards transferring and processing personal data relating to them, especially if we take into account the protection they are guaranteed under the European directive on data protection.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we all know that at present data is already being circulated in practice, but in an unregulated way. So while the safe harbour principle may not be an ideal solution to this problem, it will at least impose a certain number of rules and will be a way of preventing abuse.</p>
<p class="contents">Work has progressed on attempting to reconcile two differing approaches, namely our own legislation-based system, in which compliance with legal restrictions on obtaining and using personal data is ensured by the public authorities, and the Americans’ preference for self-regulation. </p>
<p class="contents">The agreement reached represents a limited step forward as far as the guarantees involved are concerned, but it is positive in terms of what it offers for the future by way of security. We accordingly support the position adopted in the Paciotti report with the amendments tabled by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">- It will still be possible, even with the ‘safe harbour’ agreement in place, to find ways of getting round it and selling clients’ data to third parties without having to obtain the client’s consent.</p>
<p class="contents">- Even if the agreement succeeds in defining vague data protection standards, it is not clear precisely what action will be taken when companies violate these standards. Will it be possible to take them to court? Will they have to pay compensation?</p>
<p class="contents">- The question as to how far EU citizens will actually be able to assert the rights laid down for their benefit in the ‘safe harbour’ agreement remains unanswered, particularly as the court of jurisdiction for the US companies is in the USA and so they have a natural advantage over individual EU citizens. </p>
<p class="contents">That said, I still subscribe to the report because, as matters stand, there are no provisions whatsoever for guaranteeing EU data protection standards in the exchange of data with other continents. The ‘safe harbour’ scheme does at least represent an attempt to guarantee data protection beyond EU borders.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The application of technological innovations, especially the innovations made during the impressive and rapid development of the information society, will cut right through the fabric of society. The dangers of misuse which lie in ambush behind the huge potential which is developing should encourage and oblige us to be vigilant when it comes to ensuring that the human factor and respect for citizens' fundamental rights and freedoms come first.</p>
<p class="contents">New applications and technology cannot be stopped, but nor should they be allowed to develop with no regard for man and his needs, and under no circumstances should they be used to undermine political values and human dignity or to attack basic and inalienable rights such as the sanctity of privacy and personal data.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals and policies for electronic commerce and the measures being promoted to support it are coloured by the totally one-dimensional perception of profit and competitiveness. This policy is being driven by the huge and constantly inflating sums of money being invested in and thrown at e-commerce in order to serve the needs of the big multinationals in the sector and remove any obstacles which prevent them from adapting as quickly as possible to the rapid developments on this market and acquiring huge, fast profits and influence.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed Community model behind the EU's texts and proposals is supported by and vigorously supports unadulterated competition and unbridled, excessive profit. This perception is not a guarantee for, it is a blatant threat to the future of society and mankind: uncertainty, insecurity, a breach with man's own needs, categorisation of citizens and workers who will no longer shape their environment but will be shaped by it in order to serve those who define it in the best, fastest and cheapest way possible.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as we can see, the term “adequate protection” as used in the report means the continuous and arbitrary definition and distortion of the concept of the protection of personal data, given that sanctions and compensation for breaching doors which are already wide open are advocated as deterrents and safety valves. Personal data on EU citizens is already circulating in third countries, without any fundamental control; in fact we barely even know the extent of the arbitrary acts already committed. Knowing as we do from the Echelon interception system that every form of democratic control is being flagrantly violated from without or from a distance, knowing that American multinationals are engaged in wholesale monitoring and spying at the expense of European undertakings and the economic, social, political and cultural activities of the Member States and the private life of the Union citizens as a whole, it is slightly hypocritical of us to approach this huge issue in stockinged feet with our prayer-book in hand.</p>
<p class="contents">The current protective framework and the proposed standard contractual clauses are inadequate in the extreme, riddled with holes and inefficient. You cannot appeal to good intentions for doleful competition and a profit monocracy. We would only dare call the snake pit of unaccountable monopolies which find it easy to spring up, spread and act with impunity in cyberspace ‘safe harbours’ euphemistically. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
