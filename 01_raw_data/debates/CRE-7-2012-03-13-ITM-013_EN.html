I would like to welcome Commissioners Kallas, Barnier and Andor. The specific topic for Question Time is the role of the European Union in stimulating the competitiveness of the economies of the 27 Member States. I will interpret this topic as widely as possible, but I would warn you that if your question is completely off topic and, for example, deals with the common agricultural policy, you are liable to be cut off.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you of the ground rules. Questions are taken exclusively on a catch-the-eye basis. Each Member has one minute to put his or her question, and 30 seconds to put a supplementary. The Commissioner has two minutes to reply if only one Commissioner is to be responsible for answering, and, if more than one Commissioner is to reply, each Commissioner has one minute’s speaking time.</p>
<p class="contents">It says catch-the-eye but, in fact, I am blind, so the people next to me are the ones who are catching the eye. We will now begin with those who have already indicated they want to put a question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Just recently, as I am sure you know, the Troika’s latest report on the second round of economic reforms in Greece was released. There is a passage on page 36 of the report which refers to employment in the public sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The report says that the government has stated its commitment to reducing the public sector and employment by at least 150 000 between 2010 and 2015. In order to achieve this target, it is expected to apply strictly the existing rule between incoming and outgoing staff, reduce employment contracts and transfer 15 000 to the reserve for surplus staff prior to their dismissal.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask you directly, given that the Commission was also involved in drafting this report: is it calling for the dismissal of workers from the public sector in Greece this year as one of the measures to develop its competitiveness? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We can, of course, discuss various aspects of this experience in the Greek context and also in the wider European context which, in recent months, shows signs of sliding back into a kind of recession, at least in the majority of the Member States, but it is definitely a very difficult time for the ‘programme countries’.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the key is to restore financial stability, to ensure that, after the adjustment period, there will be a return to stable financing of the real economy and then to ensure that even in such times, there is investment, and this is what the taskforce in Greece is working on.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently, just a couple of weeks ago, we had an opportunity to meet Mr Papademos in Brussels together with the President of the Commission and some eight Commissioners working in the Greek context. We are doing our utmost to ensure that Structural Funds continue to flow and the reforms that are implemented will result in the Greek economy regaining its competitiveness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As far as Greece is concerned, we are dealing with an exceptional situation that has justified exceptional measures. At the same time, the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund have played their part, as have the Greek authorities, by agreeing together to extremely tough measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add this question, Mr Papanikolaou, to the debate that we are going to have during this Question Time on the issue of growth and competitiveness. Exceptional measures have had to be taken to get out of an exceptionally serious situation and that requires the efforts of everyone, in particular, the Greek people. I am confident that your country has real assets, with its tourism economy, which is one of the most powerful in Europe thanks to its natural, cultural and historical heritage, its extremely powerful maritime economy and its extremely important agricultural capacity. Therefore – and we will talk about this shortly – although the internal market, which is the open area for the Greek economy, functions well, I think that your country must play its part and fulfil its role in that internal market, rediscovering there the foundations for reviving its growth and its job market. That is why the Greek case, like that of other countries, is linked to what we must do to relaunch growth, employment and competitiveness within the internal market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Greek economy has lots of capacities and potential, and the Greek people are actually very hard-working – we know that from the labour statistics – but the point is that this unsustainable financial situation was also partly due to the fact that too many people were employed, in an inefficient way, in the public sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Restructuring has to take place. The efficiency and the effectiveness of public administration has to improve, partly to run the economy and the public sector as such, but also to ensure that the European assistance provided through Structural Funds can be used in a more efficient way. We have made much progress in this area. The European Social Fund was not implemented very well in earlier years, but in the last year, we have managed to double the ESF absorption rate, which not only directly helps job creation and promotes enterprise, but also helps to implement administrative reform.</p>

<p class="contents">That is our goal with the Single Market Act and that is why, Mr Cancian, we have identified, in the 12 levers for growth, the communications and the infrastructures that we need for energy, transport and the digital sector. That is also why the time will come – very soon, I hope – when the governments will be ready to accept project bonds because the aim is clearly to invest massively, together, in communication infrastructures.</p>
<p class="contents">You also asked me, perhaps with reference to my responsibility, about the infrastructures of financial companies. Financial infrastructures are one of the conditions of growth. Everything that we have been doing with you for the past two years to re-establish rules, transparency, responsibility – I would also add here morals, where they had disappeared – and to get the financial services to work for the real economy and the financial infrastructures to function on sound, solid bases are also preconditions for restoring confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">That is precisely what we are doing now. I want to remind the European Parliament that, as I speak, we have given you virtually all of the texts needed to establish the regulation requested by the G20. Now you just need to take the democratic time to adopt these texts with the Council. I hope that in a few months, we will have clearly built this basis for sound, solid financial infrastructures in order to get the financial markets working for the real economy rather than for their own benefit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Naturally, as part of that agenda – which I did not invent as it came from the G20 – decisions were taken before I joined the European Commission on Basel for the banks, on Solvency for insurance, and on the revision of the Pension Funds Directive. It is my job, with you and the Council of Ministers, to put this agenda in place as intelligently and speedily as possible, without improvising. This is true for the measures you are referring to and for all of the measures affecting the 8 300 European banks. I am therefore happy to continue the dialogue with you and with the rapporteurs you mentioned. My texts are on the table. I tried to draft them as precisely as possible in all areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I am nevertheless worried, Ms Ford, about the cumulative effect of all of these texts, particularly when they concern three key investment tools: banks, which finance 75% of the economy of European regions, pension funds and insurance companies. I am therefore watching things very closely – indeed, in a few weeks, we are going to be publishing a comprehensive study on the cumulative impact of all of these measures – and I am very keen to safeguard the investment capacity, especially the long-term investment capacity, of these three sectors: insurance, pension funds and banks. However, with regard to the point that you raise, I am, of course, happy to continue the dialogue with the rapporteurs concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As far as insurance is concerned, we are working on the measures for the technical implementation of Solvency. We are also working on pension funds.</p>
<p class="contents">I take a great deal of time, Ms Ford, to listen to everyone. Very recently, I was involved in a major conference on pension funds, which was attended by hundreds of people.

The free movement of workers is indeed not just an attractive European Union freedom, but also a factor increasing European economic competitiveness. Countries to which skilled workers migrate gain a competitive advantage. However, at the same time, the countries left behind by many skilled workers lose competitiveness. Furthermore, there is increased pressure on the sustainability of pension and social security systems. I would like to ask what steps the European Union should take and how the European Commission proposes to balance the benefits that the free movement of workers can provide for the competitiveness of all Member States? Will the European Commission provide for actions to compensate for the losses experienced by countries enduring mass emigration? I asked the Commissioner this a while ago and perhaps, now that some time has passed, there has been a shift forwards.

Our action to promote free movement takes the form of ensuring that the barriers come down. These barriers are of various kinds; while there are still administrative barriers, and issues related to the single market such as the recognition of diplomas, there are also natural barriers linked, for example, to the existence of many different languages, including the 23 official languages. This is also significant, especially if we compare ourselves to the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">However, difficulties also arise in connection with the great imbalances – and uneven wage levels – between various countries, which drive movements of workers from one country to another. This occurs, especially, where regions – or sometimes even countries – are in recession, with high unemployment rates, and people move to countries where there are jobs available.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is important to ensure that there is freedom of movement and that people who arrive in a country are welcome if they come to work. However, we are also working to achieve a more circular form of free movement whereby, after a certain period in the course of which they gain experience and income, people also return to their home country.</p>
<p class="contents">We also want to ensure that such movement becomes more demand-driven, and that people do not just leave their homeland but have a greater awareness of the concrete vacancies that exist. That is why we developed the Vacancy Monitor as part of the Agenda for new skills and jobs. That is also why the forthcoming new initiative on the EURES programme will help develop EURES – which is a great network for advising people who seek work in another Member State – to be more robust and more demand-driven.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in order to fully counterbalance the trend of population and labour movements inside Europe, we obviously have to take cohesion policy very seriously and ensure that more peripheral regions do not remain in stagnation or recession, but regain the potential for economic growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This means that if a service provider wants to go in for social dumping, it can do so. However, if the trade unions call a strike to oppose this, they must first ask themselves whether this could cause damage to the service provider. As a result, the right to strike will be significantly restricted. The question I have is: can you explain to me what the benefits of a Monti II Regulation of this kind will be?

<p class="contents">We are working together to implement an agenda that you are familiar with because several EP committees – particularly the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, but others, too – actively participated in it with rapporteurs. The Single Market Act contains 12 levers for growth, including one on social cohesion and another on services. The 12 key proposals include the text that my colleague and friend, Mr Andor, just mentioned in relation to the posting of workers.</p>
<p class="contents">I just want to say, in general, that that is how we are working on the implementation of this first phase of the Single Market Act and how we are preparing – as President Barroso said this morning – for the second phase, scheduled for autumn, involving 12 new supporting proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Each of them – and we had made this commitment to a number of Members of this House and this House itself – is examined from the point of view of its social impact. Each of these measures must, Ms Schroedter, respect the collective and individual rights of workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in general, I, personally, together with my colleagues and Mr Andor in particular, have ensured that this agenda is built on the foundations of a competitive social market economy: competitive, social, market, economy. The four words are important; not just one, two or three of them, but all four.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, in the new phase of the Single Market Act, and when implementing the current measures, I will ensure that we safeguard the balance that you can see clearly in the 12 levers for growth that we have identified and on which we are working. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some Member States, having survived the sudden economic collapse at the outbreak of the global economic crisis, have returned to a path of growth, while others are still unable to cope with the debt problem. Does the Commission analyse the cases of Member States that are emerging from the crisis, so that other countries can take advantage of their experience? What steps is the Commission planning on taking to ensure that austerity measures are combined with measures stimulating growth and employment? Last week, Commissioner Andor participated in a public hearing of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) which I organised, where one of the topics discussed was the role of social investment in emerging from the crisis. How does the Commission assess the role played by social investment in returning to a path of economic growth in Europe? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need to find a good balance in terms of what we are doing in each country, with a great deal of courage on the part of the governments, in order to control public finances, sort out the budgets and reduce the current deficits or debts, which will be the taxes for our children. Along with the collective measures that we are putting in place with your support, with the ‘six-pack’ and soon the new fiscal treaty, we need to ensure that there is good management in Europe and good management in each country, while ensuring that these measures, which are all rigorous, do not curb growth.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, it is time to develop a European growth initiative and to implement together, in a proactive plan, short-term measures, such as those taken or currently being taken to revitalise the interbank sector – and that was the very important role of the European Central Bank and the European Investment Bank – the targeted reallocation of the Structural Funds and the project bonds that Mr Kallas mentioned a few moments ago. Those are short-term measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there are the medium-term measures, for which we need time to adopt the texts. They form the ecosystem that we are creating together with these 50 measures to support the internal market. They include mobility, investment, innovation and risk capital and, Ms Jazłowiecka, among these measures is the sector that you are talking about and one that is very important, in my view. It is not by chance that it is included in the 12 levers. It is social business, which today accounts for between 15% and 18% of Europe’s employment and GDP. It covers all of the social economy businesses, for which we have already submitted to you the statute for a new financial vehicle: social investment funds. More recently, we have had the Statute for a European Foundation. We are going to continue to support this sector, which is very important, in my view. These are, of course, profitable businesses, but they are also businesses that have a particularly ethical dimension, be it in the composition of their staff, for example, disabled people or trainees, or in the markets that they are trying to capture from a social or environmental perspective. I will therefore continue patiently to develop the measures aimed at facilitating the financial and regulatory aspects and the visibility of this sector of social business. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As you know, the annual growth survey for 2012 highlighted the importance of addressing the social consequences of the crisis, and many recent initiatives, including, for example, the Youth Opportunities Initiative, underline the importance of the European Social Fund in addressing these issues and intervening where it can.</p>

We are learning collectively and individually.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to tell the truth in order to respect the future generations and start again with a more solid foundation. Collectively, we have also taken the right decisions. Now we simply have to do what we said and we will see a more positive spiral beginning to take shape.</p>
<p class="contents">Can we provide budgetary stimulus, Mr Mitchell? You, yourself, are not asking for it. There are no more public funds to use as budgetary stimulus, like we did in the past. However, we can create the conditions to increase confidence through this internal market ecosystem. I am using the word that you used and it is crucial. We know that confidence is one of the keys to growth and, if we are talking about money, I think that we need to ensure that the Structural Funds, which are regional solidarity appropriations that your country receives, like many others, Ms Bilbao Barandica, are as effective as possible. Moreover, having managed that policy, I saw how your country used the Structural Funds successfully in the past for training, small and medium-sized enterprises and research.</p>
<p class="contents">Then – and we will state it for a third time – we have to be courageous and bold enough to implement the Commission’s proposal on project bonds. We can pool a number of future loans on investments needed for the single market, growth and businesses.</p>

Indeed, the European Union has adopted rather ambitious plans to link the trans-European networks and your portfolio is a great credit to you and thanks should go to you personally, but we have a major problem with air transport. A few years ago, a directive was adopted which prevented states from supporting air carriers. This happened. We were forced to privatise, we privatised them and many of these privatised air carriers simply went bankrupt. There is a similar situation in the Baltic region, including Lithuania. We have made a significant investment in a varied tourism strategy and will continue to invest in the future. Do you not feel that we should nevertheless conduct a comprehensive European Union study on the development of air transport in the Baltic region, so that if certain circumstances change in future, we would have very clear conclusions on how to develop air transport in this region and Lithuania? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why – in cooperation with Michel Barnier, who was also part of our efforts to develop sustainable and adequate pensions – we also sought to ensure that, regardless of whether someone is working or retired, there is a guarantee of a decent income level.</p>
<p class="contents">We are maintaining this holistic approach to governance.

We need to take a whole number of measures. And, obviously – as Mr Barnier has already mentioned – a huge number of new regulations are now being unleashed on the financial market. However, small and medium-sized enterprises remain the basic engine of economic growth in Europe and the new financial regulations are, in many cases, also having a negative effect on the granting of credit to those SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">My question is quite specific: what is the Commission going to do to continue to ensure that those SMEs are granted the credit which they need?</p>
<p class="contents">The second question has to do with the internal market. In that context, it is obviously quite clear that TEN-T and the Connecting Europe Facility could play a significant role in encouraging and strengthening the internal transport market. However, it seems to be very difficult to sell this project to Member States and, moreover, there seems to be a great deal of resistance in the Council to the selection of a number of trans-European projects of a cross-border nature.</p>

Indeed, 90% of the economic fabric, 90% of the 22 million European businesses, are small and medium-sized enterprises, sometimes even individual enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore want to confirm our position of two years now. Indeed, I announced it at the very start of my term. We want to bring small and medium-sized enterprises and consumers closer to the single market. For too long, they felt that it was not for them, but for the big and the mighty.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr De Backer, you should have a close look at all of the texts that, with our colleague Mr Tajani in particular, we are presenting or publishing, and at what is contained in the Single Market Act, in particular. In each case, you will find that special attention is paid – sometimes for the first time – to the role of SMEs, their capacity for investment, the ease of their administrative procedures and simplification in order to give European SMEs the best ecosystem.</p>
<p class="contents">I will give you one example: the bank capitalisation measures, since that is the topic you raised and mention was made earlier of where to obtain funding and cash flow. With Mr Tajani, we asked the European Banking Authority if we could go further – more balanced, less rigorous measures – for the banks when they are obliged to apply prudential measures when lending to small and medium-sized enterprises. We are going to maintain this more favourable criterion for SMEs in the prudential measures.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the instrument that we have just presented for risk capital, which is of particular interest to SMEs, we presented a passport, which is currently being debated in Parliament. I am working, notably within the framework of MiFID, on the idea of a European SME grant or a network of European SME grants.</p>
<p class="contents">We have simplified the reporting obligations for SMEs in terms of their accounts when they are listed on the stock market – I am talking here about listed companies – with the simplified prospectus and more straightforward transparency obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made it easier for SMEs to access public contracts by reducing drastically the administrative requirements for participating in calls for tender. In the framework of the Small Business Act, for which Mr Tajani is responsible, we have also monitored very closely all of the measures designed to facilitate investment by and thanks to SMEs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">So there are two parts. I think that the TEN-T maps and TEN-T guidelines will be more or less satisfactory with regard to the trans-European dimension of this project.

You know that we are currently emerging from this difficult crisis and are entering a more positive phase in which we are talking about and working towards growth.</p>
<p class="contents">I am talking about the recommendations put forward on the structural reform and budget cuts, which the Member States will have to follow. Perhaps they could learn from good examples – and there are some in Europe – and focus their efforts on the sectors and areas that encourage growth. I, personally, believe, and I know that Olli Rehn agrees with me, that everything relating to future investments and investment through small and medium-sized enterprises in education, research and training must be safeguarded or encouraged even if additional efforts are required.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the rest, Mr De Backer, we have this whole agenda of supporting measures; some 50 in all that we are putting in place. If you read the Single Market Act carefully, together with the 12 levers for growth and all of the proposals that are before you – at least 20 of them are on the table, with rapporteurs working very hard – you will see very clearly that 80% of them are of interest to SMEs in the ecosystem that we want to create, in which the single market is now an area of opportunities rather than an area of constraints, especially for SMEs. In conclusion, there are many other examples: from the patent to risk capital, from the simplification of accounting standards to the rules on transparency and the prudential measures in the banking sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Why am I asking this? I am asking this because in the previous debate, a fellow Member from the Netherlands said that the Dutch had had enough of employees from Eastern Europe, including Hungary. I must say that we, in turn, have had enough of Dutch and other Western European colonisers. Similarly, we have had enough of the process that started when the European Union lured Hungary into joining it under degrading terms and deceptive promises. This process then went on to become all-out colonisation under names such as the free movement of capital, which, of course, was unidirectional, and the free movement of labour, which, on the other hand, went in the opposite direction.</p>
<p class="contents">It can be called by many names; we call it colonisation. It all continued with Hungary’s being put week after week in the dock, each time for different fabricated charges. This process reached its culmination today when the various finance ministers shamelessly adopted a decision to suspend Cohesion Funds support. Do you believe that after this, you will be able to take over our very own lands as well, when the moratorium expires on 30 April 2014? Tell me, did you ever hear of 1956 and the Hungarian people’s love of freedom?</p>

However, I find it important that we take a level-headed, calm approach to the matter. Vehemence will not lead us to any solutions. At the same time, it is very important to correct the historic overview you gave. After all, the influx of capital to Hungary, for example, began long before the country’s joining the European Union. I suggest that we focus on the present and, in this respect, I find it very important that you understand that the European Commission intends to help Hungary. It intends to help it in regaining investor confidence and more dynamic economic growth, in restoring financial stability and in enabling the government to guide the economy in conformity with European norms and laws.</p>
<p class="contents">This presupposes very close, constructive cooperation. The cooperation has begun and, since early January, the government has expressed in a number of ways its intention to reach an agreement on certain disputed issues. The consultations are under way. It is regrettable that, from time to time, the process is infiltrated by noise that carries unnecessary vehemence and sometimes personal attacks. I do hope that we will be able to resolve all issues under dispute in a constructive manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
