<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span><span class="bold">.</span> – Mr President, industrial change, which can be gradual or sudden, is driven by new technologies, worldwide competition or consumer preferences. It has economic implications and an impact on employment and social cohesion, but it also provides major new opportunities when anticipated, prepared for and managed.</p>
<p class="contents">The acceleration of technological progress and the increasing competitive pressure of globalising markets are pushing companies to rapidly adapt their production and company structures. Companies must be able to anticipate and identify at an early stage what they need to do to ensure the continuity of their activities. Sometimes this calls for mergers of activities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is acutely aware of this situation and of the need for people to feel basic security in difficult times of change. We are convinced that the cornerstone of successful adaptation to change is dialogue at all levels and with full and transparent information as its basis.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had in the recent past different experiences and approaches on how to deal with large-scale operations of corporate restructuring, often affecting the lives of large numbers of European people. In some cases these operations were prepared well in advance, fully involving workers’ representatives, with due care being taken to search for the least damaging solutions. Where necessary, workers likely to be affected were prepared through employability measures to face the challenge of sudden unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">In other cases these operations were launched and implemented with less care and concern for those affected. On every occasion, and as recently as last October in this House, the Commission has highlighted the following basic positions. Firstly, decisions on corporate restructuring remain the prerogative as well as the responsibility of management. This means that, when contemplating actions likely to lead to serious social consequences, job losses for example, companies should always actively search for and choose the least negative and least damaging solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, when dismissals prove to be inevitable, the utmost must be done to reinforce the employability of those concerned. This requires anticipation, timely preparation and careful management of these processes.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, nothing can justify the absence of timely, effective and comprehensive information and consultation of the workers’ and employees’ representatives before such operations are launched or publicly announced. Worker involvement is always, and particularly in the event of corporate restructuring, not only a basic right but a necessary precondition for the social acceptance of such operations. In the end it is also a decisive factor of their success, as no collectivity can survive and prosper without trust, dialogue, partnership and solidarity between its different components.</p>
<p class="contents">These basic ideas meet with a wide consensus in Europe. This is what intelligent restructuring is about. It is more and more rare to see companies embark on damaging restructuring operations ignoring these fundamental concerns, as unfortunately was sometimes the case in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">We have built a wide range of instruments which meet these concerns in recent years in the European Union. We have set minimum requirements at European level, which all Member States and all companies must observe when contemplating job losses, especially when they are massive, or preparing other decisions likely to affect workers. The collective redundancies and transfers of undertakings directive and the European works council directive constitute our legal framework, protecting the workers’ rights and ensuring fair standards in the field of information and consultation at national and transnational level respectively.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the national and/or local level of employee involvement, the Commission wishes to underline again the need for proper information and consultation of employees’ representatives before any redundancies are decided or implemented, as provided for in the collective redundancies directive and in other national provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to recall that it is, in principle, up to national courts to deal with possible violations of these rules, if and when they are brought before them by national representatives. However, even when existing rules or arrangements are formally respected this does not mean that management’s attitude is socially irreprehensible. In fact, the Commission has argued for some time now that the rules we have established are not sufficient to deal with the challenges of today. In a world characterised by permanent change and in the context of high levels of unemployment, the rules in force seem to us to be outdated as they do not allow or promote the key ideas behind our employment strategy and our approach to change, anticipation, risk prevention and employability. That is why in November 1998 the Commission presented a proposal for a directive on worker information and consultation which has since then received your strong support. We thank you for that.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the other branch of the legislative power, the Council, has not yet – more than one year after the presentation of the proposal – begun working on it. I hope that this debate contributes to reminding Member States of the importance and urgent nature of this initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">We have recently heard from the Portuguese Presidency that a serious debate on this proposal will soon be launched.</p>
<p class="contents">The forthcoming French Presidency also seems willing to give this dossier the high priority it deserves. The Commission sincerely hopes that Parliament and the Council quickly finalise this important dossier which constitutes, in our view, the most effective answer to the concerns raised by cases such as the ones which brought us here today.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the transnational level of employee involvement there is some indication that at least in one case the companies may have breached transnational information and consultation agreements which they had concluded with their European workforce. They may have at least exploited some ambiguity in the legal and contractual framework in force. The Commission will contact the relevant national authorities to check this. In any case, I wish to say to those who believe that their rights in that respect were ignored that adequate means of enforcement and redress are available to them, notably through relevant national jurisdictional instances.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware of your request to proceed immediately with a revision of the European Works Council Directive. As recognised in the report, which we will adopt in the forthcoming weeks, we accept that the directive contains some loopholes. Nevertheless, as my colleague, Commissioner Diamantopoulou has already underlined on other occasions, when deciding whether or not to revise the directive immediately, different considerations must be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">First, any revision of the directive would have little immediate effect on existing agreements, unless the fundamental principle of respecting the autonomy of the negotiating parties no longer applies.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, an immediate revision would make things much more complicated as regards progress in respect of the other pending dossiers in this field like European company statutes and the national information and consultation proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The successful outcome of these other dossiers could greatly facilitate the subsequent revision of the EWC Directive and even provide some degree of a solution to the problems identified above. That is why we tend to consider that it might be more appropriate in this context to proceed with the revision of the European Works Council Directive only after the conclusion of those two dossiers and following a more complete evaluation of the application of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Action is not limited to legislation. To encourage and support dialogue as the cornerstone of the successful adaptation to change the Commission is also developing the recommendations of the Lillehammer Report by preparing the setting up of a European observatory on industrial change. We are also developing another suggestion of that expert group, the Managing Change Report.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finish by addressing some of the other concerns expressed in the draft resolution submitted to this House. As for the enforcement of the links between competition policy and social policy, let me remind you that there is a provision in the merger regulation which enables workers’ representatives to be heard by the Commission in the framework of the relevant procedure. Generally speaking, we recognise the need for proper consideration to be given in different instances to all aspects surrounding these kinds of operations, including their effects in terms of employment.</p>
<p class="contents">As an example of this I mention that public authorities, notably the Commission, have already taken measures through guidelines on national regional aid that came into force on 1 January this year so as to ensure that public funding remains associated with the recipients of regional aid and consequently with the jobs attached to the investment. To this end all regional aid is made conditional on the maintenance of the investment in question for a minimum period of five years. The same provision was included in the Structural Funds Regulation which means that it applies to all investments cofinanced by the structural funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Social cohesion and the interplay of policies at EU-level is the focus of the forthcoming Lisbon Summit. I know we will be coming back to these issues again in the future to see how we can best make sure our policies are adapted and reformed to underpin economic and social progress in Europe.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The subject in question is of great political and social importance. Free enterprise, free movement and free competition are essential pillars of the political and economic structure of the European Union. Company restructuring is part of the principle of free determination of investments, and must therefore be defended. However, all too often we witness events which are in stark contrast with these principles. Today, we are witnessing one of these cases, which, on the surface, may seem to be of minor importance and affect only the specific industry, but which, if it is allowed to pass without an authoritative intervention by the European Union, will become an unwritten rule which will cause problems for many of the Member States and the Union as a whole. </p>
<p class="contents">An American company – Goodyear – with production sites in Italy, Germany and England, is reviewing its production and relocation, justifiably, in its own view. However, it seems to be doing it without observing the relevant Community legislation, for it is certainly not giving reasonable notice to employees or heeding the obligation to render an account of their use of Italian and European public finances. In Italy, Commissioner Liikanen, Goodyear is not carrying out restructuring but closing a plant whose production covers 14% of the market and which Goodyear itself defined as, ‘having the most highly-skilled workforce of all its plants’, a plant which was opened with a total of EUR 85 million of European capital. No notice was given of the closure, and no intention was shown of discussing the fate of the plant or its workers, despite the fact that the public funds invested in that plant make it much more public than private. It would be a serious matter if every non-European company were to learn to use Europe as a bus where you do not have to pay for the ticket, you do not have to pay for cooperation, you benefit from using the facility and you leave without being accountable to anyone.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has to guarantee every sort of freedom, including freedom to use one’s own money for the purposes of one’s own freedom and not to let others use it at will, others who make demands and then, when the break is made, refuse even to discuss the terms of the break, despite the fact that this is a break which has been declared unilaterally.</p>
<p class="contents">Just now, Commissioner Liikanen was talking of restructuring which must not be uninformed. Sadly, in this case, he has not taken into account those who are affected and seems not to have considered those carrying out the restructuring. I would also like to point out to Commissioner Liikanen that it is not easy to take a matter to a national court. Of course, it is always possible, but when jobs have been lost and factories closed down, the idea of going to Court when proceedings are as lengthy as they are in Italy is not very reassuring.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Liikanen, we expect an authoritative intervention. As Parliament, we are, of course, expecting to be able to contribute to the resolution you mentioned – we are ready and waiting – but we expect an authoritative intervention on this, which can on no account be allowed to reach its conclusion and be forgotten, as has almost happened already. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Goodyear case is not localised and limited to the industry in question: it concerns a thousand families who have lost their jobs overnight, and are left without income or prospects for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The cases we are discussing today, like many others we have discussed here – and I fear they will not be the last – as you, Commissioner, reminded us, provide us with the opportunity to discuss the imperative need to supplement European legislation. An example is the directive on the information and consultation of workers which you mentioned, that has been awaiting a solution for years and upon which the European Parliament gave its opinion very clearly in April last year. I am also referring to the importance of reinforcing European legislation across the board by revising existing directives. I believe that the European Union and the Commission must ask the Council and the Member States to consider the procedures for implementing these directives in the different States as well.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Italy is no exception – it is not one of the most advanced states when it comes to implementing directives – but there are many countries where the directives, which, in any case, only lay down minimum rights, are hardly implemented at all. This makes it possible for companies to relocate, even within the European Union, from one country to another where directives are less strictly applied, companies have greater benefits and workers are less well protected. And the result of this is social dumping. </p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we must keep tabs on the application of these directives and reinforce European coordination. All this confirms our conviction that something like sanctions, which we reiterated were very important when we gave our opinion on the information and consultation directive last year, can on no account be abandoned. Otherwise, I believe that the cases we are discussing today will multiply constantly, and that, one day, the European Union will have no control over them, particularly with regard to competition and change-inducing technologies, and this will contribute to higher unemployment and weaken social cohesion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is – as it was the first time round – sparked off by the reorganisation of large companies, which is linked to a drop in employment. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make it quite clear that the Liberal Group is against any political interference in companies, in terms of both finance and management. Our task is to draft legislation and to monitor to ensure that it is observed. It appears that Goodyear in Italy received Italian and European subsidies to the tune of approximately EUR 40 million. The company went under despite this. This goes to show that jobs cannot be bought. The market is a law unto itself. </p>
<p class="contents">As such, state aid costs the government twice: first in subsidies and then in unemployment benefit. Surely this cannot be the role of your, my and the citizens’ tax money? All this, of course, does not mean that our Group does not share the concern of the Italian Members regarding the effects of the closure on the region concerned. </p>
<p class="contents">My Group is also opposed in principle to the naming of specific companies in this resolution, for two reasons: firstly because this creates selective responsibility. A company is pilloried one day and not the next. Why should this be the case? Michelin caused a great stir. But I did not hear a squeak when Nissan and IBM were discussed, where, similarly, a great number of European employees were involved. Secondly, this is not fair towards employees of other companies where reorganisations also take place and where it hurts too. </p>
<p class="contents">My Group has signed a joint resolution with EPP and UEN, in which, however, we made it clear right from the outset that we are against the naming of company names.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the Liberal Group will vote against paragraph 8 and the second section of paragraph 9. If these paragraphs are nonetheless adopted, my Group will abstain from the final vote. I do hope that this will not be necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Everything has already been said on this subject. For some of us, everything has already been said on the freedom or quasi-divine right of companies and for others, with whom I associate, everything has already been said on the intolerable logic of short-term profit, on disdain for workers, on both the individual and collective social consequences, on the impact on territories and on the waste of know-how and skills.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware of the fact that restructuring, as we know it today, contradicts the stated objectives of the European Union on employment and social and territorial cohesion on all counts. Under these circumstances, what is important today for us, as European Members of Parliament, when we come to the vote, is not yet again to declaim a few general points, however emotional; in my view, this would reinforce the already widespread idea that the institutions are impotent; what is important is that we use every means available in the European institutions to bring our stated priority objectives to bear on the specific case of the merger of ABB-Alsthom and the closure of the Goodyear site in Italy and draw all the relevant conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">From this point of view, what can we do? First, draft a very accurate report on the implementation of the collective redundancies and European works council directives and use all the pressure, warnings and sanctions needed in order to ensure that they are applied to the letter. It is obvious nowadays that the management of large groups are using every subterfuge they can to avoid transparent information and negotiation with their workers. We must not permit that. To claim, as ABB-Alsthom did, that it is too early for talks before the merger and too late after it, because the representatives no longer have the credentials, is inadmissible. Basically, it is patently hi-jacking the spirit of the European works council directive.</p>
<p class="contents">We must strengthen our legislation in order to close these loopholes; we must reform it and guarantee workers new rights, especially the right to contest the economic justification for redundancies. We must also review the criteria on which mergers between groups are authorised. What does the Commission, and by extension what do we look like, from the point of view of the workers and from the point of view of the social consequences, when the Commission authorises a merger as questionable as that of ABB-Alsthom? It simply looks like it is involved in a cover-up. And if all Community policies are to promote employment and cohesion, how is it that the Commission can forego such an investigation when deciding whether or not to authorise a merger? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is to create new jobs for young people entering the labour market and the second is not to lose jobs. Yet the current situation in Europe provides us with clear examples of how jobs are being destroyed, particularly, and most seriously, by companies which are making huge profits. In the past, workers were asked to show their solidarity with companies in order to ensure their survival. Now the companies are making huge profits but are also making workers redundant. Examples have been given in Spain of Michelin and ABB-Alsthom and my colleagues will give examples for Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also another hidden way of making workers redundant, as practised for example in Spain by the Ericsson company under the term ‘externalising’. Note that sensitive words like ‘redundancy’ are not used. Externalising services by subcontracting these to contract companies results in stable and permanent jobs being turned into precarious jobs without union or social rights. This is just an underhand way of making workers redundant.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, if the European institutions really believe in what they say about full employment, they must take clear steps to secure this. They must revise the directives in order to guarantee the participation of workers in these negotiations. They must revise the directive on collective redundancies, reduce the working day, link European subsidies to a clear commitment to maintain employment and include social and labour clauses in the international agreements signed by the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet again, workers are likely to lose their jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">This time, I am referring to the workers of the company Goodyear in Cisterna di Latina. As has already been pointed out, in one month’s time, 600 people and as many families could be deprived of their sole source of income. Despite the commitment they have shown to the company and despite their high level of professionalism – which has made the Cisterna plant one of the most productive in Europe – these workers are likely to be removed from the production cycle, while Goodyear, after years of benefiting from state and European subsidies, is totally free to walk out. I do not think this is at all fair, either to the workers at the Cisterna plant or to all those Italian and European citizens whose taxes have, albeit indirectly, enabled Goodyear to benefit from the state aids I have just mentioned. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission and the Council must, at last, assume all the necessary responsibilities, both with regard to the adoption of a common position on the information and consultation of workers and with regard to Community and national aid, which must only be granted to companies who undertake to establish long-term agreements to protect jobs. </p>
<p class="contents">Today, we ask the Commission to start by protecting the workers at Goodyear in Cisterna, and therefore to put as much pressure as possible on the company for it to come to an agreement as soon as possible, thereby ensuring the continued existence and operation of the Cisterna plant.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to remind the House that there is very little time available, and therefore that any measure – including those already cited by the Commission in its introductory report – which we adopt must have an immediate, timely effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are well aware of this current economic context and that the purpose of restructuring is to rationalise corporate management.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it is laudable from an economic point of view to make structural changes in order to be more competitive and win market shares, this approach may be reprehensible if it is made at the request of financiers, often shareholders, with the sole unavowed aim of increasing the financial standing of the company in order to raise profits which they can then withdraw from the company. The various recent announcements referred to by previous speakers, be they by Michelin or Goodyear, are symptomatic in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Rationalised management and improved profits should, in my view, serve the company and hence its employees first and foremost, and any financial benefits should follow. However, what we witnessing today is the phenomenon of concentration and corporate regrouping and relocation, with all the familiar consequences, both on the quality of products and at the social level, especially in terms of unemployment, difficult working conditions and increased flexibility: consequences which have a drastic effect at the human level, especially on the family unit. </p>
<p class="contents">There is a very real risk of seeing a two-headed monster emerge on this planet, with poor countries providing the labour and rich countries providing the capital. Surely Europe should act as a safeguard, maintaining a certain equilibrium between increased profitability and social welfare? We must not forget that it is human resources which make a company function at its base and guarantee it good results.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, allow me to remind you that the third letter of the EDD Group to which I belong stands for ‘difference’. Europe has a duty to make its voice heard as an alternative to savage restructuring for profit at all costs. Without doubt, the voice of difference in this monotonous flood of restructuring. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I, like all Members present, am saddened by this loss of jobs. Equally, I am saddened by the announcement made by Goodyear that has prompted this resolution. But I doubt very much indeed whether a European works council would have been able to change this company’s decision.</p>
<p class="contents">This House is very good at producing resolutions and legislation and we sometimes, in this institution, forget that Europe cannot survive alone. We need multinational companies to base their businesses within our continent. In my few months here, I have found it astonishing that whilst we all talk about the need to encourage businesses to grow within the EU, nearly every resolution we pass actually encourages businesses to leave.</p>
<p class="contents">In our last plenary part-session in Brussels we voted on the end-of-life vehicles directive and managed to make the legislation retrospective, adding huge costs for the European motor manufacturers that they could not have predicted. Two days later, Toyota, which employs several thousand people in my region, stated that this directive would not only increase the cost of cars but could well also mean redundancies in their Derbyshire plant.</p>
<p class="contents">In a world where surely less regulation is the key, we in this House seem to believe that we can add more regulation and costs on business and that they will stay within the European Union, untempted by other locations elsewhere where there are fewer burdens. We MEPs speak often about SMEs and have now come up with a unique way of creating them. Take a large successful business, add European regulations, and within months you have created a small one.

In this respect, I share Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel’s view that we cannot talk about these in detail. But maybe next time, we ought to discuss CORUS, the merger which has now taken place between our Nederlandse Hoogovens and British Steel.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to place this discussion in a somewhat wider context and examine the link between policy in the field of company mergers within the European Union and policy in other fields. In this light, I am pleased that Mr Liikanen is present and we do not only have to hold this discussion, where the interests of employees are concerned, with Mrs Diamantopoulou but we can involve the Commissioners who are active in other fields. </p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to advocate coherence in the Commission’s policy from these different vantage points, unlike my predecessor, who holds the belief that there is no need for rules. We need to gain an insight into what companies are like now. At present, we are witnessing a number of large mergers between companies which originate in an Anglo-Saxon tradition and companies with a Rhineland tradition. What remains of the concept of what a company should be like now is naturally very relevant: whether it is merely the property and toy of shareholders, or whether it is a more broadly based stakeholder society, which is meant to guarantee continuity for staff, consumers, suppliers and the local population and has, in addition, a social function. </p>
<p class="contents">As such, I would like to ask these various Commission directorates and these various Commissioners to provide a wider vision regarding corporate governments. I think that it would also fit in well with the plans which have been presented over the past couple of days on good government in Europe, as company policy forms part of this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gill (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, earlier this week President Prodi announced that one of the Commission’s strategic objectives for the next five years would be to aim for full employment. He acknowledged that 15 million Europeans are currently looking for work and that unemployment is the main source of poverty and social exclusion. What is more, the Portuguese Presidency sees the fight against unemployment as top priority. Yet, all too often these political priorities are invisible in everyday policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s decision to allow the ABB-Alsthom merger to go ahead is a case in point. The new company has announced its intention to initiate a restructuring plan with the aim of making savings. This global restructuring plan could lead to the loss of up to 12 000 jobs. In my region of the UK in particular the employment consequences of this merger have been severe as a result of ABB-Alsthom having announced that it was cutting 270 jobs in Britain with 95 jobs being lost in Stafford and 112 in Rugby. The company’s failure to inform the works council about the proposals for the merger is particularly worrying. It is especially important in the case of large international companies where decisions are taken far from the employee.</p>
<p class="contents">Point 17 of the Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers stresses the need for consultation, adding that this shall apply especially in companies having establishments in two or more Member States. I do not think it is simply a matter of a Community charter. EU legislation on this issue could not be clearer. The Commission would do well in this sort of situation to make its decisions not simply on the basis of whether a merger will distort competition but also on the basis of the social and economic consequences. We need more joined-up policy making on these issues. What we also need urgently is an impact assessment study on the effect of merger in every situation. This is the only way of respecting Article 127 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the statement made by Commissioner Liikanen, but I also look for the support of this Parliament to ensure that the legislation which we have passed on workers’ rights is implemented rigorously and to ensure that impact assessments on the workforce for proposed mergers are undertaken as a matter of course.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
