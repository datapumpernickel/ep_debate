Over the next two years we now face a third hurdle, which could prove to be the most complex and demanding for this historic project – its ratification by the EU’s 25 Member States. We must recognise that work will by no means be completed with the ceremonial signing of the Constitution on the Capitol in Rome on 29 October. On the contrary, work must go on, and everyone must bring this project to a close with the same energy, vigour and discipline.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware, and our committee is aware, that there is a risk that the European spirit, which was very much present in the Convention, but which became less and less so, without disappearing entirely, in the Intergovernmental Conference, will be lost in the national debates and domestic political battles of coming months and of the next two years. It is already noticeable that a populist and opportunist movement is being organised against the European Constitution, and it is a cause for concern that this germ has already infected one of the originators of the European idea, as is evident from the debates over recent weeks in France. The fact that a populist and opportunist movement is turning against the Constitution should give us pause for thought, even when the reasons have little to do with this project.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not allow the power games and power struggles of domestic politics to water down or even destroy this historic project, and everyone who has fought for the Constitution in the past years and decades must rise up in opposition to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament, the Commission and the Council were active participants in the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference, and I believe that the three European institutions also bear a particular responsibility in this ratification stage, as we must be advocates of the compromise that has been reached. It is therefore unacceptable for individual articles to be extracted from the overall compromise and used as a pretext for rejecting the entire Constitution, and this must not happen. An overall compromise has been reached, and we must see the wood and not just the trees, to put it metaphorically.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also the task of the European institutions to explain the fundamental goals and content of the Constitution to the European Union’s 450 million citizens, and to provide them with information on this issue. We would therefore like to ask the Commission and the Council whether a communication strategy exists, and whether suitable activities aimed at informing the European people about the project are in preparation. This House would also like to ask the Council whether a strategy exists for coordinating ratification in the 25 Member States. We are well aware that ratification will take place in accordance with the national law of each Member State, and it is also clear that some countries will require more time than others. It would however be entirely wrong if no attempt at coordination were made, especially when this has already taken place in the ten accession countries with regard to ratification of the Accession Treaty, and with visible success.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, the Council and Parliament may not now sit back and content themselves with watching from the sidelines. On the contrary, and as I said before, the same vigour and ambition must continue to guide us over the next two years in order to ensure that this project clears the final hurdles. The 2004 Constitution must not suffer the same fate as the 1984 and 1994 drafts, which went straight into the archives and never made it off the printed page and into reality. This 2004 Constitution must become a reality, as only then can progress result in increased democracy, transparency and efficiency in the European Union and hence for the people of Europe. This is our goal, and this is what we must work towards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have another opportunity later on, in reaction to other comments on this subject, but it is a hugely important topic. First of all, I should like to say that Mr Leinen’s words are very much my own sentiments, especially when he points at the enormous importance, after the steps we have now taken and will be taking on 29 October when we will be signing the Treaty, of carrying on with the same fervour, because we are not there yet. Mr Leinen is absolutely right in saying this, and a very important next step is to be taken in connection with the ratification and the referendums which will be held in a number of countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also in total agreement with him that this responsibility is shared between Parliament, the Commission and the Council. To date, our three institutions have managed to achieve that, and we will indeed need to continue in the same manner at the next stage.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that he himself indicated that there is, of course, a national responsibility where legislation, the implementation, the organisation of the ratification and also of possible referendums are concerned, and that this does not fall within the remit of Brussels. We will at any rate ensure, though, as we have also discussed, that information about this ratification process is collected. The Council’s Secretariat will be collating this information and compiling a rolling document, so that new information with regard to the planning and organisation of the ratifications and possible referendums can be processed in this document at any time.</p>
<p class="contents">This will be a permanent concern for us in the Council and will also be discussed during the European Council. I can tell you that we have also agreed that this will also be routinely on the agenda of the European Affairs Ministers who usually meet at least during each General Affairs Council for an informal lunch. It follows that from this position, we will be able to keep a finger on the pulse over the next few months.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council has drawn attention to the problem in a wider sense than simply the ratification and the general involvement of the public, partly further to the low turnout at the most recent European Parliament elections. We the presidency, and particularly the European Affairs Ministers, will make sure that we can table concrete proposals that will be discussed at the European Council of 5 November. We will set to this task in Amsterdam on 5 October, and will discuss, as already stated, both communications in a more general sense and also specifically the best ways of taking account of the ratification procedures in the different Member States and of the harmonisation that is required for this purpose. That means, in any case, exchanging information and learning from each other’s experiences in this procedure. Where harmonisation in time is possible, that should be done, but once again, that is a national responsibility. We will also ensure, and this will probably be handled centrally, that all citizens can have access to a text of the Treaty. On this score too, scope will need to be provided, though, for all possible information-related campaigns and activities to be handled at national level. I think that the signal which the new Commission has sent out, also by appointing the first Vice-President with specific responsibility for communication, is an important step, and further attention is also being paid from those quarters to communication. Perhaps I can finish off with Mr Leinen’s remark about the anxiety level, which may be rising here and there nationally with regard to public opinion. It is precisely that too that makes it so important for national governments to be able to choose the right way and have enough scope to give their own interpretation to the entire ratification process and possible referendums. Rest assured that we in the presidency, and in the Council, are very aware of our responsibilities and will make every effort to ensure that this whole procedure will have a successful outcome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to thank Mr Leinen for enabling us to hold this debate on a very important issue. We are, in fact, convinced that the European Constitution will help us to build a Europe that is democratic, more transparent, more efficient and placed at the service of Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true, however, that, to make this institutional construction succeed, we need the combined consent and participation of the public. The Commission therefore deems it essential that this Constitutional Treaty should be extensively presented and explained to the public. Let me say at this point that I am answering on behalf of my colleague Mr Vitorino, who asked me to convey his apologies, but I should like to make it clear that, alongside Mr Vitorino, I have followed recent Council debates on the draft Constitution, on behalf of my colleague Mr Barnier.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall therefore respond briefly, Mr President, in accordance with your wishes, whilst trying to be as accurate as possible. I should first like nonetheless to point out, Mr Nikolai – and I shall just greet Mr Leinen as he goes by – the important share of responsibility that falls to national governments that are signatories of the Treaty. I feel that each government is best placed to develop the most suitable approach on a country-by-country basis, depending on the particular sensitivities, and the political and social context peculiar to the country concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">That being the case, we in the Commission naturally intend to offer our complete support to this effort, and it is against this backdrop that, from as early as July, Mr Prodi, the President of Parliament and the Chairman of the Committee of the Regions, along with Mr Vidal-Quadras and Mr Vitorino, have been appealing to all European, national, regional and local parliamentarians to contribute to this debate. It is also in this context that we launched the campaign entitled ‘A thousand debates for Europe’. This is a target that we should like to reach and even exceed. May I call on each of you to promote these debates and contribute to them? I naturally call on the Members of the Commission to do likewise.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to announce what has been done within the scope of the PRINCE actions, the European citizens’ information programme. Here, too, the Commission, in conjunction with Parliament, has endeavoured to make it easier to produce explanatory notes to present and explain the text adopted and the process that was followed in order to prepare it.</p>
<p class="contents">With the 2004 credits, we have begun updating brochures for the general public and multilingual guides to the Constitution. More than ten million copies of these brochures and guides will be published. I believe we will therefore have a volume of information never previously achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made arrangements to have a video produced, which will be distributed from 29 October, together with information panels intended for all our intermediaries and networks, as well as for the national and regional public services that will be using them.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, the Commission has endeavoured to arrange seminars for journalists: we hope to reach at least five hundred journalists, who will come to Brussels to familiarise themselves with the Constitution and talk with forums comprising MEPs attending the Convention and representatives of civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Parliament and the Commission, along with the Council, may decide to hold another version of the ‘Springtime of Europe’ initiative, which had reached numerous young people; schools are asked to arrange information meetings on their premises.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Leinen, there is therefore a wide range of tools being put in place. I should therefore like to say that the Commission is not in favour of launching an overall, wide-ranging, pan-European campaign on the Constitution. That would be potentially counterproductive, because such an initiative might be perceived as a supranational propaganda exercise. Let us not forget, as I said earlier, that ratifying a Treaty is a constitutional process and that in each Member State, therefore, there is a need to sense what is appropriate and to determine the ways in which the Commission is to intervene by means of European public funds. All of this requires a tailor-made approach, hence the need for dialogue between our three institutions: Parliament, the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, turning to Mr Nikolai, I should like to thank him and the Dutch Presidency for arranging the informal meeting of competent ministers, taking place on 5 October, precisely to look into how this major information campaign can be organised. Mr Leinen, I am certain, as you are, that factual and objective information will be able to dispel a lot of the misunderstandings. Consequently, following the meeting on 5 October, we must be in a position to envisage what can be done in each of the Member States. It is on that basis that the Commission will support the efforts undertaken to this end.</p>
<p class="contents">I also clearly noticed your concern, which I share, that this informal meeting should able to specify timetables and to see who is in the best position to address each national situation. All of this will, of course, demonstrate clearly what might be the best use of budgetary investment earmarked for these actions.</p>
<p class="contents">This is my answer on the Commission’s behalf. We want to set up a programme and an information plan following up this meeting organised by the Dutch Presidency with the specific aim of adopting a practical, concerted approach and of setting up realistic action programmes that cater to our countries’ specific needs. Please allow me, Mr President, on behalf of the Commission, to thank Parliament for having, by organising this debate, already stressed the importance of this information which, once again, we want to be objective but which, above all, we want to be as complete as possible and as accessible as possible to the greatest number of people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I also believe, therefore, that this oral question from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs comes at a good time and – Jo Leinen said this very appropriately – it appeared that we had finished our work by approving the Constitutional Treaty. It appeared that the issue of ratification was now something which fell to the national authorities, to the Parliaments, to the peoples. I do not believe this, I believe that it falls to all of us and also to the institutions of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I was very pleased, Mr Nicolaï, to hear you say that the Ministers are going to deal with this issue. You have signed the Constitutional Treaty and, therefore, you, like us, have an interest in seeing it ratified as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, Commissioner Barrot’s speech worried me because, apart from the leaflets and the video, I heard that the Commission believes it would be harmful to carry out an information campaign at European level. How can it be harmful? What is the Commission’s view of the Constitutional Treaty? If it believes it represents progress, a step forward for the European citizens, it should say so, as Parliament will do. We are currently producing a report which will be approved on 15 December. If that report is in favour of the Constitutional Treaty, this Parliament must not remain neutral, but must campaign in favour of it.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe, Mr Barrot, that the Commission must consider what it is going to do on this issue. I believe it is very important to send a clear political signal of where we are, because the European Constitution is very important for the future of Europe and, therefore, all of us – the institutions of the Union and the Member States – must stand together in order to win this battle as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These procedures are national. They are matters for national and internal debate. Does that mean that there is no legitimate interest in members from other countries participating in those national debates?</p>
<p class="contents">With all due caution, it is legitimate to draw attention within each Member State to the fact that their national decision on ratification has implications for everyone else in Europe as well. It is not insignificant that 25 elected governments of our Member States have all come to the conclusion that this new Constitution is the best way forward for the European Union. It will not be insignificant either if our Parliament endorses that Constitution in December by an overwhelming majority.</p>
<p class="contents">It is right to draw this to the attention of people. It is right to try and Europeanise the debate in that way. Some have suggested having national referendums all on the same day. That we know is virtually impossible, but some Member States may wish to coordinate their referendums within a certain time period. That is up to them. It would make the debate more European. But the most important thing we can do is coordinate our information work.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that the Council is meeting to discuss that. It is necessary if only to avoid contradictions, with the Commission saying one thing, the Council saying another, the Parliament saying something else. We must focus on getting the facts across because the facts speak for themselves. This debate is myth against reality. All we need to do is provide factual information and I am confident we will win the battle of ratification. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It can, of course, be squeezed through, but it can only be squeezed through if all Members of the European Council accept that they have a collective and individual responsibility to campaign for it to be brought into force. For several national leaders, this means that they will be obliged, for the first time, to campaign on European questions. Coordination of the plot, getting the story right, seems to me to be extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the European Council must avoid a scramble to be at the end of the list – <span class="italic">la fuite en avant</span>. There should be a cluster approach to ratification with the keener, more assured integrationists going first, rather than forming a nervous queue. Public opinion will query why our national leaders are frightened of their own shadow on Europe and fearful of putting the argument for the Constitution in a positive and trenchant way that embraces the European dimension. This is a chance for our leadership to grow the European polity.</p>
<p class="contents">To the Commission I would say that public relations exercises are all fine. One should ask why the Commission, at this sensitive moment, has seen fit to cut the budget in half, but what we really need is a political Commission, a campaigning Commission that will complement the role of the European Council to bring real leadership to the European citizen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During the debates of the coming months on the ratification of a European Constitution, who else should act as an advocate of this Constitution, and as a guardian of the broad consensus achieved in the European Convention and of the concept of European integration, if not the European institutions, and if not this House? Yet the institutions present a curious sight, which reminds me of children who lose their ball while playing, and who watch spellbound as the ball bounces onto the road and under the wheels of cars to see if the ball will somehow appear again undamaged on the other side of the road.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot allow this Constitution to become a pawn in what are purely national and nationalist debates, and we cannot leave it to the mercy of domestic political grudges and calculations. I would have expected the Commission to ensure that this does not happen.</p>
<p class="contents">What action is the Commission taking? There is no longer even a portfolio for the Constitution in the incoming Commission, or a Commissioner responsible for it. There were two Commissioners responsible for the Constitution in the outgoing Commission, yet there is no longer even one at this decisive stage of the debate on it. What action is the Commission taking? It is quartering the budgetary appropriations for communication and for campaigns to inform the public about the European Constitution. If you wish to relinquish your responsibility for the Constitution, and if you wish to be an engine of European integration and the Treaties, but not an advocate of the development of European integration, you should continue on your current course of action.</p>
<p class="contents">You have an extremely important historical decision to take; do you wish, together with this House and the Council, to prevent the Constitution becoming a pawn to nationalism, renationalisation in Europe and chauvinism? Take a look at your own country, where members of the Convention have now come out in opposition to the Constitution. Has it not become clear to you that a great deal of courage is required to defend together this common project for a common future?</p>

Every effort must, however, be made in this connection in order to ensure that Europe, and, more specifically, the text of the Constitution, are actually debated. Mr Leinen and Mr Voggenhuber are entirely correct to say that we must face the risk of the Constitution becoming a pawn in domestic political or intra-party intrigues.</p>
<p class="contents">There can be no doubt that one of the main problems in the various public discussions which have been initiated is a lack of detailed knowledge on the contents of the Constitution, and in some cases a fair amount of nonsense is being talked already. More action therefore needs to be taken to provide targeted information, and this is a point that I would like to make to the Commission. Maybe for once it should not just be the facts which are conveyed to the public, but also the difficulty of the debate, the pros and cons of individual arguments, tax policy, and so on. Many examples can be given of debates that have already taken place in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">My final observation, Mr President, I would like to address to Mr Nicolaï. I noted with interest that the Council is considering arranging ratification at a similar time in all Member States. Perhaps a date should be set for May of next year? Such a date would be of high symbolic value, as it will be the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. The aim would be to set an example for peace and stability in our continent and for greater integration, and this would be a viable way of doing so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is appropriate for an issue of such significance for the future of our nations to be the subject of a broad and fair public debate and referendums in all 25 Member States, without exception. The funds made available in the EU budget for informing citizens about the constitution should be split fairly between supporters and opponents of the Treaty, however.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the proposal by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that the Treaty should be ratified between 5 and 8 May in all Member States, as some kind of reminder of the end of the Second World War, it should be regarded as a dismal historical joke. Europe’s times of strength have been when it existed free from domination by any country, and when cooperation between free nations was not hampered by supranational bureaucracy and structures.</p>

In fact, further and fuller debate should be welcomed by all sides, because it would allow us to get rid of some of the misconceptions with regard to what aspects of the Treaty we would be voting on in our countries, or debating in our national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also only right that we as a European Parliament, as the directly-elected representatives of the European people, should be seen to give leadership in relation to the way the discussions and the debate should take place in the Member States. Let us not forget that, first and foremost, our most important role as Members of the European Parliament is as public representatives of the people. We are here not to hold on to one ideological viewpoint, but to give what we consider to be a fair, honest and truthful account of what is contained within the text of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I can go along with what was proposed in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, to ensure that this kind of debate can take place; to ensure that some of the lies that were told in the past about what was in the Treaty are refuted; and to ensure that those rightful concerns that people have with regard to the future of Europe are given an opportunity to be aired within a public debate.</p>

<p class="contents">In view of the fact that to date the European public has known relatively little about the content of the Constitutional Treaty, an overly biased campaign promoting the Constitution would have a negative impact on EU citizens, who would feel that they had once again been presented with <span class="italic">faits accomplis</span>. This would mean a further increase in the euroscepticism recently highlighted by the low turnouts in the European elections, and we will therefore need to find the courage to allow a controversial discussion on the Constitutional Treaty to take place.

I am delighted to note that the decision to hold referendums is catching on. The problem with a referendum, however, is that while it is the most democratic process, it is also, by its nature, the most likely to be used for the wrong objective. In all the countries concerned, there is a risk that the European referendum will turn into a national plebiscite.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, given that the danger and the aim are identical everywhere, our governments have every interest in adopting a joint ratification strategy. Such a strategy must, to my mind, comprise at least three elements. Firstly, the question put to the public and the explanatory notes relating to it should be presented jointly. Secondly, there should be a timetable. In this respect, the best solution would be, as certain Members of this House have already stated, to hold referendums on the same date in all countries concerned. Thirdly, and I feel that this point is of particular importance, the issue of the final borders of the European Union must be set out clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a debate that neither Parliament, nor the Council, nor the Commission have thus far had the courage to hold. It is, furthermore, impossible to put the creation of a political Europe before the public without specifying what we mean by the word ‘Europe’ and without fixing the borders or at least the criteria for defining the borders. In several countries, including mine, the notion of belonging to a political Union without borders – the future composition of which would be left entirely to the good will of the governments of tomorrow – would be rejected by the vast majority. The Council must be aware of this when it comes to making its decision on Turkey. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The process of creating a Constitution is only complete when those whose sovereignty is at stake, in this case the people – the European citizens – give their final word on the text – in this case, the Constitutional text – which is submitted to them for consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we are seeing a truly worrying phenomenon: only those who are against the European Constitution are expressing themselves clearly, those who have doubts, those who are trying to use this process for party-political or opportunist purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">The governments in the Convention, the parliamentarians, restricted ourselves to saying that this Constitution is good and that it should therefore be supported. Well, now we must explain this Constitution, we must state what is positive about it and that, without it, we would be heading for the paralysis represented by the Treaty of Nice. We must do that from a European point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we must Europeanise the debate on the Constitution, we must Europeanise the process of ratifying the Constitution which, as its name indicates, is a European Constitution. And there are only two ways of doing this. Firstly, by coordinating its ratification in the Member States. There are 25 of us, but we are only one Union and the referendums must therefore be held within a few days of each other and why not close to the Day for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the institutions cannot be neutral in this debate. Parliament, the Council and the Commission, in common agreement, must carry out a strategy of information, debate and persuading the public, in order to defeat our main enemy, which will be low turn-out.</p>

We are well aware, for that matter, that ratifying the Treaties, and in particular by means of referendums, is contaminated by internal political issues. France recently gave us a lamentable example of this.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, as far as possible, denationalise the debate and encourage Heads of State or Government to coordinate their actions towards successive ratifications. In order to create a positive spiral of adoption, it would be worthwhile preventing the most reluctant countries from holding their vote first.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, the proposal to hold the vote in all EU countries during the same period, namely 5 to 8 May 2005, should enable us to employ certain symbols in the cause of adoption: the symbol of unity of place – an entire European Union expressing its opinion at the same time, as opposed to 25 countries voting one after another; the symbol of the unity of one text – one joint answer to one joint question; the symbol of the unity of time – the whole Union voting at the same time, from Thursday 5 to Sunday 8, whilst complying with national traditions of polls held either during the week or on a Sunday; and lastly, the symbol of 8 May 2005, the 60th anniversary of the last conflict that set us against one another.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore on the platform of these sixty years of peace, thanks to the European Union, that we could build the Europe of tomorrow. This is the thrust of this proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Instead, I will use a language which is very close to Strasbourg and the Alsace region. As a linguist, I would like to make known my strong opposition to the fact that Spain is calling for the EU’s linguistic regime to include Catalan and Valencian as if these were two entirely different languages. Catalan is spoken from north to south, from Salses, in Roussillon, to Guardamar, south of Valencia, and from west to east, from Fraga, in the Autonomous Community of Aragon, to Alghero, in Sardinia. To speak of Catalan and Valencian is to promote linguistic secessionism, which has long been one of the strategies of cultural destruction. As the Romans said, ‘<span class="italic">divide et impera</span>!’ which, translated into an official EU language, means ‘divide and rule!’.</p>
<p class="contents">If Europe is moving closer to an ever more effective unity, what point can there be in fragmenting both languages, which in actual fact are spoken across borders and other divisions?

I have heard the word 'democracy' repeated many times in Parliament and in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on which I sit.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the word is empty without the reality. I see little evidence of democracy in the strategies being designed to guarantee a positive outcome to the Constitution. In the committee we are told that it is our job to 'sell the Treaty', that we should restrict the debate in our home countries, that referendums should be scheduled to maximise the 'yes' vote. We are told that we must get the Council to supply funds for the pro-Constitution campaigns.</p>
<p class="contents">In committee draft questions were proposed to ask the Council to specify a strategy to ensure a positive outcome to the ratification procedure.

<p class="contents">I turn to the Council, Commission and Parliament: if we believe in democracy – especially in this process that you, Mr President, called the most important since the founding of the Union – I entreat you to do whatever you can to ensure a fair and free process, to ensure that resources are used to truly inform people, especially by distributing copies of the Constitution to all the electorate, and by ensuring that all sides of the debate are thoroughly aired. If we insist on democracy in this process – not just in word but in reality – then we will have a real outcome that every true democrat can accept. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A start was made on the Constitution by the Intergovernmental Conference, with the acceptance of the Constitutional Treaty, a conference which finished its work during the Greek Presidency in June 2003. It is a success of which we are all particularly proud. However, that is only half the story; this Constitution needs to be approved. It would, I believe, be a tragic mistake and somewhat schizophrenic on our part, to coin a phrase, if we were to consider that our worries were over and that the entire matter and the entire problem had now been shifted to the national governments because, even if this Constitution is approved by everyone, if it is approved on the basis of internal political or micro-political dialogue in each country, its approval will be a pyrrhic victory for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Given, of course, that the lion's share, as far as information is concerned, lies with the Member States, the national parliaments and the citizens, I consider that there are three basic elements of coordination which are vital to us:</p>
<p class="contents">First, as European and institutional bodies, we must not interfere or engage in repellent action; we need to coordinate so that the left hand knows what the right hand is doing.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, at the very least we must help to inform citizens in clear, simple words about the differences which exist between the Treaty of Nice and this new Constitution. Anyone who disagrees with this Constitution will need to explain to themselves and everyone else why and how the present treaty protects their reasons for disagreement better than our Constitution, because we shall continue to function; it will merely be with the Treaty of Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, and this is especially important, information will also need to continue after the referendums. The Constitution is alive. It does not end with its approval. On the contrary, it starts with its application. It gives our citizens rights. Rights of participation and cooperation to force us to legislate. Rights which they need to know in order to take advantage of them. We have this obligation if our Constitution is to be a constitution which promotes not only democracy, not only transparency, but also the power of the citizen in the Union we are building together.</p>

Whilst there is nothing essentially new in the Constitution, apart from greater legal and political integration of the Member States, it heralds a new political era, by making it clear that Europe is more than just an economic area or a market. It is an area of values, a constitutional area, where the guiding principle is human dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">As a joint operation, Europe requires joint mobilisation. The Constitution will not be made in the classical manner of the old constitutions; it will mobilise European institutions, States and the public. The European institutions that gave birth to the dream cannot now give birth to fear. They must mobilise themselves in this joint task of involving the public in objective and genuine debate on the reasons behind the Constitution, which is purely and simply an extension of the constitutional convergence between different States. The institutions must now therefore communicate directly with the public and must get away from exclusive mediation by the States. The institutions are taking the required steps towards transversal action in the process of concluding the constitutional foundation.

<p class="contents">Even a constitutional debate offers an opportunity to people with that parochial mentality, people who are incapable of grasping what is at stake. Commissioner, I should like to draw your attention to the fact that, in our view, it would be crazy for the Commission, which had a decisive role to play in tabling the draft Constitution, to renege on its responsibility to take part in a joint strategy aimed at its approval. A joint strategy between the Commission and the Council carries a good deal more weight and goes beyond a mere information campaign used to disseminate objective information. Whilst that role is very important, a common strategy goes beyond that and carries more weight.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the nature of the European Project and, in particular, of the conditions for approving the draft Constitution, as has most aptly been said earlier, in any national process of approving a draft, in every country the interests of other States, the interests of all States and the interests of all European citizens are an important factor. The intervention on the part of the Community institutions, the Commission, the Council and Parliament itself, is, moreover, the only one, in view of its unquestionably supranational nature, in particular that of the Commission and Parliament, to intervene firmly in this process without laying itself open to the charge of interfering in the internal democratic process of the States concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Supranational institutions do not lay themselves open to the charge of interfering in the internal democratic process of States and therefore have a greater responsibility in fighting for the approval of the Constitution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my view, a number of your Members have made very crucial remarks about whose responsibility it is, and to what extent, to successfully complete these ratification processes. Mr Corbett, Mr Vigo, Mr Stubb and many others have said, there is, of course, a joint responsibility for the success of the process after 29 October, when the ratification is signed, albeit because we all rely on each other. We all rely on the success of all 25 ratification processes for this Treaty to enter into force. Where we can – and I am specifically saying this on behalf of the Council, we will actually do this in the Council as well – where we can, we must support and strengthen each other in this, and also learn from each other. It would be unfortunate, as Mr Voggenhuber pointed out in his critical remarks, if we were to blame each other and pass the buck to one another, because I consider it, in fact, important and valuable, as many in this House have said, that the three institutions carry a responsibility in this. It is my conviction that, so far, the Commission has played a very constructive, positive role in communicating Europe and informing the public about the Treaty, and it would, in fact, be wrong to put the ball in their court, because I see the Member States and Members of this House as also having a very considerable responsibility in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of you raised the point about the coordination in time of the different referendums. Many fine words have been spoken about how good it would be to have these referendums take place at a symbolic moment within a limited timeframe. I hope that you will agree with me that, although we might like the idea, we will not actually entertain it, because these are matters specifically related to constitutional legislation and should remain in the national sphere. I assume that this House, in terms of subsidiarity and the question as to which government layer would need to deal with what area, would not like to meddle in this anyway. What is very important, though, is that the different Member States examine when and how harmonisation could be possible, and that is exactly what we at the Council and the Council’s Secretariat are doing. We are publishing the national schedules, thus allowing governments and parliaments nationally to take these into consideration when drawing up their own schedules so as to see whether dates can be organised close together. This has nothing to do with whether you believe in a European approach to this issue or not, as some of you suggested. It has everything to do with constitutional law and it also concerns precisely the sensitivities which many of you have mentioned that referendums are at risk of becoming a national plaything. Many Members have given voice to this concern. That is precisely why the Council is convinced that it is good to give national parliaments and national governments some leeway in choosing a sensible date for such a referendum. This could be connected to all kinds of things, including other elections, or other current issues, in the country in question. I think that the ratification by 25 countries benefits from those countries having a good look at each other, but that those national responsibilities should remain intact at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">Talking of referendums, further to Mrs Kaufmann’s and Mr Schlyter’s remarks, I would point out that at present, nine Member States have decided to hold a referendum, eleven Member States have decided against it and five countries are still undecided.</p>
<p class="contents">What is crucial is the way in which we, the different institutions, the different governments, enter into these ratification procedures, the way in which we enter into discussion with public opinion, and the way in which we will tackle the referendums in those countries where referendums will be held. I think that to start with, Mr Méndez de Vigo emphatically stated that we should be in favour, and I also considered this as an appeal to the Member States and governments. We as governments and Council will be signing that Treaty and are in favour of it. We are not impartial towards that Treaty. It is important to us for this Treaty to be adopted and ratified. It is important because anyone who reads this Treaty will see that, however you look at it, Europe will, thanks to the new Treaty, become much more democratic. Simply consider the enormous widening of responsibilities of this House; finally, it is a fully-fledged European Parliament. Or consider the level of decisiveness, which will visibly improve with the new Treaty, again an example of decision-making by majority. Consider transparency, clarity, which will improve with this Treaty. Another point that is very important when I listen to all your remarks is that even the Eurosceptics are, in my opinion, pleased with this Treaty. Why? Because it stipulates, in detail and effectively, this very subsidiarity, those questions of who decides on what. As a result, Europe becomes more democratic not only at European level, but also nationally, because national parliaments can stand up and can argue that something could be done more effectively at national level and is not a matter for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think that there is a conflict – as a number of you mentioned – between devoting all our attention to those in favour, or working on the opponents, or, as the question has been raised, giving factual information as against preliminary information. In my view, Mr Crowley, among others, is right to say that the two are not mutually exclusive by any means. I am also looking in the direction of the Commission, because it had already hinted at this fact, with good reason. Factual information is a way of despatching the myths, the lies as they were referred to here. Using factual information, we can illustrate why this Treaty means progress for everyone in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to comment on the meeting that is to be held in Amsterdam on 5 October, involving the European Affairs Ministers, to deal specifically with communicating Europe and also with ratification and with those referendums that are scheduled. I am delighted with what Mr Barrot had to say about this. It is also gratifying that Mr Vitorino will be attending that meeting, and I welcome his statement that what we discuss at it should impact on the Commission’s further plans and in turn, needless to say, also on the decision-making in the European Council on 5 November. I am also thrilled that the President of your House, Mr Borrell Fontelles has already confirmed that he will be attending that meeting, because as I said earlier, without the three institutions, we are unable to bring this to a successful conclusion. This meeting should be a meeting about communicating Europe, but one that also reveals how it is possible to communicate about Europe. It will not be a platform for reading out written-down statements, the media will be present, and I hope that we can demonstrate that Europe benefits from debate. What is helpful in that connection is the fact that your previous President, Mr Pat Cox, was prepared to act as moderator during this meeting. The principle underlying this meeting, and undoubtedly the entire further procedure where this Treaty’s ratification is concerned, is that it benefits the public and that we take the public seriously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barrot,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I wanted to be brief, but should not want any brevity on my part to have given rise to any misunderstandings.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mr Méndez de Vigo, the first and distinguished speaker, I would like to say that there is obviously no ambiguity. Firstly, the Commission is fully committed to the draft Constitution, and I can testify that Mr Barnier, followed by Mr Vitorino, whom I assisted during the Council’s closing moments, really did do everything possible to bring it about. It will mark a very important step towards making this Union of ours more democratic and towards a whole series of advances, in which codecision, or rather the extension of Parliamentary codecision, is a major element.</p>
<p class="contents">It follows that there is a manifest commitment to the draft Constitution on the part of the Commission, and that there is no question of it not having an interest in the consultation that will result or in the consultations that will be held in the Member States. Quite simply, I tried to explain that the Commission had already undertaken to prepare documents that I believe have the dual merit of being very objective and of presenting the situation as it is now and as it will be once the draft Constitution has been ratified. All too often, in fact, the debate on how the EU should develop rather confuses matters, and it is not always very easy to distinguish what exists today from what will exist tomorrow, so we wanted the tools we provided to be practical, clear and operational, even though there is certainly room for their further improvement. I hope I have given an account of what the Commission has done about this.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want there to be any doubt about the fact that funding is a problem. We did not allocate EUR 1.5 million to the preliminary draft Budget for 2005 in order to reduce the projects, but because, at the time the preliminary draft Budget was being drawn up, we were still too uncertain of the eventual outcome. In any case, we declared our intention of reviewing the situation with you in the course of the Budget procedure. The situation is clearer now, and we are ready to act on the basis of the appropriations that your House and the Council, represented by Mr Nicolaï, estimate will have to be set aside for this purpose. The Commission is imposing no restrictions in this respect. What does actually matter is that the necessary funds be used once the enterprise is underway. So let there be no misunderstandings on that front.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor let there be any misunderstanding of what I have said. We think that the Commission would be incapable, on its own, of devising an information campaign. While again thanking Mr Leinen, I would also like to stress the fact that we are agreed, in particular, on item 6 of the motion for a resolution, which states that the Council, the Commission and Parliament must prepare an appropriate campaign and a communications strategy, and that this necessitates a joint effort by all the parties. When stressing the need for a sufficiently confident and effective partnership with the Member States, I certainly do not mean that there should be, in certain Member States, campaigns that are not coordinated and are not harmonized with those of other Member States. The simple fact, which Mr Nicolaï has just explained, is that we have to take into account certain national aspects in order to be certain that our information campaign will be as effective as it needs to be. It is, then, the desire for effectiveness that motivates us, and the Commission must not be seen as any less interested in the joint effort towards winning the battle to keep the public properly informed.</p>
<p class="contents">It follows that one and all must take their share of responsibility; the Commission will entirely accept its own. If Mr Vitorino were here, he would say so forcefully. As Mr Nicolaï has just said, Mr Vitorino will be in Amsterdam, and we may hope that the meeting on 5 October will be productive, not only in terms of guidance for our joint information project for all Europe’s citizens – with information that will, let me repeat, be objective – but also perhaps in terms of that coordination for certain consultations for which many of you have rightly expressed a wish. It is indeed in our interests that what is becoming a body of European citizens should be able to be heard through consultations organised in the various Member States and through their coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">I will close, Mr President, by expressing the wish that this meeting in Amsterdam might be able to shed as much light as possible on what would make for an effective partnership between Parliament, the Council and the Commission in winning the battle on the information front; I would suggest that it would be objectivity and truthfulness, for I have confidence in Europe and am convinced that truthful information will be likely to win widespread public support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
