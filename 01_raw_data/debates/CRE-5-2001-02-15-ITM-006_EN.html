I regret to have to say that this motion for a resolution on Kosovo is quite unbelievable. Once again we are suffering from total amnesia. We are acting as if everything that has taken place in Yugoslavia over the last ten to twelve years did not take place. We are allowing Mr Kostuníca to let the Serbian people remain in ignorance of everything that Milosevic kept from them for the previous ten years, namely the events in Vukovar, in Sarajevo, in Kosovo, even quite recently, just eighteen months ago. I find this perfectly unacceptable. All eyes are on Belgrade.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand, Mr President, Mrs Pack, the need to assist the new Serbian authorities in tackling the problems which exist, but this cannot be done at the expense of justice – or a modicum of justice – i.e. by failing to challenge and condemn the actions of Mr Milosevic and the main Serbian leaders. Nor can this be achieved while closing our eyes to a situation which is perfectly intolerable in terms of international law. The 700 Kosovars still detained in Serbia were sentenced in absolute contravention of the laws of the international community. Only UNMIK and the international tribunal in The Hague would be authorised to sentence these people.</p>
<p class="contents">An amnesty would therefore not be valid, and I would urge the responsible parties within the Commission to refer the matter, with all due discipline, to the competent Commissioners. There is no need to pressure Mr Kostuníca to grant an amnesty, all he has to do is to hand over the parties concerned to the head of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo, Mr Hækkerup. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We hope that these pictures represent the beginning of the end of the Balkan tragedy. I appreciate the fact that, for the first time, Mr Solana appeared not as the evil oracle from Euripides' ancient Greek tragedy Iphigenia, but as the good oracle.</p>
<p class="contents">A starting point for a policy in the area to dull the feelings of those responsible in connection with any man-made disasters in the area should, I think, be decisively supported by the European Parliament. This House needs to send a message of support for stability, peace and the development of cooperation in the area. The people in the area must understand that there is no question of their becoming big or small, because poverty never makes people big and as long as clashes continue, the only outcome will be poverty and unhappiness and that is all they will share.</p>
<p class="contents">In this sense, because stability, development and cooperation must be our prime considerations, this is the basic thrust of this motion. The people in the area must understand, as must we, that occupied protectorates in any shape or form never allow economic development, they never allow peace and they never allow countries or people in the area to be strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, the interplay of circumstances surrounding the visit, the interplay of circumstances surrounding the exchanges in Belgrade and the interplay of circumstances for us is an exceptional, useful and crucial interplay and we must help it. We need to understand that, if democracy, peace and cooperation are to succeed, we have to surpass ourselves. This motion, which defines a wide framework which can be used as a political framework for the next round of developments in the area, gives us the prospect of doing so and we should all support it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On one side are the Kosovars, waiting impatiently for a decision on the final status of their country, also waiting impatiently for elections and still – and let us be clear, understandably – full of hatred for the Serbs. In that climate the extremists have a free hand, for example in the Presevo area, where they are actually attacking KFOR troops, a situation that, in my eyes, and also for Mr Dupuis, is totally unacceptable. On the other side there is the Serbian Government which, with new faces in charge and fine plans, can be sure of a great deal of sympathy from the international community. It has, for example, come up with proposals for the same area, around Presevo, which I definitely think offer a good basis for negotiations and which I also think the Albanians should respond to. What one can now see happening is a shift in international sympathy from the awkward Kosovars to the cooperative Serbs. That is the moment – and the moment is now – that the balancing act is most difficult. What is the task of the EU? We must hold the Serbs to their promises which, however splendid they may be, as yet exist only on paper. We must isolate the extremist Kosovars and impress upon the moderate Kosovars, using force or persuasion as necessary, that they must cooperate with the Serbs, and that they cannot go on fighting them and pressing their demands. Once again, President, I can imagine easier tasks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are speaking today about southern Serbia and Kosovo. We are not discussing Serbia and current policy in Serbia proper. I agree with much of what you said, Olivier. Believe me, those Members who were in Belgrade have taken a clear line on the conditions. For us, there can be no money unless the conditions are fulfilled. No one has ever disputed that, apart from Commission President Prodi, whom I hereby urge to desist from such comments.</p>
<p class="contents">But let me come back to today’s debate. It is a matter of how things stand now in Kosovo. I agree with Mr Lagendijk on this point. Unless we know quite soon what is to happen next in Kosovo, the difficulties will simply accumulate down there. The problem is that KFOR troops have become the targets of Serbian and Albanian attacks, although KFOR is actually there to protect both of these ethnic groups.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem, in a nutshell, is that Mr Hækkerup will have to call elections very soon. To do that, he must know what powers the elected bodies will have. But we need these bodies so that the Serbian side has Kosovar negotiating partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we have the subject of southern Serbia. I believe that KFOR, like other bodies, has not done all it should have done there. Where have the weapons come from for these new extremists? They have, of course, been transferred from the old KLA to the new KLA. In my view, KFOR, with its 50 000-strong force in Kosovo, ought to be able to establish order in the Presevo Valley. I appeal to KFOR to do so, lest we lose our credibility in that corner of the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe, of course, in the truth of what the Mayor of Presevo said in Belgrade, namely that the population of Kosovo would like to remain in Serbia if only the Albanians in the region could be treated at long last on a par with the Serbs. They want to be part of everything that Yugoslav citizenship implies.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the government’s new plan is good. It is pursuing the right path, and we should support it. To tell the truth, I am a little saddened that Mr Kostuníca has said it will all happen without supervision by the EU. Why should we not play a part? We are good mediators.

We must now protect the Serbs, who are minority in Kosovo. Moreover, we must say to the extremist Albanian insurgents that we are not, therefore, there to support the ideas of Albanian extremism. We are there to support peace and human rights, and we shall do what we can to prevent Albanian extremists from creating unrest in the new democratic Serbia. I should like to assure Mr Dupuis that there were six of us from Parliament who spent the weekend visiting the new leaders in Belgrade. We received assurances that that they would cooperate with the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague, set up a truth commission and grant amnesty to conscientious objectors etc. What we can do here in Parliament is to hold the new leaders to these promises and, if they do not live up to them, then there are things we can do, for we are, of course, the great aid provider, granting large amounts of money, now and in the years to come, to the new Serbia.</p>
<p class="contents">I want, finally, to say something which is almost a remark on the rules of procedure. The purpose of these urgent topics we are now debating is, of course, to draw the public’s attention to serious problems in world politics and to serious violations of human rights and democracy. It is therefore a paradox that we are holding the debate at a time when there are fewest people here. There is no-one from the press. It is, in fact, almost like performing a striptease in the dark, if you will pardon the expression. I also think it is a paradox that we are insisting on the Commission’s being present – and the Council too ought, of course, to be here – but we have written our motions for resolution before we have heard what they have to say. It is both paradoxical and frivolous. I would therefore conclude my speech with the request that urgent topics of this kind be put on the agenda on Wednesdays when the Council and the Commission are here and that we only vote on the motions for resolution once we have heard the remarks on our proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We cannot compress five days’ work into a Wednesday just because some people want to work for one day and have six days off every week. Perhaps there are employees in other walks of life who would welcome a similar arrangement. In my opinion, what goes on here brings shame on this Parliament, and I find it scandalous, Mr Haarder, that you should encourage this by trying to eliminate Thursday sittings too, now that the Friday sittings have gone.</p>
<p class="contents">But now to the topic itself. I wish to say very clearly that we, as Europeans, bear a great responsibility for Kosovo – and this topical and urgent debate, incidentally, was originally devoted to Kosovo, not southern Serbia; it is listed in the agenda as the ‘situation in Kosovo’. In this respect I am not entirely happy with the resolution, and I should also like to point out that my name appears erroneously on the resolution, which I did not sign. May I ask that this be corrected, because I believe – as the last few speeches, and particularly Mrs Pack’s eloquent intervention, have graphically illustrated – that it is a matter of stabilising the situation in Kosovo, for as long as the situation in Kosovo is unstable, there can be no stability in the neighbouring regions either, including southern Serbia and, indeed, the whole of Serbia.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why it is absolutely imperative, as Mr Lagendijk quite rightly said, to take the decisive step by arranging for elections to be held in Kosovo. Until we have democratically legitimised authorities for Kosovo to act as negotiating partners of the democratically legitimised Serbs, there will be no peace settlement in the region, and we shall incur a heavy burden of guilt if we keep postponing these elections for every conceivable reason, because by so doing we undermine Mr Rugova’s position, and extremist forces – whose background, by the way, is obscure, to say the least – are able to exploit the situation and make internal political capital out of the Albanians’ frustration. As I have said, our inactivity weakens the position of Mr Rugova, who embodies people’s hopes for a peaceful solution. Instead of just pointing the finger at others and saying that this one or that one is undemocratic, we should recognise the fact that we ourselves are neglecting our primary responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me close with a remark aimed at the Serbian President: if he does not accept EU mediation to resolve this thorny issue, I wonder why he accepts money from the European Union.</p>

So too is the confidence of our own citizens and the people of the Balkans in the European institutions as well as the stability of the region itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Our action in Kosovo a couple of years ago was not exactly a paragon of speed or unity. For too many months it was not a paragon of efficiency either. Our people reacted with disgust to Milosevic’s odious policy which resulted in oppression and terror for the Albanian Kosovars and in their mass exodus. Public opinion in our own countries demanded determined action such as was eventually taken. Military intervention of that nature was likely to generate misgivings and even rejection amongst some sectors of our society and even more so in Yugoslavia itself. It is only fair to reiterate that we gave political consent to that action and that it did serve to curtail Milosevic’s excesses and the sufferings of the people of Kosovo. It also contributed to Milosevic being discredited and defeated a few months later.</p>
<p class="contents">However, our consistency is now being put to the test. We can no longer conceal our embarrassment as we witness how some of the former victims in Kosovo are turning into tormentors. They are persecuting their fellow citizens of Serb origin and driving them out of their territory in as hateful a process of ethnic cleansing as the previous one. Those same elements are involved in armed aggression on other Serb territory with an Albanian population. At the same time, Albanian Kosovar mafias are operating as part of organised crime networks in several of our countries. It appears that they are doing so to raise funds with which to finance their guerrilla activities.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this is incompatible with the objectives pursued by the European Union and we must not tolerate it. The European Union is contributing very substantial sums to the rebuilding of Kosovo. Nevertheless, that contribution must be strictly conditional on respect for human rights, recognition of existing borders adopted by the international community and the cessation of all military and terrorist operations by Albanian Kosovars within their territory or beyond it.</p>
<p class="contents">The stability of Yugoslavia, Albania, Macedonia and the rest of the region may depend on our consistency and firmness. It could hinge on our stifling the extremist and expansionist action of certain elements of the Albanian Kosovar population. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe we must see that as an absolutely fundamental principle. But the situation is, of course, rather more complicated in Kosovo and in the Presevo valley than simply dealing with a few extremist Albanians and heaping abuse on them today. Of course I shall support the resolution, but really I should have preferred it if we had tackled in one go today not only the situation in the Presevo valley, but also what is still happening daily in Mitrovica. Because there – and we must not forget that – it is not only policemen, not only KFOR troops, but also citizens who are attacked daily, and it is no fun living there. Very many colleagues have been there and know what the situation is like.</p>
<p class="contents">I am amazed at the warmth with which the international community is treating President Kostuníca at this moment. We are making a fuss of him, and supporting him, and when he came to power we quite rightly told him that there must be immediate emergency aid. Of course I was in favour of that, but we are now at a turning point. We are at a moment when we are moving from emergency aid to structural help. I believe that this is a turning point that we must take advantage of. We must use it to make clear once and for all to Mr Kostuníca and his regime that he will have to take fundamental steps to solve the problems in Kosovo. That means, in the first instance, the release of prisoners. We have still made no progress at all with this. This is a real scandal. If one comes into contact with Albanian Kosovars, that is the first thing they ask about. Secondly, I believe that we must use the turning point finally to force Mr Kostuníca to consider a truly fundamental political solution for the Kosovo region, and in my view that means autonomy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The future shape of the country is the subject of intensive discussion, and there is much talk of decentralisation, even in Serbia itself, and of a new relationship with the ethnic minorities. Another subject that is frequently discussed is the need to strengthen local government and, particularly in southern Serbia, the need to give the Albanian minority fair representation in the local authorities, where the rules have hitherto been stacked against them. Every act of violence, whether in southern Serbia or in Mitrovica, disrupts the painstaking peace process that is currently taking place in the Balkans. The Yugoslav and Serb authorities must naturally take a firm line in their dealings with the minorities. That is what we in Parliament have always advocated and will continue to advocate, and there is no room for compromise there. It is important, however, that the measures taken should be realistic. Elections in Kosovo are certainly one such measure, but they must be preceded by a precise definition of the powers and authority that the elected representatives will have.</p>
<p class="contents">The present problems cannot be solved overnight. They can only be solved by a consensus of all interested parties, states and ethnic groups. That is a complex process, and I entirely agree with Mrs Pack, perhaps not in detail but certainly in principle, that Europe must take the initiative here, because none of the parties in the Balkans enjoys the level of trust that would enable it to launch a successful peace initiative at this stage. Only the European Union enjoys that level of trust. Neither the United States of America nor Russia nor any of the Balkan States and societies have the requisite degree of authority. And if Europe were caught napping now, that would pose serious problems. I can only agree with another of the previous speakers, Mr Posselt, on the money issue. We already pay out enough in the world and in particular regions without having a stabilising influence. It must be different in the Balkans. We are willing to pay, but we also want to have a say, so that stability and peace can be established in the region.</p>

As regards Kosovo, we were already aware of many of the issues raised. We strongly condemn violence in all its forms and wish to combat organised crime. At the same time we fully support the United Nations’ mission and both the incoming and outgoing Special Representatives.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and UNMIK pillar responsible for economic development promotes the involvement and training of local communities, as you yourselves have outlined. This is perceived as a key issue underpinning our cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of speakers have raised a crucial issue, namely basic respect for democratic principles and the rights of minorities. We certainly share this concern. In particular, we are pursuing our efforts on behalf of Albanian Kosovar detainees in Serb prisons. The European Union has raised this matter on numerous occasions, most recently during the troika's visit to Belgrade last week.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware that the authorities are working on an amnesty law for the thousands of political prisoners imprisoned under the Milosevic regime. We know that in principle this law should have a very wide scope. Only a few hundred prisoners sentenced for acts of terrorism would be excluded, mostly Albanian Kosovars.</p>
<p class="contents">The authorities in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and in Serbia are dealing with each individual case under urgent procedure. It is, however, true that they have no intention of granting a general pardon. They have made it clear that they will not free a single prisoner, Serb or Albanian, who has been fairly sentenced for that type of offence.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the European Union is concerned, we shall continue to raise the issue and press for an early solution. We shall have this and other matters very much in mind in the coming months as we negotiate this year’s programme of aid to Serbia with both the Serb and the Yugoslav authorities. It is very important for all concerned that the new democratic authorities maintain their commitment to continue with the reforms outlined.</p>
<p class="contents">You raised another matter in the resolution, namely the problem of the tension in the Presevo valley in southern Serbia. The resolutions adopted are also in line with the political positions adopted by the Union, which unreservedly condemns violence and terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the European Union we have highlighted the moderation displayed by the new leaders of the Yugoslav Republic and Serbia and we urge them to continue in this vein. We all have to be very clear on one point. Some of you have already referred to it and we agree entirely with you. A new era is dawning in the Balkans and it must not be marred by violence from any source whatsoever. The European Union must therefore rejoice at the plan put forward by the authorities to solve the current crisis. This programme includes proposals for dealing with the grievances felt by the people of that poor and underdeveloped region, with all the attendant problems.</p>
<p class="contents">For our part, the European Union has just received the plan and is studying it. It is worth pointing out that this is Belgrade’s first attempt to reach a negotiated settlement through dialogue amongst the various ethnic groups in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. This is indeed important. Milosevic never attempted to do so. The principle of negotiation and dialogue warrants our support and will receive it.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is increasing the number of monitoring missions in the Presevo valley and the Commission is considering ways of increasing the already substantial aid devoted to the area. This currently amounts to approximately EUR 1 million for fuel and for educational and humanitarian programmes. The Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Covic, is due in Brussels today and will discuss the plan with the Commission too. For their part, the Member States are considering how they could contribute. KFOR is playing an important role in Kosovo in an effort to restrict the activities of the extremists. Furthermore, both UNMIK and the European Union are putting pressure on Albanian Kosovar politicians to distance themselves from the extremists in Presevo. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
