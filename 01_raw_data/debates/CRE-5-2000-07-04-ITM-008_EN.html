This procedure will begin with a trialogue on Thursday evening, followed by conciliation on the outcome of the trialogue in the traditional meeting of delegations at the time of the Council’s first reading. This meeting is due to take place on 20 July.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The new interinstitutional agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and the improvement of the budgetary procedure, which was concluded on 6 May last, have revised our old ad hoc procedure. Our current conciliation procedure has become the centrepiece of the procedure for interinstitutional cooperation in budgetary matters. This procedure now encompasses two topics, firstly the one that was covered by our old ad hoc procedure, i.e. agricultural expenditure, including the expenditure resulting from fisheries agreements, along with the EU financed CSFP expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">However we should also discuss all the other expenditure; at least discuss it, even if we cannot agree. Because the conciliation procedure creates the framework that makes it possible, as it says in the interinstitutional agreement, to continue the debate on overall expenditure development and the essential features of the budget for the coming financial year in the light of Commission’s preliminary draft budget. That is precisely the stage we are at now. </p>
<p class="contents">We are in possession of the Commission’s draft budget, and our motion will contain advice for the Council on its first reading of the budget. This advice will be clear and unequivocal. One of our main priorities was, is, and remains support for the peace and stability process in the Balkans. We asked for a multiannual programme for this as early as last year, so that the financing for this process would no longer have a hand-to-mouth existence but would be placed on a firm footing. We have already inserted a revision clause in the interinstitutional agreement to this end, in conjunction with the Council and the Commission. In addition, as early as December last year, we drew up a joint declaration, together with the Council, during our last second reading.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, the Commission has now presented a proposal for revision of the financial perspective and for a multiannual programme for the Western Balkans. It has also submitted a preliminary draft budget based on the revision of the financial perspective. We welcome this initiative from the Commission, because we believe that it is absolutely vital to revise the financial perspective if we are to honour the commitments entered into by the European Union in the Balkans. However we do not think that we should finance our aid to Kosovo and the Balkans simply by carrying out a multiannual redeployment of our traditional priorities in external policy, and making cutbacks in our cooperation with developing countries and in the aid we deliver to the poorest of the poor.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">By adopting Agenda 2000 we have already agreed to a 22% cut in heading 4, albeit only on condition that the appropriations needed for Kosovo and the Balkans are financed by fresh money.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, we are expecting the Council to enter into constructive negotiations with us to this end, and hope to reach a conclusion before the Council’s first reading.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Permit me to make a few comments on the traditional aspects of the ad hoc procedure. We take the view that when it comes to heading 1a, i.e. agriculture, we are completely justified in waiting until the Commission has sent its Letter of Amendment before we amend the ceilings. We are delighted that the Commission has budgetised in heading 1b the full amount available under the financial perspective, and we hope the Commission will be able to make full use of it.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Last year, Parliament fought tooth and nail for heading 1b. We are not so fickle as to behave any differently this year. But we certainly take a keen interest in the transformation of the nature of the appropriations for heading 1b into differentiated appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">As far as the fisheries agreements are concerned, we are expecting that as in previous ad hoc procedures, the Commission will submit updated, realistic figures before Parliament’s first reading that we will then be able to take into account.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">We think it is right and proper that the CFSP is becoming more and more of a Community policy, i.e. CFSP actions are being transferred from the Second Pillar to the First Pillar. However, we would like to press home to the Council that this must not lead to more and more cuts in the amounts available for our traditional external policy measures</p>
<p class="contents">What we absolutely cannot agree to is the Council’s attempt to finance the Special Envoys in its own budget. The gentlemen’s agreement only applies to administrative expenditure. The expenditure for the special representative is of an operational nature. If such a step was taken without the agreement of Parliament, then we would deem this a violation of the Interinstitutional Agreement on the part of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">That was the advice I wanted to give the Council. There will be more in the motion that we are due to vote on tomorrow. We expect the Council to take account of our deliberations and decisions in those of its own. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission has submitted a second preliminary draft on which the agricultural sector would certainly like to comment. </p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the European budget comes off worse compared to other major continents because there is less public funding available here compared to those other continents. Secondly, the budget has not yet reached the prescribed ceiling. I hope that the Council will make up the difference, if not, Parliament will be submitting proposals. </p>
<p class="contents">There are also a few other issues which have struck me. We need to try to use the budget efficiently. On the one hand, there is a reshuffle of the headings, also in this budget, which begs the question as to whether the relative stability or the European Union as a whole are safeguarded. Does the budget tie in sufficiently with discussions with a social dimension within the European Union, such as those pertaining to consumer affairs, the environment and animal welfare? The European Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is open to issues of this kind, also with regard to proposals which may or may not be submitted. </p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to the quality of policy, and in this connection, particular attention should be given to whether policy helps maintain a high-grade rural environment in Europe from a financial point of view. Can Europe’s rural environment count on adequate care and financial means? </p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development’s report and the opinion show that we welcome the deferment of the discussion regarding the EUR 300 million set aside for the reconstruction of the Balkans as far as it goes. The discussion has been postponed until October, but the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has pulled no punches in this respect. The second point I would like to make in this connection is that, since every year, we have some money left in the agricultural budget, it should be possible to use this money the year after i.e. to earmark it and not to return it. Thirdly, particularly in respect of agricultural policy, resources must be used more effectively and more pressure should be exerted on the Member States or the Commission in order to speed up the submission of plans which can then be implemented adequately. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our committee tabled two amendments for the report. Owing to tight meeting timetables, they have been brought to the plenary session via my own group, and I hope that they may be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 19 reminds everyone that there must be adequate payment appropriations for Structural Funds programmes, trans-European transport networks and other budget headings relating to transport, so that the programmes may be effectively implemented right at the start of the programming period. In this way payments made at the end of the programming period – as was the case the previous year – are avoided.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 20 concerns innovative measures. The appropriation must be kept at the level decided at Berlin. We have to remember that the Interinstitutional Agreement contains a pledge that the reduction in appropriations by EUR 200 million made the previous year should be made good this year. Our committee is not proposing to move appropriations set aside under the URBAN initiative to be used for innovative measures: the compensating appropriations have to be found elsewhere. The importance of innovation was stressed both at the Lisbon and Feira summits. Innovation must therefore be adequately supported. The implementation in practice of innovative measures in the area of Structural Funds has not got under way because preparatory work on the part of the Commission has lagged seriously behind.</p>
<p class="contents">Our committee supports the policy of support for employment and the importance of SMEs in Mrs Haug’s report. The Commission and the Member States should also simplify and speed up administration procedures relating to Structural Funds. More attention should be paid to the success of projects at approval stage.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If I need to mention the Special Envoys at all, it is because the Council is insisting on transferring the financing of the Special Envoys to the Council’s administrative budget. That may sound very sensible. The problem, however, is that, in doing so, there is a loss of the inspection and the control that of course exists in the case of budget items in the Commission’s budget. I therefore agree with what is stated in Mrs Haug’s report, namely that we must insist that these appropriations for Special Envoys remain on the Commission’s budget, for we in that way ensure continued parliamentary inspection and control and ensure that Parliament continues, for example, to be listened to and kept informed. In the Foreign Affairs Committee, we have been sufficiently constructive, however, as to think also about how a medium-term solution might possibly be found in a situation where negotiations with the Council were taking place. This can be read about in the Foreign Affairs Committee’s contribution to Mrs Haug’s report. For if the Council definitely wants these appropriations to appear in the Council’s budget, there is, of course, the possibility of the Council’s, in return, entering into a type of inter-institutional agreement with ourselves here in Parliament, whereby the Council promises to give us the same information, control, inspection facilities etc as if the appropriations had appeared in the Commission’s budget. That is, therefore, the Foreign Affairs Committee’s constructive contribution, and I should like to add that we, of course, also insist that, whenever anything new is adopted concerning the common foreign and security policy – be it in terms of expenditure or of initiatives – the Council must inform the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has indeed worked quite hard although, in the case of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I am afraid she was working so hard that she was not able to pay anything more than a goodwill visit to our committee. Therefore we have prepared the opinion which is before Parliament. I will briefly touch on some of the points that arise from it.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I want to support the points that are made by Mrs Haug concerning the implications of spending in the Balkans. It is a matter that has been of significant concern to the Industry Committee. We are particularly concerned about the implications for a wide range of the programmes that fall within our remit. It certainly is the case that, with the move to activity-based budgeting, we are moving away from the concept that everything that was previously in the budget has to be preserved for the future. Nonetheless a great deal of the programmes that are within our remit would be significantly affected by the spending proposals for the Balkans, unless Mrs Haug is successful. So on behalf of the Industry Committee I should like to voice our support for her in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents">In two particular areas we are affected by multiannual programmes. I want to reiterate our commitment in the research area. I recognise that this is not a matter that is affected by the budget on this occasion, but we should not ignore the changes we are seeing in the energy sphere with Save and Altener. The figures that we see are seeing for Save, where there is a significant reduction in the budget for energy efficiency schemes, are a result of the budgetary process last year. That is only just now coming through.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point I want to make in the trade sphere relates to the need for us to ensure that the omnibus regulation for the transatlantic dialogue is adapted. I hope the Commissioner will take that on board.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As rapporteur for this committee, I would just like to highlight three points that are of interest to the committee, within the context of the conciliation procedure. One concerns the information campaign in the last phase before the introduction of the euro bank notes and coins. The remaining time will have to be used intensively, which means that the information campaign for the euro (PRINCE 2001) must be continued with high priority. We must step up the information campaign so as to avoid any uncertainty on the part of the public, particularly in the run-up to the introduction of the euro banknotes and in view of the exchange rate parity between the euro and the dollar.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon guidelines constitute a second important point in the eyes of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. In addition to providing sufficient means and technologies for SME, it is also important to support programmes and actions that improve the self-financing and outside financing facilities for the Union’s key players on the job creation front. This includes developing markets for financial services, providing risk capital, but also giving special attention to female entrepreneurship, as has already been called for by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in the guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">My third point concerns the debate about personnel. If the Commission wants to honour its Treaty obligations in respect of merger control, anti-trust law and state aids then my committee believes that the Commission should make the Directorate-General for Competition a top priority when it comes to the redistribution of personnel in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is almost as if the Commission has forgotten that we committed ourselves to establishing full employment again in the European Union, when we were in Lisbon, which is something President Chirac emphasised again before this House only this morning.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">How else are we to explain the fact that of all the budget headings, it is the one for local commitment for employment that the Commission wants to completely do away with? I am appalled by the idea, and have every right to be, given that only in April, the Commission issued a statement highlighting the importance of the local dimension to Europe’s employment strategy. This budget heading was one of Parliament’s initiatives. We wanted more money for employment and we wanted to gather more experience of similar projects over three years so as to be able to subsequently arrive at a legal basis. Hence there are, of course, no possible circumstances under which we would endorse the Commission’s decision on this, simply because, as a Commission, you have run out of ideas at the moment for promoting innovative measures in the Social Fund. We very much hope that the Council will side with Parliament in this matter, and that we will in fact be able to retain this employment initiative.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">It is equally unacceptable and completely incomprehensible that the Commission wants to make drastic cutbacks of 32% and 18% respectively in the budget headings for the action plans against social exclusion and discrimination, even though social coherence in the European Union is precisely what we are always calling for, and only this morning we again had an extensive debate on the anti-discrimination package. I believe the Commission knows full well that we have no intention of supporting this cutback, and here too we are relying on the joint discussions.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">At any event, I hope to see some movement from the Council and the Commission with regard to the points I have mentioned. The same goes for the non-governmental organisations and the budgetary line for health protection in the workplace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must support our fishing industry and help it to be placed on an equal level with giants such as the United States, Russia or Japan.</p>
<p class="contents">As draftsperson of the Committee on Fisheries, I would like to express my satisfaction with the Committee on Budgets’ support for our proposals on the international fishing organisations and agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I will refer to our contribution to the international organisations. In an increasingly globalised world, the Union must increase its presence in these organisations which regulate offshore fishing, for reasons of prestige, good management of resources and, above all, the defence of the interests of our industry and our workers.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the international agreements. This six-month period, with the French Presidency of the Council, will be decisive in terms of completing the negotiation of these agreements, including, amongst others, the Fisheries Agreement with Morocco.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all concerned about the prolonged inactivity – seven months now – of the Community fleet which was fishing in Moroccan waters. This is by far the European Union’s most important agreement in this area and our main priority: five hundred boats, thousands of fishermen out of work and many economically paralysed areas depend on its renewal.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate Mrs Haug on her work, which has not been easy, and I am happy that the amounts envisaged by the Commission for the funding of the agreements to be negotiated in 2000 and 2001, the agreement with Morocco amongst others, have been respected.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, Mrs Haug, your report is a clear sign of the European Parliament’s support for the Community’s negotiators and for the thousands of European families who are impatiently waiting for the negotiations to be concluded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, the Committee on Development and Cooperation is extremely keen to radically expand its budget compared to last year, because we have 45 million children in Africa with no primary education and an increasing number of poor in the world, whilst our continent is becoming increasingly rich. </p>
<p class="contents">But we maintain a sense of realism. We are prepared to make do with reducing spending to the 2000 level and thus cancel out the cut-backs which the Commission proposed in favour of financing Kosovo. No more, no less. We are aware of the broad support we enjoy in this Parliament. </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the issue of modernising the budget is essential. This morning, we talked about the 1998 discharge. The way this discharge is currently organised leaves a great deal to be desired. With our help, the Commission would like to change tack. The new approach involves a clear definition of goals and sectors within regional programmes, explicit grouping of sector-specific goals and a clear division of budget lines. We will, as a result, be able to deploy personnel where they are needed to carry out the activities. This results in a classification according to DAC sectors. It is a modernised budget and at the same time, it will inform us whether we have actually achieved the results projected in the budget, as will be apparent from the reports in Parliament. This budget, therefore, also accommodates the EDF budget, although we are not harmonised legally but we are in terms of content. The sum total will, as it were, show that we are clearly focussed on fighting poverty across different sectors. </p>
<p class="contents">We very much hope that with this line of attack, namely a modernised budget, we will be able to turn the negative image, about which Commissioner Patten had every right to complain so bitterly, into a positive image of a Europe which is open to fighting poverty at world level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are gradually gaining an understanding of the positions being adopted by the Commission, particularly with regard to the preliminary draft budget, and the Council will soon state its position. I believe that in the course of this complex process, whilst Parliament is working towards consensus on its views amongst Members so that it can advocate these views as vigorously as possible, it must demand complete clarification of the Commission’s proposals, as well as objectivity in the Council’s position. Parliament must then move forward, as a whole, with its own position. So we have reached a stage in the clarification process when “wait and see” stance is appropriate. It seems pointless at this juncture to make threats, to proclaim Parliament’s power or to put forward all of our views at once. Everyone realises, or will realise, the importance of the European Parliament in the budgetary process and how important it is to achieve consensus in this process. </p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, we need to know more about certain fundamental issues, such as: </p>
<p class="contents">- implementation of the 2000 budget, especially both parts 1-A and 1-B of heading 1, “Agriculture”;</p>
<p class="contents">- evaluating the reductions proposed by the Commission in internal policy sectors – heading 3 – particularly bearing in mind the justification for these reductions and their effects on the policies that have been targeted; </p>
<p class="contents">- promoting an in-depth analysis of the proposals for reforming the Commission, including the staffing needs of the directorates-general and its policy on externalisation; </p>
<p class="contents">- identifying the priorities of the Council and the Commission with regard to external actions – heading 4 – and clarifying the relationship between commitments and payments under this heading, by investigating the reasons for the worrying delay in the implementation of commitments and by ascertaining the quality of the expenditure; </p>
<p class="contents">- gaining full information on what is being proposed in the new programme for the Western Balkans, including Serbia and Kosovo, particularly with regard to its financing;</p>
<p class="contents">- information on how it is intended to finance the common security and defence policy. </p>
<p class="contents">As you will see just from these examples, what we need to know goes well beyond the discussion on financing the Western Balkans. In fact, it would be a mistake for the European Parliament to reduce the discussion of the 2001 budget to this one issue. </p>
<p class="contents">I have two final observations. Taking the appropriations for payment as a point of reference, in 2000 these totalled 1.11% of the gross national product of the Member States, but a lower amount is being proposed for 2001, corresponding to 1.0%. Does it make sense to try to deepen the European project and at the same time to reduce the relative value of the European Union budget year on year? And, bearing in mind the figures that I have just mentioned, does it make sense to discuss the financing of new priorities and to actually question some of the priorities already established, while at the same time returning considerable unutilised sums to the Member States? I congratulate Mrs Haug on her fine work.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If you look at the Haug report, Parliament wants to find a solution. We are actually looking for agreement with the Council on the way to get a good budget by the end of this year. Let us get that point clear. We are not looking for confrontation, we are actually looking for a way of cooperating together. But do not be fooled into thinking that we are not prepared to take hard decisions if necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">It is pretty hard to get an agreement when the Council just ignores Article 20 of the Interinstitutional Agreement. Ever since the PDB was published by the Commission they have been duty bound to discuss with us the revision of the Financial Perspective which was proposed by the Commission. They have failed to do that. On two occasions we have asked them for trialogues and we have been refused. That makes it pretty difficult. And that will be at the forefront of our discussions at the trialogue this week and in the conciliation on 20 July. Whatever the Council votes on 20 July we will still be making that point in the autumn when it comes to our first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">From the very first trialogue of this year with the Portuguese Presidency, the one thing that was obvious to everyone is that we need an agreement between the three institutions on the funding for the western Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pretty sure Parliament has a position now. The Council's position is about 200 million less than ours, which means that we will not get an agreement on that and unless we have an agreement there is going to be a problem in how we fund the needs in category 4.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems now that there might be some possibility of redeploying funds from the MEDA programme to help solve our problem. For an institution that tells us that what was agreed in Berlin was set in concrete, I think the Council has a bit of a cheek in moving large sums of money from the MEDA programme which they agreed 12 months ago and then lecturing us about what can and cannot be moved. Having said that, we are of course, prepared to listen to the Council, to hear what their suggestions are and I look forward to our trialogue this week and the conciliation meeting on 20 July.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report under discussion concerns Parliament’s provisional position on the budget in the conciliation talks that are to be held. Just as Mr Wynn said, the problems really mainly concern Category 4: External Action, and the reconstruction of the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">Last Spring the Commission proposed the so-called CARDS programme for the reconstruction of the Western Balkans. Its total value is EUR 5.5 billion. EUR 1.9 billion has already been found for the programme; of the remainder, EUR 1.4 billion would be found by the reallocation of Category 4 funds, and 1.8 billion by moving funds from the section of the budget dealing with agriculture. The sum to be reallocated is therefore approximately 5% of the total sum under Category 4, so that it may be technically possible, given there is sufficient political will. However, the use of agricultural expenditure for the reconstruction of Kosovo is not fair, as each EU citizen must play a part in the work and not just the farming community. In addition, the future needs of agriculture are hard to estimate, as the Agenda 2000 reforms are only just starting and the WTO talks are in their elementary stages.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal for the CARDS programme is explicit and our group supports it. EU Member States have to bear the responsibility for the reconstruction of the Balkans, as most of them were keen supporters of the military action there, and many also took part in it. Unless the countries of Europe help th–e inhabitants of the Balkans in their reconstruction work, honourably and vigorously, then this could result in a deep feeling of resentment and bitterness that could last for generations. Military action is always an extreme measure, and somebody must always suffer the consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">When the Interinstitutional Agreement between the Council and Parliament, which contained the financial perspectives for the years 2000 – 2006, was made, it was forecast that the reconstruction of Kosovo might call for ‘fresh’ resources. This is stated in point 3 of Mrs Haug’s report. The Council has, however, signalled that it will not adopt any amendment to the financial perspectives – not even between categories. The CARDS programme is so huge that it is impossible to adapt it to the present financial perspectives. There are two alternatives ahead: to fund just part of the programme, or table an amendment to the financial perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is responsible for the reconstruction of the Balkans. If it merely promises money, but is not prepared to give it, its credibility as a global player shrinks. In that case Parliament will have to act within the framework of the financial perspectives, which will mean severe cutbacks in the CARDS programme.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For the first time since the Berlin Agreement, negotiations will take place in the Council before first reading regarding a possible review of the financial perspective. My groups welcomes this development. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s initiative is necessary in order to finance the Stability Pact for the Balkans. We also endorse the plan to earmark resources for Serbia in the post-Milosevic era. Due to the Council’s attitude in last year’s difficult negotiations, there is insufficient trust in political pledges without a financial picture to match. But although we agree with the thrust of the Commission’s plan, my group would probably have reached different conclusions regarding the size and distribution of the proposed reductions under the external policy heading. As it stands now, the civil society, i.e. activities by non-governmental organisations in terms of human rights projects, is proportionately having to foot the lion’s share of the bill, and this seems to me a recipe for disaster if we want to achieve stability in the long run. My group hopes that the Council is prepared to take a constructive stance and at long last to live up to its pledge to make sufficient resources available for new priorities, such as the Stability Pact, without causing lasting damage to existing policy, which is put on the back burner for reasons other than content. This request has not yet been met – or so it seems, which is detrimental. The EU’s credibility will be in the balance, and in my opinion, this is a bad start for the further development of the EU’s foreign and security policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time the reconstruction of Kosovo, after the illegal war there, is being financed at the expense of other countries receiving aid, in a way that is improper and dishonest. Our group supports the former position expressed by Parliament, according to which the Council must agree to amend the financial perspectives, particularly with regard to Category 4. Waging wars and rebuilding countries must not be allowed to happen at the expense of former preferences in the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">We also support the committee’s position according to which expenditure set aside for a common foreign and security policy is operational expenditure, which must remain the budgetary responsibility of the Commission. That will clarify the context in which discharge is granted. Furthermore, the granting of discharge must also concern a common foreign and security policy. However, we will not support the Council and Commission line wherein the main political focus will not shift at all towards the prevention of unemployment.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, the budget with its EUR 93 million in payment appropriations represents a 5% increase, whereas national budgets are subject to greater austerity. However, the European agricultural budget is also experiencing a period of austerity, even though outwardly it appears to have grown by 7%. Agricultural revenue has dropped and so this 7% is a mere illusion; we have simply moved from a price support policy to an income support policy. We are witnessing the continued, and wholly scandalous, misappropriation of EUR 300 million of agricultural funds for the reconstruction of Kosovo, as though the Balkans formed part of the CAP! The CAP is being drastically cut back to the advantage of the CFSP and, as you will see, this is being carried out with no modification to the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">We are here as part of a consultation procedure that the Treaties do not provide for and we are operating within the framework of an Interinstitutional Agreement of May 1999 that the Treaties do not provide for either. Over the past 20 years, non-essential expenditure has increased from 5% to more than 45% of the total budget expenditure without any modification to the Treaties. We have carried out an institutional revolution, to Parliament’s advantage, without an IGC. Does this mean that the institutions are to adapt spontaneously or that the European Commission and Council will be able to operate with 20-21 members just as they do with 15 and, empirically speaking, solutions will be found?</p>
<p class="contents">If at the IGC in Nice we tried to make enlargement conditional upon deepening, this would be viewed as a pretext for delaying the entry of the countries of the East, and Poland has recently voiced its displeasure at this. We are all aware that the accession of the countries of the East would mean a budgetary revolution and increased taxes. In other words, the revolution that looks set to take place in European affairs over the coming ten years is not an institutional one but a budgetary and tax one.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a mistake to make cuts in heading 1, for agriculture is an essential factor in our economy, the economy of the European Union. Agriculture is certainly a fundamental part of any debate on boosting development or employment, not because any of us are agriculture lobbyists but because agriculture must not lose its funding. This point must be stressed, although the report also stresses the difficulty of finding sources of funding for that most remarkable and certainly important operation to be carried out in Kosovo. My question is this: is it possible to carry out the Kosovo operation without taking funds away from other credit lines in our budget? And the answer is that yes, it is possible, it can be done without cutting other credit lines or interfering with sectors which are fundamental for the development of the economy within the European Union but rather giving them financial security for, if we do not do so, we will certainly weaken the European market and the euro against their competitors, NAFTA and the dollar.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, since we profess to have an ongoing budgetary policy which must certainly be focused chiefly on boosting economic development and the economic growth of the individual countries, it is not at all sensible to be financing operations such as the Kosovo operation<span class="bold"> </span>if this means that we cannot predict the extent to which we will be able to finance budget credit lines.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the very fact that the Council is setting a precedent by including Special Envoys and all our special interventions in its own budget lines is a serious matter. This must stop. It must be seen as highly negative. In my opinion, if we invert this trend, we will be doing a great favour to both our economy and Parliament.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also congratulate her on her efforts to reach a consensus, which is a very difficult job. There is an irrefutable fact in her report: category 4, which was approved in Berlin, may become insufficient if we continue to add the funding of new commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the implementation figures for programmes outside the European Union are very poor and in some cases this is the fault of third countries and in others, the majority of cases, it is the fault of the Commission. What is clear is that the budgetary implementations do not match the effort made in recent years to introduce these programmes into the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we have the problem of the European Councils. Every six months we have new commitments to finance because the Council has identified new priorities without consulting Parliament. Over time, all of this is resulting in a postponement of the decision on the non-obligatory expenses incurred by the Council, and this decision and postponement were not provided for in the Interinstitutional Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, I would like to say that Terence Wynn’s position seems to me to be very coherent. This is logical, since he is also chairman of the Committee on Budgets. I believe that – as he says – we must enter into trialogue with very open minds. It is clear that nobody is managing to give a reliable estimate of what is needed in Kosovo. It is also true that if we have to cut the external programmes, we must do so according to a principle of linearity and if it is not done in that way, somebody somewhere is assuming a very great responsibility. Ladies and gentlemen, the Interinstitutional Agreement is something this House must maintain. If anybody is going to be irresponsible, let it not be us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is almost a carbon copy of the procedure for the 2000 budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, the insufficiency of what was adopted in Berlin, in March 1999, for external policy, rocks the foundations of the Community budget. The Council’s short-sightedness hinders any logical solution. Rather than a budgetary cycle, ladies and gentlemen, it appears that we have a budgetary big wheel.</p>
<p class="contents">Somehow or other, the Commission has honoured its commitment to propose a multi-annual plan for the Balkans. However, sincerely, I agree to a large extent with the Council’s criticism that the figures do not seem particularly well founded. As the former MEP, Lord Tomlinson, said, there is nothing more expensive than a meal amongst Foreign Affairs Ministers: they are always ready to promise money without considering where it will come from.</p>
<p class="contents">I truly believe that the proposal is rather inappropriate and has no sense of time. They are proposing to move funds intended for agriculture to foreign policy and these proposals have not even been accepted by the United Kingdom. Just imagine. That is no way to make progress.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Serbia, they propose more than EUR 2 billion over the period. I would like to remind you, ladies and gentlemen, that in order to topple Pinochet, the European Community spent EUR 10 million. Our contribution to the campaign against Pinochet in the referendum was EUR 10 million.</p>
<p class="contents">We spend EUR 40 million a year on the democratic forces in Serbia and they are asking for two hundred and something more. When Milosevic falls, I will be the first to accept a revision of the financial perspectives. However, meanwhile, let us forget the annual EUR 200 million from now until the end of the period. Let us not push things to the limit.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and Gentlemen, I do not know if the Council is aware of the real situation. If it rules out – as it has ruled out – moving money from category 1A, Agriculture, to category 4, and does not accept any increase in the ceiling of category 4 for foreign policy, and all of this must be done by means of a redistribution of resources, we are simply dealing with a case of a non-revision of the financial perspectives. We are simply dealing with a case of budgetary procedure in the field of non-obligatory expenditure and, therefore, the most that could be said would be that the Council has not complied with Article 20 of the Interinstitutional Agreement.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In respect of the fisheries budget, I note that an increase of over 27% is proposed in the funding of international agreements. These are the southern agreements with third countries which enable EU vessels to fish in the waters of Morocco, Mauritania, Argentina and elsewhere. I must remind the House that these agreements currently cost EU taxpayers EUR 269 million a year and are primarily of benefit to the fishing fleets of Spain, Portugal and France. These southern agreements are always calculated on a cash-for-fish basis while northern agreements on the other hand are arranged on a reciprocal basis. It is this disparity between southern and northern Member States which is evident in the CAP as well as in the CFP budget. For example, the Commission recently announced an arbitrary cut in export refunds which will cost the Scotch whisky industry around EUR 32 million a year. Their explanation was simply that Scotch whisky is a rich industry and therefore does not require any subsidy.</p>
<p class="contents">Why then do we discover that it is intended to increase the subsidy to wine growers by 64.5% next year, taking the budget to over EUR 1 billion? Why is the olive oil industry receiving an 8.9% increase providing them with almost EUR 2.5 billion next year, and most shockingly of all, how on earth can we justify giving to tobacco growers an increase of 2.8% taking their subsidies to over EUR 1 billion when we know that tobacco products kill half a million of our citizens every year.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, the beleaguered dairy sector with dairy farmers suffering across the EU will receive a paltry increase of funding of only 0.3%. Let us make sure the budget is for all EU citizens and not just for the southern EU Member States.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the rapporteur explained, today’s debate is by way of preparation for the Council’s first reading of the 2001 Budget on 20 July, mainly so as to be able to discuss in detail the votes on compulsory expenditure, i.e. agricultural market expenditure, fisheries expenditure, the fisheries agreements and the draft for the external and security policy expenditure. Consequently, we have the opportunity this week, to set the appropriate course for the trialogue.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The trialogue will probably major on the general growth rates for the 2001 Budget as compared with the 2000 financial year. To reiterate the point once again, the Commission proposal provides for an increase of 5% in the payment appropriations, and an increase of 3.9% in the commitment appropriations. It was not easy to achieve this outcome because the additional requirements for the Stability Pact had to be accommodated and Agenda 2000 involved adopting a very high growth rate in respect of agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The Council made the proposal in its preliminary preparations in the Budget Committee that a growth rate of only 3.5% in respect of payment appropriations and 2.8% in respect of commitment appropriations be provided for, and of course it would only be possible to sustain a drop of that magnitude, given the high proportion of expenditure on agriculture, if we were to make larger cutbacks under the agriculture heading than the Commission has proposed. I am really quite amazed that the Council’s Budget Committee has already proposed more far-reaching savings in the agricultural sector than the Commission, notably to the tune of half a billion euros.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">This beggars belief given the debates that have taken place in the public arena on the Commission proposal, but of course the question remains as to how willing people are to say that savings of this kind can be employed in other areas. A case in point is that of the question mark over external policy aid. This is where the Council, unlike the Commission, is proposing a reduced package of EUR 400 million in commitment appropriations. The Commission considers this proposal to be lacking in the necessary political foresight, in view of the tasks we have before us on the external policy front.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Naturally the Commission welcomes Parliament’s support in respect of the Balkans policy, and I would like to thank you for this, and especially for having this debate, which I believe has afforded some crucial insights. The Council says that the Balkans policy is a high priority, but it is has still made an inadequate financing proposal in my view. The Commission has pointed out that aid for Bosnia is being cut, for example, and that Albania and Montenegro have not exactly been generously provided for in terms of appropriations, on the contrary, only one commitment is being honoured in our view. We must also be sure to provide the necessary funding for the commitments we have in Kosovo – which, thankfully, are now being administered effectively owing to the reconstruction agency – so as to be able to pursue a successful policy here, because this area, more than any other, is a touchstone for the European Union’s common foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I would like briefly to go into the issue of the fisheries agreements. We will certainly have an unusual situation to contend with in 2001, given that numerous agreements are due to be renegotiated or extended, even though it is not yet clear as to when the agreements will be re-concluded and at what cost. This could easily lead to a shortfall in the appropriations provided, although I believe there is in fact support for the Commission’s proposal not to provide too low a level of appropriations here. The Commission will submit its new estimate of the necessary expenditure in October, whereupon it will be possible to plan more precisely for this sector than is perhaps the case at present.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Speakers have mentioned in the course of their interventions that there are serious differences of opinion, particularly where the revision of the financial perspective is concerned. On behalf of the Commission, I can only repeat once again that as far as we are concerned, our mission in the Balkans – which could not be taken account of in last year’s financial planning – is so important that we are right to make an adjustment. That really is not to say that we should decide to amend the financial perspective every time there is a fresh requirement, only that the Commission believes we are justified in doing so when important new tasks crop up.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">There is another point I would like to make on behalf of the Commission, and it concerns the field of external policy. We have proposed that EUR 30 million be earmarked in the 2001 Budget for the Rapid Reaction Fund, which is used for non-military crisis prevention. The Council has proposed that the fund should take a cut of EUR 10 million and that the appropriations for CFSP should be increased by 10 million in return. It is the Commission’s belief that we ought not to weaken this new instrument of non-military crisis management, i.e. the Rapid Reaction Fund, from the outset. </p>
<p class="contents">I have this to say about Mrs Haug’s report: you have issued another reminder that the Commission must also come up with the documents it has promised in respect of the administration of the external policy, under the heading ‘externalisation’. I would again point out that we are working very hard on finding a solution that will centralise control over the project cycle in the future, mainly – and this is a major area of concern to me personally – so as to reduce the amount of time between the moment we engage in overseas commitments and the point at which funds are ultimately released.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the rapporteur and the Committee on Budgets. I hope we may be able to use the next few weeks to find more common ground than differences of opinion, so as to be able to get off to a good start with the budgetary negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
