<p>The Barcelona Process does not provide for observer status. Libya, as a country with a Mediterranean coastline, is eligible to join the Process, but it was not in a position to do so at the beginning for political reasons. Following the suspension of UN and EU sanctions in 1999, Libya was invited to take part in the Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference in Stuttgart, as a guest of the presidency. At the same conference it was agreed that Libya should be invited to join the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, on condition that it accepts the Barcelona Process ‘acquis’ in full.</p>
<p>Yemen has recently asked the EU Member States and the Commission to support its desire to join the Barcelona Process; it has said it will accept observer status should full membership prove impossible for the present.

<p>The UK Government’s acceptance of insurance companies’ requests to be allowed to carry out DNA tests on their clients in order to ascertain whether they have any genetic predisposition towards the future development of a serious disease has set alarm bells ringing amid fears that it will give rise to widespread use of a nightmarish form of genetic racism, whose victims will mainly be workers. Such profit-motivated efforts to exploit and divert the course of scientific progress and knowledge are inherently in serious danger of creating a ruthless form of genetic screening which leaves anyone not belonging to the genetic ‘master race’ without insurance, a career or even a job.</p>

<p>At the meeting of the General Affairs Council on 5 October 1998, the Council expressed its indignation and condemned those responsible for the massacre at Racak in the strongest possible terms. Furthermore, with a view to making a substantial contribution to the investigations of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), on 22 December 1998 the Council approved, under Article J.3 of the Treaty on European Union, a Joint Action with the aim of dispatching an EU Forensic Expert Team as quickly as possible, with uninhibited access to the locations to be inspected, in order to investigate this case and inform the Council of its conclusions. Article 1 of the Annex to the Joint Action, which came into force on 1 January 1999, set out the mandate of the EU forensic experts, but did not stipulate a date for its expiry nor did it include any renewal or review clause. The Expert Team’s report on the incident at Racak was presented to the Council on 17 March 1999.</p>
<p>All the Member States of the European Union have decided to fully cooperate with the ICTY and to fulfil their obligations under the relevant Security Council resolutions. As the President of the ICTY noted on 31 May 1999, these obligations include the obligation on all states and organisations holding information on alleged crimes coming under the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to communicate that information to the Office of the Prosecutor.</p>
<p>The Council, to which the Expert Team duly presented its report, has respected these obligations, as in the first half of 1999, during the German Presidency, it communicated the results of the autopsies on the victims of the massacre at Racak to the ICTY. In June 2000, the Expert Team intends to present to the Council its final report covering all its activities and conclusions under the 1999-2000 Joint Action.</p>
<p>Carla dal Ponte, the ICTY Prosecutor, stated on 29 September 1999 after her appointment that the ICTY would continue to investigate crimes committed during the armed conflict in Kosovo and would bring those responsible to trial at the Court of First Instance in The Hague.</p>
<p>The Council does not consider it appropriate to make any further comment on pending cases.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0405"></a>

If so, is the Council aware of the need to make the Indian authorities aware, in an explicit and concrete manner, of its willingness to do this? Furthermore, is the Council aware of the adverse, and indeed dissuasive, effect that the introduction of an increasing number of political, social and environmental criteria into economic and commercial negotiations, including the WTO negotiations, is having on the development of Euro-Indian relations?

<p>The Council does not share the honourable Member’s view that the focus of the Union’s policy on Asia is exclusively on China, and does not therefore see any urgent need for a significant change of policy. The Council will continue to pursue the Union’s broad objective of maintaining and promoting balanced relations with all the main Asian countries, such as Japan, China, India and Korea and the ASEAN countries, such as Indonesia.</p>
<p>Against this general background, the Union’s decision to arrange the first ever EU-India Summit in Lisbon on 28 June is a clear indication of the EU’s political will to strengthen the existing relations between both parties, based on the results of the long and fruitful cooperation between Europe and India, and to translate them into a new strategic dimension for the twenty-first century. On the basis of the universal values of democracy and respect for human rights, for the rule of law and for fundamental freedoms which the Union shares with India, the Union intends, at this first summit, to strengthen the existing cooperation and dialogue, to promote economic growth and bilateral trade on the basis of a precise multilateral standards-based system, to enhance contacts between their respective peoples, and to step up cultural, educational and scientific exchanges. The Union will also endeavour to secure India’s commitment to cooperation on peace matters and in resolving regional conflicts by means of dialogue and through confidence-building measures, and efforts on India’s part to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Lastly, the Union will endeavour to strengthen cooperation with India in areas of common interest such as defending and promoting human rights, protecting the environment, and combating terrorism and drugs.</p>
<p>With regard to relations between the EU and India in the WTO framework, India has indicated that it is willing to enter into a new round of negotiations, despite the existence of non-trade matters to be dealt with outside the negotiations, such as the protection of workers’ fundamental rights and environmental protection, and also investment and competition. Furthermore, the EU wishes a global trade round covering a wide range of subjects, including non-trade issues, to commence as soon as possible. </p>
<p>These different approaches adopted by the EU and India towards future WTO developments will not, as the honourable Member suggests, have an adverse affect on relations between the two parties. On the contrary, the long and fruitful cooperation between Europe and India to which I have referred ensures that we will maintain a constructive dialogue which will enable us to explain our respective positions much more clearly and will, I hope, lead to a convergence in our points of view.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0416"></a>

<p>With reference to its oral answer in March (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2000-0252_EN.html">H-0252/00</a>), the Council wishes to stress that the military operations against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia were approved by NATO, not by the EU. Any question on that decision should be addressed to the EU Member States who are also members of NATO. The Council deeply deplores the human rights violations in Chechnya and has adopted a series of measures to improve the human rights situation and to ensure that those responsible for such crimes are brought to trial.</p>
<p>The Council has repeatedly urged Russia to stop the human rights violations in Chechnya and has called for an independent national inquiry on human rights so as to ensure that its findings are impartial. It accordingly approved a resolution at the April session of the UN Human Rights Commission. Furthermore, it has successfully exerted pressure for a presence by the international organisations in Chechnya.</p>
<p>In fact, in response to increasing international pressure, Russia has taken several steps in the right direction: it has created a National Public Commission on Human rights and it has permitted the publication of a report by the Committee for the Prevention of Torture. It has accepted the return of the OSCE Support Group, and has agreed to give NGOs and the ICRC access to Chechnya. In addition, it has agreed that two experts from the Council of Europe should be present in Mr Kalamanov’s office. Lastly, the President-in-Office of the OSCE and the troika of EU Heads of Mission in Moscow have visited the region.</p>
<p>The Council will closely follow developments following these measures and will take every opportunity at its disposal to convey to the Russians its concern about the human rights situation in Chechnya, the next such opportunity being the EU-Russian Summit on 29 May.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The situation in Presevo in Serbia is particularly critical: separatist elements are making their presence felt and stepping up their activities in an alarming manner, and incidents involving the illegal movement and transit of weapons to regions with a strong Albanian-speaking presence are on the increase. This situation is exacerbating existing fears, and there are signs that the flashpoint is spreading beyond Kosovo to other regions of Serbia, which will have unforeseeable consequences for the stability of the region as a whole.</p>
<p>How does the Council view this situation one year after the adoption of UN Resolution 1244? Does it not consider that this tension is being exacerbated by the declared objective of the EU – which is contrary to international law – to overturn the legally elected government of Serbia and to violate the basic right of a people to decide which government it wants? Does it not also agree that the central objective of the EU policy in the Balkans must be to preserve the status quo of borders and consequently to preserve the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and its federal states?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council agrees that it is necessary, as a matter of urgency, to bring an end to the continuing tensions in Kosovo and to the fresh outbreak of ethnic violence there. It also shares the honourable Member’s concerns about the risk of tension spreading beyond Kosovo, and in particular to the Presevo Valley. Accordingly, both the Presidency and the Secretary-General/High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Mr Javier Solana, have repeatedly pressed Kosovo’s Albanian leaders to refrain from taking any action which could cause violence to escalate in the Presevo region. The EU also fully supports KFOR’s efforts to control the administrative border between Kosovo and the border regions of southern Serbia.</p>
<p>The Council is firmly convinced that a satisfactory solution for Kosovo is key to the stability of the whole region. Against this background, the European Union’s objective continues to be to create a democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo within the internationally recognised borders of the Former Republic of Yugoslavia. To this end, the EU entirely supports the efforts being made by the international community to secure the full implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1244, as it supports the efforts being made by UNMIK and KFOR to prevent the escalation of violence, to facilitate the safe return of all those who have fled their homes and to create a viable administration in Kosovo.</p>
<p>The Council has repeatedly called on Kosovo’s political leaders to adopt urgent measures with a view to avoiding further incidents and disturbances, to condemn violence and extremism, to expel extremists from within their ranks and to support UNMIK and KFOR. The Council has warned that its assistance in Kosovo also depends on the progress made with inter-ethnic reconciliation and the implementation of all aspects of UN Security Council Resolution 1244.</p>
<p>The Council is committed to the process of democratisation and coexistence. Only by the representatives of minorities sharing responsibilities will it be possible to help to construct a multi-ethnic Kosovo. The Council accordingly welcomes the decision made by certain Serbian leaders in Kosovo to take part in the Joint Interim Administrative Structure. The Council also considers it of the utmost importance that UNMIK and the OSCE should make careful preparations for the municipal elections due to be held this year, including arrangements for postal votes and the participation of minorities. In this respect, it is vital that all ethnic groups take part in the municipal elections if they are to be representative.</p>
<p>With a view to supporting this democratisation and coexistence process, the EU is cooperating with other members of the international community to rebuild the daily lives of Kosovo’s entire population, regardless of their ethnic origin. Apart from the significant bilateral aid granted by the Member States in 1999/2000, the European Community has made humanitarian aid to the value of EUR 429 million available to refugees from Kosovo, to persons displaced within the region and to returnees. Reconstruction and exceptional financial assistance, including support for UNMIK, will total EUR 437 million between 1999 and 2000. Finally, the Council notes that the creation of the “fourth pillar” of UNMIK – economic reconstruction – is being carried out under the aegis of the European Union, and has already indicated the importance of this pillar for the future of peace in Kosovo.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0423"></a>

<p>The draft resolution on the human rights situation in China, tabled by the US delegation at the 56th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, was not put to the vote, following the adoption, on 18 April 2000, of a ‘non-intervention motion’ based on the draft resolution tabled by the Chinese delegation.</p>
<p>The Council regrets the fact that a non-intervention motion of this kind was, once again, tabled and adopted. In line with the position which the EU has repeatedly adopted in the Commission on Human Rights, the Council, as a matter of principle, favours voting against any non-intervention motion which is visibly intended to prevent that body from dealing with situations existing in particular countries. No country, large or small, should be permitted to exploit procedural instruments in order to avoid being criticised or judged by the international community.</p>
<p>On 20 March 2000, the Council decided that in the event of the resolution being put to the vote the EU Member States which are members of the Commission on Human Rights (D, F, E, I, LUX, P, UK) would vote in favour. This position reflects the deep concern at the human rights situation in China which is shared by the European Parliament, civil society and NGOs.</p>
<p>A degree of progress has been made in improving the legal system and bolstering social and economic rights; nonetheless, scant progress is evident at ground level, especially concerning civil society and political rights. The Council is deeply disturbed at the constant and pervasive constraints on fundamental freedoms, above all on the freedom to hold meetings and the freedoms of expression and association. It has also observed, with deep concern, the frequency with which the death penalty is applied in China, as well as the continued existence of administrative detention camps in which people can be held without proper legal assistance and, in most cases, without a fair trial.</p>

<p>Bulgaria, Lithuania and Slovakia have undertaken commitments for early closure of their non-upgradeable nuclear reactors. These reactors will thus be definitively shutdown in accordance with agreed timetables. The decommissioning and dismantling of the reactors will indeed take a longer period, irrespective of the closure dates. It is the responsibility of the respective Candidate Countries to draw up decommissioning programmes. In addition, the Nuclear Power Plant operators need to submit detailed decommissioning plans for approval and licensing by the nuclear safety regulatory authorities of the particular countries. In all countries, this is both a legal requirement for the licensing of the decommissioning as well as a political demand under the energy strategies, to allow the Governments to devise programmes to address social and economic consequences of the closure and decommissioning of the Nuclear Power Plants. The Commission has been active in the preparation of this planning process, however. Decommissioning studies have been concluded under various PHARE programmes and allow the candidate countries to choose the most appropriate option of technical decommissioning methods. The Commission is also committed to provide PHARE support for the decommissioning of the nuclear power plants in Lithuania, Bulgaria and Slovakia, and for consequential measures to be taken in the conventional energy sector. Decommissioning projects will be supported from these programmes, via the Ignalina, Kozloduy and Bohunice International Decommissioning Support Funds to be managed by the EBRD. In the Ignalina case, projects have been identified by the Lithuanian authorities, and predominantly include the construction of waste and spent fuel storage facilities. The same is happening in Bulgaria and Slovakia. The Commission is concentrating its efforts on the provision of support to the most effective investment and management steps needed within the current financial perspective ending in 2006.</p>
<p>The Commission is undertaking a number of steps. The compliance of Lithuania, Bulgaria and Slovakia with their closure commitments regarding the Ignalina, Bohunice V1 and Kozloduy 1-4 reactors will be scrutinised as part of the Commission’s Regular Reports. The respective candidate countries have also committed themselves to work closely with the Commission in regularly providing information on the nuclear energy sector. The compliance will also figure strongly in the Commission’s recommendations with regard to the opening and closing of the negotiation chapter on energy. Furthermore, the financial assistance provided under the special national PHARE programmes for the three above-mentioned countries is conditional upon the countries’ compliance. This will be taken into due regard when programming this support under the annual budgeting requirements. In addition, the manager of the forthcoming International Decommissioning Support Funds will report on the recipient countries’ compliance with their closure commitments and the conditionalities set out in the grant agreements with the Funds. Likewise, the disbursement of the Euratom loan offered to Bulgaria for the upgrading of Units 5 and 6 of the Kozloduy plant will be conditional upon its compliance to its closure commitments for units 1-4.</p>
<p>The provision of a Euratom loan is not the trigger to prepare decommissioning projects for Kozloduy 1 and 2. The Euratom loan is designed to improve the upgradeable reactor units 5 and 6 of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant, which are of a different type and design. However, as already mentioned, its disbursement will be conditional on Bulgaria’s compliance with its closure commitments for the units 1-4. The Bulgarian authorities are obliged to draw up decommissioning programmes and plans as a consequence of the Understanding agreed with the Commission on 29 November 1999. The Commission is working together with the Bulgarian authorities for the implementation of the said Understanding. Cooperation also covers the drawing of a detailed plan and timetable for the definitive closure and decommissioning of units 1 and 2. A meeting of the Joint Working Group was held in February and a new meeting is planned for June.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0360"></a>

<p>The Commission initiated the Article 88(2)(ex Article 93) procedure against the Swedish reduced social contributions scheme, because it has doubts as to its compatibility with Community state aid rules.</p>
<p>The aid granted under the scheme falls within the scope of Article 87(1) (ex article 92) of the Treaty. The reduction of the social contributions constitutes an operating aid favouring certain companies in North Sweden. Moreover, the scheme covers a number of sectors, such as hotels and call-centres, in which there is significant intra-Community trade. The granting of operating aid to companies in such sectors could very well distort competition in the common market.</p>
<p>Under present State aid rules, operating aid in North Sweden can be approved only as compensation for the extra cost of transport of goods in low population density areas. However, the Swedish scheme applies exclusively to service companies that do not transport goods, and that therefore do not have “additional transport costs”. Sweden argued that the scheme provides compensation for additional “distance-related costs” other than additional transport costs of goods. It is clear that the concept of “distance-related costs”, as defined by Sweden, constitutes a significant widening of the concept of “the cost of the transport of goods”, as defined under the Community’s State aid rules.</p>
<p>The opening of a formal investigation under Article 88(2) EC gives the Swedish authorities an opportunity to present their arguments in favour of the scheme. It also enables other interested parties to comment on the scheme. This will allow the Commission to take a more fully informed decision on whether it is necessary to widen the concept of “transport costs” as proposed by Sweden.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0386"></a>

<p>The conditions attached to the granting to Crédit Mutuel of the monopoly right to distribute a tax-exempted saving account may give to the bank a discriminatory advantage in the form of a State aid.</p>
<p>In its assessment, the Commission takes fully into account the fact that the Livret Bleu may find its justification into some services of general economic interest defined by the French State. These services are not questioned.</p>
<p>However, according to the Treaty, the State support, in whatever form received by a credit institution for the specific task of raising funds for the Member State, has to be limited in its effects to the performance of that task and may not spill over in any way into competitive activities of the institution.</p>
<p>In applying competition rules, the Commission’s final concern is the consumer’s interest. Undistorted competition among financial institutions ensures that the consumers get the best services at the lowest possible prices.

<p>Does the Commission agree that there will be a real competition problem if the merger of three key biscuit producers in the UK (case: COMP/M.1920) goes ahead? It is estimated that the three companies affected by the takeover control 62% of the biscuit market, but only half of the workforce, leading to fears of up to 3 000 job losses across the UK. Can the Commission confirm that it will take into account the volume of sales and the unique nature of the national market when taking the decision on whether to refer case COMP/M.1920 back to the UK Competition Authority, requested by the UK Government under Article 9 of the Merger Agreement?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The transaction as originally notified to the Commission involved the acquisition of control by Nabisco over United Biscuits (UB) and Horizon Biscuits, with the involvement of a number of financial companies as minority shareholders. It would have led to high combined market shares in several countries (Finland, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom mainly). In the United Kingdom, the largest market, the combination of UB and Horizon would have created competition concerns because it would have resulted in significant market shares in both branded and own label biscuits produced by the parties. The British competition authorities were of the same view and requested that the case be referred to them under Article 9 of the Merger Regulation in so far as it concerned the biscuit market in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the parties proposed and put into effect modifications to the operation as a result of which Horizon was excluded from the deal. Horizon’s owner, the American investment company Hicks, Muse, Tate and Furst (“HMTF”), has also sold its minority shareholding to the other investment companies involved in the operation. As a result of these modifications, the overlap of market shares in the UK was eliminated and the competition problems resolved. The operation could therefore be approved. In these circumstances, a referral of the case to the United Kingdom was no longer necessary.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0351"></a>

<p>In response to a complaint, the Commission instigated infringement proceedings against Greece and reached the decision that the tax legislation affecting the purchase of property was discriminatory in that the exemption was restricted to only Greek nationals. When the relevant provisions were not amended, the Commission decided to refer the discriminatory provision to the European Court of Justice.</p>
<p>The Commission only prosecutes in cases of infringements which are not corrected. If Greece is prepared to amend its legislation to comply with the requirements of Community law, then the Commission is willing to assist, should Greece so request. It is not, however, acceptable to retain an exemption for currency payments for only a small category of Greek citizens (i.e. sailors that have been away from Greece for at least six years). The original motivation behind the relevant provision (which dates from 1950), apparently also of a monetary nature, is no longer remotely valid in a system of the free movement of capital. Such a concept is, moreover, not easy to reconcile with the prospect of Greece’s entry into the EMU. Finally, in the view of the Commission, the social reasons given to justify the exemption for sailors are far from clear and seem instead to create inequality between Greek citizens.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0353"></a>

<p>The objective of Community policy has always been the reduction of pain inflicted on animals during tests, and wherever and as soon as possible, the elimination of animal suffering, an aim which is also included in Directive 86/609/EEC regarding the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes<a href="#defann_24_2" name="refann_24_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 1</span>.

Furthermore, it will fulfil the wishes of a large number of people – shown in opinion polls – as it aims to ban definitively animal tests for cosmetics throughout the Community. On the contrary, a marketing ban would not answer this purpose, animal testing still being performed in the Community for cosmetic products to be exported.</p>
<p>The development of alternative methods being the key solution to suppress animal testing, the Commission will take the lead in the regulatory acceptance of in vitro methods validated at Community level by the Organisation for economic cooperation and development (OECD).

<p>The Union-Jordan Association Agreement was signed in November 1997 and endorsed by the European Parliament in June 1998. The Union-Jordan Association Agreement is the 5th Agreement that has been concluded within the Euro-Mediterranean partnership established by the Barcelona Declaration after similar agreements with Tunisia, Morocco, Israel and the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p>Jordan ratified the Agreement in September 1999 and seven Member states ratified until now. For Italy internal ratification seems to be complete, but ratification was not yet notified to the Council. When it is notified, a majority of Member states will have ratified.</p>
<p>Experience shows that the ratification process of Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreements in Member States can take between somewhat less than three years (Tunisia) and up to five years (Israel). Against this background the state of ratification of the Union-Jordan Agreement is rather positive. For that reason the Commission remains confident that the Agreement can enter into force by the end of 2000 or beginning of 2001.</p>
<p>The Commission will address the time lapse between completion of negotiations of Euro-Med Agreements and their full ratification in more general terms during the Lisbon Euro-Mediterranean Meeting of Foreign Ministers in May 2000.</p>

<p>The Commission is aware of problems relating to the exploitation of mackerel and herring stocks such as misreporting by species and by catch areas. Furthermore there are also indications that shoals or grade sizes of fish of low commercial value are dumped at sea in order to maximise the value of catch quota with more valuable fish (so called “slipping” and “high grading”). There is, however, insufficient information on the scope of these problems. Therefore, transparency needs to be improved.</p>
<p>As regards misreporting by area and by species, measures have been strengthened and may be further strengthened. Indeed, vessels over 24 metres overall length are subject to the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS), which allows the authorities to monitor continuously their areas of operation. Furthermore stricter controls of landings are carried out. Slipping and high grading practices hamper the conservation of stocks. The Commission has programmed a detailed examination of these issues with experts from the Member States concerned. The placing of observers on board fishing vessels is certainly one of the options which will be considered. The Commission has already invited the Member States concerned to place scientific observers on board of some vessels in order to collect information on these problems. At this stage, the Commission is not yet in a position to say if and when observers will be placed on the vessels in question.</p>
<p>Concerning current negotiations taking place on quota allocation of blue whiting, in particular, between the coastal states in the North-East Atlantic Ocean but also in the framework of the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC), the Commission will adopt a realistic and firm position in the defence of the interest of the Community as a whole.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0369"></a>

<p>In response to the first part of the question asked by the honourable Member, universities have provided several of the many constructive contributions that have been received. It is interesting to note that the contributions have come from various quarters – some from researchers in a personal capacity, others made on behalf of a research department, and others still from a university as a whole. In addition, the Commission has sent out more than 2 000 copies of the communication to organisations representing the sectors concerned across Europe, including universities and research institutes. A meeting which some 80 figures from the academic world, industry and the European Institutions had been invited to attend took place on 3 May 2000. The Commission saw this meeting as an opportunity to hold more detailed discussions on the issues addressed in the communication with the groups concerned. </p>
<p>In response to the second part of the question, the Commission has asked for the views of 600 European companies on the issues in the communication which are of vital importance to industry. The list of enterprises which have received the questionnaire includes in particular those which took part in the framework programme, amongst them a number of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The SME sector was also represented at the meeting of 3 May. Furthermore, several of the proposed themes for action for the creation of a European research area directly affect industry and more especially the SMEs. In particular, theme for action 3.3 involves proposals for measures to encourage the creation of companies and risk-capital investment.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Does the Commission believe that the EU has been better able to cope with the effects of the recent sharp rises in oil prices than in the past and, having due regard to environmental considerations, does it favour providing incentives to the Member States to encourage and promote offshore wind and wave electricity generation projects as an additional clean and lasting solution?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The short term impact of the sharp rises in oil prices was undoubtedly significantly less than in the past. On the basis of an increase in the average oil price for the year from USD 17 (1999) to USD 21.5 (2000) the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) is estimated to increase only slightly from 1.2% (1999) to 1.5% (2000) and 1.6% (2001).</p>
<p>This currently observed enhanced ability to cope with price increases is due to a variety of reasons. The dependence of our economies on oil has decreased – oil consumption per unit of GDP has fallen from 0.15 tonnes oil equivalent (toe) in 1973 to 0.078 toe in 1998, wages and salaries are relatively stable in the Community, and consumer prices are cushioned from sharp increases in import prices by the reforms and deregulation boosting competition and the relatively high tax component, and hence low crude price component in most oil products.</p>
<p>The Commission in its White Paper on renewable sources of energy set out a strategy to double the share of renewable energies in gross domestic energy consumption in the Community by 2010 (from the present 6% to 12%) including a timetable of actions to achieve this objective in the form of an Action Plan. The Commission, on 10 May 2000, put forward a proposal for a directive with the strategic objective of creating a framework for a significant increase of electricity produced on the basis of renewable sources of energy and to facilitate its access to the internal market for electricity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, under its ALTENER and 5<span class="sup">th</span> Framework programmes, formerly Thermie and Joule-Thermie programs, the Commission has supported many projects for further development, demonstration, and application of wind power. Wind turbines have steadily increased in size and thus the unit cost of generation has become more attractive. A key action towards the target figure of 10 000 MW of new wind generation capacity is a feature of the ‘Campaign for Take-Off’ for renewable energies, which is also included in the Action Plan, is a series of credibility actions over the initial period 1999-2003 aimed at kick-starting the effort towards the 12% target for 2010. The intended priority in this key sector action is large wind farms, including offshore, and challenging sites and applications.</p>
<p>The ALTENER programme, and the demonstration components of the Fifth Framework Programme and predecessors, address renewable energy technologies such as wind, which are state-of the-art and thus completely or largely ready for the market. This is not the case for wave power (and tidal) generation which is the subject of research projects currently supported under the Fifth Framework Programme non-nuclear energy component ‘energie’ under its various key actions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0375"></a>

Since the Council in 1995 found itself unable to agree on the Commission’s proposal for an action programme targeted on older people, no further programmes of this sort have been planned.</p>
<p>Within the framework of the Contacts Points Group on older peoples policies the Commission has provided a platform for Member States for the exchange of experiences and dissemination of best practices. In the last two years systematic exchanges have focussed on differences in the organisation of long term care.</p>
<p>The development of care and other services which allow frail and dependent older people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible (Care-in-place) is a policy priority in the older peoples policies of the great majority of Member States.</p>
<p>The issue of caring for very old and frail people was raised in the communication ‘Towards a Europe of all Ages’ which the Commission issued as a contribution to the United Nations (UN) International Year of Older Persons. In the communication the Commission underlines the need for a great expansion of the capacity of formal care systems in combination with better support for family carers as the ageing trend in our societies accelerates. Home help, home nursing and specially adapted housing are mentioned among the provisions which will need to be substantially expanded.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0377"></a>

<p>The Commission has no evidence that there has been a significant increase in such direct marketing activities by the financial institutions. The practice of offering special offers and direct marketing opportunities in mailings with clients is relatively commonplace in Europe. This practice is often resorted to by credit card companies who not only promote certain products or services but also negotiate discounts and rebates with the associated service or product suppliers. Thus, the customer is offered a form of loyalty discount when purchasing the promoted product or service with the relevant credit card.</p>
<p>Direct marketing with introductory or loyalty sales promotions is a less expensive form of promotion of traders’ activities than other forms of commercial communications such as media advertising. In this case the financial institutions offer to other businesses and traders the possibility of inserting advertising in the financial institution’s account statement mailings to their customers. The financial institutions can offer this service by local area or at regional/national/international level depending on the requirements of the advertisers. There is nothing to prevent small traders from benefiting from this commercial communications service to attract customers to their shops (although it must be said that many of them will not feel it practical or useful to do so).</p>
<p>On the other hand, to the extent that these commercial communication services consist of discounts or promotions it is often suggested that larger enterprises can offer more attractive discounts or sales promotions compared with small traders and this has led to national restrictions in a number of Member States to protect against unfair competition. The Commission is currently considering this general issue and the differing national regulations in this domain with its Expert Group on commercial communications. Following the opinions of the national experts involved it hopes to present a Communication on this issue later this year.</p>
<p>These activities can also encourage competition between financial intermediaries and thus provide for more efficient services to final customers. Those who carry such advertising earn revenues that can offset the costs of mailing their customers and therefore make their charges more competitive. Furthermore, in those cases where the advertiser pays for the service by offering a discount to the customers of the financial institution sending the mailing, this incites the customer to rely more extensively on that financial institution’s payment mechanism rather than that of its competitor.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0378"></a>

<p>In 1998, 42 553 lives were lost on the European Union’s roads, and some 1.7 million people were injured, of whom around 170 000 will suffer from lifelong disabilities. The Commission has recently issued a communication on its road safety priorities and appears to be laying more stress on the contribution of infrastructure to road safety. Can the Commission state what financial and other assistance it aims to provide so as to assist Member States in taking low-cost measures to improve the safety infrastructure of roads, particularly in regions where the condition of the roads is below the average European standard?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In its communication of 17 March 2000 on ‘Priorities in EU road safety - Progress report and ranking of actions’, the Commission has not sought to set any particular store by the contribution of road infrastructures towards improving road safety at Community level.</p>
<p>In fact, in submitting the Action Programme for 1997-2001, the Commission highlighted the constraints inherent in the traditional division of road safety measures in three categories (infrastructure, vehicles and users) and expressed its support for a comprehensive analysis of road safety measures which would consider the road traffic system in its entirety. In order to illustrate the need to take account of the areas of overlap between the three categories, the Commission pointed out in particular that certain adjustments to infrastructure might lead to an increase in accidents because of the additional risks that drivers might take.</p>
<p>However, the cost-effectiveness analysis referred to in the communication of 17 March 2000 has indeed made it possible to determine that, inter alia, the Union ought to set itself the short- and medium-term priority of establishing ‘guidelines’ for devising ‘forgiving’ road infrastructures and making improvements to ‘black spots’. These guidelines should be based on the best practices applied in the Member States. Preliminary studies have been conducted to determine the methodology to be adopted. In all likelihood, a call for proposals for the drafting of the guidelines proper will be issued. In this respect, studies could be funded under budget line B2-702 (transport safety), subject to the availability of resources. It is too early to say exactly what resources could be earmarked for these studies, which in any event cannot cover specific work on enhancing existing infrastructure.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0385"></a>

<p>The Black Sea Greeks who have returned to Greece from the former Soviet Union – over a hundred thousand to date – face enormous problems. As well as the extremely serious difficulties that confront them with regard to language, adapting to society and the acute housing situation, unemployment and social security are particularly worrying problems. The percentages of those who are unemployed (30%), in part-time work and in work for which they are over-qualified are much higher than those for the rest of the population, while large numbers face serious problems in relation to recognition of Greek nationality and of previous employment giving rise to pension rights.</p>
<p>In view of the fact that within the framework of the Community employment programme there is provision for funding to support specific activities connected with similar problems (e.g. the NOW, HORIZON and YOUTH START programmes), could the Commission say whether the Greek Government has applied for funding for initiatives to improve the living conditions and the full economic and social integration of returning Black Sea Greeks? If so, which particular programmes are involved and what level of funding has been approved?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Action for Greek repatriates from Pontos has been financed in the context of the 1994-1999 Community Support Framework (CSF) for Greece under the Operational Programme “Combating Exclusion from the Labour Market”. This action included pre-training and in particular Greek language teaching, training and accompanying/support measures i.e. psychological and social support. Moreover, the development of structures for the promotion of employment and accompanying/support services for Greek repatriates and migrants was also financed. According to information provided by the Greek authorities a total of approximately EUR 28 m has been spent on action in favour of Greek repatriates from Pontos. It is estimated that 5 510 persons benefited from this action.</p>
<p>Under the 2000-2006 Community Support Framework for Greece, the 2<span class="sup">nd</span> policy field of the<span class="sup"> </span>European Social Fund Regulation which aims at promoting equal opportunities for all in accessing the labour market with particular emphasis on those exposed to exclusion will provide the main framework for action in favour of the specific population group. As relevant negotiations have only just started, it is still not possible to give any specific information on the credits to be allocated for action under the specific policy field. However, there will be provision for action promoting labour market integration and social inclusion for Greek repatriates from Pontos.</p>
<p>In the framework of the Employment Community Initiative the following projects respecting Greek-Pontic refugees from the former USSR were approved:</p>
<p>1. Horizon axis 1995-1998:</p>
<p>10 projects amounting to EUR 5 252 586 (GRD 1 587 920 000) were approved and have already been completed. These projects were transnational and innovative and included actions aimed at the development of Refugees’ Support Centres, Vocational Training, the subsidising of Employment and dissemination practices. Approximately 650 refugees were involved in the aforementioned actions.</p>
<p>2. Integra axis 1997-2000:</p>
<p>20 projects amounting to EUR 8 738 458 (GRD 2 716 000 000) were approved. These projects are still under way. However, a substantial number of actions will already have been completed by the end of 2000. In general terms, 1250 refugees are estimated to be the beneficiaries of these actions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0400"></a>

It is with concern that I note that some Member States – including the Netherlands and Belgium – are banning medicines intended for equines as Directive 81/851 has not been amended. It is essential that Directive 81/851 is amended as a matter of priority.</p>
<p>Could the Commission indicate when it will amend Directive 81/851 in order to deliver on the Commission Decision and if the amendment takes some time, can the Commission confirm that Member States should operate according to the spirit of the Commission Decision pending the logistical process of amending Directive 81/851?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Through its Decision 2000/68/EC<a href="#defann_39_3" name="refann_39_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a><span class="sup">1</span>, the Commission has recently decided to amend the provisions for the establishment of the horse identification document (passport) in order amongst others things, to:</p>
<p>- Extend the scope of animals that should be accompanied by an identification document;</p>
<p>- Request, within this document, additional information on the intended future of the animal (as regards its possible slaughter for human consumption) and on the medicinal treatment administered to the horse.</p>
<p>In the 8<span class="sup">th</span> recital accompanying its Decision 2000/68/EC, the Commission mentions that it considers amending Article 1 of Directive 81/851/EEC<a href="#defann_39_4" name="refann_39_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a><span class="sup">2</span>. This consideration refers only to a possibility, but does not prejudge any final Commission decision on this issue.</p>
<p>The Commission is still considering the possibility for a holistic approach for amending the current legislative framework for veterinary medicinal products (mainly Directive 81/851/EEC), in order to try to solve as a whole the availability problems of medicinal products intended to be used in horses and in all the other so called “minor species”.</p>
<p>The procedure for a final decision on a proposal to amend Directive 81/851/EEC in such a context would take some time. However, as long as the regulatory framework has not been changed, the Commission cannot confirm that the Member States should operate according to the perspective for a possible change. By doing so the Commission would prejudge the outcome of the final decision of the Parliament and the Council. In addition, when assessing the measures taken by the Member States, the Commission has in particular to ensure that public health is not put at risk.</p>
<p>However, once a possible proposal to amend legislation has been adopted by the Commission, the Commission will take account of this situation when appraising provisions taken by the Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In view of the increasingly authoritarian and nationalist stance being taken by the Beijing regime and the threat this poses to the stability of the entire continent of Asia – a threat which many Western economic operators have already discerned, as is demonstrated by various economic indicators and, in particular, the decline in investment – is the Commission aware of the vital and urgent need to shift the focus of the Union’s policy on Asia from Beijing to Delhi? If so, is the Commission aware of the need to make the Indian authorities aware, in an explicit and concrete manner, of its willingness to do this? Furthermore, is the Commission aware of the adverse, and indeed dissuasive, effect that the introduction of an increasing number of political, social and environmental criteria into economic and commercial negotiations, including the WTO negotiations, is having on the development of Euro-Indian relations? Does the Commission not consider that these political, social and environmental issues, the importance of which is not disputed here, should be dealt with by separate and pragmatic discussions and should, in no case, be used by one or other of the parties as a means of halting the development of a strategic relationship between India and the European Union?

<p>The Commission’s policy towards Asia is based on the principles of comprehensive engagement, dialogue and consultation both with individual countries and with regional organisations such as ASEM, ASEAN and the SAARC. It does not regard its relations with the region as having a centre of gravity founded in any single country.</p>
<p>As regards China, the Commission seeks to establish a relationship based on mutual respect and benefits. A strategy of comprehensive engagement aiming to help China embrace universal human rights standards, comply with multilateral trading rules, and take a positive attitude towards global challenges such as sustainable development and arms control, constitutes the best way of advancing the EU’s interests and values.</p>
<p>As to India, the Commission has made substantial efforts to strengthen and intensify its relationship with the world’s largest democracy. The EU concluded a far-reaching cooperation agreement in 1993 and drafted a Communication on an enhanced partnership, which was well received by the European Parliament. The Commission is also currently preparing the first ever EU-India Summit to take place in Lisbon in June. This follows a marked warming of political contacts brought about by the visit of the Indian FM Singh to the Commission in September 99 and a successful Ministerial meeting in Helsinki in December 1999.</p>
<p>Upgrading the relationship with China and India should thus not be seen as mutually exclusive. Both nations are equally important, emerging political actors on the regional and international stage with whom the Commission seeks to intensify contacts across the board.</p>
<p>The honourable Member expresses concern that the EU’s position on the role of environmental and social issues in the WTO round may have a negative impact on our relationship with India. The Commission is alive to the concerns expressed not just by India but by other developing countries.</p>
<p>After Seattle, the responsible Member of the Commission has been engaged in intensive talks with the Indians (and others) on these matters. We have told the Indians that we want the new round to contribute to sustainable, rather than unsustainable, development. The Commission has clearly rejected any call for unilateral, protectionist measures in the environmental field and the use of trade sanctions in the area of trade and labour.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that environment is already part of the WTO system. It is only natural that, in the framework of a comprehensive, global round, the Commission may want to seek clarifications and improvements of the existing rules on environment.</p>
<p>The question of labour is different. Precisely in response to India’s and others’ opposition to bringing these matters within the WTO, the Commission is proposing to establish a regular dialogue between the WTO and other relevant institutions, notably the ILO. This dialogue would not be part of the new round. This should contribute to assuage India’s concerns. India has recently agreed to formally open an environmental dialogue with the EC.</p>
<p>The Commission is hopeful that India will join the camp of those developing countries that are slowly moving from outright opposition towards a more open-minded approach concerning these issues.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0407"></a>

<p>Since 1994, the LIFE programme has been funding a project for the restoration of the alignments of standing stones at Carnac, implemented by the Ministry of Culture which manages the site.</p>
<p>This project is intended to conserve the site that has for years been under threat due to excessive tourism which has caused soil erosion serious enough to unseat the menhirs. The project includes organising public access entailing closure of the site at certain times of year, the relocation of some traffic routes and parking areas, and the demolition of some buildings. The ‘Archeoscope’ to which the honourable Member refers, however, is a private initiative unrelated to the project.</p>
<p>There has been a public inquiry into the works planned as part of the LIFE Project and a Declaration of Public Interest was issued by the County Governor of Morbihan on 10 July 1997. These were delayed several times in order to take the comments put forward by the local population and local authorities into consideration. There have, therefore, been many opportunities for local associations to be consulted in relation to the project.</p>
<p>Subject to evaluation of the results of the project, it does seem to have kept to its site conservation objectives, and so, at this stage, there are no grounds for considering withdrawing Community funding.</p>

<p>Ferry traffic in the Kvarken straits between Sweden and Finland has declined by approximately 30% since duty-free sales were abolished. This is causing employment problems in the region. Before the abolition of duty-free sales, Commissioner Monti claimed that it would be possible for this to be offset by increased employment in the regular retail trade. However, it is difficult to see how this could happen.</p>

<p>The Commission always recognised that the decision to abolish duty­free sales for intra­Community travellers might have an adverse impact on certain regions. Its analysis<a href="#defann_46_1" name="refann_46_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup">1</span> showed that this impact was likely to be time limited and specific in terms both of localities and sectors affected. As a peripheral region heavily dependent upon ferry traffic, it was estimated that the Kvarken region, and more particularly the ferry services between the county of Västerbotten in Sweden and the Ostrobothnian counties in Finland<a href="#defann_46_2" name="refann_46_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a><span class="sup">2</span>, could be adversely affected by the abolition. From the information presented by the Honourable Members, indicating a decrease in passenger volume of 30%, it seems that these predictions might have come true.</p>
<p>The Commission, however, considered the proposed extension of the duty­free arrangements, even if limited to certain sectors, too broad an instrument to address specific problems arising from the abolition of duty­free sales. Instead, it considered that these were most efficiently addressed within the framework of existing Community instruments, namely the Structural and Cohesion Funds and State aid. Under the procedures in place, only Member States can put forward proposals for specific measures or for re­balancing existing programme measures to alleviate such problems. Accordingly, the Commission urged Member States to exploit fully the possibility offered by submitting specific funding proposals.</p>
<p>Sweden and Finland have decided to avail themselves of the State aid scheme, considering the ferry service in the Gulf of Bothnia as a public­service interest. This allows for public procurement of the Kvarken ferry route. This measure has been endorsed by the Commission as being in line with the Community guidelines on State aid to the maritime transport industries.</p>
<p>Regarding structural funds, the Swedish and Finnish proposals for the Objective 1 and 2 regional development programmes for 2000­2006 in Kvarken do not include concrete plans to support ferry connections. However, Sweden and Finland have jointly proposed a cross­border INTERREG III Community Initiative programme for the Kvarken­Mittskandia area which the Commission received on 28 April 2000. This proposal includes ferry traffic as one of the key issues for the area. Clearly, the Commission is not able to pronounce an opinion on the programme at this stage, in advance of the start of negotiations.</p>
<p>The Commission is not aware of any instances of misuse of dominant position by other ferry lines in the Gulf of Bothnia caused by subsidies.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Commission sees no reason to consider again the issue of duty­free sales, an issue which the Council unanimously decided in 1991 and 1992 and affirmed in 1999 nor does it see any justification for special tax rules to be applied on a regional basis. It considers that divergent rules such as lower rates would contradict general principles laid down in Community legislation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission shares the concerns expressed about the conservation of endangered species. Whilst it can do little about the management of this question in situ, it does have a role to play when European Union citizens are involved. Under Community wildlife trade legislation (Regulation 338/97) an import permit is required before any hunting trophies can be brought into the Community. This import permit can only be issued when scientists in the importing Member State are satisfied that the import would not have a harmful effect on the conservation of the species concerned.</p>
<p>As regards grizzly bears from British Columbia, Community scientists have formed a positive opinion with respect to allowing imports of such hunting trophies. They consider that properly managed trophy hunting can make a positive contribution to the overall conservation of wildlife in North-western America. The Commission is confident that the Canadian authorities are controlling the Community in such a manner that there is no danger to the balanced development of the Grizzly Bear population.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0428"></a>

<p>The Commission has announced its intention to discontinue the specific aid for dried fruit which is governed by Regulation (EEC) 2159/89<a href="#defann_50_1" name="refann_50_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and which is intended to improve the structures, the production and the marketing of such products.

<p>Unless it is reversed, the Commission’s course of action will be highly damaging to the sector, which is of major socio-economic importance in Catalonia (particularly hazelnut production in Tarragona), the Valencia region and the Balearic Islands.</p>
<p>In view of the positive effects of the improvement plans and their low impact on the budget, and given that the EU is deficient in such products and therefore highly dependent on external markets, can the Commission say whether or not it intends to continue or establish other measures which will compensate for this loss of aid to the dried fruit sector?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Specific aid has been granted to the nut sector for 10 years under the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 2159/89. Additional specific flat­rate aid for hazelnuts has been granted since 1997 and up to the year 2000.</p>
<p>The main objective of this aid was to improve the productivity and competitiveness of the nut sector.</p>
<p>Community expenditure on the sector has been very significant. EUR 725 m have been spent on improvement plans in the period 1990­1999. For those plans still in operation a further EUR 250 m are foreseen until 2006.</p>
<p>It has always been understood that this aid is temporary and degressive. In this way, financial responsibility could be shifted on to the growers.</p>
<p>Therefore, no extension of this aid is foreseen. However, other support schemes are available.</p>
<p>Firstly, aid is available for nuts through the operational fund scheme of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96. This provides financial support for all fruit and vegetables marketed through producer organisations.</p>
<p>In addition, Member States can include nuts in their rural development plans under conditions of Regulation (EC) No 1257/99. This would help address the environmental and social aspects of nut production.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>One of the conditions for undergoing selection procedures for recruitment to posts at the EU institutions is that the applicant should not be above a certain age: a translator, for example, must not be aged over 45. Irrespective of their training, competence and work experience, therefore, applicants seeking selection for employment by the EU suffer discrimination on grounds of age. This is despite the fact that the EU claims to be trying to combat discrimination on grounds of sex, race, ethnic origin, religious or other conviction, disability, age and sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Can the Commission explain why this age discrimination persists within the EU’s own institutions?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission made a decision in principle to abolish age limits in competition notices in January 1998. As a first step it began by raising the age limit for all staff recruitment competitions at basic grades to 45, following the approach adopted by the Bureau of this Parliament in October 1997. During inter­Institutional discussions on the Reflection Group report on Personnel Policy, the other Institutions also expressed their willingness in principle to raise the age limit to 45.</p>
<p>In the Commission, the higher age limit has applied to all relevant competitions launched since that time, including the large­scale graduate competitions held last year (COM A/8­12/98) and a number of others, such as the competitions for informaticians and secretaries.</p>
<p>The honourable Member may be interested to know that, in spite of the introduction of the higher age limit in the large-scale graduate competitions ­ where there were 30 000 applicants ­ the relatively young age profile of applicants remained almost the same as on previous occasions. We continue to take the view, however, that ­ in due course ­ raising and ultimately abolishing the age limit could begin to make a positive difference by encouraging applications from more mature candidates who obviously may have much to offer the Commission.</p>
<p>The Commission also periodically organises competitions for intermediate grades and for specialist posts at A5/A4 level where the current age limit is 50 years.</p>
<p>The honourable Member will be aware that not all of the Institutions necessarily share the Commission’s determination to completely abolish age limits. I therefore wrote recently to the Presidents of the other Institutions underlining the Commission’s commitment to abolish age limits, and asking the other Institutions to review their position in the light of the anti-discrimination clause in the Treaty of Amsterdam and in the light of the Commission’s recent experience. The Commission hopes for quick and real progress on this issue, and naturally, I will continue to keep the House informed.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
