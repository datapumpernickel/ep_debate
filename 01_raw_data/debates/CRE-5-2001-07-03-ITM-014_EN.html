<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Niebler (PPE-DE)</span></span>  ,<span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank you all very sincerely for supporting my report. In the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy we had a very intensive and fruitful debate on the subject of radio spectrum policy, and I received some good amendments not only from my fellow Members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, but also from Members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport. I was pleased to incorporate these amendments into my report. In formal terms, these amendments ultimately fitted very well into a compromise that was excepted by the committee with 49 out of 50 votes, with one abstention.</p>
<p class="contents">The subject of my report is the Commission's proposal for a decision on a regulatory framework for radio spectrum policy in the European Community. It relates to establishing which institutions will, in future, make decisions about radio spectrum policy and via what procedures. The proposal specifically does not lay down any substantive guidelines about allocating frequencies, that is to say it does not stipulate whether specific frequency bands are to be made available for telecommunications, broadcasting, transport or military purposes. Instead, the proposal is limited to institutional and procedural issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of the directive is to create a reliable regulatory framework which provides a basis for consistently deciding questions about the harmonisation of the use of the radio spectrum, allocation procedures and conditions of use at EU level, in cases where the implementation of EU policy objectives requires the use of frequencies. We need to distinguish between two types of issue here. Firstly, strategic policy decisions have to be taken. On the other hand, policy guidelines also have to be implemented. We are therefore talking about technical implementation measures here. We are already familiar with this distinction between political decisions and technical implementation measures from the Lamfalussy report.</p>
<p class="contents">The major significance and consequences of the proposal flow from a number of aspects. The radio spectrum is, because of the ever greater demands being placed on it, increasingly becoming a scarce and valuable economic resource and a decisive factor in employment. Allocation of sections of the spectrum for uses such as communications, broadcasting, transport, police, military and earth observation purposes is becoming more and more complex. Strategic decisions have to be taken in order to balance the needs of commercial users and non­commercial users. Just how valuable radio frequencies have now become is demonstrated by the result of the UMTS licence auction, which the Member States held last year for a narrowly defined section of the spectrum. For Germany, for example, companies were willing to pay EUR 50 billion, and in the United Kingdom it is well known that the auction brought in EUR 38.5 billion. The allocation of frequencies to the various user groups and users must therefore – and this is already a topical issue – be carried out in the most transparent and democratic way possible, whether at Member State level, at European level within the CEPT, and now at EU level as well, if decisions are to be made about Community activities reliant on frequencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course it goes without saying that European-level decisions about frequency policy have to be made by the European Parliament and the Council. In general, it should be for politicians and in particular the elected representatives of the people to make decisions about an issue as important for society and the economy as frequency policy. The job of putting these decisions into practice, that is to say technical implementation, can be entrusted to the Commission. In doing this, the Commission should also be able to call on the expertise of the CEPT, by seeking advice on how to solve technical problems from the CEPT. The amendments which 49 of the 50 Members in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy agreed provide for exactly that to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">However, two of the amendments from the Group of the Party of European Socialists, of which the Commission is no doubt aware, undermine this approach. I am talking about Amendments Nos 22 and 23, which have been tabled in the plenary. Ultimately, the aim of these amendments is to prevent Parliament and the Council making joint decisions about frequency policy in future. Instead, only the Commission and the Council will decide on these matters. I cannot support that, and I therefore urge you to vote against these amendments. On the other hand, I can recommend to you the amendments tabled by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and those of my own group, which have been tabled for legal reasons following a recommendation by the Legal Service.</p>

Due to their increasing use, radio frequencies are becoming an increasingly limited and valuable commodity. As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I would like to emphasise the importance of the transport sector and the equal rights of each means of transport to use radio frequencies for operational purposes, above all to ensure passenger safety. Air and sea traffic, for example, are completely dependent on the use of radio frequencies. The different needs of different regions also need to be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the amendments put forward by our committee were adopted by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy while others were not. On behalf of our Group I introduced two amendments in plenary which reflect the opinions of our committee. Amendment No 24 concerns the regional aspect and draws attention to the fact that different circumstances such as population density and distances, industrial structure and traffic conditions must be taken into account in harmonising radio frequencies. Amendment No 25 concerns transparency. The publication of information on the use of frequencies is important but publication is only beneficial if the information published includes all the data necessary for the effective use of this information. Transparency is connected to achieving efficient use of unused areas of the radio spectrum. The annex to the proposal for a decision is too general and apparently confuses reserving the use of frequencies for different purposes with allocating frequencies to users. I would like to see support for these two amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No one will deny that, in view of developments in technology, a new regulatory framework on frequency policy is needed. However, certain basic principles have to be borne in mind here, since although the technology itself is neutral, the way it is used is not.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, whose unanimous opinion I am presenting here, has, amongst other things, considered how it can be guaranteed that adequate transmission capacity is reserved for content addressed to the general public. In other words, in addition to economic issues, consideration also has to be given to political, cultural and social aspects, and also to the right to privacy and to consumer protection. This applies first and foremost to broadcast programming content relating to the expression of cultural diversity, freedom of speech and pluralism, which therefore plays a significant part in shaping opinion as part of the democratic process.</p>
<p class="contents">This is all the more important given that the proposal quite rightly stresses the fact that radio frequencies are a scarce resource and that this will not change in the longer term. It would therefore be wrong to place too much emphasis on economic efficiency. Products geared to the general public should also have a guaranteed place in an open competition-oriented market for electronic communication networks and services.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has not entirely taken on board the views of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport in this respect, as we would have wished, but it does recognise the principle of freedom of speech, and this is a key reason why we are willing to vote for the report as it stands.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also emphasised elsewhere that democratic, social and cultural interests connected with frequency use need to be taken into account. The Member States should also be expected to comply with that requirement, including Italy – please note, Mr Berlusconi. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to congratulate her on the quality of her report. In this connection, I should like to broach two subjects which are a little controversial.</p>
<p class="contents">Subject one is the possibility of stepping up the harmonisation of the military use of the radio spectrum. We know that a huge proportion of the spectrum is used by the military. That is, of course, understandable in an historical context, but if we are working towards a common security policy, we will also have to question whether the level of efficiency is proportionate to its use. I believe that that is not the case. It resembles one large patchwork at the moment. In my opinion, the private sector, in particular, needs a larger proportion of the spectrum.</p>
<p class="contents">What can we do? Normally speaking, we could attempt to harmonise, but that is of course extremely difficult. That is why I propose a step-by-step plan. First of all, we must prioritise in terms of military and civil use. Secondly, Member States must be transparent in terms of the use of the military spectrum. Thirdly, the Commission, Council and Parliament, and all those involved, must join forces, finally, to open a discussion on this topic and, especially, to look for ways of bringing about harmonisation in the future. Not easy, but it has to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point: a separation of political affairs and technical implementation. Many of the CEPT actions are technical, but all these technical points have a great many political ramifications. That is why I believe that it is of great importance for the political aspects to be discussed more among the Commission, Council and European Parliament, and for the technical side to be left to the CEPT to take care of. But I believe it is crucial for us finally to discuss the political framework in this arena too. That is why I warmly recommend this amendment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, thanks are also due to the Commission because it has shown such persistence in pursuing this subject over the years, although we did not expect that it would act so quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I have to tell the Commission that to some extent it has been unnecessarily tough, not least regarding the amendments put forward by Parliament, and that it has not perhaps shown the institutional flexibility that it might have or that might have been expected from the Commission. Mrs Niebler has quite rightly pointed out that there is a considerable difference between technical measures and strategic decisions on policy, and that when it comes to strategic decisions the European Parliament really ought to play a greater role than provided for in the report, so that transparency is guaranteed and democratic structures are actually established. This is even more important if you bear in mind that the Council is by no means in agreement with the Commission that the Senior Official Group should be established. That only leaves us with the Senior Official Committee, which means that the institutional framework for taking democratic decisions will be distinctly limited.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally would therefore support Mrs Niebler's new proposal in which she suggests establishing a "call-back procedure" in the wake of Lamfalussy. My Group has, in any case, tabled certain amendments. I hope that the House will be able to accept these amendments. They will also be supplemented by an oral amendment which I hope the House will support. We can take on board the Council's proposal, in which it proposes that in cases going beyond technical measures the Commission should propose a legal instrument to Parliament and the Council. I hope that we will have your support for this and I hope that the Commission will be able to live with this amendment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is one of the major news stories of the day. I would also like to say to the Commissioner that we appear to have got into the habit of celebrating Tuesday evenings here together– all the usual suspects, as we are on these issues. It is almost a little absurd.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur and the previous speakers have highlighted the significance of efficient use of the latest resource to be in short supply, namely frequencies. It is important that we have transparency in the use of these. As Mr Pohjamo said, it is also important to report the terms for the frequencies used. It should also be possible to reserve frequencies for services useful to society on special terms.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been mentioned, it is actually the institutional issues which are difficult. I personally am a little afraid that we may have worked a bit too quickly and that we are in the process of developing quite a few hierarchies. We talk about technical implementation provisions. We also talk about the political level and the mandates given to the CEPT. In other words, the system is quite complicated. Our group came up with a proposal for a call back procedure. However, I hope we agree that what in this context have been called technical implementation measures do not include technical matters. Otherwise, we would be moving much too far into the CEPT’s territory.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also certain other aspects which may need correcting tomorrow. There is still a proposal to send observers to the High Level Group. Parliament’s proposal refers to both a high level group and a committee. We simply cannot have both representation in a high level group and also a call-back procedure. That would be too much. We must look at how we can correct this before tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The objective should be to achieve the greatest economic benefit possible. The UMTS has demonstrated that there is a need for action here. If a kind of virtual property arises as a result of frequency allocation, would it not make sense to permit licensing in this field in such a way that a new source of income is again available for finance ministers which, combined with equity capital formation for the companies involved, brings a benefit for both sides? I think that we need to look for totally new theories for frequency allocation and that we should also have the courage to implement them.</p>
<p class="contents">I often get complaints from CB users. Mr Scheibenbogen writes to me regularly. This is quite simply because there is still no single market for equipment use in Europe, so that we need to find an approach in the area of hardware too so as to secure a single market.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 7 is about publishing information. I would be interested to hear from the Commissioner in what form this information is to be made available in future. I would like to see more detail in Article 10(1) about the powers of investigation for regulatory authorities, whilst of course observing the principle of proportionality and preserving business secrets.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that these principles are particularly important for the future, and I will be pleased if we can congratulate Mrs Niebler on the adoption of this very important report tomorrow, because she really has done sterling work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The radio spectrum has become a central means of communication, bringing with it money and power. With no standardised allocation procedures, we all know the result of the third generation mobile phone deals – one company in the sector is currently going bankrupt every week. In some Member States there were no charges at all, while others used hybrid systems. The result of all this is a confused situation, not to mention unemployment. This was supposed to give us a cutting edge in global competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Because radio waves transcend borders, it is clear that we need common European principles to administer them since, to put it bluntly, fifteen different interpretations of the same thing is a barrier to marketing. The Electronic Europe strategy demands that everyone should be included on equal terms. This makes things considerably more difficult and conflict must be removed. At the same time, cultural diversity should be encouraged and in this regard I mean, for example, public radio broadcasting, which must be given the necessary frequencies. I approve of this kind of political decision making but when deciding on commercial issues we have to have a level playing field with the same procedure, whether this be auction or some other procedure, throughout the whole of Europe so that the system does not end up on the verge of collapse as it is now. For this reason I support Amendments Nos 22 and 23 and Mrs Mann’s oral amendment. I think that this will see us achieve a balance in these sub-areas and gain an understanding of what is important and what is business. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FI)</span> Mr President, the Commission is pleased with the progress on its proposal for a decision on radio spectrum policy. I too would especially like to thank Angelika Niebler for her report. This proposal is part of a whole which the Commission would like to see adopted by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would like to state that the wide-ranging discussions of recent years are now producing results, as the general importance of the radio spectrum and the need for efficient decision making are starting to be recognised. Today, following discussion in the committee, the issue is having its first reading in the European Parliament. The timing is ideal, since, after much discussion, the Council, for its part, last week reached consensus on the new text which largely confirms the Commission’s original aims. Following its examination of Angelika Niebler’s report and the new amendments, the Commission can state that it is satisfied that Parliament in principle supports the Commission’s proposal. Despite this, the Commission has some detailed observations on various parts of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">From the Commission’s point of view the most problematic aspect of the report is that it does not sufficiently distinguish between, on the one hand, issues which fall under the codecision procedure and, on the other, issues to be decided by the committee procedure. All the amendments to be approved must comply with the comitology rules agreed for the EU institutions, which guide the use of the committee procedures and according to which the Radio Spectrum Committee will also have to operate. Some amendments propose that all the decisions should be made by the codecision procedure, in other words that this procedure be adopted in agreeing the Community’s common policy and also in agreeing such technical implementation measures required in order to comply with the policies agreed. In the opinion of the Commission, the latter, i.e. technical implementation measures, should be agreed by committee, where they would be determined using the committee procedure. In addition, the report presents amendments according to which the European Parliament could revoke or amend measures already realised via the committee procedure. In the view of the Commission, this conflicts with the Comitology Decision.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you of the main principle of the proposal: whenever the European Parliament and the Council, using the codecision procedure or by other means, agree Community policy concerning the radio spectrum, such as the Galileo project or the Single European Sky project, they agree at the same time that radio frequencies are available in order to realise this Community policy in practice. In this context the committee procedure is needed to enable us to decide on the technical implementation measures which are essential in order to realise the agreed Community policy. To clarify the matter further it can also be stated that the committee procedure is not used to agree Community policy which may depend on radio frequencies or such harmonisation which go beyond merely technical implementation measures. In such cases, the codecision procedure is used.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason the Commission cannot accept those amendments from Parliament which conflict with the central approach of our proposal for a decision. Parliament’s amendments, according to which, all the decisions made by the committee procedure would be brought before Parliament and where Parliament would have the right to amend or revoke them if they concern issues other than purely technical implementation measures are against the rules set out in the Comitology Decision. According to the Comitology Decision, the Commission must re-examine draft measures if, according to a resolution by Parliament, they exceed the implementing powers provided for in the instrument on which they are based and inform Parliament of the action it intends to take on Parliament’s resolution and of its reasons for doing so. In this context the most important amendments from the Commission’s point of view are Amendments Nos 10 and 19, and the Commission also requests that the Members of the European Parliament reconsider their opinion on these amendments as they already have regarding Amendments Nos 21, 22 and 23.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would finally like to emphasise that the Commission greatly values Parliament’s seeking to play an active role in the decision-making process regarding the radio spectrum. For precisely this reason the Commission referred in its proposal to the existing opportunities for doing so – the codecision procedure and the committee procedure. As for the other amendments, the Commission can approve Amendments Nos 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 17 and 22 – 25. We accept Amendments 3, 7, 9, 11 – 13 and 20 in principle. The Commission is unable to approve any other amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I can state that the opinions of the institutions on the aims of the proposed decision have converged. This should be seen as a guiding principle in further preparation for the entry into force of the decision. On this basis the Commission is ready to continue open cooperation with the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
