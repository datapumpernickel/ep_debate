<p class="contents">As I understand it, this is an oral question rather than a speech, and so I will try to keep it very brief. As you know, this question deals with the environmental effects on whales of underwater sonar systems, military and civilian equipment that has quite considerable effects on the auditory system of whales. We have, most regrettably, had indications from experts that whales are dying in vast numbers, something that has not started only recently, but has been going on for some time.</p>
<p class="contents">What we would like the Commission to tell us is whether it has been informed of new studies and whether these have been sufficiently publicised. We would very much like to know whether it is aware that the United States has already dismantled stationary sonar systems of this kind. Is it aware that new technologies capable of performing these functions have been in existence for some time?</p>
<p class="contents">We see here the potential for innovation under the Lisbon strategy. We do not want to scrap any ships, but we do want our friends in the defence sector to continue to be able to travel under water in an orderly fashion, rather than, as is unfortunately the present case, in some confusion and disarray. This is an opportunity for innovation; is the Commission willing to take action in this area even outside the European Union? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At the plenary session in March of this year, Commissioner Solbes made a statement on behalf of the Commission on the effects of low-frequency active sonar on the marine environment, in which it was pointed out that the EU’s Member States are required by Community law to set up stringent systems for protecting whales in European waters. The Commission did not, however, have at its disposal the information on high-intensity active sonar systems and their potential effects on whales that it would have needed in order to clarify outstanding scientific issues and adopt an unambiguous position.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, the Commission asked the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea to examine this complex issue scientifically. This was to provide a basis for the description of measures that might prove necessary in the future in order to avoid disturbing whales and in order to guarantee adherence to the provisions of the Habitat Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The scientific study has since been set in motion, and the draft conclusions are expected at the beginning of 2005. The Commission will make the results of this study available to Parliament and to the public. We will consult the Member States, through the Habitat Committee, on the best possible options for protecting whales from sonar systems and other forms of noise pollution, and in these discussions all interested parties will be involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Commission is aware of the potential environmental effects of military activities, the fact that the EU possesses no competence in this area means that the Community cannot take any action to regulate the development of new defence technologies. If, in future, we become more involved in the field of defence research, this will of course have a major part to play. Let me reiterate that the study was commissioned in September 2003 and is expected to be available by the end of this year. As the study needs to collate all the available knowledge on the subject, it is a complex task, and, as it has to do with the military sector, this has often not been easy.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore ask you to note that the completion of the study will require some considerable time. I do hope, though – as I have said on behalf of my fellow Commissioners – that the results will be available at the beginning of the coming year and will then provide a sound basis for action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have already brought up the issue of whales twice, and we will do so again in the future, until we make clear progress in this matter. I wish to thank Commissioner Schreyer for her reply, which inspires hope. It is important that the Commission should do all it can within the limits of its powers.</p>
<p class="contents">Two years ago, I personally collected the names for the first oral question, and it has to be said that research material on the subject has substantially increased in volume in the intervening period. Precise information on the effects of high-intensity sonars has been obtained from many reliable sources, including data published by 18 European researchers in the issue of Nature magazine dated 9 October 2003, which shows that high-intensity sonars pose a significant threat to marine mammals in particular, but also to fish and other marine fauna. There has been a considerable increase in the body of evidence showing a link between the death in large numbers of marine mammals and high-intensity sonars.</p>
<p class="contents">A year ago, in October, researchers and our parliamentary delegation went to NATO headquarters to submit two petitions asking the member countries of NATO to restrict the use of LFAS systems until their environmental impact and link to recent whale deaths had been fully investigated. At that time, the petition had been signed by more than 85 000 people and 68 environmental organisations in Europe, the United States and Canada.</p>
<p class="contents">While we agree that it is a totally legitimate exercise to try and develop this defence system, and to monitor submarines that use new technology, it is especially important to take the vulnerability of our environment into consideration. From the point of view of sustainable development, we should aim to develop alternative technologies which protect nature while at the same time achieving the objectives set for them. In military technology, as well as other fields, it is worth reminding ourselves of the ecological price we have to pay for the technology we choose to employ. With high-intensity sonars, the price is too high. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We now have valid and sufficient scientific evidence demonstrating that high-intensity active naval sonars can be lethal for whales, dolphins and fish. All cetaceans are extremely dependent on hearing for their survival, and many species have an acute sense of hearing and use sound not only to locate their prey but also for navigation and communication, often over long distances.</p>
<p class="contents">Noise pollution caused by sonar equipment thus not only causes physiological damage but also interferes with the natural behaviour of the animals and with normal communication. It drowns out calls and disorientates the animals, scaring them away from their usual habitats, where they feed and reproduce.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year we adopted a resolution on the protection and conservation of the marine environment. This Parliament voted unanimously for the application of consistent, coordinated measures to halt the decline of biodiversity by 2010 and to promote the sustainable use of the seas, protecting and conserving marine ecosystems. I would not wish to remind you, Mr President, that these were political objectives to which we gave a binding commitment at the last world summit on sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, therefore, that it is our duty to adopt provisions designed to preserve the marine world which surrounds us, and so I call on the Commission to abide by the deadlines which it announced in this Chamber for making the move from studies to concrete proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Instead of the electromagnetic energy waves used by surface radar, it employs acoustic energy waves with which it scans the water of the oceans. These acoustic waves are, in simple terms, very loud noises which travel over many hundreds of kilometres and, in the areas used, completely fill every cubic inch of ocean water without any geographical limitation. Sometimes they are so loud that they can even be heard outside the water by people standing at nearby shores.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not surprising that such high-energy noise bombardment causes severe disruption to marine life. This disruption is especially extensive to animals that by nature have very sensitive acoustic capabilities, such as whales and dolphins. What a whale hears and feels when sonar is used is the equivalent of what we would hear and feel if four jumbo jet engines were operating at full blast in this room. The scientific evidence gathered mainly from necropsies on stranded whales is becoming increasingly stronger and more enlightening and it is convincing to most scientists, and it certainly satisfies our precautionary principle.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from direct injury to internal organs such as the inner ear apparatus, the sonar waves cause the animals to panic and in terror to move uncontrollably and haphazardly, trying desperately to escape from the painful and disorientating sonar noise. In so doing, they may rise very quickly from deep waters, thus suffering a form of fatal decompression sickness and/or they may be stranded on nearby beaches where they meet their demise.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be noted that for every animal stranded, many hundreds more are killed or severely injured but we never get to know about them because they never reach the shores. It should also be noted that dying from the effects of sonar injury is an extremely painful, agonising and slow form of death.</p>
<p class="contents">It is imperative that the motion for a resolution which has been submitted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety calling for the restriction of the use of these sonars be passed urgently and unchanged in substance. The amendment proposing the restriction of the use of sonars in geographically non-sensitive marine habitats, if accepted, will severely weaken this resolution and render it largely ineffective.</p>

<p class="contents">These new, much more powerful sonars – one of the loudest sound systems ever devised – have sparked an epidemic of strandings, internal bleeding, deafness and lung damage wherever they have been tested. A single blast of the new technology can affect animals across 3.8 million km2 of water. That is why it is simply not good enough that the Commission responded to a written question of mine last November, simply saying that this type of technology needs to be used with caution. This type of technology <span class="italic">cannot</span> be used with caution because of the huge impact it has. At one hundred miles away from the source of the sound, the noise can still cause shearing of the tissues in the air sack behind whales' and dolphins brains.</p>
<p class="contents">I listened with great interest to the Commissioner's introduction, and I heard a lot about more research but nothing about calling for a moratorium. In July, the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission unanimously issued a strong statement of concern about intense underwater noise, citing what <span class="italic">it</span> calls compelling evidence that entire populations of whales and other marine mammals are potentially threatened by it. So do not tell us that we need more research before we call for a moratorium – we do not: there is plenty of evidence that we need to act.</p>
<p class="contents">I would strongly urge Members to vote against the amendment tabled by the PPE Group, which seeks to weaken the resolution by calling upon Member States to adopt geographic restrictions in sensitive marine habitats. There is simply no scientific justification for this amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Korhola gave a very nice speech – it is a pity she has now left the Chamber – but she did not explain why she has put her name to this very same amendment, which would gut and weaken the very resolution which she claims to support. Given that a single blast of this low-frequency technology can affect animals across 3.8 million km2 of water and that little is known about their migratory patterns, geographic restrictions are not appropriate. They will not work. I urge colleagues to reject that amendment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For example, a number of links have been shown to exist between military exercises in which this technique is used and the high incidence of stranded whales.</p>
<p class="contents">As mentioned earlier in this debate, there is only one amendment to this excellent resolution. It comes from the other side of this House and was tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. They wish to attenuate what is one of the absolutely key points by restricting the demand that this technique should not be used so that it only applies to certain geographical areas. That is something that would seriously damage the document. It is also a practical impossibility, since we are concerned here with species that travel over huge areas of sea and that cannot be confined to certain areas. We are also concerned with sound waves that, in themselves, can travel for hundreds of kilometres.

In environmental policy too, we are trying to prevent new technical developments from damaging flora and fauna.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the new sonars that are currently under discussion, I can be brief. We see cases of stranded sea mammals whose hearing has been damaged. Those animals are stranded in areas where ships sail that are equipped with a new kind of extra loud sonar. These factors, combined, lead us to believe that those sonars cause damage to sea mammals. I take the view that we should apply the precautionary principle in this instance too and should therefore temporarily ban the use of those types of sonar in European waters until such time as it has been proven that there is some other cause or – if the damage is indeed caused by these sonar devices – until a final ban is imposed. With regard to the amendment tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I understand that restrictions can be imposed on protected areas, but it seems wise to me to retain the current text of the resolution in order to send the strongest possible signal to the Council and the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In 2002 and 2003, over 300 dolphins and porpoises were washed ashore and their carcasses could be seen on beaches.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of recent research published in <span class="italic">Nature</span> magazine in October, attention has focused on naval sonars. However, the absolute priority for groups concerned with such sea mammal deaths in the south-west of England and many other parts of the country is to put a stop to indiscriminate pair trawling in the English Channel as soon as possible. We are impatiently awaiting EU action on this. My constituents simply cannot understand why action has not already been taken on the basis of the precautionary principle, which the Commission so often cites in support of its initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">We want more research to be carried out on the effect of naval sonars. I note that the Verts/ALE Group is moving an amendment saying that it wants a moratorium because it has been proved that naval sonars are dangerous. That is not actually true. The research published in <span class="italic">Nature</span> says: 'The incidence of such cases of dead mammals during a naval sonar exercise indicates that acoustic factors <span class="italic">could</span> be important.' <span class="italic">Nature</span> magazine says that further investigation is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that we have to be realistic. Green MEPs support the idea of an immediate restriction or ban on such sonars, but the British Navy, and no doubt others with less accessible websites, are about to conduct trials on a new low-frequency, high-intensity sonar S2087 from Type 23 frigates. The Ministry of Defence admits that there is an acoustic effect that might damage sea mammals. For that reason, it will introduce mitigating and monitoring measures to protect marine mammals. For example, we would prefer to see avoidance of the use of sonar in marine breeding grounds adopted as part of a common EU strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Blocking the use of such sonars in any EU waters would deprive those who defend us of a useful early-warning tool that we might well need in a dangerous world. It is a difficult balance, but we believe that our amendment to the text delivers the best possible solution. If it is not adopted many of us will, with great regret, have to abstain or vote against this motion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At the moment, the scientific evidence is clear. The University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria has carried out very detailed studies on the subject and it is clear that the low-frequency sonar used in naval military manoeuvres does harm to animals.</p>

I do not know what the PPE-DE Group wants to do: perhaps they should give out ear protectors to the dolphins and whales.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of ziphii have died this summer in the Canary Islands, clearly due to the effects of sonar. The Verts/ALE Group has been condemning this for a long time. The Spanish Government and the Ministry of Defence have acknowledged the problem and the Canary Islands Government recently accepted that this type of harm is related to the use of medium-frequency active sonars.</p>
<p class="contents">Last April, the Government and the Ministry of Defence signed a cooperation agreement to prevent the mass beaching of ziphii which is taking place in the Canary Islands area. This agreement is very significant, since it shows concern and demonstrates that ziphii are affected by sonar.</p>
<p class="contents">What we find completely unacceptable is the amendment presented by the Group of the European Peoples’ Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats with a view to restricting the use of high-intensity naval radar/sonar only in areas defined as sensitive marine habitats, something which is absolutely impossible.

It is a fact that the European Parliament is not just responsible for the protection of the environment, but also for security and defence matters, on the latter of which we have set up a sub-committee. I believe that any resolution adopted by us would carry much more weight if it took full account of these aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say that it is extraordinarily important that we should find a solution, and that whales and dolphins have to be protected. About this, I believe there is broad agreement in this House as a whole, but there is, on the other hand, the question of what is the best course of action. I do not know whether it is realistic to call for a moratorium, for the continued use of these devices to some extent will continue to be necessary for security and other reasons. For that reason, I believe it would be more realistic to seek first a suitable geographical limit and come to an agreement that these devices should no longer be used in places where whales and dolphins have died in particularly large numbers. For that reason, I very much commend the amendment tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party.</p>
<p class="contents">There is yet another aspect to this, in that a preparatory programme for safety research is currently under discussion – it features in the Budget debates, Commissioner Schreyer – and it is to be introduced and funded by the European Union. As I see it, the issue of substitutes for sonars, or that of other methods for protecting whales, should be dealt with under the heading of this programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
