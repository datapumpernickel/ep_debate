<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, the oral question from Mrs Jackson and the draft resolution before Parliament today on the same subject are all very timely. One year after our return from Johannesburg we must keep up the momentum and maintain political leadership in the European Union by delivering on our Johannesburg commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to address the specific points in Mrs Jackson's oral question before taking the opportunity to add a few more general points on the Johannesburg follow-up.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me start by addressing the last issue raised in Mrs Jackson's question: the Commission's role in making sure that sustainable development becomes a major and regular aspect of forthcoming Spring Councils. I would like to make three points in response to this part of the question. First, by adding an external dimension to the Göteborg strategy, the European Council conclusions mean that the European Union's sustainable development strategy is the main vehicle for the implementation of the Johannesburg commitments. Consistent with this approach, the Commission intends to continue addressing the follow-up of the World Summit in its annual synthesis reports in preparation for the Spring European Council meetings.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the Commission is also undertaking an overall review of the sustainable development strategy to be ready by the time the new Commission takes up office. The review, covering the period up until 2009, will further integrate the World Summit implementation into the revised strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, the Commission services are now preparing a stocktaking document on the Summit follow-up that will be submitted by the end of 2003 and that may also include proposals for further action.</p>
<p class="contents">We want Parliament to be more closely involved in discussing the implementation of the World Summit commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to the first part of the oral question, reporting specifically on the water and energy initiatives. In our stocktaking paper on the World Summit follow-up the Commission plans to submit to Parliament and to the Council a detailed report on both initiatives. 'Water for Life' aims to bring sanitation and water to those who lack it most. Currently 2.2 billion people die from water-related diseases each year, a figure that is unacceptable. The EU initiative is focused on Africa, but will also cover other regions. A ministerial conference in Addis Ababa in December 2003 should help to develop ownership among all African stakeholders. The Commission has tabled an ambitious proposal to allocate EUR 1 billion from the European Development Fund to set up an EU water fund. This money is already reserved in the budget, but the Council has so far been reluctant to free up the resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union Energy Initiative for Poverty Eradication and Sustainable Development addresses access to affordable and sustainable energy services. Nearly 30 developing countries from three continents have joined the initiative. To take it forward in Africa the Commission will sponsor a high-level energy event to be held in Nairobi on 20 and 21 November 2003. As in the case of water, ownership and awareness in recipient countries are essential to make progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Still on the subject of energy, the EU also launched in Johannesburg the Renewable Energy Coalition. The Commission has agreed to host the Coalition secretariat. We intend to work intensively in the coming months to ensure the Coalition is fully consolidated in time for the 2004 World Renewable Energy Conference in Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">On the final part of the oral question dealing with strengthened governance for sustainable development, this is clearly an essential requirement for progress in the World Summit implementation. In this regard, the European Council has stressed the need to reinforce UNEP and to consider its institutional upgrading by creating a UN environment agency. This is an important objective and our interaction with UNEP must be enhanced right away.</p>
<p class="contents">In the short term we need to expand UNEP's role in the World Summit implementation. The results of the Global Ministerial Environment Forum in February 2003 should help to achieve this objective. The results were very positive on chemicals, with a decision on the strategic approach to international chemicals management, setting up a process that should culminate in an Intergovernmental Conference in 2006. UNEP was also asked to take an active role in the pursuit of the ten-year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production, agreed in Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="contents">The Global Ministerial Environment Forum will meet again in Korea in March 2004. Water, sanitation and human settlements – the three items on the CSD agenda for 2004 and 2005 – will be the main focus of discussions. Nevertheless, some of the unfinished business on international environmental governance will also need to be addressed, including matters such as UNEP's funding, the reinforcement of its scientific basis and its role in enforcing international environmental agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to some of the broader issues associated with the World Summit implementation and reflected in the draft resolution. One year ago I came to Parliament and told you that the European Union could be proud of the leadership role it played during the Johannesburg Summit. I also told you that our slogan for the summit would continue to guide us in the implementation phase: From Words to Deeds. My own assessment is that work is in progress to implement our commitments across the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development, both internally and externally, but events, and most recently the failure of the trade talks in Cancún, show the scale of the challenge we still face.</p>
<p class="contents">In March 2003 the European Council identified a set of priorities for implementing the sustainable development strategy and the Johannesburg outcomes. Foremost amongst those priorities is policy coherence between external commitments and internal policies. The reform of the common agricultural policy and the fisheries policy is a step in the right direction. However, further efforts are needed in these and other areas, such as energy and transport. Our credibility will suffer if unsustainable trends persist or if our policies have detrimental impacts outside the EU, in particular on the development opportunities of the poorest countries.</p>
<p class="contents">On sustainable consumption and production, the EU has been playing a leading role by promoting a broad mix of policies and tools, such as integrated pollution prevention and control, the eco-management and audit scheme and eco-labelling, as well as sectoral instruments in key areas such as energy or agriculture. But we should not try to reinvent the wheel: we are assessing the measures and instruments implemented so far and identifying gaps. We are also working with Member States to provide an overall assessment by the end of 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Poverty eradication has been, and will continue to be, at the centre of our World Summit commitments, as will the development dimension. This is a key issue when working towards the achievement of all internationally agreed development goals.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of financing for development, the Commission has been asked by Member States to closely monitor the commitments made before the Monterrey Conference. Continued efforts will be needed to stick to our commitments against a background of sluggish economic growth and fiscal austerity.</p>
<p class="contents">In concluding, let me welcome Parliament's support in pushing for the EU to be in the forefront when it comes to delivery. Two weeks ago the European Commission adopted a communication on our cooperation with the United Nations. It was entitled: 'The Choice of Multilateralism' and in it we stated that the EU should adopt a determined front-runner approach to the negotiation and implementation of important initiatives in the fields of sustainable development, poverty reduction and international security. We also called upon the UN itself to follow more closely an approach based on benchmarking and clear targets in the follow-up to major conferences, such as the World Summit. I am confident that I can count on Parliament's continued support in pursuing these efforts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wijkman (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, firstly, I too wish to say thank you to Mrs Wallström. I am well aware of her commitment to these issues, and the information she provided about what has happened following the Johannesburg Summit was welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to thank Mr de Roo for his draft of a sound resolution, which we shall vote on tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">We all – or many of us at least – had high expectations prior to Johannesburg, but the outcome fell far short of these. To a certain extent, I believe that the difficulties have to do with the fact that the work on sustainable development in a way runs counter to our traditional method of working. In this context, we are required to work horizontally, that is to say to integrate the objective of economic growth with those of social development and of the effective protection and responsible management of the physical environment.</p>
<p class="contents">This integration is difficult for many reasons. To begin with, we do not have an education system that facilitates an understanding of these horizontal connections. On the contrary, most of us have a segmented education. In the same way, the research world is partitioned. Everyone talks about cooperation across the discipline barriers, but the vast majority of researchers are specialists in narrow areas. Few are able to survey the whole scene and few have the knack of seeing systems as an organic whole. Our method of organising ourselves in various areas of society is also vertical or divided into sectors. We can take this Parliament as an example. We should have a committee on sustainable development, but instead we are divided into sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a problem with the whole of the economic model. It is very short-sighted and does not enable us to incorporate either the long-term or qualitative aspects of development. We still measure everything in terms of gross national product, that is to say the total production of goods and services. There is no vision of how such production – or, for that matter, consumption – affects the environment or social development. Do not misunderstand me, I do not for a moment believe that we could solve these problems through negative growth or by consuming less, when the point is that we must devote much more attention to the forms, content and quality of growth and not just to its quantity. Mrs Wallström, I believe this is a great challenge, especially for the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s role in the work in favour of sustainable development is central, especially today when we encounter a lukewarm attitude on the part of the Washington administration. Our responsibility in this area has implications both for our internal policy and for our cooperation with the poor countries. Where our own policy is concerned, we need to adjust the economic regulations so that we provide sufficient positive incentives for the far more efficient management of energy and materials. We also need, step by step, to stop using substances that remain toxic for long periods. Allow me to give a practical example. When it comes to the supply of energy, which is central in the context of the Lisbon Process, we could agree upon an ambitious target for reducing the consumption of energy in our economies or, if we wished to, for increasing energy efficiency by, for example, 2.5% to 3.0% per year. That is entirely possible at a purely technical level, but there is a lack of political will.</p>
<p class="contents">Where our relations with the poor countries are concerned, Commissioner Wallström has already pointed to the water and energy initiatives. I can only hope that this issue of the supply of water, with the billion euros earmarked for it, will be resolved shortly. One way of doing this would, in actual fact, be to ensure that the European Development Fund, or EDF, was incorporated into the ordinary budget, something which we in Parliament have always demanded.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the energy issue, I am unfortunately rather pessimistic. The proposal submitted is very sound, but there is no extra money set aside. What is really required – and what is not at all happening – is for priority to be given to the supply of energy and to sensible efforts in this area, not only on the part of the Commission but also on that of the recipient countries. I should like to call upon Mrs Wallström to try to release a proper amount of additional money and earmark it for this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution we are to decide about tomorrow requires, and reflects the wish for, ongoing progress reports on the part of the Commission. Mrs Wallström has also commented on this, which is excellent. I just hope that there is very substantial reporting of what is being done in the developing countries. In this area, we at present lack any reporting worthy of the name. We lack clear objectives and clear indicators. The discussion we conduct on the aid we provide and on how effective our efforts are in this area is therefore couched in very general terms. I believe the Commission as a whole needs to commit itself to developing both quantitative objectives and indicators whereby we obtain reporting worthy of the name.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish, just like Mrs Wallström, naturally to focus upon the issues related to poverty. We need more aid, but also better aid. For this, reforms to the trade system are needed, as I say. From that point of view, what happened in Cancún is of course very unfortunate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In our decision, supported unreservedly by my political group, we emphasise that measures to implement the Johannesburg programme are necessary. That is not something we are now addressing for the first time. In Johannesburg, where many of us were disappointed by the results because they fell short of the European Union’s demands, we already knew what was required. There is, however, a chance, at least in the future, to make up some ground in this area if we can achieve many of the objectives we set ourselves in Johannesburg and if we can really achieve significant progress in a number of areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I admit that we do not at present find specifically the best conditions in relation to our demand that, in particular, the European Union ought, in the future too, to play a pioneering role in issues of sustainable development. I am just thinking of the long discussions on chemicals policy and also in other important areas. I also know that, in this area, it is not so much the Commission that is putting the brakes on but, without a doubt, the Member States too. Nor, however, is the current Presidency, whose representatives in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy painted a very sad picture a few weeks ago – also in connection with the issue of sustainable development – the best advertisement when we at present talk about this topic.</p>
<p class="contents">I was disturbed to learn that the Presidency has apparently either not understood, or not wanted to understand, either the principle of shared responsibility on the part of the developed and developing countries or the principle of different degrees of responsibility according to which, if we cause pollution, we must assume greater responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner has already mentioned a number of the points I wanted to raise. She has informed us about the water and energy initiatives. I am already delighted about the comprehensive reports on these subjects, because the very participants in this House’s parliamentary delegation were very anxious that the projects concerned were too large or that, for example, renewable energy would be under-represented in the energy initiative and that traditional forms of energy would be accorded undue support.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that, in the near future, we can count upon a proposal by the Commission on chemicals policy. One objective of Johannesburg was, of course, to reverse the trend by 2020 where dangerous chemicals are concerned. I believe that the problems with chemicals policy also show that having our own committee on sustainable development does not help us out of the difficulties. There are very detailed discussions, and we must work through one topic after another and, in the case of every topic – including chemicals policy – bear in mind the need for sustainable development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would be most grateful if she would try to depart from her prepared remarks and deal with these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">At Johannesburg she, on behalf of the European Union, was successful in securing agreement on ambitious targets to improve sanitation for billions of people within a relatively short period of time. The first year has passed and there has been lots of talk and plenty of paper, but if the targets are to be met, we need to see hundreds of wells, thousands of septic tanks, tens of thousands of pipes being laid each and every month. At a meeting in Parliament earlier today, the Commissioner reminded Members that EUR 1 billion had been set aside to start projects and she informed us that the Council had blocked the spending of this money.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, can you tell the House, has the Commission being putting forward specific proposals for the use of some of this money on projects to improve sanitation in developing nations? Has any expenditure at all been authorised by the Council or has everything been blocked? Has this refusal to release funds been universal; has it been entirely by agreement of the Council or has it been the case that some Member States have been instrumental in securing the blocking of expenditure?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally Commissioner, if this is the case, how do you feel personally about the way in which the Council appears to be backsliding on the commitments made by the European Union at a summit where – and we take great pride in this fact – we played a leadership role? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was there. Environmental breakthroughs were achieved in Rio. The Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on Biological Diversity were signed. Sadly, no consensus was reached in Rio regarding forests. Developing countries were fobbed off with the renewed pledge to increase funds for development aid to 0.7%, but ten years later in Johannesburg the contrary was seen: even less development aid. The Johannesburg Summit concerned itself more with the problems of poverty than those of the environment; and rightly so. 25 000 children are dying in our world every day. Fortunately, the Johannesburg Summit did not fail like the one in Cancún a week ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Davies has already touched on the point that the practical implementation leaves much to be desired, particularly regarding the European water and energy initiatives. Fortunately, however, a partial breakthrough was achieved in the field of energy for the first time. A coalition of the willing will now try to promote new, renewable energy. That is a good thing.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has to learn at world level what it is now doing internally, slowly and laboriously, in the Lisbon process. Progress has to be made with the economic, social and environmental circumstances at the same time. Improvements have to be made at the same time. We have not reached that point yet at world level. However, our Green motto is: trade, aid and firm agreements simultaneously. We want more fair trade; but that sadly failed in Cancún. More aid must also be given for clean water, sanitation and renewable energy sources for the more than one billion citizens of our world that are currently without them. New environmental agreements are also needed, particularly for sustainable forest management. We must not forget that. The path is long, but soft power will triumph. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition, I said then that realising the objectives should contribute to the desired sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">I see sustainable development as an embodiment of the task that God has set mankind to dress and keep the earth. It is very important to ensure a balance between social, economic and environmental elements. In addition, we must strive to achieve this balance not only for the developed, but also for the developing, countries. Sadly, this balance was not given its due at the Johannesburg Summit, because not enough emphasis was placed on the social and environmental elements.</p>
<p class="contents">One year on from Johannesburg, there is already cause for us to worry about the implementation plan. It would be good if the European Union were to take more initiatives in this regard. It is a good thing, of course, that we are dedicating ourselves to enabling the Kyoto Protocol to enter into force, but more is needed. The targets for drinking water and sanitation, chemicals, fish stocks and the reduction of poverty, starvation and child mortality should be followed by tangible action and policy. In addition, I am very curious to hear what the European Commission has done over the past year to establish a trade policy that does not hinder the development of poor countries or the environment. We must be careful that we do not ask for too much at the same time, or do things that are only indirectly connected to sustainable development. The promotion of equality between men and women could serve as an example of this. It is not always advisable to get involved, as the European Union, in matters of a strongly cultural nature. Where human rights violations are concerned, it is a different story, of course, but these do not fall under the subject of sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I am concerned about the European Union's approach to combating AIDS. I am convinced that marital fidelity is a much better means than all kinds of contraceptives. Practical experience has shown that campaigns involving contraceptives are not as effective. Information campaigns such as those taking place in Uganda are much more so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Combining economic aspects, environment and the social dimension is a powerful idea. These are the three cornerstones of a better world. Sustainable development has developed over time. Initially, it was chiefly concerned with the environment, and had an additional socioeconomic aspect. Nowadays, the environment seems to be accorded a lower priority at international conferences, and poverty reduction takes precedence. Whereas Rio was still an environmental conference, Johannesburg was concerned with everything: water, AIDS, schooling, energy, poverty, malaria and environment. That makes it difficult to implement sustainable development; for, with all the problems we are tackling, we have the sense that we can never do everything at the same time. As far as I am concerned, it is also somewhat apolitical to put so many desires on the table at the same time without making choices. In order to make sustainable development a little more specific, I have two suggestions to make.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, all of the European Union’s policies should undergo a ‘Johannesburg check’. It seems to me a good idea to examine all of our legislation and policies against sustainable development: primarily policies with clear external implications, but also more internal matters such as the Directive on paints. One example is climate policy. Our thoughts are chiefly turned to the environmental aspects and the economic costs; while the social aspect <span class="bold">– </span>the attention to social inequality <span class="bold">–</span> has up to now been left behind. Another example is pharmaceutical legislation. We are chiefly preoccupied with our industry, the competitive position of European businesses, and our own public health, and we are not looking at the rest of the world. It does not have to be this way. A Johannesburg check would bring this to light immediately, and also open our eyes to the environmental aspects of medicines. With the packaging dossier, Parliament did its best to involve exports to developing world countries in this by means of a prevention policy, and to promote sustainable production and consumption. In food legislation, there are environmental aspects and social aspects in abundance. The current food legislation would not, at any event, pass the Johannesburg check. By showing that it is possible to give flesh and blood to sustainable development, we bring about rejuvenation, and this rejuvenation can also arouse new creativity.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to the second point. Sustainable development not only needs flesh and blood, but indeed a face. Our common foreign policy is having difficulty getting off the ground. Anyone who reflects on Europe’s role in the world quickly comes to the conclusion that we are too divided to find a military role of any consequence for ourselves. Why, then, should we not put a great deal more emphasis on global public leadership; leadership so that we may tackle problems worldwide in a pragmatic way and in consultation with interested parties, businesses and NGOs. We have to commit resources to this and make room for it in our budget, therefore. It may also be a good idea to give this leadership, too, a face: a ‘Johannesburg Commissioner’. There are sufficient commissioners in the coming term of office who would be capable of fulfilling this role. Perhaps you, Commissioner, could advance the idea of a Johannesburg Commissioner and a Johannesburg check a little within the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Such a concept is also an extremely difficult one because it has to be translated into what Mr Davies mentioned. It has to be translated into the concrete number of new wells that have to be drilled or into providing pipes and other items necessary for good sanitation facilities for poor people. That is why I like your questions so much, because this is exactly how we have to proceed now.</p>
<p class="contents">What have we been doing? We are, as you know, preparing a report for the end of the year which will explain exactly what this 'Water for Life' initiative means and what it contains. The discussion so far in the Council has presented difficulties for some Member States. The Council is not fond of the idea of setting up a secretariat for the particular purpose of a water fund – although perhaps you should ask the Council about this, because who am I to say how it discusses the matter? Perhaps the Council wants greater flexibility in the use of this EDF money, at least, that is how I understand the direction the discussion is taking in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">However, when we discuss the 'Water for Life' initiative, it covers both water and sanitation. There are a number of initiatives that range from looking at the approach to river-basin management, to big rivers in Africa, to very concrete projects like drilling wells.</p>
<p class="contents">In our report, which you will receive before the end of 2003, we will show exactly what has been achieved so far and how we can establish ownership in poor countries, for example in Africa. We have concentrated on Africa, but we also need to get its people on board and allow them to feel that this is their project, that they can work on it and achieve good results. I do not have the figures to give you the exact numbers, but we are compiling them now to provide clear evidence of what has been done so far and of how we think the next steps should be designed.</p>
<p class="contents">Our other problem is that we know each other, perhaps, too well in our discussions on sustainable development. However, this matter has to be integrated into all other policy areas. This is exactly what you have been saying in all contexts, from trade to agriculture, energy or transport. We have to subject the matter to the Johannesburg check that Mrs Corbey has mentioned. We should be able to come back and see whether we have changed the time perspective or the geographical perspective. We will, of course, continue to ensure that this policy is integrated better in what we do and ensure policy coherence, because that is really the major challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot agree more with you on, amongst the other issues you mentioned, the need for education and research, which applies across borders. The next opportunity for us is to return to it when we provide the report and keep it constantly on our common agenda.</p>
