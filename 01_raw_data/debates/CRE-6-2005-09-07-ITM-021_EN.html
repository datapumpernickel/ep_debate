I wish to thank all those fellow Members who have shown great interest in, and commitment to, the report and made valuable contributions to it.</p>
<p class="contents">The gender with which we happen to be born is as important a health factor as social, economic and ethnic background. The UN conferences in Cairo in 1994 and Beijing in 1995 put gender-related discrimination in health care on the agenda. Unfortunately, not much has happened since in the way of action, whether it be in the Member States or at EU level. Women’s health is still often seen as synonymous with sexual and reproductive health. Naturally, women’s health is more complex than that.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to mention a few examples of gender discrimination. Women with acute heart complaints are still forced to wait longer than men for ambulance transport. The same types of heart disease still lead to higher mortality among women than among men. It is still the case that more men than women with sight problems are given the opportunity of having cataract operations. Violence against women, which is a major public health problem, is still an almost invisible phenomenon in medical training and practice. Men still constitute the norm in research and the development of new drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">This report focuses in particular on two different areas. The first area is about submitting proposed measures to combat gender discrimination between men and women affected by the same or similar diseases. The other focus area is women’s health from the perspective of so-called ‘women’s diseases’, that is to say diseases that almost only affect women, for example breast cancer, osteoporosis, eating disorders in the case of young girls and violence against women in all its different forms – physical and mental abuse, genital mutilation, sexual slavery, prostitution etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Gender discrimination becomes very clear to anyone able to study the <span class="italic">few</span> research reports that exist. For example, an analysis of the work done at a health centre in Sweden specialising in skin diseases reveals that men and women are treated very differently. Men are given the more expensive light treatment, while women are sent home with a prescription for skin ointment. The conclusion in terms of costs is that, if women were treated in the same way as men, the resources expended on women would increase by 61%. If, on the other hand, the intensity of women’s treatment is taken as the norm, the cost of treatment would decrease by 33%. I might also mention that, in the example I cite, <span class="italic">all </span>the doctors who discriminated between women and men in issuing prescriptions were women. This shows that gender discrimination permeates thinking in the case of both men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to combat gender discrimination, researchers and others must have access to gender-disaggregated health care statistics. Without information and knowledge, we cannot substantiate how, in reality, gender discrimination operates. Nor, without such knowledge, can we do anything about the problems. It really is high time that measures were taken enabling us to talk in terms of fair and equal care.</p>
<p class="contents">Gender discrimination in health care is just as important a determinant as ethnic background and social and economic factors. This is something of which we must take account in future in our work to obtain fair and equal health care.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to emphasise that access to sexual advice, reproductive health care and family planning are important tools in the service of women’s health, as well as of women’s opportunities to participate in society on equal terms and of combating poverty and the ongoing feminisation of poverty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is a fact that, from the day I took up office and became involved in health issues, I realised that there is indeed a gender dimension – a difference between the two sexes – in health issues.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, for example, the question of smoking, where it now appears that there is an increasing tendency among women to smoke, especially young women and especially on the basis of the false promise that they can use smoking to control their weight. We know society's problems as far as young girls' weight is concerned and this is now being exploited in order to promote smoking.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the question of HIV/AIDS. Unfortunately, the number of cases is increasing in the European Union among young people, especially women. This is also one of the most worrying factors about this illness. Then there is, of course, the question of alcohol, consumption of which is indeed rising at the moment thanks to alcopops, which target and are mainly consumed by women, with the social problems that this can cause.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, that is why I consider the report to be very important and both I and the rest of the Commission will take very serious account of the proposals contained in it. Of course, I must say from the outset that many of the issues touched on in the report falls within the competence of the Member States. Nonetheless, we have ways, such as proposals, recommendations, the open method of coordination and guidelines, with which we can develop a common policy between Parliament and the Commission in order to persuade the Member States to apply it.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to refer briefly to two or three matters: in both the 2006 programme and the new health programme we shall take account and promote the gender dimension, exactly as the report proposes; on the question of smoking for 2006, we shall focus our attention on young women. The same applies to alcohol: the strategy which I shall be presenting within the coming year will have a special dimension for young women.</p>
<p class="contents">The same also applies to mental health, which will be approached from the criterion of the gender dimension. The Green Paper on mental health which we shall be publishing in October will also emphasise this issue. We shall soon be announcing the new guidelines for breast cancer screening and we have already extended work on cervical cancer also. We believe that, by the end of the year, we shall have the first package of guidelines. This proves that we really are taking account of this dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, what is really important, and I take it on board and will promote it in the Commission, is the question of collating data, really accurate data which will give us the real dimension of the difference between the sexes in the health sector; this will of course help both us and the Member States to plan the rest of our strategy. For example, in 2006 we shall define indicators for gynaecological health and the menopause, such as an endometriosis indicator which is, of course, extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to close by saying that in the pharmaceutical sector, together with my colleague Mr Verheugen, we shall soon be announcing an initiative in the pharmaceutical industry sector and we shall take account here in the patient information sector of the need for a different approach to women as regards the use of drugs which, as the report quite rightly says and there is no need for me to analyse it further, react differently in men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall follow the debate with a great deal of interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have but one word to say on the matter: ‘vigilance’. In fact, the scope and pertinence of the rapporteur’s remarks highlight forms of discrimination that seem to belong to a different era. It is unacceptable that, today, the simple fact of being a woman means that there is a greater risk of not being born, and then, of being less well cared for than a man.</p>
<p class="contents">Health is our most precious asset and this asset in currently in danger. For a number of years, an increasingly clear link has been established between women’s physical and mental health and their economic situation. Poor women have more physical and psychological health problems than other women. They have a shorter life expectancy, they experience premature aging and they take more medication. One out of every two teenage girls from an underprivileged background shows a high level of psychological distress. More than half the number of single-parent mothers live in poverty; they take more medication than other mothers and their level of psychological distress is particularly high. Women who are less educated or who are unemployed or poor are, in fact, the most affected by psychological distress and physical health problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Female poverty, single parenthood and social isolation therefore create an explosive cocktail that endangers women’s health, a state of affairs that is quite simply intolerable. This report is an extremely useful reminder, which comes at just the right time. There are no individual explanations and solutions: we must therefore find joint explanations and solutions. That is our political task. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why the report by Mrs Svensson is so important, and I am much obliged to her for it. It is really no longer acceptable that most medicinal products are still tested only on men – another fact which has already been mentioned – even though we know that biological factors mean that medicinal products work differently on men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also no longer acceptable that, for example, more women than men die of heart attacks, because the differing symptoms that occur in women mean that the condition is not diagnosed in time. It is equally incomprehensible, in my opinion, that there is still a complete absence of references to any gender-specific reactions in instruction leaflets for medicines. My group fully supports this report, therefore, as it requires Member States to finally take gender-specific health policy seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the demands put forward in this report are not new. This just goes to show how slowly the wheels of bureaucracy turn in the Member States. Although EU guidelines for the early detection of breast cancer in women aged between 50 and 69 have been in place since 1992, comprehensive mammography screening exists in only nine Member States. This can reduce mortality by 35%.</p>
<p class="contents">This report also calls for screening for women from the age of 40, subject to the availability of evidence-based data, as there are early indications that mortality can be reduced here, too, by up to 20%.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue we regard as important is that of chlamydia infection. This disease leads to female infertility in one third of cases, where it has not been diagnosed in time. Further data on this are urgently needed.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, I should like to draw attention briefly to a development that is going completely unnoticed by the public. Although Caesarean operations present an increased health risk to mother and child, the number of such operations is rising dramatically in several States. Causes seem to range from hospital doctors’ duty rosters, to supplementary income from private patients, to parents requesting particular appointment dates: holiday planning plays a major part in this.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, my group supports the call – addressed to Member States, in the first instance, of course – for attention to be drawn explicitly to the health risks of Caesareans to mother and child, which are five times greater than with natural births. However, we also support the call for the Commission to further study this phenomenon and gather and pass on the relevant data.</p>
<p class="contents">We also welcome the call for the Commission and the Member States to take every possible step to ensure that women finally receive a full explanation of the advantages and disadvantages of hormone replacement therapy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It could be described as a patchwork quilt: it lacks any grand design or focus. We must, however, have clear areas of focus. The speech by the Commissioner just now was very welcome. His conclusion that the gender dimension should be taken into account and the areas of focus which he mentioned were truly welcome. The main issue that should be raised is the fact that 14 Member States of the Union have not implemented the screening programme to identify cancerous diseases. It would save money and human life, and it is very important that these screening examinations are actually carried out in good time. It was also very positive that the Commissioner suggested that mental health was a priority. In many Member States mental health patients are clearly second-class citizens, and mental health illnesses are not seen as diseases in the same way as others. Thirdly, I would also like to say how glad I was that the growth in alcohol consumption was something the Commissioner drew attention to in his speech. Alcohol consumption has increased in almost all Member States, and deaths and alcohol-related illnesses have become common. This has been a fatal trend, especially among the young. There is therefore much to do with regard to this at Union and government level, and priorities must be set. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As has already been emphasised, there were failings: gender differences were not noticed. I do hope, however, that the Commission will not merely pay lip service to this, but that this initiative will, in future, lead to more action to rectify this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">There is particular agreement that female genital mutilation is a crime against women in many respects, but especially from a medical point of view. The European Union must not be content with making appeals, but must set a crystal-clear example, and I hope that the Commission will join with the next Presidency in launching an appropriate initiative. We need screening programmes, we need a notification requirement, and we need penal measures for those conducting genital mutilation in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Chlamydia leads to infertility in one third of cases. We need greater awareness, more campaigns, to bring this truly dramatic issue into the public eye. In addition, the risks arising from hormone treatment, and hyperstimulation in the case of in vitro fertilisation, can no longer be played down. The European Union must do more in this field, particularly for the sake of women. It is my hope, therefore, that this own-initiative report really signifies a fresh start at European level, and will thus bring the issue of ‘women and health’ into sharper focus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Dutch Parliament will not discuss further measures against female genital mutilation until later on this month. The Cabinet has adopted a number of sound recommendations from the Public Health Council on the prevention and prosecution of genital mutilation. That itself illustrates how important it is that this subject, and Mrs Svensson’s report, be considered. Despite the Netherlands’ image, to which it is attached, of being a progressive country, clear policy on genital mutilation has been too long in coming, and even now, the Dutch Government has not yet decided in favour of a notification requirement for health professionals, because it fears that the public will avoid seeking medical help if is used for enforcement purposes. However, we cannot afford to take this casual approach to this serious form of abuse, and we therefore support the appeal in Mrs Svensson’s report for notification to be made mandatory.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the gender disparities in health care and the need for a gender-specific approach to health complaints, as indicated in the report, there are many areas left where women and health have a special relationship and where gender-specific effects can therefore be anticipated. These should be mapped out before new legislation is introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">Two months ago, the Dutch Parliament decided to have a gender effect report drawn up for the new care system that is due to be introduced on 1 January. I would advise the Commission to have similar gender effect reports drawn up in areas of policy that really matter to women, and would ask that these be presented to Parliament before new health care legislation is approved. This could, in fact, be seen as an addition to paragraph 11 of Mrs Svensson’s report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although the report highlights a number of key problems of both a general and specific nature, its particular focus on certain issues means that it discriminates against others that are no less important, and for no good reason.</p>
<p class="contents">It is always easier to treat a disease whose cause is known. After having studied the report, I should therefore like to draw Members’ attention to the fact that discrimination stems from a lack of respect for human rights and ethical principles, as well as from the present epidemic of mental illness. It is a symptom of self-centredness, or in other words the desire to dominate others and to subjugate them by manipulating them for one’s own purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that most medical workers are female, which is a problem raised in the report, does not amount to discrimination. Instead, it is a prerequisite for patients, given that women are naturally caring and sensitive to their needs. Wages that are too low to meet costs can be discriminatory, however. Economic conditions and liberal lifestyles result in discrimination against women who have children and against morally upright families. The latter provide the only environment for normal growth and co-existence in an atmosphere of mutual respect and love, and a family environment of this kind requires legal support and pro-family policies.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, destruction of the family is one of the causes of sexual promiscuity, which is a further link in the chain of infection of sexually transmitted diseases, in particular chlamydia and HIV, which cause a great deal of suffering, as well as cancer and death. Similarly, the fight waged by women for the privileges and rights due to them must not degenerate into aggressive and conflict-generating rivalry with men.</p>
<p class="contents">If the author is genuinely concerned about women who suffer from mental illness and addictions, then why does paragraph 21 contain covert pro-abortion propaganda? Such propaganda disregards traditional standards and results in confusion and depravity, as does the liberal-minded tolerance of deviation. Furthermore, although differences do indeed exist between the types of addiction suffered by women and men, the underlying problem is always one of self-addiction. The latter is a symptom of individual mental deficiency and of the mental illnesses known in medical parlance as self-destructive behaviours.</p>
<p class="contents">Violence is also a symptom of mental illness. Research carried out on people in homosexual relationships has shown that the proportion of men and women using violence is around 50% respectively. This proves that violence is not related to gender.</p>
<p class="contents">From a medical point of view, the proposal to administer medicines on a gender-specific basis is entirely misguided, since it is standard practice to adapt dosages to a patient’s body weight or age. Any differences in the way individual medicines need to be administered depend on individual sensitivity and sex hormones, which means that there is no justification for the EU’s innovative introduction of gender differences into pharmacotherapy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am delighted that the interest we are taking in such matters may well be born out of the time-honoured European tradition of concern for the weaker members of society. This is a fine tradition in this instance, where there is every justification for turning our attention to women as the weaker half of the human race. At the same time, however, we must ask ourselves to what extent many of the problems facing women today stem from undesirable changes in civilisation, a flawed family model and negative ideologies that spread in the wake of modern ideas about good and evil and morality and immorality.</p>
<p class="contents">Men are working ever shorter hours, and in some Member States have even secured for themselves a 35-hour week, which means that nothing or almost nothing gets done. If we take this fact into account, as well as the fact that women also have to work this 35-hour week as well as looking after a home and family, it becomes clear that a woman’s lot is indeed harder. This begs the question of whether arrangements should not be made to allow women to stay at home if they so wish, and to devote themselves to their families instead of working as hard as they frequently do today.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, this report fails to highlight the negative consequences of frequent abortions, although it states very clearly that women are suffering from extremely serious mental disorders. It also indicates that levels of alcoholism and drug addiction among women are rising, and, as Mrs Svensson notes, that an increasing number of women are committing suicide, which is highly regrettable. The question that needs to be asked is the extent to which this results from flawed family types and models and from such things as the effects of abortions or of certain contraceptives.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, in spite of everything we should welcome the fact that women still live longer than men in the majority of countries. It is an unfortunate fact, however, that this gap in life expectancy is narrowing, and this is quite obviously a result of the many problems to which Mrs Svensson refers in her report.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret to say that this report has a certain ideological slant. As noted by Mrs Krupa, this can be seen in paragraph 21, which refers quite unnecessarily to ‘reproductive health’, or in other words covertly encourages women to have abortions. I am mystified as to why ideology-crazed feminists come out of the woodwork during almost every debate we hold. During debates on AIDS and on the Millennium Goals, and during the debate this House held on equal rights for women and men, there was always someone who wanted to shoehorn in ‘reproductive health’, or in other words a covert endorsement of abortion. This is entirely unnecessary ideology.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the confusion between patients and women in the health service is entirely misplaced ideology. Equal access for women and men to health services is one thing, but the internal workings of the health service are something else entirely. Unfortunately, this is yet another example of the deluded feminist ideas to which some Members of this House still fall prey.</p>
<p class="contents">It was with the greatest satisfaction and pleasure that I found in point D the statement that public health is affected primarily by ethical and moral principles. I hope that public health in Europe reaches an optimal level on the basis of good moral health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we know that we have neither the human resources nor the material resources to meet such a large-scale demand, and it seems to me that a certain modesty ought to guide our work.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that, at a time when we are enabling everyone to benefit from technological discoveries and when we are concerned about the way in which energy and food products are distributed, it is high time that we envisaged the creation of a European bank for health and prevention. It is quite obvious that, within the countries that have recently joined the European Union, a large part of the population is excluded from public health systems. These people do not go and enquire about health care.</p>
<p class="contents">Should we not, therefore, think about health care coming to them by means of screening campaigns, vaccinations and primary care dispensed, regardless of gender, by mobile teams and equipment? While in our old European countries, in fact, the right to health care has become undeniable, the same cannot be said of these countries, where health and social protection is all too often aimed at those who have paid contributions so as to benefit from this protection. It is therefore the case that unqualified and unemployed men and women, elderly people and lone parents do not have access to the most everyday care.</p>
<p class="contents">Leaving aside the resources that might come from the Structural Funds, such as funding allocations for the health care structures already implemented in these countries, it is imperative to ensure that a minimum level of health protection is given to these sections of the community. It would be wise, therefore, to begin with the children, as we know that without prevention and basic health care during childhood, incurable problems can set in. Then, depending on the needs, it would be a case of treating as a priority those areas with the most significant pathological conditions and, finally, of extending the scope of the activities. If we want to aspire to action with a humanitarian dimension, that is our duty as MEPs and that is the duty of our Assembly. It is a challenge, admittedly; however, we must have the ambition to accept it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore thank our rapporteur for her initiative and the useful information contained in her report.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, a prosperous society with standards and cohesion is based above all on the physical and mental health of its members. Our report raises awareness of the particular situations which women face in the health sector, such as childbirth, and of particular problems such as breast cancer, cervical cancer, osteoporosis and menopause.</p>
<p class="contents">It gives us information about the particular behaviour which women have as patients and users of certain drugs and therapies. The Commissioner has confirmed these peculiarities to us and assures us that he will incorporate them into his new strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur also gives us information about the lack of information and proper approach to these situations by society and by scientific and nursing staff. We therefore understand the need – and here I support the rapporteur's proposals – for special studies, detailed statistics and indicators, so that we can study these situations properly and address them effectively with all the parameters and at all levels – prevention, diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">What is important is that we understand that we need to examine the gender dimension in all our national and Community strategies and in all research programmes and all information and awareness-raising strategies, because women themselves must be informed and protected.</p>
<p class="contents">One negative element of the report is that it includes issues which do not come within the scope of the study, such as the call for shorter hours and pay levels and I propose that we should not vote for these paragraphs. I should also like the Commissioner, as the question of paragraph 21 was raised, to explain to us what the Commission means by its strategy on sexual and reproductive health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Turning to the Commissioner, I think it is appropriate to point out that this ambitious report, which combines a gender approach with health and the state of our health systems, deserves to be placed in the political spotlight, including by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should make its voice heard and, based on a careful analysis of the various national health systems in the Europe of 25, tell us what its overall approach is, how it intends to include prevention and treatment in all the Union’s policies and, above all, what its assessment is of Europe. Once we know that, and after the debate with Parliament, we shall be in a position to say what progress has been made in this continent, which is not merely a series of misfortunes, but a part of the world where women live better lives than in other areas of the planet.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should also specify the challenges facing us in building a new welfare state commensurate with women’s needs. Europe will not progress without women; that is a political fact that I hope even the Commission will not forget.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore grateful for this report, but I must admit that I have asked for a separate vote on three items: recital U and paragraphs 15 and 10, because they are superficial or poorly formulated and, despite the rapporteur’s very good intentions, they are liable to be damaging because they are not comprehensible.</p>
<p class="contents">Recital U and paragraph 15 state that ovarian stimulation as such may endanger a woman’s health. That statement is false and may, without saying as much, lead people to condemn stem cell research on the basis of some presumed gender discrimination. We do not need obscurantist attitudes!</p>
<p class="contents">Europe needs to move forwards on a firm scientific footing. Paragraph 10, at least as it has been translated into certain languages, calls not for human cloning to be ruled out of European programmes, as would be correct, but for the practice to be stopped or suspended. Europe does not finance any programmes of that kind, and therefore the idea that one might say or think that we are trying to stop therapeutic cloning should be ruled out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I refer to a disease which affects an estimated 14 million women and girls across the EU. There is no known cure, the cause is unknown and the average diagnosis time is rising, not falling, now standing at nine years. The disease I am talking about is endometriosis. It wrecks lives, it wrecks families, it causes infertility, it is not just 'bad period pains'. The disease desperately needs serious research and attention.</p>
<p class="contents">As Members will be aware, we had a written declaration in this House to raise awareness. We achieved a total of 266 signatures, more than has ever been achieved on a single health issue. Seemingly, though, the pain caused by this disease goes unnoticed. It is a real gender issue. Even in our modern society, no one wants to talk about the pain associated with menstruation; women should 'just get on with it'.</p>
<p class="contents">That cannot be right. The consequences of this disease are heart-rending for many women and families and there are also consequences for Europe's economy. 14 million women across the EU are waiting for someone to take their suffering seriously. It is wonderful that the rapporteur has included it.</p>
<p class="contents">I was grateful that the Commissioner mentioned it, but really it is now up to the Commission and the Member States to do something about this dreadful disease, which is a gender issue affecting only women and girls. I wonder what might have been the case had it been a male disease! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President, I concur with the notion that good health is not merely the absence of illness, but is about physical, mental and social wellbeing. That concept lies at the heart of a strategy called the Investing for Health Strategy, which I initiated in my constituency during my time as Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in the Northern Ireland Assembly. I saw myself not as a minister of illness, but as a minister of health.</p>
<p class="contents">This report by Eva-Britt Svensson – and I thank her for it – highlights many of the pertinent issues. It contains good, practical recommendations that are worthy of support.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been put to me that being a woman is bad for your health and indeed there are statistics that reinforce that commonly held view. We hear now of statistics from Scandinavia suggesting that there are inequalities not only in health status, but also in the response of health systems and health services to women, as compared with men. If this is the case in Scandinavia, with its relatively good record on equality, then it is time we took a very close look at trends in other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome Commissioner Kyprianou's recognition of the importance of data. I also echo the proposal put forward here this evening by my colleague, Kartika Liotard.</p>
<p class="contents">Recognition of gender inequalities in health is required if we are going to successfully combat disparities and ensure that there is adequate health care for everyone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am not a doctor, but I gather that many comments in it put the finger on the sore spot. I am impressed with the care that emanates from this report. It shows a great deal of compassion for the individuals who cannot in any way stand up for themselves, certainly when that is the result of abuse, crime or addiction. I wholeheartedly endorse the appeal for an accessible health care system. Paragraph 21, however, is in sharp contrast with all the positive sections of this report. Whilst the report devotes much attention to the well-being and health of adults, paragraph 21 fails to guarantee this for people at an earlier stage of their lives. It appears that the rights of, and care for, adults are more important than those for people who have just started out in life. To me, the life of every human being is just as valuable, whether they be very young or very old. That is why I would like to call for the removal of those elements that draw a distinction between care in the different life stages. In that way, the positive approach of this report can also benefit those people who cannot yet look after their own interests. I hope that my fellow Members will be prepared to remove this blot on this otherwise excellent report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report that she presented in committee was truly balanced and largely complete. It is important that the issue of ‘women and health’ be addressed at European level. I should also like thank the Commissioner for instigating the appropriate initiatives in this regard as, firstly, there is still a lack of information on the effects of many medicinal products on women and, secondly, illnesses specific to women are still receiving unequal treatment in research. There are hardly any clinical trials involving the testing of medicinal products on women. This is a particularly important aspect against the background of our current discussions on the Seventh Framework Research Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly – and this is a particular concern of mine – EU action is also important in the case of osteoporosis, the hidden epidemic which particularly affects women. It is important that the fight against this disease finally be given a higher profile.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite apart from these comments, I should also like to express my regret that the report in the form currently being put to the vote in plenary is only a watered-down version of what Mrs Svensson originally presented in committee. I find it particularly infuriating that the report now includes demands for shorter working hours and higher pay for healthcare professionals: in paragraph 54, for example. Although I fully appreciate the difficult working conditions within the health service, this is not something that should be dealt with at European level. Where would we be if decisions on pay were taken at European level? On the subject of working hours: we have only recently adopted the Working Time Directive, so I do not think it right for this issue to be addressed once more in this good report.</p>
<p class="contents">The same goes for an amendment tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament on unisex tariffs. We adopted a directive regarding unisex tariffs in 2004; I do not consider it appropriate to now demand a further revision of this. I, and other members of my group, therefore reserve the right to vote against this report tomorrow – if this means voting on absurd matters – even though I warmly welcome the essence of the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not only true of access to sexual and reproductive healthcare; there is also discrimination when it comes to diagnosis and treatment as a whole, particularly as regards what are deemed women’s diseases, such as fibromyalgia, breast and uterine cancer and osteoporosis. This is therefore a timely and welcome report and I take this opportunity to congratulate Mrs Svensson.</p>
<p class="contents">Women are discriminated against because prejudices prevail over common sense and respect for others. As a result of prejudice and lack of information there are more women today with AIDS. In order to reduce the number of women suffering, and to prevent more deaths, all Member States must, as a matter of priority, ensure access to sexual and reproductive healthcare and family planning. We cannot allow thousands of women to go on dying because they opted to undergo backstreet abortions; we cannot allow thousands of young people to suffer the consequences of teenage pregnancy because they have not been given sufficient support; we cannot allow thousands of women to suffer physical and psychological abuse in maternity wards because of neglect and, worse, prejudice. Even in European maternity wards there are women who are abandoned for hours on end during labour, suffering terribly, without any help or attention.</p>
<p class="contents">It is known that domestic violence, genital mutilation, the trafficking of women, prostitution and all manner of sexual trade are at the root of serious health problems and deaths among women. Violence against women between 15 and 44 kills more women than cancer, malaria, road accidents and war. In Europe, however, women continue to be abused, mutilated, trafficked and prostituted, without the authorities in the Member States fulfilling their responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">For that matter, what has the Commission done? In this area, it too has done very little. Even obvious and simple measures take time to be implemented, such as breast screening, which has only been put in place in a few countries – such as Belgium, Finland, France, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Portugal – and it is crucial that this be extended to cover other countries. Health policy falls under the competence of the Member States, but the Commission could and should do more in this area because there are many situations that go beyond national responsibilities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Svensson report comes at the beginning of the 21st century to prove that often, due to technological achievements and despite the progress of science and perhaps due to the breakdown in values, a large proportion of women in the European Union have or risk having bad health or are threatened by a plethora of illnesses, disorders and addictions.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the subject of today's report is gender discrimination in health systems; in other words, in the ways and means of addressing all the terrible and frightening threats described to women's physical and mental health.</p>

<p class="contents">Initiatives also on the health of girls and young women in the European Union, because its continuing life and prosperity depend on them. Even if in the motion for a resolution there is a lack of hierarchy and certain indications border on exaggeration and touch on the principle of subsidiarity, I feel, as a female Member of the European Parliament and as a women with daughters of her own that approaching health problems and the causes of illnesses with gender sensitivity is a civilised step.

I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, my Swedish fellow Member Mrs Svensson, for having included many important issues worth highlighting in this context. I am very glad that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has supported my amendments concerning, for example, women and smoking. The latter now forms part of paragraph 34, and I naturally hope that I shall receive support for it tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Sweden became the first country in the world in which the number of women smokers exceeded the number of male smokers, a fact of which I do not feel especially proud. Women are more vulnerable than men to the dangers of smoking. One explanation is that, in general, women are smaller than men and have smaller hearts and narrower coronary arteries than men. Investigations also show that it is mainly poorly educated women in low-paid jobs, for example care assistants and other health care workers, who are the biggest smokers.</p>
<p class="contents">In the last few days, a major new study carried out by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) was presented, showing for example that women with symptoms of heart disease and vascular disorders generally receive worse care than men, and this in spite of the fact that women’s chances of surviving heart attacks are fewer than men’s.</p>
<p class="contents">Discrimination of all kinds, in this case gender discrimination in health systems, is an international matter. We in the EU should therefore come up with a clear policy and also draw on each other’s experiences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Direct and indirect expenditures on medical treatment account for an ever-increasing share of the budgets of the Member States of the European Union. However, the positive effects of this are not experienced by everyone to the same degree. In the case of poor and disadvantaged groups, excluded on several counts, who make up the bottom third of society, we cannot say that there has been any significant change for the better either in terms of quality of health care provision, or in terms of their well-being, state of health, or life expectancy.</p>
<p class="contents">The report drawn up by my fellow Member, Mrs Svensson, clearly articulates the need for greater equity in health care provision. The objective is to provide the same quality of health care and ensure equal access to health services for women and men. A particularly strong point of this report is that it calls for the creation of the conditions for equal access to health care and equality of opportunities for pregnant women, women living with chronic illness or disability, older women and those belonging to other disadvantaged groups, for example Roma women.</p>
<p class="contents">Due to a lack of statistical data, we have no figures on the relationships between the Roma population as a whole or Roma women in particular and the various types of institutions that make up the health services. Few surveys have investigated the degree of prejudice manifested by health service employees in the way they deal with Roma people. Neither do we know what prejudices or fears are harboured by Roma people with regard to the health service and its employees. From reports by human rights NGOs and anthropological descriptions, however, the clear picture that emerges is that Roma women living within the European Union get poorer-quality health care, as they are affected by a number of unfavourable factors and are subject to discrimination. In Hungary today, for example, the life expectancy of a Roma woman is 62.5 years, while that of non-Roma women is 75 years. We need to have a great deal more discussion on the decisive factors involved in curtailing the lives of fellow women who are Roma by 13 years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are two invisible diseases, given the difficulty of their diagnosis and the lack of resources devoted to research and their treatment. It is calculated that 90% of the people suffering from these diseases are women. We are therefore clearly dealing with two gender diseases. Consequently, research into the origin and causes of these diseases is urgently needed, in order to improve treatments and compare results. To this end, it is essential to increase the resources allocated to research, improving the training of health professionals, organising information and social awareness campaigns, carrying out studies on their social, legal, economic and healthcare repercussions, and also to promoting and developing new techniques for early diagnosis and for the dissemination of existing prevention methods.</p>
<p class="contents">For all of these reasons, I would like to call upon the Commission to carry out a study that compares the degree of application of treatments and their effects, both physical and psychological, in each of the Member States, in order to make progress with tackling these diseases. It is essential to take account of the gender perspective when drawing up and applying health policies. Fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome are not the only diseases that mostly affect women. Other gender diseases that have been mentioned more often in this debate, such as breast cancer and osteoporosis, are at a rather more advanced stage in terms of prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Nonetheless, in all cases it is necessary to continue actively to make progress, to continue research and to ensure that the public authorities work to effectively guarantee the health of men and women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As members of parliament we draw attention to events around the world and we are particularly sensitive to minorities, who, in certain cases, demand special attention and care.</p>
<p class="contents">We women are not a minority, however. We represent more than half of the population of the European Union. In spite of this, women in our society encounter problems that are solely a result of their gender. So the fact that the treatment of women in various health systems continues to be discriminatory is something we simply cannot accept.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet the right to healthcare is one of the basic socio-economic rights in the European Union Charter of Human Rights. Therefore it is right and proper that the European Parliament, as the highest democratic institution in the European Union, should draw attention to this fact and put forward possible measures. In doing so we must observe the principle of subsidiarity and we must also do so in the document we are discussing today.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore support the document and I also support the amendments, which are needed if the principle of subsidiarity is to be taken into account. In other words we, as the European Parliament, cannot interfere in the jurisdiction of individual Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we do have the opportunity to take an important step in discussing and formulating European policies, where we do have the relevant jurisdiction. May I point to the example of the joint decision-making of the European Parliament on the seventh framework programme. Health is an important part of this programme. The financial resources we earmark for this programme must reflect demographic indicators and the genuine needs of our citizens. In this way we can also come closer to the people and give them the opportunity to see directly how joint European policy can affect their quality of life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have often met to talk about women in the middle of the night, and with you in the chair I believe. We always talk about women in the middle of the night, and one day we could do so in daylight, Mr President.</p>
<p class="contents">The inequality and discrimination suffered by women is structural and sustained. We women have always been carers rather than cared-for. There is therefore still a very significant imbalance between the level and quality of care for men and care for women. We do, however, have certain common values in Europe, such as fairness, universality and solidarity. Accordingly, we must also apply the gender perspective in the area of health, as the Commissioner has quite rightly said today.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcomed the initiative taken by the Social Democratic Ministers of the European Union who met in Sweden at the end of August, discussed the reduction of gender inequalities in health care and expressed their concern about the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">There are certain issues the report should have dealt with in more depth, and which relate in particular to sexual and reproductive health, as many speakers have already said. It has also already been pointed out that violence is a health problem. There is another important issue worthy of mention: the difficulties faced by immigrant women in accessing health systems, because they are afraid.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope we will meet again in daylight. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to draw attention to an important issue: we must not allow women to face discrimination in the health services again just because they are poor, on a low income or because they are suffering from specifically women’s illnesses. In the health services we must not repeat the mistakes that put women at a disadvantage in other areas of life. On the other hand, it would also be very important to ensure that, as part of their training, medical and health care personnel acquire the knowledge and skills enabling them to deal appropriately with illnesses that are specific to women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have also followed closely the proposals and views expressed. Of course, I cannot comment on all of them in such a short time, but I have taken note of them and I shall of course take very serious account of them.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that there is a difference when it comes to health between men and women; there is the question of the illnesses which affect both sexes but which are peculiar either in their diagnosis or treatment in women and, of course, there are illnesses which affect women in particular. This is something which needs to be taken into account when policies in the health sector are defined.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, I shall not refer to all the specific illnesses mentioned. What I can say, however, is that our new programme makes special provision and gives us the facility to turn our attention to specific illnesses. Of course, they cannot all be covered, but we shall be able to define the priorities together when the time comes to adopt the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">This of course brings me to a basic point which I would like to raise: the need for money, because everything that has been said is all very well and good. It is indeed everything we could wish for but, without the necessary financial resources, it cannot be achieved. This means, first of all, that the Member States will need to earmark part of their budget for this sector and I agree with the report, which encourages the use of the Structural Funds for investment in the health sector; it is a very good proposal and I urge all the Member States, especially the new Member States, to make use of this facility. However, we too at Community level need the financing we have requested if we are to be able to implement the programmes we propose.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware of Parliament's positive stand in this sector and I am depending on its support with the problems which exist as regards the adoption of the financial perspectives for the next budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say that we need to understand that many issues fall within the competence of the Member States: the provision of medical services, the health systems, all this is the responsibility of the Member States. As I have already said, we shall make use of all the non-legislative means we have at our disposal to promote policy in these sectors. However, the reference made earlier, for example, to the question of breast cancer screening – that it has not yet been implemented in all the Member States – highlights precisely one weakness. I believe that collecting and publishing data and information for the Member States in these sectors will create significant pressure on them to implement precisely these recommendations and the guidelines which they agree with.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur and Parliament once again on this initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
