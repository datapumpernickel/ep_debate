<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, the study 'Global Assessment of Organic Contaminants in Farmed Salmon', published on 9 January 2004 in <span class="italic">Science</span> magazine, compared the levels of 14 organochlorine contaminants in samples of farmed and wild salmon. Besides dioxins and PCBs, the study reports on the presence of residues of organochlorine pesticides, the use of which has long been prohibited in the EU. This study does not raise new food safety issues as the levels found are consistent with the results from other surveys and from official controls. This does not, however, mean that the presence of these contaminants is not a cause for concern.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards dioxins, strict EU maximum levels were adopted in 2001 for dioxins in feed and food, including fish. However, in setting these levels, the Commission had to take into account the reality of the current background contamination of the environment in order not to endanger the food supply. I would remind you that worldwide, only the European Union and Korea have adopted maximum levels for dioxins in feed and food. These maximum levels are part of a comprehensive strategy adopted by the European Commission in 2001 to reduce the presence of dioxins and PCBs in the environment, in feed and in food. The implementation of this strategy would give new impetus to the reduction of the background contamination. As a result, it will be possible to lower progressively the maximum levels to follow this downward trend.</p>
<p class="contents">The legislation foresees that, as early as this year, the maximum levels have to be revised to integrate some PCBs with toxicological effects similar to dioxins. Furthermore, it is foreseen that by the end of 2006 the maximum levels will be revised, aiming for a significant reduction. For the other PCBs, the European Food Safety Authority is currently undertaking a risk assessment. The result of this risk assessment is expected to become available by the end of 2004. The Commission will thereafter consider the setting of maximum levels also for these PCBs in feed and food.</p>
<p class="contents">The organochlorine pesticides detected in the study published in <span class="italic">Science</span> have long been banned in the European Union. However, their continued presence in fish is due to the fact that they are very persistent compounds, which can still be found in the environment. The European Union has established maximum levels for these pesticides in animal feed, including fish feed. On the basis of updated risk assessments undertaken by the Authority, the Commission will consider whether a revision of the current levels is necessary for the protection of animal and human health. The highest levels of two pesticides – toxaphene and dieldrin – found by the study in salmon feed exceed the maximum levels fixed by the EU. We have, accordingly, drawn the attention of the Member States to these findings and requested that they submit data from official controls and, if necessary, reinforce those controls.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would stress that the levels of dioxins reported in the study are all below the EU maximum levels. Fish – be it farmed or wild – has its place in a well-balanced diet to ensure that consumers continue to benefit from its positive health effects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Immediately after Christmas and New Year, a number of articles appeared in the French media, mentioning probable dangers. An announcement was actually made but was not actively followed up, which left consumers with unanswered questions.</p>
<p class="contents">I remember some years ago, at least five, possibly six years ago, talking with someone who worked with Mr Fischler at the Commission, who told me, when we were in the midst of the BSE crisis, that the second food crisis to hit Europe would be in farmed salmon. Those words stayed with me and this is why I was keen for a debate to take place on the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">He was certainly exaggerating somewhat – I hope so anyway – and what the Commissioner has just told us would appear to bear this out. Nonetheless, I feel that it was important for us to be able to pass on some answers to our fellow citizens so that they know what they have to do.</p>
<p class="contents">When we established the European Food Authority, we emphasised how important it was that communication should be commensurate with the level of risk. In this regard, when the press articles appeared at the end of 2003, I would have liked the Commission to offer us an immediate response, rather than – somewhat regrettably – waiting until mid-February, when Parliament requested the information.</p>
<p class="contents">With problems of this nature, it is wrong to focus on the difficulties faced by one economic sector or another. I put myself in the place of the salmon farmers and of the regions that are – or could have been – affected by information of this kind. Such a situation has economic knock-on effects and we are duty bound to bear this in mind. Our overriding concern, however, is food safety for our fellow citizens. I therefore believe that it is our duty, and this is especially important, to ensure transparency at all times and to communicate answers at the appropriate moment, so as to avoid a vacuum of information that may increase people’s concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">Even so, Commissioner, you tell us that the quality of salmon leaves something to be desired, yet you affirm elsewhere that what could be detected as doses of dioxin was below maximum levels set by the EU, and we are all relieved at that. What I should personally like to request from you is not only that controls be implemented, but also that decisions be taken in order to ensure that farmed fish is better monitored and, more importantly, that it reaches appropriate sanitary levels.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what I wanted to say, Commissioner, and what we expect from you is that controls should be put in place and swiftly followed by action, so as to offer complete reassurance to European consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Scottish salmon farming supports 6 500 jobs, 70% in the Highlands and Islands, injecting GBP 2 million every week into the Scottish economy. Scottish salmon accounts for nearly 40% of all Scottish food exports. The bias of the press coverage and the lack of quality information led to a food scare based on insubstantial evidence and falsehood. I was pleased that the Commission took prompt action to put right the evidence and to speak up for the safety of Scottish salmon. So too did the Food Standards Agency in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">The substance of the food scare was based on a highly misleading piece of research published in the American journal<span class="italic"> Science.</span> PCB and dioxin levels in Scottish salmon are significantly lower than the threshold set by the EU, the Food Standards Agency, the US Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organisation. Professor Hugh Pennington, a leading food expert said: 'The evidence is pretty clear that the officially recommended levels, which are higher than the ones that the scientists are talking about, are actually safe.'</p>
<p class="contents">The methodology of this research has been called into question. The conclusions are based on a controversial risk assessment model that was introduced by the US Environmental Protection Agency. The risk assessment model is not recognised by international organisations responsible for food safety and public health such as the WHO, which considers it scientifically flawed.</p>
<p class="contents">Additionally, the salmon used in the study were purchased prior to the country of origin labelling regulations, and so the study has not even ensured that the salmon tested were farmed in Scotland or the EU. On top of all of this, the research does not contain any new information. Even the figures used in the research are questionable, as they differ from UK Government official figures. With this in mind, the Food Standards Agency does not accept the research findings and advises people to eat two portions of fish per week, with one portion being oily fish, such as salmon. Sadly the American research has ignored all the health benefits of eating salmon, which contains high levels of Omega-3 fatty acids and is proven to reduce the risk of heart attack.</p>
<p class="contents">Sir John Krebs, Chairman of the FSA, backed this up. He said that although dioxin levels have decreased dramatically over the past two decades, they remain a consumer concern. The known benefits of eating one portion of oily fish outweigh any possible risks. On the subject of fish feed, which was also brought into question, the feed of US, Canadian and Chilean producers comes from the same sources as that for the Scottish fish farmers. It seems strange that US, Canadian and Chilean samples should be free from levels of the substances under test, compared with those from Scotland.</p>
<p class="contents">To my mind there is something very odd going on, when the basis of a report can be taken as read without thorough investigation. In fact, one of the scientists involved in the research – Dr David Carpenter – has confessed that 'There may be some legitimacy in saying the reason they chose to fund this study was that they had another agenda well beyond the health effects.'</p>
<p class="contents">Scottish Quality Salmon members already undertake measures to ensure the quality of its feed supplies and have in place a testing regime to ensure its standards are met, as well as the rigorous environmental regulation that fish farms adhere to, which has been improving year on year since fish farming began. The Scottish Environmental Protection Agency has a specific remit and responsibility to regulate salmon farming – 63 pieces of legislation, 43 European directives, 3 European regulations, 12 Commission decisions – that help reassure consumers that the product they are consuming is of the highest quality.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know if the Commission is in a position to comment on the proposed anti-dumping measures. I understand that there were ongoing negotiations this weekend between the Irish presidency and the British Government. If you have an opportunity to comment, Commissioner, that may be useful.</p>
<p class="contents">A line needs to be drawn under this episode. Damage has been done to the Scottish salmon farming industry, there is no doubt about that. However, we have to move on, highlighting the falsehood of the accusations and the importance of eating salmon as part of a balanced, healthy diet. It is because of our membership of the EU that we can work together in order to seek solutions. The European Commission's immediate response reassured consumers that eating salmon is safe. It is only by action at the EU level that we can take action against false food scares and bring reality to bear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The health risks associated with salmon have quite obviously been exaggerated. On the other hand it is obvious that eating farmed salmon is less healthy than eating wild salmon. This is one reason why the European Union should aspire to a policy on salmon that keeps as close to nature as possible, although salmon farms will of course still be needed for the production of both rainbow trout and salmon.</p>
<p class="contents">The Baltic Sea has its own migratory salmon stock. The rivers flowing into the Baltic have produced young that have migrated to feed on what the sea areas have to offer: shrimp and small fish. Contamination and the use of the water systems for floating timber and hydroelectric power production have had an adverse effect on breeding. This decline has been partially offset by introducing stocks of salmon into rivers, something which companies that produce hydroelectric power in particular have been obliged to do. That, however, has not had much effect. It has been estimated that as many as 95% of young salmon introduced in this way perish. On the other hand, there has been overfishing of salmon both in the open sea and in coastal waters close to the rivers in which they spawn. There have been continual disputes over salmon fishing rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that, with enlargement, the Baltic Sea is to become even more obviously an inland sea of the Union, a comprehensive plan should be drawn up to protect salmon stocks and organise fishing activity. Salmon breeding must be restored as closely as possible to its original natural state. Rivers and streams that make good spawning grounds must be made suitable to permit increases in salmon stocks. Fishways should be built on constructed waterways, and the spawning grounds in the rivers should be properly maintained. By promoting the natural regeneration of salmon stocks we can open up new opportunities for sport fishing and tourism based on it in all the countries with a Baltic coastline. Once the natural reproduction process for salmon is improved, the level of introduced fish stocks can be reduced and in the course of time perhaps abandoned altogether. The money saved can be spent on the building of fishways, the upkeep of spawning grounds, and boosting other fish stock levels. The fishing of Baltic salmon should start to see the implementation of the ‘spawn state principle’, which has been successfully applied in the North Atlantic within the framework of the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation. Fishing has to be restricted so that the sustainable and natural renewal of salmon stocks is assured.</p>
<p class="contents">After the enlargement of the Union, the protection of the Baltic Sea, maintenance of its fish stocks and organisation of fishing activity in the region will no longer be matters of multilateral cooperation but a bilateral issue between the EU and Russia. I believe that Russia for its own part is prepared to take up the challenge of cooperation; the main responsibility, however, lies with us, the EU and the Member States of the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is because, according to press reports when this scientific study was first published, a statement was issued claiming that a spokesperson from Commissioner Byrne's office had agreed with the assessment made by the United Kingdom Food Standards Agency that the levels of chemicals in our European salmon did not exceed EU limits. I welcome the fact that this position has now been revised, because what we are talking about here is about consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Background levels have to be taken into account. The issue needs to be addressed as to why those background levels are there in the first place. That is something that also has to be tackled.</p>
<p class="contents">From these studies it has been quite clear that farmed salmon have a significantly higher contaminant burden than wild salmon – that is what the report says – and that farmed salmon from Europe are significantly more contaminated than farmed salmon from South and North America. A lot of people have long seen that there is obviously some sort of health risk in relation to farmed fish. We are now saying that consumption of farmed salmon should be limited to a certain amount per week, or per month, which raises a question about the threat to consumers. It should be clearly labelled so that consumers know what they are eating and have that choice.</p>
<p class="contents">I raised the issue with the President of Parliament, Pat Cox, and asked him to request the European Food Safety Authority to issue a scientific opinion on the problem. He agreed to do so. Unfortunately, we have still not received the letter which he was going to send. It is crucial that this should not be further delayed, because we are not just talking about salmon here. An issue which has not been raised at all is that other carnivorous fish species, for example tuna, cod, sea bass, sea bream and trout, are farmed in similar conditions and probably exposed to similar contamination. This is an issue which needs to be addressed, not just in relation to farmed salmon but in relation to other farmed fish.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I see that the United Kingdom Government has adopted protection principles to safeguard Scottish salmon. They should adopt protection methods to safeguard the consumer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, there must be accurate, reliable and totally independent scientific advice before any such action can be undertaken. It will not surprise the Commission that I am somewhat sceptical, to say the least, in relation to some scientific studies currently doing the rounds and which, I believe, prompted the present crisis. I am not interested in who did the study. I am, however, interested in who paid for the study. I am also interested to know if there are vested interests involved in this work, if there is anyone who stands to gain from this type of so-called scientific research.</p>
<p class="contents">For me, the crisis in the salmon sector is not just environmental; the real crisis is that the EU salmon industry, particularly in my constituency of Connaught-Ulster in the west of Ireland, is under serious threat of extinction. The entire Community industry is under threat from cheap imports, or to put it another way, from dumping of farmed salmon from Norway, Chile and the Faroe Islands. It is totally unacceptable to me that a growing number of independent Irish and Scottish producers are going into receivership. If this continues unchecked, there will be no environmental or health issues to resolve because there will be no EU salmon. In recent days, both the Irish and UK Governments made a joint application to the European Commission for new measures to safeguard our salmon-farming industry. The application does not concern the Canadian or the American producers; it concerns the EU producers, starting with Irish producers who are fighting for survival.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I ask the Commission to tell me and the Irish salmon producers, whom I represent, what follow-up or initiative it has taken to date, or intends to take, on the joint Irish-United Kingdom application? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As politicians we are not armed with scientific knowledge, yet how are we to address a crisis that may have far-reaching socio-economic consequences for entire sectors? How can we solve a problem that has arisen from the publication of a scientific report that casts doubt on the sanitary quality of a food product, that has been published as part of a root and branch reputation review, and that has already been widely covered in the media, thereby raising concerns among consumers? How do we distinguish between what is based on well-founded concerns, calling for the most stringent measures and protocols to be put in place, and what is based on effects that are simply due to defects in the mathematical models used or in the balance of parameters?</p>
<p class="contents">Having had our fingers severely burnt by previous crises, which had devastating consequences – such as the crises involving mad cow disease, and dioxin in chickens, the case before us today, evidenced by the abnormally high death rate among bees, of the danger of new and extremely powerful neurotoxic molecules, which are used to coat seeds, getting into fats and water – we are being vigilant and must continue to err on the side of vigilance. It is only by redoubling the controls, the studies, the research and the analysis that indisputable results will begin to come through to reassure consumers. The food safety authorities are there to help us in this aim, but Parliament must also give a ruling. I should also like to remind you at this juncture, as a member of the Scientific and Technological Options Assessment (STOA), that we have a novel type of body available to us in the European Parliament, the STOA panel, whose function is to provide Members of this House with aspects of scientific assessment that they may need in order to clarify the positions that our various committees are required to take. It is by no means a perfect institution, but I feel that the STOA is capable of offering us invaluable help, such as providing us, in regard to a question such as the one before us this evening, with an overall perspective and a critical analysis of all scientific studies in existence or ongoing. We must therefore not overlook this invaluable instrument. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Few realise that the research on which the article was founded was commissioned by the Philadelphia-based Pew Charitable Trusts, worth an estimated USD 3.8 billion. They are well known for their international campaigns against global pollution and they have recently become influential opponents of the aquaculture industry. The <span class="italic">Science </span>magazine article – based on a USD 2.9 million research project carried out by the Institute for Health and the Environment at the State University of New York at Albany – has, as previous speakers have said, proved to be deliberately misleading in the advice it provides on salmon consumption. And yet, I think all of us in this Chamber would be astonished at how that article suddenly appeared in newspapers all over the world. The reason is that on the day it was published in <span class="italic">Science</span> magazine it was sent out by press release by an international PR company based in New York and simultaneously appeared on the website of the Canadian-based Suzuki Foundation, which campaigns on behalf of Alaskan wild salmon and which, of course, has a vested interest in damaging the European farmed salmon industry.</p>
<p class="contents">In their conclusions about limiting salmon consumption, the study's authors appear, as Mrs Stihler said, to have misapplied an already suspect risk model developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency by failing to include any analysis of the health benefits of eating salmon, despite over 5 000 scientific papers attesting to the necessity of eating oil-rich fish as a regular component of a balanced diet. The research does not actually contain any new information: the data the research provides is no different from the findings of previous studies that also found dioxin levels in farmed salmon to be well within official safety limits. However, the interpretation used in the research paper deliberately exaggerates the health risks.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the PCB levels in all EU farmed salmon are significantly below the level determined to be safe for sale in supermarkets, even by the US Food and Drug Administration, as well as by all other international watchdogs, including our own EU Food Standards Agency and the UK Food Standards Agency. The American research is therefore seriously flawed. EU fish farms undertake rigorous inspection and quality control regimes to ensure that only the highest possible environmental and welfare standards are met and that the public is provided with an entirely safe, non-toxic and reliable product. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, in order to make properly informed choices, it is essential that scientific information be accurate, up-to-date and verifiable. In recent times, looking from Scotland, it is perfectly possible to believe that certain campaigners are making it their business to talk down specifically the Scottish salmon-farming industry and talk up specifically, as has been suggested, wild salmon from certain other areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Just publishing an article in a magazine entitled <span class="italic">Science</span> does not automatically verify the accuracy of its contents. It is clear, as the Commissioner acknowledged, that there is no new evidence in the particular study published in <span class="italic">Science</span>. It is also clear that the levels of various contaminants were within standards set by the European Commission and the UK and Scottish Food Standards Agencies, which are not bodies that are easy to satisfy in that regard. The research totally failed to mention the positive health benefits that can be gained from eating fatty fish such as salmon. Organisations such as Scottish Quality Salmon, which has very high standards, should be encouraged. They require of their members constant improvement in such things as feed quality.</p>
<p class="contents">It is inexplicable to me to suggest that Scottish and Irish salmon, but not other farmed salmon fed on exactly the same feed, somehow did not come out of this study as measuring up to the same standards. The measured approach adopted by the Commissioner is right, and I hope that, as others have said, there will be support for measures to protect this industry, which in Scotland is essential for employment and social cohesion in very fragile areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Salmon farming has often been criticised in the past for its environmental impact, but only recently have potential health impacts been raised. It is crucial that these be better understood.</p>
<p class="contents">Health advice given by governments across the EU traditionally highlights the importance of eating more fish. Yet, if risk analysis suggests that consumption of farmed Atlantic salmon poses health risks that detract from the beneficial effect of fish consumption, then we need to know more about that. We need to understand more about it and we need to act on that knowledge. We need to know for certain that farmed salmon has more contaminants than wild fish and that dioxins are among the most toxic chemicals ever created.</p>
<p class="contents">So far the debate has been dominated by arguments over whether the contamination found in the salmon was legal. What we should be concentrating on is whether the salmon is genuinely safe. That might well mean revisiting the limits that were set for contamination in 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to get away from the arguments for or against Scottish salmon or any other kind of salmon. These are not very helpful. We should be talking about whether aquaculture itself is providing a viable and environmentally sustainable food for humans, and I would argue that the answer is increasingly looking like 'no'. Also associated with aquaculture is a whole range of other problems, including the spread of disease and parasites to wild fish, the use of fish, fishmeal and fish oil as food with impacts on wild fish stocks, pollution of the sea floor from unconsumed food, the impact on predators when they are killed and the antibiotics used to control the disease. There are some genuinely important issues here that need to be looked at and yet, perversely, governments continue to support aquaculture when, in many ways, they might well be better off putting their time and resources into rehabilitating the natural habitats of salmon so as to allow the wild stocks to recover.</p>
<p class="contents">This latest health report on salmon should be taken as a wake-up call to change the way we farm fish. I look forward to a Commission revision of the standards based on genuine safety measures, not on allowances for background environmental levels, because health cannot and should not be compromised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am happy that it has been acknowledged by Parliament that the Commission responded quickly to this issue and that a clear explanation was given when it first came into the public domain.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make a clarification statement and to repeat what I said earlier. It would be a mistake to confuse the presence of dioxin and PCBs in the fish, and the presence of pesticides in feed. One questioner suggested that the Commission had made a statement earlier that was different from what is being said now. That interpretation arises from a confusion of what has been said, which is that the dioxin levels are within EU maximum levels, but the pesticides in food are not, and I gave two instances that were above that. That is a question of the levels being above the appropriate levels in the feed rather than in the fish themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">In answer to the question I was asked by Mr Ó Neachtain in relation to the joint report that has been furnished by the Irish and United Kingdom authorities, I have to say that report has not reached my desk, nor has it reached my DG. I am, of course, making inquiries about it, but that report may have been on a related issue and sent to a different DG. It is something I will look at if it has been sent to me and if it is relevant to my portfolio.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the question of further risk assessments, the European Food Safety Authority is carrying out a risk assessment on the presence of non-dioxin-like PCBs. It is quite clear that my services and the European Food Safety Authority are keeping an eye on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
