<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rehn,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, we have all seen the latest news about the large-scale job cuts that were announced a few days ago by a major automobile manufacturer. The Commission fully understands the worries and sympathises with the workers in Rüsselsheim, Bochum, Trollhättan and elsewhere. We are following these developments very closely using the Community competences that are available to us to facilitate better industrial conditions for the car industry in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The sector's difficulties stem partly from the general economic downturn over the past few years. The low GDP growth rate in the EU has had its repercussions on the car industry too. Thus we have seen a decline in sales of motor vehicles and a decline in employment in the automotive industry. Therefore, improving general consumer confidence and economic dynamism is also crucial for the demand and sales of cars. Competitiveness, economic reform and new industrial policy are now high on the political agenda of the Commission and will receive even more focus in the new Commission. We shall also soon learn how Mr Kok proposes to revise the Lisbon strategy to put more weight on higher growth and better job creation.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to be able to better assess the competitiveness of the car industry the Commission has launched a study that we will publish in a few weeks time in the context of our annual competitiveness report. The study shows that the automotive industry contributes 6% to our manufacturing employment and 7% to manufacturing output in the Union, making it a major driver in the European economy. Its added value and employment have, however, declined between 2000 and 2002. A similar development in employment took place in the US and Japan.</p>
<p class="contents">Our analysis of Europe's strengths reveals that, due to the large home market, the European motor vehicle industry is well positioned to exploit economies of scale. Moreover, due to the sophisticated demand, EU manufacturers get advance feedback from their customers, which helps them improve product quality. Furthermore there is a high innovation capacity and research and development spending amongst the European automotive industry is at least as high as, or higher than, that in the US and Japan.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of weaknesses, EU productivity is still lower than that in the US and Japan. Furthermore there is slow growth in the European home market, which means that as other markets continue to grow the demand advantages from the large European market may diminish over time.</p>
<p class="contents">Compared to the current level of productivity in the Union, the level of labour costs presents a serious challenge for the car industry in some Member States. Labour costs per hour in the European Union are still somewhat below those in the United States but significantly higher than those in Japan and especially Korea. We can best compete if we can offer better quality, better technology and better services that come with a car. This underlines the importance of innovation. As has been shown by some manufacturers, an agreement can also be reached with the workforce, aimed at reducing costs.</p>
<p class="contents">For this to happen there has to be a common understanding between management and the workforce as to what objectives are to be achieved. Such agreements make sense if they can be used to save employment, to keep manufacturing locations and to make the car industry more competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to threats, our studies see a danger that major innovations are not stimulated by European regulations. Future regulation must therefore take into account the long-term competitiveness of the car industry and the need for manufacturers to be able to sell their products and similar products in Europe and on the whole world market. This must be addressed by policies of better regulation, which is a major challenge for both of us, the Commission as well as for Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is currently considering setting up a high-level group to analyse major challenges affecting the automobile sector and to identify ways and means to improve the industrial framework conditions in the sector. This high-level group should also focus on the cumulative impact of legislation on the sector's competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">It is up to the new Commission to take a position on the setting up of such a group. Commissioner Verheugen, or rather Vice-President-designate Verheugen, said at his hearing in front of you in the European Parliament that he is considering setting up such a group. I will certainly support him if he chooses to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Commission is doing its utmost to offer the best possible industrial and innovative framework conditions for the car industry, for the European automotive industry. We need to further develop dialogue in the sector with the main stakeholders involved. Moreover, we must revise the Lisbon strategy of growth and employment to revitalise economic dynamism and to strengthen consumer demand on our continent. Growth and employment must indeed be put centre stage in all Union activities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to save EUR 500 million, the American General Motors group is seeking to cut up to 12 000 jobs in the EU. Our motor industry is a key industry; two million people work in it, with ten million in firms supplying it. If it is now being manoeuvred into a crisis, the only thing I want to point out is that in Germany, since 1990, a hundred thousand new jobs have been created in this sector – or has Germany failed as an industrial location? At Opel, in Rüsselsheim, 4 500 jobs are to be cut back. The people affected live in my electoral district, and I have met them. Fear is in the air.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, they have worked for years already, helping to reduce the costs of the Olympia model. Now that negotiations are in progress about shorter working times and wage renunciations, about doing away with night shifts and reductions in staffing levels, the consequences for the firm’s management have to be discussed. At Adam Opel AG, there have been six chairmen of the board in five years, trends have been missed, and ranges that are insufficiently innovative or attractive have failed to attract customers, quality has been sacrificed for the sake of short-term cost reduction, thus gambling with the firm’s good reputation, and these things amount to serious errors on the part of the management. Now that the attempt is being made to use the restructuring of the motor industry as a pretext for making co-determination an empty concept, that is what I call provocation. Workers’ participation has, particularly when times are hard, resulted in consensus, has secured industrial peace and has always been to the benefit of both sides. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats can only hope that the management and the workers’ representatives can get together and hammer out an agreement on their future in Europe. In my experience, workers are always willing to accept austerity measures if these keep their jobs safe in the long term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What, then, lies behind this crisis? It has been brought about by years, if not decades, of high-level mismanagement in the group. There was no strategy capable of dealing with Europe, and perhaps the greatest error of all was that there was no strategy for the European internal market, no strategy for European consumers, and no strategy for making use of the knowledge, expertise and skills of the relevant companies’ workers. What this very clearly shows is that a change of direction is needed here. It has been said, and rightly, that industrial policy must be put back on the agenda for the European institutions. A good way of doing this, we think, would be for us now to discuss how to combine General Motors’s subsidiaries in a European Company, but we also urge that the Commission should get more involved, and that we should enter into a dialogue on industrial policy with each sector, one that will facilitate the promotion of innovation in the various industries that are important to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We are only just beginning to get to grips with the future of European industrial policy. When this House debates the European works councils, we will be reminding you of how important it is that workforces be allowed to speak and that they be involved. I have no sympathy whatever with the Liberals and Conservatives who have prevented a joint resolution from emerging from this debate. You, ladies and gentlemen, have some lessons to learn!</p>

We believe this to be an appropriate response to the management’s contemptuous attitude, for how else, other than as enormous and profound contempt can one describe it when a company plans mass redundancies, but those at the top do not think it necessary to communicate these plans to the workforce at their highly productive sites, who, instead, have to read of their fate in the newspapers?</p>
<p class="contents">My colleagues have already said what needs to be said about the management’s mistakes; let us talk about the work that has to be done in this field in the future, including by the Commission. If the Commission is elected – which, as things stand today, I do not think it will be – Mr Verheugen, as early as next week, will have to take on the task as part of the Lisbon strategy. I do not know if we are actually prepared, politically speaking, for what lies ahead of us. I share Mr Bullmann’s misgivings. I believe that we are a long way from having forward-looking concepts for the motor – or mobility – industry, where a lot of opportunities for innovation have been missed in recent decades. Mr Rehn spoke about research and development policy. I very much hope that the new energy crisis really will move European research policy towards enabling us, to have, at some point in the foreseeable future, 1-litre cars, that is to say, the cars of the future, built in German and European factories. There are lead markets to be opened up, and we have quite a few possibilities there, but only if we abandon the false outlook we have had to date, of ever-bigger, ever-faster cars at ever-higher prices.</p>
<p class="contents">Being from Lower Saxony myself, I would like to address one particular problem affecting the motor industry there, and in Germany and Europe as well. In recent years, the Commission, represented by Commissioner Bolkestein, has repeatedly attacked the VW Act, under which Volkswagen operates. It so happens that the Volkswagen Group is a living example of an innovative business culture. What the future of co-determination will be like, we see – thanks to the VW Act, at VW, with its jobshares, its wage renunciation, its 5 000 times 5 000. These are ideas from which other businesses could well learn, but this ongoing attack on the VW Act, which, in our view, does not constitute an infringement of internal market rules, is also an attack on this exemplary business culture. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My previous job was in a car factory, so this debate is that much more relevant to myself.</p>
<p class="contents">What we now see is huge pressure for change in the European car industry. Factory is pitted against factory and worker against worker. It is the metal workers who have to pay the price through having to do less satisfying work at high speed. I think that a lot of what is happening is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">It cannot just be a simple matter of making thousands of workers redundant. We must demand that companies accept their social responsibility. They have a social obligation towards those who work in the factories. They should enter into dialogue with authorities and trade unions in order to find solutions, such as shorter working hours, other than laying off the work force.</p>
<p class="contents">What we also see is that the regulations are inadequate. Stronger union rights are required, together with intensified cooperation between unions within one and the same company.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it good that the Commissioner mentioned demand in his introduction. It is true that demand is too low. The question that must also be asked, however is: demand for what? With the high oil price and major environmental problems, it is quite clear that what we need most today is cars that are propelled by something other than petrol, for example ethyl alcohol. In this area, we can see how the European car industry in actual fact lags far behind competitors in countries such as the United States and Brazil, which are much further ahead with the work on developing more environmentally friendly vehicles. This is one of the sins committed by managements in the European car industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to draw your attention to two key facts, before making two proposals. Firstly, the automobile industry is experiencing near-deflationary conditions, as well as being exposed to a competition which is subject to almost no restrictions. Secondly, it is one of the mainstays of European industry, generating two million jobs directly and over eight million jobs indirectly, as well as accounting for 24% of research and development. It provides a firm guarantee for Europe’s place in the global economy, and yet this industry is under threat. Rapid and decisive action must be taken, and my proposals are as follows.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the Commission statement, it should be stressed that, since enlargement, only three of the 25 Member States can truly be said to be major forces in the automobile industry, namely France, Germany and Italy. It is therefore imperative that the other Member States and the Commission understand the significance of this industrial sector for all of Europe. In particular, the European Union should not impose any additional regulatory constraints which are not in strict proportion to actual environmental and safety needs. Our prime concern should be to maintain the competitiveness of the European automobile industry. By cooperating closely with this industry, we must now move away from the drive to reduce polluting emissions, a task which we are close to achieving, towards a new priority of reducing CO2 emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission drafts on designs and models are another cause for concern with regard to the future and competitiveness of our automobile industry. The reason why the automobile industry is one of the leading industrial sectors in terms of resources allocated to research and development is because it is possible to obtain legal protection for the results of this research. Those within the Commission who support an unbridled liberalism should therefore be made to see sense, and our industry must be able to pursue its efforts to modernise and to improve competitiveness without others gaining from the fruits of its labours, in so doing jeopardising jobs in European industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It accounts for the direct employment of 1.2 million people but, as the Commissioner stated, is under enormous pressure, not only pressure from growing competition in Asia but also from increasing competition in the ten new Member States. The events in Bochum are not an isolated phenomenon; Opel’s sister company in Antwerp is also being hit hard, and, before this, Flanders had been affected by other serious streamlining measures. You will be familiar with what happened with the Ford factory in Genk and the closure of Renault in Vilvoorde. It follows that the Commission must, as a matter of urgency, come up with a perspective for the automotive industry.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted with your reference to the establishment of a high-level group. That is, of course, fantastic news. The only question is: when for? As time is of the essence, what is the timeframe in this respect? Commissioner, I think we must table very tangible and very ambitious objectives. Let me give you an example: by 2015, the European car should be a 100% clean car, one that is 100% safe for the passengers and entails 0% risk also for the soft road users and which, on top of everything else, should negotiate the traffic seemingly automatically. Commissioner, there is no harm in a little wishful thinking now and again. That is the only way if we want to avoid a kind of competitive situation where the regions of the old Europe, if I can put it this way, are at daggers drawn with the regions of the new.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I should like to conclude by saying that we should not forget that the automotive industry is still an industry that excites many young people. An enthusiastic innovation plan from the Commission will be able to persuade pupils and students to opt once again for technological subjects, with prospects in a high-tech industry, an industry with a bright future, something which I have no doubt we are all in favour of. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In our concern for social responsibility, we always risk being pushed into a corner, and sometimes we allow that to happen, but there are points here that have to do with the economy in the traditional sense of the word.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite that, there are a number of mistakes on the part of the management to be added to the list, to which it had been alerted by the workers’ representatives on various occasions, one such mistake being the fact that, unlike Volkswagen and the Japanese, Opel does not sell its cars outside Europe, in the USA, for example. I am not talking here about the top-of-the-range European models that are sold there. A further mistake was that materials were bought in cheaply, with the resultant expense of remedial work at weekends. New work patterns were introduced abruptly, and the group became over-centralised. It is necessary to draw attention to these points, particularly now – and I very much agree with Mr Mann on this – that representatives of industry associations and the ideologues retained by them are hard at work dismantling the types of co-determination that we in Europe introduced as part of our social model, and pronouncing them unsuited to the modern world.</p>
<p class="contents">That being so, I agree with much of what you, Mr Mann, had to say, but why did your group, with its majority in this House, refuse to table a resolution? Perhaps they did not want the substance of what you said to be adopted in this House this week. That is a point that must be addressed head-on, for much of what you have said we Social Democrats can agree with. It is only embarrassing that your party colleague in Bochum should raise the question of whether the crisis might have been resolved if the regional or local promoters of trade and industry had been able to do something different. Those are narrow-minded answers – what we need now is something different!</p>

If the crisis is a result of over-production and problems in accessing the market, it makes no economic sense whatever to give in to demands for wage cuts. It is a good thing that the workforce are refusing to be no more than chess pieces for the global players who no longer take it as read that businesses have any responsibilities to society.</p>
<p class="contents">General Motors should remember Henry Ford’s dictum that ‘cars don’t buy cars’, whereby he justified doubling his workers’ wages in order to stimulate demand. That is why we need a demand-led economic policy and, at the same time, a different structural policy. The European Union has a number of instruments at its disposal, such as the Directives on collective redundancies and on European Works Councils, which are very important, but are, unfortunately, designed as corrective measures, shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need is preventive measures that do not leave everything to the market, all the more so if we want to take the Gothenburg agenda seriously and make development sustainable. For that reason we welcome the Commission’s idea of setting up a working party.</p>
<p class="contents">This must, however, also involve a debate on the diversification of production and of services, if regions are not to become dependent on one sector. More attention also needs to be given to research and innovation in the field of new products. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We did not want a resolution about this issue, the reason being that, in a resolution, we would be forced to write: ‘We want all Europeans to trade in their cars straight away and make sure that they buy new Opels and Volkswagens’. Our economy is not a planned one; it cannot arrange this sort of thing. What is happening, quite simply, is that consumer demand is stagnating in our society. There is no confidence in the economy, not in Europe and certainly not in Germany. That is why fewer cars are being bought, which, in turn, impacts on production.</p>
<p class="contents">Production units are in any case trying to reduce production costs. They are computerising, they are relocating plant, and so on. What the cutbacks at Volkswagen and Opel actually illustrate is the need to opt for another route. What is that other route? I share your view that we should ask workers to be more flexible in order to ensure that something can be done about working conditions too, but those workers cannot solve the problem on their own. Although we have to restore confidence in the economy, the workers in the companies concerned should also receive back-up, not only from governments, but also from social partners, in order to address the problems jointly. I am not referring to the labour costs alone, because we have just learned from the Commissioner that labour costs in the EU are still below those in the United States. It is mainly the indirect labour costs that are proving pernicious in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It follows that we must – and I think that this is also one of the issues – try to reduce the indirect labour costs, and the Lisbon process can play some part in this. In my view, along with the high-level group, which I appreciate greatly, we will then need visible results from the studies that are due shortly. Credit where credit is due, Commissioner – and I say that also on behalf of our group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my own country, Sweden, where the car industry plays an incredibly large role, our big car companies have been bought up by multinational concerns. That is the case in Trollhättan, where GM now owns the Saab factory.</p>
<p class="contents">For Trollhättan, this is of huge significance. Six thousand people are employed by this industry and a further 6 000 people are dependent on it in a town with a population of approximately 50 000. Allow me to state that it is not the workers, but the company, that has, in this case, for a long time been making miscalculations.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me also to say that I am not an opponent of restructurings. My party has always been open to restructurings, but it is important how they are carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, they must be carried out with a sense of social responsibility. It is not only society that must accept social responsibility, but the companies too. The workers must be involved. It must not just be a case of informing them of decisions that have been taken. They must be actively involved in the restructuring process. Workers must not, as happens right now, be played off against each other in different countries by being told that they have to accept poorer social conditions if we are to engage in production. We shall not take part in that kind of game.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of people in our country say that we do not need more cooperation at European level, but the opposite is the case. We need more cooperation, partly between the union organisations, where there is constructive cooperation between IG Metall and the Swedish Metal Workers’ Union, and partly between politicians and trade unions. We also need political cooperation at European level. A high-level group that draws up guidelines for industrial policy is a good idea, but we also need the other dimension, namely a review of the European Works Councils Directive and the Collective Redundancies Directive. We need to strengthen those directives, so that we strengthen the position of workers when restructuring is carried out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You should not ask what the EU can do for national industrial policy but what your own national governments can do for Europe’s competitiveness. What you are asking sounds the alarm about whether European industry is at all able to hold its own in relation to global competition.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not the case that we now need a European automobile policy. We have experience from the seventies when national policies on shipyards were conducted in a long list of different European countries. It put a stop to development and led not to jobs being saved, but to capital being wasted. What is now needed is a policy that allows European companies to develop their competitiveness. It is absurd if we are to have a competition policy within the European Union that makes it difficult for European companies to compete globally in a market in which competition is global. When we are concerned with an industry that needs to be competitive globally, the conditions that make it competitive cannot be assessed on the basis of national sub-markets.</p>
<p class="contents">We must now ensure that we conduct a policy that strengthens competitiveness. Not one of the proposals presented in this debate in the House would lead to more cars being sold or produced in Europe. Instead, they would give rise to false expectations and distract attention from what needs to be done, namely accept changes and restructuring. Above all, a Lisbon process is needed that makes European companies competitive and that can give Europe more companies. That is what Europe needs, not a European automobile industry policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We in the European Parliament must tell them once again today that – as has already been said – we reject forced redundancies and any closures of production plants. We also want to demand once again – as has been said here repeatedly – that workers’ rights to information, consultation and participation be strengthened, both at national and at European and multinational level.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware that the workers of GM are trying to participate in the European committee and trying to anticipate crisis problems, anticipating possible scenarios and in this case it is the management which has done the abandoning and which has made mistakes.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we are once again demanding that companies’ corporate and social responsibilities be increased, that the Commission not just take the decision to analyse the sector, but also to take measures to ensure that responsibilities towards workers and the territories they work in are met, and we are also demanding more incisive measures in relation to the transparency of decision-making, which we believe has failed in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in the case of GM, these workers – and I am well aware of this, since this has been the case in the Figueruelas plant, in my region of Aragón – have just signed an agreement in which they have demonstrated a great capacity for negotiation, dialogue, foresight and adaptation to the demands for flexibility, specifically with a view to anticipating cycles, but despite that, the management – not the management in Aragón, but the European management – has once again abandoned them.</p>

The message to the many people who are facing uncertainty in Rüsselsheim, Bochum and Trollhättan – and I have been to some of those plants – is that there is life after restructuring. That is why the United Kingdom car industry is doing relatively well. I am not complacent about it, but it is a fact. We should be reflecting on why General Motors tells us that it needs to save EUR 500 million a year in costs to make itself competitive. I am sure it can justify those figures.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to work together. That is the message that needs to go out. It is impossible to achieve record levels of car output in the United Kingdom with, in many plants, quality and productivity levels that are the best in Europe, without working between managers and the workforce and with dealers and customers. As mentioned in Mr Rehn's statement this afternoon, we must encourage the Commission to look at the competitive conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not want an industrial plan for the car industry. We do not want the Commission or politicians telling car companies what to do. We are in a competitive market. But that EUR 500 million will go into the cleaner, safer cars that Europe's consumers want. That is the change that is needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have to get away from making some laws on the environment – albeit very comprehensive ones – followed by laws on the protection and safety of pedestrians and others, and then laws on mobility, while neglecting, as we did in the past, to put together a truly cohesive and uniform strategy for this sector. That is what is urgently needed if we are not to be helpless spectators while jobs in European industry are wiped out.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we can gain some optimism from what Mr Rehn and Mr Verheugen said in the hearings. One cannot but welcome the setting up of a high level group of this sort, but ‘high level’ means not just this or that chairman of this or that company’s board, but also the workers’ representatives; it must involve not just the Commission, but also the European Parliament. I think we can find examples of this in shipbuilding too.</p>
<p class="contents">There is just one more thing I would like to say, and that is that what the outgoing Commission, as regards jobs in the motor industry, has covered itself with is not just glory. I would cite not only the Volkswagen legislation, but also the Design Directive, as examples of how urgently amendments are needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is really not the case. The member of my cabinet, Mrs Asenius, is a former worker on the assembly line at a car factory in Gothenburg, and I myself worked in the summers and on Saturdays as a spare parts salesman, all of which gives us, I hope, some kind of practical experience of car industry issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to thank honourable Members for their support and sympathy for the workers and for their overall support for the Commission's position. I have taken due note of the views expressed and will report them to the present Commission and to the new one.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I cannot comment on specific sectors and their management, it is true that we cannot blame the macroeconomic environment alone. Management decisions have also played a role in the current situation in the European car industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Our conclusion, which I think is a very common view in this House and in the Commission, is that we need a new approach to industrial policy. This does not mean picking the winners as we did in the 1970s, which often meant, in fact, sustaining the losers, but a dual policy based on a horizontal view of competitiveness, education, innovation, technology, regional policy and so on, combined with a sound sectoral analysis covering various sectors, so that we know what combination of policies is best for each sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore appreciate your support for the consideration of the high-level group, which would, in my view, work in the same way as in the textile sector. I take due note of your sense of urgency and will report this to the Vice-President designate, Günter Verheugen. I am sure he will take that into account if our appointments are confirmed on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Belet asked me to dream. Yes, I dream about cleaner and safer cars. I dream and expect that the European car industry, as well as the public sector, will devote more funds to research and innovation. I should like to see the social partners and all stakeholders focus strongly on the competitiveness of this key sector in the European economy. This is a very worthy focus for the high-level group, and I trust we will have good cooperation with the European Parliament on these issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A few months ago, the General Motors Group, of North America, was said to be planning drastically to reduce its workforce and to make cuts in Opel, Vauxhall and Saab’s European factories.</p>
<p class="contents">As stated in the motion that was recently approved by the workers at Opel Azambuja, in Portugal, GM’s consolidation measures cannot be allowed to continue to damage the workforce. It is the workers who have met the conditions of what is known as the 2001 ‘Olympia Agreement’, while the Board of GM Europe has been carrying out its obligations in a piecemeal and incompetent fashion, by doing business in a confrontational and contemptuous manner. In so doing, they have shown their ignorance of the European car market.</p>
<p class="contents">GM Europe’s economic success cannot depend solely on importing American brands and American strategies. It is essential that production be maintained in various countries in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore wish to show our solidarity with and support for the GM Europe factory workers in their fight against redundancies, against the closure of factories and against the violation of collective working agreements. Their rights must be defended. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
