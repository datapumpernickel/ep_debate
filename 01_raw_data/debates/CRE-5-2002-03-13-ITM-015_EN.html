<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Carlotti (PSE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, every year the European Parliament presents a report on the activities of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly. Since 2000, however, the Cotonou Agreement has brought about a new context that profoundly changes the very nature of this report. The Cotonou Agreement made profound changes to the cooperation objectives, with the new goal being a renewed partnership that is more balanced and more effective. This means that there have to be changes in the JPA’s modus operandi. More than just changes in the modus operandi, it requires a real cultural change.</p>
<p class="contents">Where are we in this process? The Joint Parliamentary Assembly is at a watershed. After 2000, which had raised great hopes of a new era in relations between the EU and ACP States, 2001 did not fulfil all its promise. The working group did undertake a massive adaptation of its working methods, but many delays and a great deal of resistance hindered progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Here are three examples of this: firstly, the European States’ inertia in the ratification process. Only three countries have ratified the agreement: Denmark, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and us, the European Union. Although we are aware that the procedures are long in many European countries, this sends out a political message and a negative signal to the ACP countries. All European Member States must ratify the agreement before the end of 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">The second example is the untimely use of voting by separate college in the Assembly. This is detrimental to its parliamentary nature. I propose limited use, and in particular I propose a moratorium on its use among Europeans. The question of voting rights is fundamental, and the debate over Rule 2 of the Rules of Procedure has led to numerous controversies. The principle of representation by parliamentarians alone must be forcefully reaffirmed, and the compromise drawn up by the Working Group, which specifies limited cases of difficulty in which voting by non-parliamentarians is permitted, is the final position that we can accept here.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to get through this bad patch. This report proposes a few paths that we could take. I will only mention some of them, such as a specific instrument to contribute to democracy: the democratic bonus, financial or material aid to improve the functioning of democratically elected parliaments and a better representation of the opposition. For the ACP countries, the principle is one country, one vote. In fact, each country speaks with just one voice. It is impossible for opposition Members of Parliament in the ACP countries to make themselves heard. In order to remedy this, we need to have an open debate, without taboos, on the re-weighting of votes. For now, the proposal of three delegates per country, put forward by my fellow Member Mr Martinez last year, is heading in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result there is the question of funding. Following a rigorous financial assessment by the Commission, a special fund would be reserved to cover the travel costs of ACP parliamentary representatives only and for the organisation of sessions. From a more general point of view, the JPA is the only assembly that has no budget. It should be given new powers to enable it to exercise financial and political control over the funding of cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, my last point: the European Parliament should devote special attention to the work of the ACP countries in a comprehensive debate, at least once a year, here in the European Parliament, on the different aspects of cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs Carlotti, your report represents a kind of political road map indicating the route to a genuine parliamentary and democratic assembly. It contains many helpful proposals for modifications. So it is a good thing that it is to be adopted before the plenary session in Cape Town and can be taken on board in the discussions there.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Carlotti has already gone into many of the recommendations contained in the report just now. As shadow rapporteur, I would like to comment briefly on a few points. The Cotonou Agreement led to a fundamental reformulation of the goals of cooperation between the EU and the ACP States. Some of the key substantive and political improvements to that agreement are the result of proposals made by the European Parliament. Mr Corrie has done excellent work in this area in recent years as co-President. The result is an ambitious agreement that opens up new horizons for cooperation. But it now needs to have life breathed into it. The working methods and procedures of the JPA need to be streamlined and to correspond to a genuine parliamentary, joint, democratic assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">This process was initiated last year and needs to be continued. These new powers should make it possible for the Assembly to exercise tighter financial control over the expenditure of EU development aid. Stricter monitoring and budgetary control combined with regular contacts between the Members of the Assembly and Members of Parliament from the recipient countries could help to ensure proper use of EU funds in line with the actual needs of the ACP countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The report calls for enhanced cooperation with civil society and non-governmental organisations. In view of the political dimension of the Cotonou Agreement, it seems desirable to establish a dialogue between the public and politicians in the ACP and EU States.</p>
<p class="contents">The obstacles in the way of making the JPA a genuine joint parliamentary assembly need to be eliminated as soon as possible. It is very regrettable that ratification of the agreement in the EU Member States is moving forward at such a sluggish pace. The risk that this will send the wrong signal to the newly industrialised countries with which the EU has strong historical, political and cultural links should not be underestimated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report underlines that Cotonou is a major step forward in the process set out some decades ago for cooperation between the European Union and a growing number of African, Caribbean and Pacific States, with the aim of aiding their development.</p>
<p class="contents">It reminds us that we are facing a process that has matured and that has also adapted to the current situation. Europeans have not granted this new agreement to our partners, but have fully and rigorously negotiated it with them. This is, therefore, an association agreement between partners that are equals in their mutual respect, recognition and rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It is an agreement which, in addition to its economic and commercial component, introduces an innovative political dimension that should allow the ACP-EU Community, united in its proclaimed democratic values with a great capacity for influence in its pursuit of a just, balanced, free, lawful, peaceful world where prosperity is reasonably divided and shared, to burst onto the world stage. However, all the confidence expressed in the report is naturally conditional upon our responsibility to take advantage of the provisions of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence the appeals of the rapporteur, first of all, to those Member States who do not consider the ratification of the Cotonou agreement a priority. She also calls on the European Parliament to give the implementation of the Cotonou agreement the attention it deserves. She calls upon those MEPs who act as Parliament’s representatives in the ACP-EU Joint Assembly to act responsibly. She also calls upon us to make sure this Assembly is truly parliamentary and well balanced, and to commit ourselves to acting in a way that shows solidarity, and is fully democratic within this Assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also highlights our ACP partners’ responsibilities to achieve what is set out in the agreement so that the Joint Assembly can be set up once and for all. They will then need to adjust themselves to democratic standards, the respect for human rights and the Rule of Law, as guarantees for their own progress and to effectively contribute to a world of stability and peace which is the objective of the Cotonou agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a fine piece of work, and it is also excellent that the work has been completed before the next meeting of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly takes place, which is as early as next week of course. It is an important report, and Mrs Carlotti has also put forward a number of theoretical observations. I shall examine a couple of them more closely but, before I do so, I should just like to emphasise that it does not of course help a great deal to stand here and talk about the Cotonou Agreement if we cannot get it ratified, and we must once again call upon the Member States to make such ratification possible. I believe that, in the course of the last few months, only one additional country has come on board. And even if there are many countries that have planned to ratify the agreement, we have still to see the final signatures. The situation is a little better where the ACP countries are concerned, but the overall number of signatories is, of course, still by no means large enough.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing that can be said is that such an agreement is not really, of course, worth very much if we do not arrange for proper aid. Here, too, there are, no doubt, difficulties, and I hope that the Commissioner – or whoever he now has to help him – will succeed in getting a process under way before tomorrow’s formal meeting of foreign ministers. The target I should like to have seen, namely one of 0.7%, will certainly not be adopted, but I have to acknowledge that this target is impossible to achieve at the present time. Simply getting a binding process under way will, however, be of absolutely crucial importance.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like now to address two points in Mrs Carlotti’s report. The first is the issue of our own working methods. On that issue, I definitely do not think that we have made enough progress. I think we have too many resolutions and too little debate. The second point is the composition of the ACP-EU delegation, which is not of course particularly appropriate. The fact that the delegation includes only one person from the ACP countries introduces a distortion, democratically speaking, and I therefore also think that we should look again at the composition. Should we, for example, have twice as many delegates from both sides and then only meet once a year in order to obtain greater representation? Or can we come up with some other solution? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am struck, in particular, by how strongly the theme of genuine partnership shines through; how the EU/ACP Joint Parliamentary Assembly is a unique relationship in modern political life and – imperfect as it is – it can stand as a model for new and innovative relations between North and South, which are perhaps today needed more urgently than ever before to build a more peaceful and sustainable world. That does not mean that there is not room to improve the workings of that relationship. I commend Mrs Carlotti for the proposal she makes in that regard. I would like to expand on a couple of them.</p>
<p class="contents">First, if a partnership is a genuine one, then it must also be a consistent and coherent one; one that manifests itself not only in the EU's development policy but also in the EU's trade and economic policy; not only a partnership within the confines of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, but a partnership that extends into other international institutions like the WTO, the World Bank and the UN.</p>
<p class="contents">At the WTO in particular, there is enormous scope for the EU and ACP working more closely together. On trade there are some huge political challenges ahead, not least the negotiation of the regional economic partnership agreements. These have the potential to have damaging effects on some of the poorest ACP countries who are simply not ready to open their markets to the EU and who do not have the negotiating capacity to engage not only in this process and the WTO process but also in the process of their own regional cooperation agreements. It is therefore essential that the JPA plays an active role in shaping and monitoring this process. Greater involvement of civil society will also be key. I appreciate the proposals in the report which would enable the views of NGOs to be heard far more systematically in the JPA's proceedings.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a partnership must be a partnership of equals. We urgently need to find the means and the resources to fund it, to address the basic imbalance between the representation of the EU side, reflecting Parliament's political make-up and spectrum of political views, and a system of representation of the ACP states based on one country, one vote, which prevents different political views being expressed.</p>
<p class="contents">The JPA is a unique instrument of cooperation and solidarity, North and South. We need to value it, improve it, and build on it as a model for North-South cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

ACP-EU cooperation has gained a new democratic aspect, and that means that we also need to provide a new democratic dimension in shaping this cooperation. That is why the emphasis on the parliamentary nature of the Assembly presented in this report is so important. Flesh needs to be put on the bones of this idea. And that is also why it was so important for this report to be approved by this House before the session in Cape Town, so as to give us moral support for the reform of this cooperation process.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a following wind if we are to strengthen the parliamentary dimension and to achieve what we have pledged to do. We have been told that the work on the new Rules of Procedure has not been totally without conflict – that is why it will be very important for us to have the support this report so that the negotiations in Cape Town can be brought to a satisfactory conclusion. I am sure that we will be able to agree on a structure for the standing committees, which will accordingly change the nature of cooperation in this parliamentary assembly. The standing parliamentary committees make it possible to work continuously on problem areas, whereas up to now it has only been possible for us to work in ad hoc working groups. I hope that this form of cooperation will facilitate far more intensive work on various themes and closer cooperation with our colleagues on the ACP side.</p>
<p class="contents">The regional meetings will also lend new weight to our work. They will also give a voice to other people involved in ACP cooperation who have not so far had an opportunity to have their views heard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its ratification by the European Parliament in January will encourage the Member States to follow that example, thus enabling the financial part to be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">The Joint Parliamentary Assembly has adapted its work according to the new role that it has been given, in particular to promote democratic processes. As a forum for the expression of the will of the people and of democratic values, it has a central role to play. But its powers are limited. It remains just a platform for political expression, without any decision-making or executive powers. It should therefore be given new powers, both political as well as financial and operational, and the logistical resources to go with them. A working group responsible for evaluating the involvement of civil society in the partnership should therefore be created. In the same way, parliamentarians should be involved in the forthcoming negotiations on the future ACP-EU trade regime. We will therefore vote with conviction in favour of Mrs Carlotti’s report, which makes excellent proposals on the other points, as she set out a while ago, while pointing out that the way that the ACP countries will become democratic is by making the associated institutions and development cooperation more democratic in general. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Our current partnerships with 77 countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific should set an example for relations between the European Union and the United States, and also EU candidate countries, which we have been very enthusiastically debating in the recent past.</p>
<p class="contents">If EU Member States do not show much interest in these partnerships, which is borne out by the aforementioned fact that only four Member States have ratified the Cotonou Agreement, Parliament should do so, particularly because relations with these countries are based, according to the new agreement, on political dialogue, of which the Parliamentary Assembly is a fundamental pillar.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would like to ask the Member States, particularly my own, Spain, which holds the Presidency of the Council, to speed up formalities so that the agreement can be ratified.</p>
<p class="contents">The Joint Assembly, like this Parliament, is deeply involved in a process where its Rules of Procedure are being reformed, having, as its aim, the true democratisation of ACP-EU relations. Our efforts are directed, first and foremost, towards improving the functioning of the Assembly, converting it into an assembly which is effectively balanced and parliamentary. At the moment it is not balanced because, whilst on the European side the range of ideologies and political sensitivities that make up the European Parliament are represented, the ACP countries have only one vote per country; a vote which obviously represents the authorities’ opinions; it is not balanced in terms of equality between the sexes either. Nor is it parliamentary, because the representatives from ACP countries are not, on the whole, Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The credibility of our cooperation with ACP countries, which is far from negligible, is in doubt if it is not accompanied by reforms and the strengthening of the institution that is the most representative of the association, that is to say, the Joint Assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, in a seminar, we said that ‘without democracy there can be no development’ and this is a priority objective of the international community and the European Union. I would ask the Commission and the Council to make resources available to ACP countries to improve their institutional capacity, especially with regard to representative institutions, and to promote the organisation of civil society and their participation in cooperation programming.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr, President, let me first add my thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Carlotti, for the good work she has put into preparing this report and also thank those who have contributed to the discussion tonight.</p>
<p class="contents">I note that in her report, Mrs Carlotti emphasises the importance of the parliamentary nature of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and the role it should play in achieving the objectives set out in the Cotonou Agreement. I fully endorse this, and can only encourage the Assembly to reinforce its own legitimacy and democratic nature, for example by ensuring that it is composed purely of parliamentarians.</p>
<p class="contents">I have noted what has been said by a number of people about the need to broaden participation to allow for a more representative reflection of views. This may prompt something of a discussion, in fact, since such matters are defined in the Cotonou Agreement, but I sympathise with the attempt to make room for opposition parties to express their views within the work of the parliamentary assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point concerns a revision of the rules on financing to ensure the full participation of ACP parliamentarians in the Assembly’s sessions and other meetings. The Commission is, of course, concerned that ACP parliamentarians should play their full role, on an equal footing with their European counterparts, to ensure parity between ACP and European members. We are prepared to look into a possible revision of the agreement governing our contribution to the fund for the participation of ACP members. I hope that we will soon receive the financial forecasts we need from the ACP Secretariat to allow us to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Carlotti suggests that a special fund should be set up to finance the Assembly. If I understand correctly, such a fund already exists, and is mentioned in the Declaration on the Joint Institutions annexed to the Cotonou Agreement and is, in fact, specified to be in the region of EUR 4 000 000. This fund covers financing of the Joint Council and Joint Parliamentary Assembly, and is managed by the ACP Secretariat. The Community’s contribution to this fund cannot be increased, but with a little planning there should be no problem as to the amount of money available to cover ACP participation. We will have to look at this in a practical way. Basically, given the relatively large strategic effort to strengthen civil society and to fund directly civil society NGOs in our ACP partner countries, it would appear unfair to leave the work of parliaments somewhat weakened while strengthening the political work of non-elected bodies in our partner countries. Hence my sympathy and understanding with regard to the need to ensure that this can actually operate smoothly.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Carlotti also suggests that the Assembly be more actively involved in scrutiny of the management of EDF funds. I agree with the spirit of her argument, and everything should be done to ensure that the Assembly fulfils the consultative role given to it by the Cotonou Agreement. However, I am sure you will understand that this should not lead to the establishment of new complicated procedures and reporting requirements that will add to the problems we already have in making the whole system function. I can promise that we will provide information on the implementation and functioning of the EDF, and of course discussion of this theme in the Joint Assembly is to be welcomed. All the more so since in launching the Cotonou Agreement and the preparatory work for the country strategy papers for the 9th European Development Fund activities we have reached out and included parliaments and public in our ACP partner countries in a way that intentionally raises expectations. For that reason, it is even more relevant and natural to engage the parliamentarians closely in specific discussions about the overall functioning of cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, it is true – several Members have pointed out – that we are lagging behind in the ratification process. Four or five Member States have completed ratification. They are Denmark, Finland, Sweden and the UK – and I think France has also completed its ratification process now. Technically speaking, this has not raised any real problems until now, but it will do so if we have not completed the process before the summer recess. I would not like to see a situation emerging where we have a slowdown in the real disbursement and real level of planning activity because of a failure of one or more Member States to ratify. That would simply be too embarrassing. I very much appreciate what has been said tonight and urge Members of the European Parliament to encourage completion of this process in their own countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
