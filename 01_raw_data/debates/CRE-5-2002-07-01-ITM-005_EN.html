<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mayol i Raynal (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, we are being consulted on a proposal for a tax directive on biofuels. Before examining the merits of the proposal, I would like to make two initial comments.</p>
<p class="contents">The first concerns language. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, please excuse the flaws in the language that I am using in this House. My mother tongue is, in fact, Catalan and I condemn the fact that 10 million citizens are unable to use their own language in this House. The second comment concerns terminology. In my view, the term ‘biofuel’ is regrettable. I proposed to the Committee on Economic Affairs that we use the term ‘agrofuel’. Since this proposal was rejected, I mention it now for the record.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a directive seems to be the result of the directive intended to promote the use of biofuels in transport. The Commission is working on a hypothesis that road transport will continue to increase. In order to meet the commitments made by the Union in Kyoto, we must contemplate using, at least in part, fuels that do not exacerbate the greenhouse effect as a substitute for fossil fuels.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, the White Paper on transport policy states that CO2 emissions from transport can be expected to increase by 50% between 1990 and 2010. According to assessments made in the White Paper, road transport is responsible for 84% of these emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the growth in demand in the transport sector is causing increased dependence on oil- or natural gas-producing third countries. The Commission Green Paper on the security of energy supply recommends that substitute fuels should represent 20% of our total consumption by 2020. The Commission believes that we will benefit from promoting the use of bio- or agrofuels, giving us the possibility of using land which, under the Blair House Agreement, is excluded from food production. In the Commission’s view, this could be beneficial for the future Member States, Eastern Europe, Malta and Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to promote the use of biofuels, a tax incentive must be introduced. Taking into account the current price of crude oil, the per-litre cost price of producing pure bio-diesel would be between EUR 0.25 and EUR 0.30 higher than that of fossil diesel oil. In fact, it appears that the Commission wanted to amend the tax regime for biofuels following the ruling by the Court of First Instance of 27 September 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">These arrangements constitute an exception to the general law on excise duties for mineral oils; the harmonisation of the structure of excise duties for mineral oils is the subject of Directive 92/81/EEC, which the present directive is seeking to amend. In order to encourage the production of bio- or agrofuels, Member States have, until now, been able to implement measures to reduce or exempt excise duties under Article 8(2)(d) of Directive 92/81/EEC. Under the aforementioned Directive, pilot projects for the technological development of more environmentally-friendly products, in particular in relation to fuels from renewable resources, may benefit from these exemptions.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of these provisions, Germany, France and Sweden, in particular, have approved tax derogations that may go as far as complete tax exemptions. The Court of First Instance, however, overruled the Commission’s decision to apply this specific tax derogation to France since the manufacture of ethyl-tertiary-butyl-ether (ETBE) in France had gone beyond the pilot project phase.</p>
<p class="contents">Another provision has been made for derogations under Article 8(4) of Directive 92/81/EEC. The Council takes the decision, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission. In view of the case law involving BP Chemicals, several Member States submitted derogation applications to the Commission. On the basis of Article 93 of the EC Treaty, the proposal for a directive seeks to harmonise the rate of excise duty for biofuels. It is stipulated therefore that Member States may apply levels of taxation lower than the rate of 20% which has been retained as a lower limit on these products, but that the levels of taxation may not be lower than 50% of the normal rate of excise duty applied to fossil fuels. Member States may apply an additional reduction to bio- or agrofuels used by certain hauliers, including local public transport suppliers. Several amendments are seeking a total exemption from excise duty to be applied to biofuels. It is unlikely that the Member States, which must act unanimously in this area, will reach an agreement on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">From an ecological point of view, there is no evidence whatsoever that the products that these particular directives are encouraging, namely, bio- or agrofuels which can be mixed with oil (biodiesel and bio-ethanol) offer any real benefit. One might wonder whether the ideas for reducing the greenhouse effect are not being put forward to conceal the true intentions of oil companies, chemical refining industries, the motor industry and agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendment that we tabled, therefore, seeks to ensure that the size of reductions in the rate of tax are calculated solely in accordance with the ecological benefits of products and their uses. From this point of view, we believe it would be more appropriate to encourage biofuels with a view to their use by what are called their ‘captive audience’, namely taxis, bus companies and diesel locomotives. A separate distribution network could be set up, engines could be modified to run exclusively on biofuels and energy savings could thus be made.</p>
<p class="contents">This solution also has the merit of encouraging decentralised development. It may be possible for these products and uses to benefit from total tax exemption. This should also apply to biofuels produced from the biomass from Mediterranean regions where there is a substantial risk of fire. In essence, although we agree on the 2% target of biofuels for the year 2005, we oppose the 5.75% target by 2010. We call for the quantitative objectives to be redefined following an environmental impact assessment which takes into account the alternative uses of biomass. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ayuso González (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is a directive which responds to the Commission Communication, the Green Paper and various resolutions by this Parliament. We believe it is a realistic directive and that it can be complied with perfectly well.</p>
<p class="contents">Before moving on, I would like to highlight the cooperation and harmony I have enjoyed with the shadow rapporteur, Mrs Rothe, and with the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, Mr Kronberger, since we are involved in a Hughes procedure. This circumstance, incidentally, has considerably delayed the debate on the directive at first reading as a result of a problem of competences which Parliament has taken too long to resolve.</p>
<p class="contents">I am going to focus essentially on the most controversial aspect of the directive, which is the issue of the objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has proposed certain obligatory objectives to be complied with over a number of years. There are some countries which have made progress in achieving them and which could comply with them before the time limits set by the Commission. However, many countries have been very reticent in accepting them.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the amendments presented – and there have been many – proposing indicative targets, this Parliament, both in the Industry Committee and in the Environment Committee, has approved making the targets obligatory by a huge majority. In the Industry Committee specifically, there were 38 votes in favour and 5 against.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, the shadow rapporteur, myself and the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, in an act of great generosity by Parliament, have offered the Council an amendment, which we tabled jointly, with a view to the targets being indicative. We expect something from the Council in return of course: that it reciprocate by accepting a series of other amendments from Parliament and by accepting the proposed directive from the Commission with this exception of the targets. Furthermore, we also propose to the Council a compromise on Amendment No 53, which proposes that the Member States, for justifiable reasons, may delay the application of the directive through a one-off exception of two years.</p>
<p class="contents">Another matter I wish to deal with does not relate to the present directive, but indirectly affects the application of mixtures. It involves Directive 98/70/EC on the quality of petrols. The Commission is aware that this directive must be adapted for mixtures, since it cannot be applied in the same way for mixtures as it is for other oil-based fuels. In countries with warm summers, volatility increases and therefore vapour pressure will have to be increased. I had presented an amendment in this regard. As a result of legal problems I have withdrawn the second part of it, but I would like to stress that the Commission must propose the modification of Directive 98/70/EC so that mixtures may have a volatility of 70 kPa (kilopascals) in the countries with hot summers, as is allowed in the countries with cold summers.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue which has arisen during the debate on the amendments has been that of proposing the introduction of other fuels in the directive. This is not its aim. However, there are a number of amendments in the recitals which may be accepted, insofar as we must take account of these alternative fuels. We do agree with the amendments that move in the direction of including biohydrogen in the scope of this directive. Other amendments take the approach of establishing quality standards for biofuels which must be mixed. We must establish standard rules for all biofuels.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that this is a directive which is intended to replace existing fuels with biofuels. It is not a directive with an ultimately environmental aim, but it has significant environmental repercussions. There are those who say that there are other cheaper ways to reduce CO2 emissions. No doubt there are, but the directive provides a further degree of synergy. Furthermore, it brings other benefits in relation to employment and agriculture. All I ask is that the Council accept the Commission’s proposal and Parliament’s proposal and that the directive be approved, because the producers of biofuels need a stable framework for production. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The intention in one directive is to introduce a tax on biofuels, which would take away their present competitiveness against fossil fuels. The aim in the other directive is to promote biofuels in order to build up their share in overall fuel consumption to a marked degree. The promotion of biofuels is without doubt an essential component of Europe's future energy supply, being sustainable and environmentally friendly. The amendments by the Environmental and Economic Affairs Committees, however, by raising the possibility of complete exemption from duties, make the two proposals compatible.</p>
<p class="contents">One crucial point, that of their environmental impact, has been addressed in discussion of biofuels. The call has been made for the entire ecological lifecycle of biofuels to be evaluated. In principle, this is right; but, for the purposes of comparison, fossil fuels must also be included in such an assessment, and their complete lifecycle evaluated in order to achieve objective and comparable results. This should then also be dealt with in discussions with the Council, where we have proposed a compromise. Assessments of whether actions are ecological are probably much better reached when working towards obligatory or indicative targets. We will indeed reach a compromise, but one of the most important preconditions for it is the agreement of the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It seems that the debate on biofuels has, in a way, put the cart before the horse, in the sense that this is, first and foremost, an agricultural problem and that it would have been more sensible to wait for the assessment of the Berlin agenda to be completed, in other words, to complete the mid-term review, so that we know exactly which direction to take for the biofuels policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The quality of biofuel production will primarily be determined by the way in which agriculture will be managed and this is what we must bear in mind, above all else, in dealing with this subject. The biofuels in question can be manufactured using a production-based approach, with GMOs, with per-hectare inputs, but the overall ecological impact would then be negative.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, if we take the logical approach, the one which the common agricultural policy has followed for some time now, in other words, if we practise greater crop rotation and if we respect the environment as we should, then biofuels and biofuel production could become a valuable extra activity for farmers involved in direct production. It is better to produce pure biodiesel, pure oil or use biomass to produce hydrogen rather than to follow an approach whereby a small percentage of fuel of agricultural origin is blended with fuels which are themselves still fossil fuels and are therefore still products that produce a great deal of pollution during production.</p>
<p class="contents">This line of thinking leads to an approach, which, in our view, is heading in the right direction. And since the proposed approach seems satisfactory, we shall study in detail the final decision that is taken. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not only, however, for the purpose of reducing emissions that it is important to invest in development work with a view to producing alternative fuels. The issue of a secure long-term energy supply for the European Union is also becoming ever more important.</p>
<p class="contents">Because taxes constitute a very large portion of the selling price of energy products, different types of tax incentive are effective instruments of control. The proposal I shall confine myself to talking about concerns the possibility of reducing excise duty in the Member States, that is to say the Commission proposal for amending Directive 92/81/EEC. The proposal gives the Member States access to a flexible financial instrument of control for developing the production of biofuels. It takes account of the Member States’ budgets, local conditions and own choices of technical solutions. The proposal is therefore in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity too. I consider the amendments by the rapporteur and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which have been adopted by the committee, to have further improved the proposal. They contain demands for time limits and supervision, the evaluation of total energy efficiency and the assessment and analysis of environmental impact. That is why I am delighted to support the report, and I should like it to be approved by the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Producing and utilising fuels derived from biomass is a political and economic alternative to importing oil. The transport sector's demand for energy will continue to grow. That is evident to all of us, as society is becoming ever more mobile and the number of vehicles on Europe's roads will also continue to increase dramatically after EU enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe's economy and jobs are inevitably dependent on security of supply, so fiscal support is the right way ahead, as we can expect the production of fuels from biomass to completely replace the import of fuel oil as soon as a few decades hence. It is therefore right and proper for Europe-wide fiscal instruments to promote biofuels over a transitional period. A common internal market demands more than the development of instruments by some states and not by others.</p>
<p class="contents">Because they contain a proportion of carbon dioxide and need to be mixed with petroleum, biofuels are currently subject to the duty levied on petroleum products. It is therefore also right that we recommend to the plenary that it should go beyond the Commission proposal and consider as a possible incentive not only reduced rates of duty but also actual exemption from it, in order to make progress with further deliberate promotion of biofuels.</p>
<p class="contents">As fiscal benefits, whether in the form of reductions or exemptions, lead to marked cost reductions, the competitiveness of biofuels can be guaranteed. This promotion can simultaneously create jobs in agriculture and plant engineering, leading in turn to higher tax yields and social security contributions. In the final analysis, the production of biofuels is labour-intensive and has a greater impact on employment than the production of conventional fuels. More favourable fiscal treatment at Community level is in accordance with the principles of the internal market and will also tend to enhance the EU's competitiveness. There may be resultant innovations in the areas of process engineering, cultivation and harvesting, and also in the production of motor vehicles. Community-wide requirements for biofuels to be of a quality standard compatible with state-of-the-art motors would make it possible for motor engineering to advance to the point of producing the zero-emission car, which would probably be an export winner. All this enhances growth and creates jobs, as does the export of relevant products and processes to countries that are at present economically dependent on imported oil. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My group is also of the opinion that the Commission proposal is a very attractive one. My group has always taken the view that the use of agricultural products for industrial purposes should be promoted. I can imagine this proposal on biofuels being the first of many, as agricultural products can also be used for other purposes, such as lubricants and recyclable plastics, to name but two. A whole range of other uses can be added to this.</p>
<p class="contents">As other speakers have already stated before me, Europe is over-dependent on energy imports. We import about 50% or 45% of what we need, and this dependence is likely to increase. The Commission is therefore on the right track with this proposal. One of the things that should be considered is how we can make vegetable biodiesel even more effective. Doubt has been expressed from various corners, to which I do not entirely subscribe, as to whether biodiesel is all that profitable economically and ecologically speaking. I believe it is, but the Commission might be able to make some changes for the better.</p>
<p class="contents">Something which is not included in the Commission proposal, but which I very much approve of, is that pure vegetable oils too, and not only biodiesel, can be used as fuel. The technology for this is of German origin and involves the use of a special engine. Why should we not give it a try? Why too, would it not be possible, if farmers use their own vegetable oil, for them to receive tax exemption for this? We will support this at any rate.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as taxes are concerned, various countries have in the past tried to promote biofuels and there is a tax discrepancy in different ways in many European countries. We take the view that this should be maintained for the time being. In my opinion, this could in the long term give rise to competitive differences, and we should be able to prevent this from happening. We believe that it is acceptable for these tax differences to continue until about 2008, but by that time, a certain harmonisation will inevitably have to occur, and I welcome the fact that the Commission monitors this.</p>
<p class="contents">In a nutshell, the Commission should be congratulated on this proposal, pure vegetable oils should also be included and, in order to promote the use of agricultural products in general in future, the Commission must table proposals on lubricants, recyclable plastics, and so on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It need not, however, necessarily be so. Rather, it depends entirely upon how these biofuels are produced. Using heavily subsidised, highly refined agricultural products to produce biofuels may, in many cases, be unwise from an environmental point of view. If consideration is to be given to the overall environmental impact, there are significantly more interesting techniques, for example the production of ethyl alcohol derived from forest products. If a system sustainable in the long term is to be obtained, biofuels must therefore be assessed from an overall perspective and in terms of their environmental drawbacks. Taxation must also be adjusted in the light of this long-term environmental impact.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that if a breakthrough is to be obtained in connection with this new technology and the extensive investment required, countries must be able <span class="italic">completely</span> to remove tax for a transitional period so as to bring about the required investment in terms of engines, filling stations etc. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do wonder, however, whether this objective will be reached by promoting the use of biofuels. Biofuels have, apart from the positive C02 effect, other environmental effects too. Indeed, other gases are released during combustion, and these environmental effects are less positive as a rule. I therefore consider an integral environmental impact study to be necessary in order to remove the doubts that exist in connection with the use of biofuels. If we now promote biofuels by means of fiscal measures without gaining a clear picture of the effect on the environment, we could well end up disappointed. Promotion will be appropriate when the use of biofuels makes a clear contribution to a better environment. However, it will need to be stressed that the same emission standards must apply to engines that run on biomass as they do to regular fuel engines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Biofuels are fuels capable of replacing conventional fuels or of being mixed with them, and which are derived from the processing or fermentation of various non-fossil biological materials. The reason I say this is that we should always explain what we are talking about. Bioethanol and biodiesel are the biofuels most in use at present. Whilst the two of them are virtually equally profitable, they cannot compete with fuels derived from oil. The profitability of biofuels is manifestly dependent, on the one hand, on producing the maximum quantity from the best-quality production process and, on the other, on its price. While I am on the subject of biodiesel, I would like to mention that it is derived from plant oils – rapeseed, sunflower, soya and palm for example – which are mainly grown in regions of the EU and can also be used as animal feedingstuffs.</p>
<p class="contents">Being a convinced advocate of the environmentally-responsible market economy, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the possibility of Member States levying duties at less than the stipulated minimum rates on products composed of biofuels. As the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee has already done, though, I do also insist that this concession must also include complete exemption from duty for pure biofuels over a specific period of time.</p>
<p class="contents">Why do we demand this? We demand it because we have to guarantee that biofuels will be able to compete against petroleum. Its additional costs are at present around EUR 0.30 per litre. Another reason is that biofuels are CO2-neutral and therefore contribute substantially to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and to achieving the Kyoto commitments. Thirdly, they help us achieve the objective we have set ourselves, of Europe becoming self-sufficient in energy; not only are we currently excessively dependent on petroleum imports, but it is calculated that we will be 85% dependent on them by 2020. Fourthly, biofuels are an indigenous energy resource for the EU in the same way as are the other renewable energy sources and coal. We know ourselves today to be taking a step in the direction of a strengthened environmentally responsible market economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Plans to apply reduced rates of excise duty to biofuels or to exempt them from duties altogether, and to provide for the promotion of their use with a catalogue of clear objectives, will help to reduce the European Union's high degree of dependency on oil imports in an environmentally sound manner. From here on in, though, I propose to confine myself to the proposal on the promotion of biofuels.</p>
<p class="contents">My heartfelt thanks go primarily to our rapporteur, Mrs Ayuso González, not only for submitting an excellent draft report, but also for her really good cooperation. The promotion of biofuels fits into the EU's overall strategy of doubling the penetration of renewable energy sources<span class="italic"> </span>by 2010, a strategy for which we have essential reasons. In Kyoto, the EU made the commitment to reduce the output of greenhouse gases by 8%. Traffic in particular is a major source of these. It is likewise important to safeguard security of supply, and promoting the biomass as a source of energy will give rural development new and significant impetus.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking as I do for the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I therefore welcome the responsible Committee's confirmation of the line taken by the Commission, that binding national targets should be set for further increasing the share of biofuels. I have, however joined with the rapporteur in tabling a compromise amendment providing for indicative targets to be linked with the possibility of their being reviewed. The rapporteur has gone into the background to this. The one thing we now see as important is that we should meet the Council halfway by being willing to set indicative targets as well, but this means that we expect the Council, this very week, to accede to the demands made by the competent Committee in various areas. It is important in this context that environmental and climatic conditions should come under particular scrutiny, that agricultural practices should be examined accordingly, and that it is not in the least acceptable for the Council to do as it is no doubt currently trying to do, and provide for any Member State to be able to opt out without substantial obstacles being put in the way of their doing so. What are we to do with a directive that starts by setting targets and then makes them more lenient? We are, then, prepared to come to a speedy agreement – indeed, the whole point is that we desire one – but such an agreement is not to be had at any price. We hope to have reached agreement with the Council by Thursday. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would warn against seeing it as unique among the CO2 problems, because biofuels are significantly more expensive and the potential for saving CO2 is comparatively slight and comes at a high price.</p>
<p class="contents">I see this issue as having to do with alternatives for agriculture, and as not just being about greater self-sufficiency in energy supply, but also being an opportunity for our farmers to offer alternatives that strengthen our own energy base at a time of growing problems with surpluses. That, indeed, is why the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy adopted Mrs Ayuso's very fine report by a large majority. We have also, Commissioner, tabled a number of amendments. It would of course be splendid if the Commission were to take them on board. The first has to do with the issue of mandatory blending. It is our opinion that it is not the incorporation of additives that is the solution to the problem, but the achievement of an overall objective, whether that be by the use of a biofuel as the sole fuel, as is already possible with my diesel, for example, or whether it be through alternatives. That is one point: yes to the objectives, but not in the form of mandatory blending.</p>
<p class="contents">A second question is that of how assessment is to be carried out, and Mrs Rothe has already mentioned this. What she and Mrs Ayuso again emphasised in Amendments Nos 68 and 69 has been incorporated into many individual amendments by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. Even before the market share of biofuels has exceeded 2%, we want to have a report on the measures' impact by 2006; in other words, we want a clear eco-balance sheet, we want a clear balance sheet covering CO2 and the alternatives. Prior to any binding increase to the 5.75% that is sought after and is in any case approaching the limit of the surfaces in the European Union according to current models, we want a balance sheet and then a report from the Commission every other year. If any agreement can be achieved by means of this package, then the proposal is a good one and we are making progress. If the Commission is able to agree to this, a broad majority will be the result.</p>
<p class="contents">Exemption from duty is a much more difficult matter. My experience in this House since 1994 tells me that, on fiscal issues, the Member States persist in adopting a self-centred approach, and that any agreement on uniformity in the taxation of energy is still a long way off. A directive on the subject has been in existence since 1992, and six Member States have implemented it. In my country, last Friday, the upper house of the German parliament decided in favour of full exemption from taxes, which is a very far-reaching thing, but one that is not on the agenda in other Member States. I therefore have little hope that the Council's second directive, on which Parliament can only be consulted, will pass into law in the foreseeable future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In that respect, we have to keep our feet on the ground. A product which promises net improvements of 45% at most obliges us to put more support measures in place in other areas. The same goes for fiscal incentives.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if the same potential and the same financial resources as are envisaged in this area were to be invested in thermal insulation for example, energy requirements could be reduced by three times as much. From a purely ecological point of view, then, the appropriateness of biofuels is at least up for discussion, but we cannot deny that this product has a future. Innovation is inherent in it.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, when looking into the future, we also have to take into account the fact that this provides a way ahead especially for the candidate countries, with large areas of agricultural land. However, it is in this sector that policy is moving in the direction of maximising production, and probably doing so with the aid of genetic manipulation. Do we want that as well? If we do, then OK. In addition, there is still doubt about the cost-benefit ratio from the consumer's point of view. I hope that is something we will be able to resolve. If, for example, the price of crude oil drops on world markets, the cost of producing petroleum will also be down, and producers of the agricultural raw materials may, or indeed will, require additional subsidies. This is not a time for euphoria, but the proposed compromises between the groups certainly give us a chance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The directive will be important for the sector’s industry and will point the way to developments in the years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">The most crucial issue, and the one that is discussed in several amendments, concerns how binding the percentages are to be – are they to be obligatory or just target values? Our aims and targets must be such that they lead towards the long-term use of biofuels with low emissions. Transport is a major source of carbon dioxide emissions, and we are highly dependent on imports of traditional petroleum-based fuels. This dependence on imported oil will increase in the future, and we must free ourselves from this dependence in any way that is at all possible.</p>
<p class="contents">However, at this stage I do not support binding targets with regard to percentages. A voluntary scheme is often the most viable solution. There are always dangers associated with coercion. Many Member States are sparsely populated and in thinly populated regions often the only way of getting around is by car. We cannot force people who live in sparsely populated regions to use biofuels if this means significantly increased fuel costs.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to set targets to promote the use of biofuels we must also be prepared to introduce tax concessions in connection with them. Tax relief could be granted for biofuels to guarantee their competitiveness, as the Commission has stated in its separate proposal for a directive. Biofuels will not be competitive, compared to traditional fuels, without separate tax concessions. I do not believe, however, that the Council of Ministers, especially the Ministers for Finance, will be very pleased with this idea. I would therefore like to show moderation in this matter of tax relief.</p>
<p class="contents">We should leave the matter of increasing the market share of biofuels for a later appraisal. Let us first see how well the new products are received by the market and consumers and what other effects biofuels and bio-components have. The undisputedly positive impact of biofuels on employment in the EU countries must not be overlooked in the study. Neither should this directive mean expensive agricultural aid for certain Member States. We will have to look carefully at how the availability of raw material develops in the different Member States. The Commission’s proposal to increase the percentage annually must at this stage be omitted from the directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No doubt, any problems are on the Council's side, and I only hope that we do not have a repeat of what happened many years ago when Mrs Scrivener, who was a Commissioner at the time, submitted a similar package and the Council ended up rejecting it. I hope there will be a better outcome this time.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of speakers have rightly pointed out that there are cheaper ways of making CO2 avoidable, and there can hardly be any dispute about that. On the other hand, biofuels have a range of advantages to offer that should not be underestimated. As we produce biofuels, so our energy dependence will diminish. I believe that the burden they will lift from agricultural policy is an argument that will carry particular weight in consequence of the addition of the countries of Eastern Europe to the enlarged EU. I speak as someone who has had a certain amount to do with technology when I say, thirdly, that I believe it will give technology a certain boost, in that new processes and techniques will be developed, and businesses can rest secure in the knowledge that they will be supported throughout the years that they are working on biofuels, as is only right and proper.</p>
<p class="contents">I want, though, to draw attention to two things that this directive will certainly bring in its wake, and which – as I have already said in committee – will not be to everyone's liking. The biofuels directive will of course increase biologists' desire to create more efficient renewable raw materials with a low environmental impact, and step up their efforts at doing so. That should not be forgotten. We will also have to import biofuels, which means that Europe will become a new market for countries such as Brazil, Argentina and the USA, and we should be careful not just to create a market for others, but also a market for ourselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Titley (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, we all recognise the need to cut greenhouse gases and we all want to see policies on cleaner fuels. The question is how we can achieve these objectives. In my opinion, the Commission's proposals on promoting the use of biofuels for transport are not necessarily the best way of achieving those objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, by restricting the scope of the directive to biofuels, we could hinder rather than help achieve our overall environmental objectives. We need a broader-based strategy to cover all renewable and carbon-beneficial fuels. We need to cut carbon emissions quickly and as cheaply as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, mandatory targets in the first instance are too restrictive. Member States need to be encouraged to negotiate targets in line with their own particular circumstances and the environmental performance of fuels suitable to their geographical areas. We should also bear in mind that many high-energy biofuels may be better used in heat and power production rather than transport – another reason for allowing Member States to develop their own biofuel strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, if we do get agreement on reduced rates of fuel duty for biofuels, that would make mandatory targets less necessary. So I agree with the compromise position which has been outlined this evening, which calls for indicative targets with the Commission able, at a later date, to introduce mandatory targets if we feel progress is not being made.</p>
<p class="contents">I would warn colleagues about some of the remarks that have been made about security of supply. I endorse what Mr Linkohr has just said. We may well end up needing to import many of these biofuels. Brazil and the United States have competitive advantages – lower land values and certainly a better climate. Therefore, we could end up being protective of our biofuel industry and replacing one form of agricultural policy with another one. That is the last thing we want to achieve because, in many areas, I suspect this is an agricultural policy not an industrial policy, and, of course, we must not underestimate the importance of genetic modification in meeting the biofuels targets that we require. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not believe the latter will be the case, but I am very grateful to our Commissioner, Mrs de Palacio, for the fact that she has nevertheless dared to table a proposal in order to examine whether we can promote the production of biofuels, and particularly their use.</p>
<p class="contents">In actual fact, we have come full circle. As we have seen in the past, as our draught horses on the fields were replaced by machines, so we will witness, if it were up to me, European farmers using tractors and machinery that mainly run on biofuels, which happen to be produced on the farm. If we can achieve this, then we will have made a huge step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that my amendments to reduce the rate of excise duty to zero, or at least offer this opportunity, and not only a 50% reduction, have been adopted in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. I would like to ask the Commissioner whether it is indeed true that the Finance Ministers have also said that a total excise exemption for biofuels might well be possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point is the use of rapeseed and cold-pressed rapeseed oil. There are, of course, suggestions that these raw materials might be imported, but it seems to me that if we want to become less dependent on the import of fuels in particular, then we must expressly include the clause that total excise exemption is only granted for the production of biofuels in the European Union. This seems to be quite essential, in my view, also for the European countryside, and offers us good prospects for a new, hi-tech rural development policy.</p>
<p class="contents">What could be finer than to expand the second pillar for the production and cultivation of biofuels of rapeseed but also other raw materials, precisely for fuels? I would welcome it with open arms if the Commission were to work out further applications on this score and, especially, if it were to impose further obligations on the Member States in order to meet this objective.</p>
<p class="contents">That would include those Member States that have a very poor score in this area. And I would add that my country, among others, does not score very well at all in this matter. I have high expectations of our current Commissioner, Mrs de Palacio, and hope that she has an opportunity to enforce these objectives more forcefully on the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to express my gratitude to you, Commissioner, for having proposed binding targets, as I believe this directive to be of less value without them. It is true that we cannot expect too much of the directive. It will not resolve the whole climate problem for us, nor will it sort out all the difficulties we have with energy, but it has contributions to make to the security of energy supply and to climate protection, and it can open up new sources of income for agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">Now for the misgivings, which are as follows. One is that intensive farming will be promoted. Yes, of course there is such a thing as intensive farming, but there is also extensive farming, and I have never come across a refinery producing conventional fuels on an extensive basis. That is always about intensive and localised pollution of the environment. Mention has been made of the life cycle of biofuels and the pollution of the environment involved in their manufacture. Who is calculating the life cycle of conventional fuels? We must also take other factors into consideration, such as the transport from the oil-producing regions to Europe, and possible calamities such as that which happened to the tanker <span class="italic">Erika</span>. If the <span class="italic">Erika</span> had been carrying biodiesel, the environment would have been unscathed. Those who enumerate the drawbacks of biofuels should also mention those of conventional fuels.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe in technology, and I believe in innovation. If we create a clear framework for them, biofuels in Europe will be a great deal more efficient, more cost-effective and also much more environmentally friendly. All we have to do is give them that framework. I therefore ask the House to support Amendments Nos 25 and 33 in particular, which give pride of place to eco-efficiency and make it a criterion in the directive. How I vote on Thursday, and whether or not I agree to a compromise with the Council, will be determined by whether amendments unanimously adopted in committee, such as Nos 25 and 33, are actually taken on board. If they are not, then I cannot vote for a compromise at First Reading stage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is surely not enough simply to prefix the word ‘fuel’ with ‘bio’ and thus create a biofuel that is 100% biological. On this I am in agreement with the criticisms voiced by Members of this House. What, though does ‘biological’ mean? For me, it means an all-embracing eco-balance sheet, one that covers cultivation and production, as well as the output of gases. I would therefore ask you to evaluate normal fuels in the same way, without succumbing to the temptation to apply double standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Any eco-balance sheet must, in my opinion, include an economic evaluation of biofuels, which must be compared with conventional ones. Here we have the chance to build up a market of our own in the European Union, which would mean an increase in EU jobs in production and processing. But a market of our own also means independence – that we would no longer be dependent on global markets and affected by world economic crises. This Europe of ours will never achieve complete independence in the field of fuels; our consumption is too high for that. But we can at least make a start on operating and securing our fuel market ourselves in the future. As has often been mentioned, the cultivation of renewable raw materials could be an additional – and welcome – source of income for agriculture in the European Union. Good use would be made of land that had been set aside, which would be a source of important and new produce.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by noting that every new market needs to be supported politically, financially, and – very importantly – with ideas, if it is to establish itself on a long-term basis. It is my contention that at least 50% of wind farms would not have been built without subsidies, and heaven knows that not all of them function efficiently. Let us do all we can to get the reports through; I ask Members to support them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As you know, the aim of this directive in terms of taxes is to establish a Community framework which allows Member States to apply a differentiated tax system which favours biofuels. In terms of the content of its directive, the European Commission is proposing a series of measures which, on the whole, are balanced and well-structured.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I believe that we should allow each Member State the greatest possible freedom to set the level of reduction of special taxes, that is, to promote this type of fuel and not to establish a minimum level of tax. I believe that each country of the European Union is going to try over the next few years to achieve the reduction in CO2 emissions we have set for 2020 within the framework of the Kyoto Protocol and, according to their circumstances, some will put more emphasis on the use of biofuels and others on wind power, etc. For this reason, I believe it is essential to make this directive more flexible.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it goes without saying that each Member State is sovereign when it comes to deciding the extent to which in their particular case it pays to lose income via special taxes if that leads to a reduction in CO2 emissions. In the same way, I fear that this will be the only way to move this proposal forward within the Council, where, as you know, there is a great divide on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the policy on interinstitutional information and transparency, in general, I am very much in favour – particularly on issues relating to the environment, with regard to which there is great sensitivity, which seems doubly important – of our all being informed punctually of the development of the various programmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I shall not return to the political argument but, as you know, market forces dictate that, for two major reasons, biofuels cannot currently be developed spontaneously in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The first reason is that the price of fossil fuels does not include external costs generated, firstly, by the use of a non-renewable resource – namely, oil – and secondly, by very high greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason is that oil companies benefit from the advantage of having a century’s worth of industrial experience, which has enabled them to optimise industrial costs on an enormous scale.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore perfectly legitimate for Member States to use differentiated taxation – a formula which we believe to be much fairer than considering cuts in excise duty – taxation that would encourage the competitiveness of fuels of plant origin, which are renewable and do not contribute to the greenhouse effect.</p>
<p class="contents">It would therefore be a matter of transforming excise duty on car fuels into a type of eco-tax that would be higher for fossil fuels than for renewable fuels due to the punitive external costs of fossil fuels.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s tax proposal should help to enable the European Union to meet the objective set out in the Green Paper on the security of energy supply, namely of achieving 20% use of substitute fuels in road transport by the year 2020.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments adopted in the Committee on Agriculture seek to make this Directive more effective, by emphasising that the by-products of biofuels produced in the European Union provide materials that are rich in plant protein which can be used in animal feed; by abolishing the totally arbitrary limit of 50% of the tax differential; by abolishing the time limit of 31 December 2010, since the external costs in the oil sector are permanent; by applying complete tax exemption to fuels used in biofuel production, which is already the case in the manufacture of oil products; by pointing out that cuts in excise duty can only apply to biofuels produced in the European Union, otherwise the European Union would not benefit from either reduced greenhouse gas emissions or from protein fodder crops that are produced as a by-product. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I will speak firstly about the proposal on the promotion of biofuels for transport, the rapporteur for which is Mrs Ayuso, whom I would like to congratulate very warmly on the tremendous work she has done. The fact that five committees have participated in the examination of this proposed directive clearly demonstrates the intrinsically multifunctional nature of biofuels.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in terms of the issue we are debating is as follows: the Council has repeatedly discussed these initiatives, both in the Energy Council and in the Ecofin Council. The reality is that the most important problem, as Mrs Ayuso has pointed out, is the issue of whether the targets are to be indicative or, alternatively, obligatory.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the position of the majority of Member States and of the need – which I believe to be essential – to implement a stable system within a stable framework, essentially from a fiscal point of view, to promote the use of biofuels, the Commission could accept a solution similar to that proposed by the directive on electricity from renewable sources being applied to biofuels. Therefore there would be a review clause which would allow the Commission to propose the reintroduction of mandatory targets in the event that the States of the Union do not manage to comply reasonably with the proposed indicative targets.</p>
<p class="contents">There are now two amendments, No 68 and No 69, which have been signed by various rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, which, on behalf of the Commission, I can accept, because they could clearly bring the positions of Parliament and of the Council closer together. I would also like to say that I am pleased to accept all the amendments which prioritise the environmental factors in the case of biofuels. Some of you have said that there are not so many of them. I would like to say to you that a minimum saving of 45% in terms of CO2 emissions – and for certain biofuels this is much greater, around 80%, and in some cases event higher – seems to me essential.</p>
<p class="contents">I am shortly going to present you with a new proposal to provide a clear framework for the combined production of heat and electricity, that is to say, co-generation, and I would like to point out that we are talking about global improvements in the efficiency of the whole system of 5 or 10% and that the most efficient systems barely achieve a 10% improvement. I would therefore point out that an improvement of 45%, for example, in relation to CO2 emissions, is an element that must be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the environmental aspects, I would like to say that there are certain amendments which we cannot however accept, such as Amendments Nos 1, 5, 6, 25 – someone mentioned this one earlier; but I am sorry, we cannot accept it - 37, 41, 44, 60 and 66, because they would imply an additional burden which we cannot take on or because they would extend this proposal too far.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware that energy consumption in the transport sector is a complex issue. Fundamental improvements in this sector will not result from just one measure. We have presented the proposal on biofuels together with a communication on alternative fuels. The target is 20% of alternative fuels, in general, which covers a much broader scope and, in this regard, I can accept all the amendments which take this approach.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we believe that the amendments which include other fossil fuels in the provisions of this directive do not fall within its scope and we cannot therefore accept Amendments Nos 9, 13, 29 and 30 (in part). Neither can we accept certain amendments which, for example, exclude the use of biofuels in fleets of captive vehicles or which remove content from the proposal, which are Amendments Nos 11, 17, 27, 33, 40, 48, 50, 51, 52, 56, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66 and part of 19. We need to take a decision on energy supply in transport, we cannot delay any further beginning our work to reduce our dependency on oil. Promotion campaigns and declarations of good intentions are useful but they are not sufficient to change the energy situation in Europe. Our proposal to promote biofuels will open a new market for renewable energy technologies and requires your strategic decision in order to take advantage of its potential.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, with regard to the amendment of Directive 98/70/EC, which relates to the characteristics of fuels, and in order to take account of the problem of volatility in the warmer countries – in the countries of the South of the European Union – we are trying to ensure that, in the context of the discussion which is currently taking place at second reading in this Parliament and the modification which is currently being worked on, there is some room for it. In any event, it is clear that this is a problem which has to be confronted, because otherwise, in the countries of the south, there would be certain months of the year in which the use of certain biofuels, specifically ethane, would be simply impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we have the opportunity to agree on a legislative provision which, on some aspects, is less ambitious than the Commission’s original proposal, but which I believe is realistic and which allows us to make progress, provided that – and this brings me to the second proposal – the Council also accepts our proposal on exemption from special taxes for biofuels.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, according to the news reaching us from the Council this issue has also been discussed. It appears that this time the Ministers for Economic and Financial Affairs are prepared to make a real effort to provide significant impetus for the use of biofuels.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to express my gratitude for the rapporteur’s work and insist that the news I have from the Council moves in the right direction and this will therefore allow us to approve the package, the two measures, with targets that are not mandatory, but merely indicative. I believe that this would be a step forward in terms of promoting the use of biofuels.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to this proposal, the Commission can accept several of the amendments. However, it cannot accept Amendments Nos 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24 and 25, because they attempt to impose obligations on the Member States or because they are already covered by the legislation in force, or simply because they are superfluous or inappropriate in the context of this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Parliament’s support for the two proposals with the rewordings and amendments suggested – specifically Amendments Nos 68 and 69 – would represent genuine progress and would speed up the increase in the use of biofuels in the transport sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that tomorrow an agreement will be reached that allows for approval at first reading, which would mean that this initiative could be implemented as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
