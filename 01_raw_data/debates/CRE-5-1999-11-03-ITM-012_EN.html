<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Palacio Vallelersundi (PPE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, this is not the first time that I have taken the floor in this House to speak in my capacity as a citizen and would like to say that, for me, the most important thing is to speak as a citizen on behalf of the citizens. And normally I have spoken on reports which affected the citizen’s main concerns: the issues of the third pillar, that is, justice and internal affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">But today, reminding you of something I said here during the last part-session – after Tampere the European citizens have received the message that Europe is no longer just a market – I would like to say loud and clear that, with this strategic document on the internal market which has been presented to this Parliament and which I am speaking about today, the citizen is going to have a clear idea of the coherence of that market and the fact that the ultimate and main protagonist of that market is the citizen. The ultimate and main protagonist of the internal market is the citizen and the small and medium enterprise.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is there any confusion? It is clear: the internal market is a wonderful achievement, a success story, without any doubt, but it is not perceived as such by the citizens nor small and medium-sized enterprises. Today the impression is still that the internal market is the concern of the multinationals, the major companies, the bureaucrats, Brussels, the technocrats who are far from the concerns of the ordinary people, where many initiatives pile up on top of one another without order or harmony, with no guiding ideas, which, in many cases, are perceived as one more nightmare in the onerous task of living in a developed Community or having a small or medium-sized business.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, Mr President, that it is not only a matter of refuting the idea that everything bad in the Member States comes from Brussels and everything good comes from the governments. It is not only that. It is something that goes much further. Until now, there has been a lot of very good legislation with very clear consequences, but it has been done without a strategy. Now the strategy is here and the importance of this strategy is fundamental if we want the citizen to see that the internal market is not just a matter of legislative acts which relate to the four freedoms, but that it affects them fundamentally.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, congratulations to the Commission and, naturally, we offer our unconditional support to this idea which seems to us, in Parliament, to be very interesting and deserves to be developed. Now for our wishes. Firstly, this Parliament wishes to be closely involved with each and every step in the process which is planned for the internal market, with the selection of strategies, the selection of second level objectives and the selection of specific objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">We also wish to be closely associated with the balance given to legislative and non-legislative actions. We are in favour of non-legislative actions, since often legislation is not necessary given that sometimes “soft law” is enough, but these initiatives should not cause us to lose sight of the fact that we must avoid the false idea of harmonisation and we have to avoid legal insecurity, as well as false expectations about the internal market. The same thing happens with the choice between harmonisation and mutual recognition. We also believe in the need to establish a fair balance and Parliament hopes that its points of view will be fully taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">And with regard to the citizens’ more specific ideas, we are very much in agreement with this general strategic objective, but we want the citizens to understand their rights better and above all to be able to exercise them in a clear and concrete way. We want more efficient and clearer systems for the settlement of disputes which would be better if they were extrajudicial as well as judicial, and all the better if self-regulation policies are created to discipline those markets.</p>
<p class="contents">And, of course, we want the four freedoms to be fulfilled. We want the fourth freedom – the free movement of persons, which stands between the internal market and the policies of justice and internal affairs – to be a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">We want, above all, Commissioner, to insist on legal security and, to that end, we are calling upon you to develop an initiative – which is lacking in your strategy – for the creation of a genuine administrative procedural law for all types of infringement procedures, for all the procedures which involve the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, we want Europe to speak with a single voice with regard to the internal market and to act as a model – why not? – in international relations. And to this end we need a clear legal framework, a legal framework for the internal market, with principles, which radiates into other policies and by means of which the citizens may have a clear idea of what has been done over the last 50 years and which now, through these initiatives, we believe will have an absolutely guaranteed future role. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(NL) </span>Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mrs Palacio very much for giving me the opportunity of enlarging upon the strategic plan for the internal market and also for the preliminary remarks she has made. I would also like to thank her for the congratulations she has extended to the Committee and, indirectly, the services which fall under my remit. </p>
<p class="contents">The action programme is now behind us. What we need next is a strategy. The Commission’s announcement combines a strategic vision for the long term and priorities for action in the short term. The strategy should provide a coherent framework for policy development. The aim is to enhance the internal market’s efficiency, benefiting both citizens and businesses. We need to make all interested parties, citizens, consumers, small and large businesses realise that the internal market is a good thing for them, that because of it, the conditions can be created for a thriving business world and a competitive position which focuses more on the challenges of globalisation. </p>
<p class="contents">Also, and this might be an even bigger challenge, we need to convince the consumer that the internal market opens up a wider range of goods and services at lower prices without putting safety and quality at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">The integration of fifteen national markets required a new legal framework, a framework which is supported by nearly 1,500 directives at present. This work is on-going. There will always be new decisions. A number of important measures are currently being discussed by this Parliament, for example regarding e-commerce. Your question, Mrs Palacio, highlights, however, quite rightly so far as I am concerned, the increasing significance of measures and initiatives of a non-legislative nature which need to ensure that the agreed rules function well in practice. </p>
<p class="contents">The specific actions are not static or long-term. They will be reviewed annually and replaced as soon as they reach completion. It is essential that Parliament is involved in this revision in the capacity of co-legislator. Actions will be adapted and adjusted largely on the basis of the scoreboard of the internal market which is compiled twice-yearly by the Commission and also on the basis of the Cardiff report on the operation of product and capital markets. </p>
<p class="contents">Also, the Council’s conclusions concerning the Cardiff report, with regard to which agreement will be reached during the Internal Market Council of February or March, will make a huge contribution. Input from Parliament running alongside this would be ideal. Admittedly, the deadlines are short. </p>
<p class="contents">The Cardiff report will be published in mid-January. The Commission will need to table its proposals for new specific actions by April. But I am convinced that your institutionalists are up to the task. </p>
<p class="contents">Measures of a non-legislative nature encompass a wide range of activities. There will be areas where the Community, invariably the Commission, will be in the forward line and three elements, by way of example, will prove to be useful in this. </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the dialogue with Europe’s citizens and industry which provides information on the precise way in which rights can be exercised. Secondly, simplification. Initiatives, such as SLIM and the <span class="italic">business test panel</span> are intended to lighten the administrative load for industry. Thirdly, promoting a common European administrative culture with high levels of services for the European citizen. We need to encourage national officials to exchange good practices and solve problems swiftly and informally, thus obviating the need for legal remedies. </p>
<p class="contents">The position of Parliament which is, of course, aware of the needs among citizens and within industry, is essential. I would like to emphasise this point. I promise that I will inform Parliament, maybe through its committees, of the development of this type of initiatives right from the start. </p>
<p class="contents">Another form of non-legislative measures which can underpin and reinforce the operation of the legal framework is self-regulation or, better still, an approach in which regulation and self-regulation are integrated whereby many aspects are laid down in the legislation and alongside this, many groups of interested parties offer solutions upon joint consultation. </p>
<p class="contents">It is only starting to dawn on us what scope this approach gives us in the fast-moving area of e-commerce, for example, with regard to on-line complaints procedures. It cannot be left to the legislator, the Union or the individual Member State to deal with these issues. We have to join forces with those who have most involvement: consumers and industry. </p>
<p class="contents">Parliament is ideally positioned to initiate the discussion on initiatives of this kind, probably mainly to highlight the concern of the ordinary citizen whose voice is not always heard in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the new institutional equilibrium established by the Treaty of Amsterdam, requires that Parliament, the Council and the Commission cooperate in the field of legislation. I hope that the strategy for the internal market will allow us the opportunity to extend this cooperation to the preliminary stage when the priorities for action will be established and to the implementing stage when it is to be ensured that rules function fully. </p>
<p class="contents">I herewith conclude my response to the question raised by Mrs Palacio. Mr President, perhaps you will allow me to say a few words more at the end of the interventions to complete my contribution to this debate. Thank you for your time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although it is a very general paper, it is still important. The internal market itself is a wonderful thing, and has enabled us to make a lot of progress in Europe but, as Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi said earlier, it has not been such a success with consumers and the public as it should have been. That is why there really is scope for improvement in our internal market policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I consider it to be very important – and this is also made clear in a motion for a resolution which we have submitted today – that in future, internal market legislation should be more coherent than it has been in the past. In my experience over the last five years in this House, the approach adopted has, unfortunately, always been a rather piecemeal one, failing to recognise links with other legislative issues. In my experience this has also applied, particularly so in fact, to consumer protection legislation, where there have very often indeed been discrepancies between various directives, between various pieces of legislation at European level. For instance, this applies to specific cancellation deadlines and periods of protection for consumers: these have frequently been different. In some cases there are deadlines or periods of seven working days, and in others just seven days. In the end nobody knows where they stand any more. This is just one example of a lack of consistency where more needs to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, I believe that it was a mistake that at the beginning of the last parliamentary term the old Commission did not continue with the work on a European Contract Law – which Mr Lando and his commission had begun – despite the fact that Parliament had made funds available for this.</p>
<p class="contents">We very often have a problem with internal market legislation these days in that there is no framework, no common structure for legislation. I think that a process of rational, scientific advance preparation would have helped to ensure far more coherent internal market legislation today. I therefore very much welcome the fact that the Commission has addressed the issue of coherence in its paper. Commissioner Bolkestein drew attention to the need for this at the joint meeting of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in Strasbourg.</p>
<p class="contents">I also feel that the special attention being paid to improvements in judicial cooperation is extremely important. Without better judicial cooperation, and if consumers are unable to have their rights guaranteed within the internal market, the internal market loses half its potential value.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not enthusiastic about everything in this paper and in the motion for a resolution before us today. For example, let us take the case of the requirement in the paper that a package leaflet should in future be used to remind consumers of their rights. I think that is rubbish, to put it mildly! There is a big difference between going into a chemist’s and buying a medicine there, with a full explanation of any risks, and simply buying a normal product on the market. I do not think it makes sense to explain every consumer’s rights in a package leaflet.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to make a few comments about the amendments tabled on this motion for a resolution. The Socialist amendments are largely unacceptable to the PPE Group, in some cases purely and simply because they are very Socialist! Amendment Nos 7 and 8 are just two examples of this. I think that not even Gerhard Schröder or Tony Blair would be very enthusiastic about these amendments. Neither are we!</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, there are also any number of amendments that look reasonable at first sight, but which we actually consider to be out of place in this paper on internal market strategy, as they relate to social issues and should be dealt with elsewhere. For that reason, we will not be voting for those amendments either.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me say something about that old chestnut “Do we want more harmonisation or do we want mutual recognition?” You really have to answer that question on a case-by-case basis. The principle of mutual recognition often has advantages. But in cases where it is no longer practical because the systems are just too different, the only way forward is then harmonisation. So it is not possible to settle this issue as a matter of general principle – a decision really has to be made in each individual case depending on what is at stake.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe, therefore, that we should be all the more grateful to the Commission for not treating the internal market like an old hat that just has to have a few dents knocked out now and again, but rather as a project that constantly requires new political initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, I welcome the Commission communication on the European internal market which we have before us. I also consider that the four strategic objectives have been very well chosen and the right method has been adopted for evaluating and monitoring them.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I think that I can allow myself a few constructive criticisms. One of these relates to the structure of this communication. I must confess, even though I am by no means a totally inexperienced Member now, that the complexity of this communication, with its strategic objectives, operational objectives, target projects, legislative and non-legislative measures, makes it really hard to follow and to grasp what the Commission is trying to convey to us. I hope that the European citizens whom the whole thing is ultimately intended to help can make more sense of it.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that the Commission is in places too polite when it comes to identifying obstacles standing in the way of the internal market today. It seems to me that the Member States’ responsibility should be spelt out more clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication also fails to address the system under which the European Parliament is tied in with the procedures and the tight time framework of the so-called annual cycle, to ensure that Parliament’s rights are fully respected. In this case it seems that the schedule is dictated more by the Council’s timetable. I also hope that the procedure under which we have had to consider this particular communication here in Parliament is not to be a model for future procedure. I say that, Mr Lehne, because it is precisely on account of this procedure that we have not had an opportunity to discuss amendments in committee, and that we have had to follow a procedure not at all typical of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we should pay more attention to the fact that the internal market and other EU policies have, to some extent, led to developments which the public regard as absurd or off-putting. Some product components are nowadays transported thousands of kilometres across Europe, only for some of them then to be returned to their country of origin. Not only are significant transport costs incurred, but there is something wrong about this whole system, for example with the export refund system or the marking of regional origin system.</p>
<p class="contents">If, in this day and age, the very same pesticide attracts 20% value added tax in one Member State and just 3% in another, whilst fully complying with the sixth directive on value added tax, something is obviously wrong! We should not wait for the great day of fiscal harmonisation to dawn, we should do something about this with all haste. I am presenting this as evidence that we urgently need a new strategy for the internal market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Broadly speaking, we can welcome it as evidenced by the fact that we have not tabled any amendments. We seem to be moving on with the internal market, hopefully to a position where we will get an internal market that functions properly and fairly for all our citizens and businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight two challenges to the perfection of the internal market. The first is striking a proper balance between a quest for harmonisation and respect for the subsidiarity principle. I wish to draw attention to this in relation to the ultra-peripheral regions of the Union whose status has now been specifically recognised by Article 299 of the Treaty. Our group will seek to support an inclusion of an amendment to the motion endorsing this.</p>
<p class="contents">The second and perhaps bigger challenge is that of the new technologies, the advent of e-commerce. We have the biggest opportunity ever to make the single market a reality to many sole traders and SMEs in our Member States who may not previously have thought of selling outside their own immediate locality. However, this commercial revolution in the way we do business will also require a revolution in our legal thinking. As a lawyer I know that my profession is not particularly known for being revolutionary. The systems of commercial and civil law that exist across our Member States were largely constructed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a response to industrial and commercial changes in those centuries. We need our own new responses for the 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents">I have raised, as have other colleagues, our fears about the combined contents of the Framework E-Commerce Directive and the revision to the Brussels and Lugano Conventions. There are fears that e-commerce may be strangled at birth by regulations which potentially expose traders to 15 different European legal jurisdictions whilst at the same time the very same regulations could fail to really give our citizens easy or affordable access to justice. The old conventions and legal approaches need to be subject to some new and imaginative thinking if we are really to unleash the potential of e-commerce. Some have suggested a new <span class="italic">lex mercatoria</span>. Maybe it should be <span class="italic">e-lex</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">It is equally true, given the question tabled by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, that Parliament needs to be fully involved in this process. With new legislative proposals, we should not be pushed to provide opinions and reports at breakneck speed which allow us little time for thought and consultation with interest groups and citizens. Whether it be regulation by that way or by means of so-called new soft-law methods, again Parliament needs to be fully and properly engaged in the process.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no room for fudge or lack of clarity. The new commerce will need a framework that provides certainty both for consumer and trader alike. We have challenging times ahead. Give this House the time and mechanisms which will allow us to respond in a way that meets not only the expectations of Europe’s citizens but also of those in the global marketplace who are waiting for us to take a lead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thanks also to my colleague Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi for having made such an excellent job of putting together thoughts in a motion for a resolution on this strategy. We are very happy with that but we will suggest one amendment: to clarify the position of artists in the Community, in particular in the areas of freedom of movement, establishment and taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">In the main paper we are particularly attracted – as are others – by the emphasis on the need for a coherent approach to Internet regulation and e-commerce; also, intellectual property, distance selling and data protection – taking them all together in order to protect consumer rights and ensure adequate rules of viability. Naturally, in our group, we want to see that the achievement of the internal market involves a balance – as you said yourself, Commissioner – between market freedom and the need to protect the environment, consumer health and consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to mention our sense – like yours – that the ordinary citizens need to see an increase in the speed and efficiency of infringement proceedings against defaulting Member States where the rights of European Union citizens exercised within the internal market are impinged upon or denied.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very upset, as a member of the academic profession, to see yet again the issue of foreign language lecturers in Italian universities coming forward without yet a resolution after eleven years, after three judgments in favour of the rights of these ordinary citizens seeking to exercise freedom of movement, seeking to take advantage of that fundamental principle of the Union and the internal market of no discrimination on nationality grounds. It really is disgraceful that this issue still remains open. I hope that the Internal Market Commissioner and his colleagues will make it their urgent business to bring this to an end. The Commissioner has shown himself wise and far-sighted in his strategy document. I trust and am sure he will show himself no less resolute in pressing home cases which have to be brought to a conclusion speedily.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Peijs (PPE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the internal market idea is based on doing business in a competitive environment without confines where the same rules apply for everyone: a level playing field. But I increasingly notice that the interpretation and enforcement of legislation in the internal market differs quite dramatically from country to country. One country enforces nothing at all, whilst in another country enforcement weighs very heavily on industry. Even the understanding of the outcome which needs to be achieved by means of a certain law can be totally different from country to country. </p>
<p class="contents">I can list many examples: the fresh meat directive, the liberalisation of telecom, environmental directives or the directive concerning slaughterhouses. Customs offices too interpret EU decisions completely differently. What can be done in one country is completely inconceivable in another. A source of discrepancies are the minimum and maximum harmonisations. On account of the uniform outcome, I would prefer maximum harmonisations in future, such as in the case of the directive on distance selling or even mutual recognition. Any other approach will ultimately lead to a situation which covers so many variations that it will appear as if there has never been an internal market. </p>
<p class="contents">The postal services directive will prove my point. In the Netherlands, we naively believe that the directive is one on liberalisation. This is completely refuted by the French Secretary of State. The aim of the directive is to protect public property. This will lead to a situation where the Dutch postal services will be extremely vulnerable to take-overs but the money involved will be earned in a monopoly. Indeed, Commissioner Monti stated that it has never been verified whether the ban on cross-subsidy is observed when making purchases. There can be very harsh penalties indeed for Member States and companies if European legislation is observed. Fair competition is difficult, especially if one time-sharing company observes the legislation but another one does not, for example, and nothing is done about it. </p>
<p class="contents">Since this would obviously create an excessive amount of work for the Court of Justice, the Commission is planning to grant national judges power to rule on exemptions within the framework of article 85, para. 3. I can assure you, Commissioner, that judges in Naples and Frankfurt will interpret the article very differently indeed. </p>
<p class="contents">I believe in the internal market, but I am very concerned because I am convinced that the market is threatened in its very core by a lack of uniform enforcement. There are too many different transpositions of directives, and as you also point out in your strategy, too many cases of non-transposition and non-enforcement.</p>
<p class="contents">You mentioned the SLIM programme, but Commissioner, the SLIM programme is completely ineffectual. Simplified old legislation has a discouraging effect on companies which already comply with old legislation. And what you do is to reward companies which never comply with legislation. I do not think that we could subscribe to this. Besides, SLIM does not even work in itself. Enforcement is the priority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In a short space of time, the Commission and Commissioner Bolkestein have presented us with this communication on a strategy for the European internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, as Mrs Wallis has highlighted, the problem is that we are acting at breakneck speed, perhaps because we have little time and we have to move quickly. Clearly, the Commission has had little time to draw up this document, and we have had even less time. Tomorrow we are going to vote on a motion for a resolution. I believe that the Socialist Group will vote in favour of it, but it has introduced a series of amendments which, as you might expect, reflect socialist thinking.</p>
<p class="contents">And here I would like to point out to Mr Lehne that, without doubt, he has not read the Commission’s strategy if he thinks that social considerations were left out of it, because the strategic objective number 1 which the Commission has set is to improve the quality of life of our citizens. And within this strategic objective, we should achieve, amongst the operational objectives, the promotion of employment and ensure the coordination of social protection and the broad protection of our citizens’ rights. Therefore, the socialist amendments aim to fill this particular gap.</p>
<p class="contents">And among the socialist amendments, there is one, which Mrs Wallis highlighted, which points out the special position of the outermost regions, which are totally separated from Community territory, a long way from it and which therefore, in the application of Community law, in accordance with the new article 299.2 of the Treaty, cannot be subject to the same regulations which are in force in the internal market in continental Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I totally agree with Mr MacCormick’s observations on the situation of artists, which would have to extend to the whole field of intellectual creation, which suffers from a deficit within the European Community, especially in the field of external competition, and I also agree with his observation concerning the need to guarantee the free movement and free practice of the intellectual profession within the European Community.</p>
<p class="contents">And I would also like to point out that Mrs Peijs is very right to say that one of the difficulties which we have today in the Community field is that Community law is interpreted and applied in a different way in each of the fifteen Member States. The problem is that the Community has to legislate because, if it does not legislate, the States will legislate for it. At the moment, we have a broad set of Community regulations, fifteen sets of national regulations and in many cases, for example in the federal, or almost federal, States, many more. If the Community does not regulate, if the Community does not provide a legal framework, this will continue along the worst lines possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope, therefore, that after this first Commission communication, the Commission will present Parliament with a strategic programme, with the necessary legislative package, with more time for the Commission and more time for Parliament, but I also hope that, during this legislature, the internal market will become a reality and that, in becoming a reality, it will do so to the benefit of the citizens and the workers and that it will allow for the continued consolidation of this European social model, which I would say at the moment is the envy of those countries which do not belong to the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The strategic document which has been submitted to us certainly represents an important change in the single market and extends and consolidates the idea of a single market which is one of the main cornerstones of the construction of Europe. Among other things, it gives us a glimpse of a series of scenarios where the single market is certainly also the bearer of new freedoms and opportunities for the citizens. </p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to dwell on some legal subjects which have already been dealt with sufficiently by Mr Lehne and Mrs Palacio. I would instead like to talk about some political matters which have not yet been fully addressed by the document but which, I am sure, will be the subject of a debate in Parliament, because it is through these matters that the idea of Europe is developing. Firstly, there is the question of how we are going to create a real single market where the States are currently tending to implement protectionist measures – we have seen some cases, even recently and how the Commission intends to make the best use of the infringement procedure, speeding it up and encouraging the citizens and their associations to report the breaches of Community law which occur daily in the various Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">A second area is the use of new technologies. The European Union must provide a direct legal framework to allow the free movement and free provision of services and avoid conflicts and obstacles to free movement caused by too great a divergence in the legislation of the various countries of the Community. The directive on electronic signatures will definitely be followed by directives on e-commerce and copyright in the information society and on consumer protection in distance selling of financial products and other kinds of products. All the European institutions will have to be vigilant so that consistency of the common legal institutions is guaranteed. In these areas, a fair balance between public regulation and self-regulation of those concerned will allow the market to function without infringing citizens’ or consumers’ rights. Besides, these new technologies require consumers’ trust in order to be fully used. Giving your credit card details must not and cannot involve a risk. </p>
<p class="contents">Now we come to a third subject: how the Commission intends to act in the progressive extension of the single market to the applicant states. This must happen without calling into question the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> and guaranteeing the albeit delicate balance currently in place. Applicant states’ national markets must become integrated into the Community market smoothly, and it will therefore be necessary to provide for any transitional measures which may be necessary where these countries are not yet ready. Our goal, though, must be to help them be prepared right from the first day of accession. </p>
<p class="contents">One final subject: what does this document mean for international economic relations, which will soon have a crucial time in the Millennium Round. We are living through a historic time which has no precedent and which calls for a far-reaching ability to adapt to changes, in order to prevent the European model leaving the international arena with its tail between its legs. Ours is the time of interdependence. Different aspects of economic and social life at a global level are entwined together and with their respective interests. Interdependence requires that diversities are taken into account, where possible, in the transition from plurality to unity, and it must be regulated by maintaining a balance in the relationship between the identities, diversities and co-existence of the models. The inevitable confrontation with diversity requires the ability to adapt one’s own identity as far as is necessary in order to be able to compete on an equal footing with others. </p>
<p class="contents">So, in the sectors concerned with international trade, we are assessing how the mutual influence of systems on a global level is increasing with every passing day. We know that the European model has already been taken as the basis of the transatlantic dialogue. We must not allow our efforts to let us be conditioned by other models that are not our own.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This consideration obliges us to highlight its positive aspects and, to a certain extent, avoid any negative comment. It would be unjust, therefore, to describe the document as unambitious, but it would nevertheless have been justifiable to level this criticism at the document if it had been carried out by a Commission which had been in action for longer.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation cannot hide the fact however that this is really simply a document of intentions, which we take note of. Meanwhile, we will wait to see whether these intentions become concrete measures, commitments which involve a time scale for their implementation. Then, and only then will we be able to make a more accurate judgement of the Commission’s intentions.</p>
<p class="contents">Amongst the aspects which warrant our special approval, is that of protecting consumer interests. If anybody should benefit from the construction of the internal market, it is the consumer, that is, all of the citizens. And in this respect, Commissioner, there is a phrase in the communication which worries us. It says literally that “a more intense trade in goods and services between the Member States could lead to additional risks to the consumer”. This phrase raises the question of the view of consumer protection as an inevitable requirement to impede the free movement of goods, within the meaning of the judgement on Dassonville, Cassis de Dijon etc. In other words it leads us to the principle of mutual recognition, which seems to be very dear to Mr Bolkestein.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like my position to be very clear. Mutual recognition is a principle which was important in preventing barriers to the free movement of goods, but it is only partially valid for the construction of the internal market in the absence of harmonised legislation. In order to move forward with the internal market, it will be necessary to insist on the principle of harmonisation. Once legislation in the field of consumer protection is harmonised, I would not be in a position to make such a statement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The most welcome thing about it is a recognition by the Commission that we are moving now into an entirely new and different phase of the development of the single market from any that we have seen before. The first point that I want to make echoes what a number of colleagues have said, namely that this strategy has to be responsive and flexible.</p>
<p class="contents">The corporate by-word now is about reinventing corporations, reinventing what we do. And of course the sort of new technologies available to businesses and consumers that many of us have referred to tonight are going to be the engine for making the single market develop even more quickly. Really the question I pose to the Commission tonight is whether this strategy is not in fact not ambitious enough. I really echo what my Socialist colleague said a bit earlier because we have to consider the newly emerging electronic technologies as being the engine of creating the single market. One of the things this strategy has to do is to really encourage businesses and consumers to move and adopt the new electronic commercial technologies as soon as possible because of themselves they will be what creates this single market in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I remind you, ladies and gentlemen, in reflecting on that, that as empowered consumers start to adopt this technology, that many of the barriers that are put in their way at the moment, the legislation for example on commercial communications, on the way that goods can be presented to customers, are going to become redundant. The messages that come directly to people into their homes are not going to be subject to the extraordinary array of diverse and intrusive in many cases regulations affecting commercial communications in the European Union at the moment. In future we must trust consumers, we must give them information, we must empower to use the information at their disposal and they will be the people that will bring about this single market.</p>
<p class="contents">There will be new generations of new small businesses coming into existence to exploit and develop that technology that will be there to service these consumers. The second point that we must consider is encouraging the development of these new businesses, to encourage new entrepreneurs, to make sure that the traditional ideas of the European social model that Mr Medina referred to earlier do not in fact inhibit the development of making Europe the place that is going to have the sort of energy and excitement that we see currently in the United States in adopting these new technologies. So, in welcoming this, I ask the Commission to think about the next step forward, to encourage new technologies and encourage consumers and businesses to use them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, many thanks for allowing me to speak for the second time this evening. I would especially like to thank the Members of this Parliament who have postulated their ideas this evening, as well as their criticisms regarding the document which is tabled for discussion this evening. </p>
<p class="contents">I will try to respond to a few points in more detail. I will probably not be able to deal with all the points in detail, but I would like to stress, for the benefit of the Members of this Parliament, that both my colleagues and I have carefully taken note of all the points brought forward and I would like to underline that we will make every effort to incorporate the ideas and thoughts prevailing in Parliament into the document at issue this evening. </p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank the MEPs who have expressed words of appreciation for the Commission and who have welcomed this new strategy for the internal market. The Commission is very grateful. The Commission is new in this legislature. We have tried our best to work as fast as possible to submit this document to Parliament, thus enabling Parliament to give its opinion at the earliest opportunity. </p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, criticism can be levelled at many points and this is what some representatives did. But I do not agree, on the other hand, with Mr Medina Ortega, who remarked that the internal market should become a reality to benefit all European citizens. The internal market is a reality. The internal market exists and all European citizens benefit greatly from this in the form of low inflation, low pricing and the large choice of goods and services which they want to buy. In other words, I would like to say to Mr Medina Ortega: the internal market is a reality which benefits everyone, especially the consumer, albeit that they may not be sufficiently aware of this. As far as this is concerned, it is up to both the Commission and the MEPs to make this even clearer to these consumers. </p>
<p class="contents">A number of representatives, not least Mrs Palacio, have mentioned what is termed these days as “soft law”. In other words, these are not legislative instruments but instruments which relate to the use of the mutual acceptance of standards with regard to issues such as “peer group pressure” and to the adoption of the best working methods from other Member States. This is a key element of this communication. We are indeed making efforts to this effect and, as such, we are drawing on the original methods used to complete the internal market, namely the 1992 project by Lord Cockfield. There are indeed many advantages to the mutual recognition of standards and we would like to continue in the same vein. </p>
<p class="contents">It is definitely the case that there is a difference between harmonisation and this mutual recognition of standards. As far as this is concerned, I share Mr Lehne’s view of assessing on a case-by-case basis whether harmonisation or mutual recognition of standards should be applied. Although it is something that has to be assessed case by case, I would like to stress – the proposed resolution, in fact, deals with this in one of the sections – the great importance of the mutual recognition of standards because they work faster, are more flexible in this fast-changing world and because they make sure they meet the requirement of subsidiarity. This is something Mrs Wallis remarked on. I could not agree more. The right balance needs to be struck, of course, between harmonisation on the one hand and the principle of subsidiarity on the other. I think that the mutual recognition of standards meets this requirement. </p>
<p class="contents">According to Mrs Berger, the structure of the document was somewhat chaotic. I am pleased that Mr MacCormick claimed the opposite. After all, he spoke in English about a “clear and rational document”. These are, of course, two conflicting opinions. My own opinion is that the document is well-organised. There are four strategic objectives, each of which is split up into three, four, five or six operational objectives. And then, of course, there are still those objectives which require a practical plan of implementation. So with the best will in the world, I cannot see why Mrs Berger claims that the structure of the document is chaotic. </p>
<p class="contents">She does seem to cut ice when she advocates involvement of the European Parliament in the annual cycle set out in the document. This to my mind is a very important point. I would also like to stress that, every year at the appropriate time for this, the Commission will gladly listen to the remarks and ideas put forward by the European Parliament when, in the course of its annual cycle, it can once again examine the actual target actions close-up and substantiate them further. </p>
<p class="contents">We find the involvement of the European Parliament a matter of the greatest importance. This is not only because in the European constitution, Council, European Parliament and the Commission form the three corners of the triangle which is to decide on all of this in a balanced way, but also because the representative body of the people that is gathered here is clearly best suited to interpret the opinions of Europe’s citizens, which is what it is all about, thus enabling the Commission to draw the right conclusions. I would, therefore, like to impress on Mrs Berger and other Members of this representative body that we will listen very carefully to the opinions expressed by Parliament when, in the future, they are put forward once or maybe twice a year or through contact on a smaller scale with the Commission. </p>
<p class="contents">I would, furthermore, like to respond to the remarks made by Mr MacCormick on artists. I recognise that Mr MacCormick has a valid point when he highlights the situation of travelling artists within a European context – i.e. those working in different countries such as, for example a concert pianist or a dance group – when he highlights the predicament of those who create and propagate the arts. I myself would like to make an effort to raise the issue of the freedom of movement within the European Union but also to provide an improved basis for taxation. But, as I am sure Mr MacCormick will agree, this is not easy. There is no European income tax at the moment and it is not likely that there will be any in the foreseeable future. This might be a good thing but, in any event, I share Mr MacCormick’s opinion that the tax situations of artists working in the different Member States require attention and I am quite prepared to look into any objective suggestions made. </p>
<p class="contents">As for lecturers at Italian universities of non-Italian nationality, I can inform Mr MacCormick that it so happens that I signed a letter on this matter today, addressed to an MEP who had lodged the same complaint. As far as this issue is concerned, we are aware and it is in hand. </p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Peijs distinguished between minimum and maximum harmonisation. She stated that she much prefers maximum harmonisation. I agree, in principle, with Mrs Peijs. Ideally, we should agree on a maximum level of harmonisation throughout the Union and each country should observe this. There is, of course, room for defensible exceptions to the general principle. Think, for example, of the social standards which are higher in some countries than in others. If we consider that some standards to safeguard, defend and protect the environment are higher and more stringent in some countries than in others, then surely we will not prevent these countries from exceeding the generally accepted standard. Indeed, my starting point coincides with that of Mrs Peijs. I too favour maximum standards, but we cannot prevent countries from going beyond the generally accepted standard in some areas. As far as this is concerned, I think we need to try to strike the right balance between the internal market on the one hand and requirements with regard to the environment or social standards which exceed the general norm on the other. </p>
<p class="contents">She also spoke about the postal services directive, which is a very important point. My department and, indeed, I myself, are examining how we can move this issue along. It may be premature to give details at this stage but I do agree with Mrs Peijs when she says that it is by no means an ideal situation that companies are bought by certain postal services which have a monopoly position, in other words that some companies are bought by those bringing about a monopoly-like situation. We do not welcome monopolies being used to purchase companies which are in the same line of business but which are independent. Because then this is a clear indication that the liberalisation of postal services has not gone far enough, or at least that this liberalisation is not applied correctly by some postal companies. We have to be very mindful of this because once again, we cannot accept this and this is also one of the reasons that I hope, in the not too distant future, to propose further ideas on how the postal directive can be further detailed. </p>
<p class="contents">I will skip over Mrs Peijs’ observations on the decentralisation of decisions in terms of competition, but not because I do not want to discuss them. In the dim and distant past, I myself have been involved in policies on competition in the capacity of minister in the Dutch government. Not wishing, however, to encroach too much on the remit of my colleague, Mr Monti, I will not go into this issue any further. </p>
<p class="contents">She closed her intervention with the words “enforcement is the priority”. I agree with Mrs Peijs on that score. To draft a policy is one thing, to enforce it is quite another. This is, of course, also one of the key points of this document of the new strategy, namely that we acknowledge that legislation has been laid down in broad terms but that it is now a matter of implementation, enforcement and monitoring this implementation, so as to enable the Commission to lend its support to the correct implementation of provisions of the internal market by means of infringement procedures. </p>
<p class="contents">My penultimate remark concerns an observation made by Mr Berenguer Fuster, where he states that consumer protection should not jeopardise the internal market. The document that we submitted and that is being discussed this evening, attempts in fact, in the first strategic objective, to create a balance between the internal market on the one hand and the protection of consumer and environment interests on the other. We have made this attempt and hope that we have succeeded to some extent in creating this balance and hence in preventing the protection of consumer interests from jeopardising the internal market. Because the internal market, of course, is also there for the manufacturer and industry although it mainly serves the consumer. In other words, if consumer protection were to be detrimental to the internal market, we would shoot ourselves in the foot and this is not what we want. And I believe that is not what the Members of this Parliament want either. </p>
<p class="contents">To finish off, Mr President, I really valued the observation made by Mr Harbour. I know that Mr Harbour applauds the document on strategy with regard to the internal market. I would also like to thank him for attending last Friday’s hearing. In fact, Mrs Palacio gave a very valuable general introduction to that end and I would like to thank her too. Mr Harbour stated that the internal market should mainly be <span class="italic">responsive and flexible</span>, in other words should accommodate the requirements of the consumers and of the citizens of the country in question and should also be flexible. I could not agree more. We live in a world which changes at high-speed. The new electronic gadgets used in business are well-known, are gaining in popularity and create their own problems. The Commission should react to this. Will you allow me to impress on Mr Harbour and, in fact, all Members of this Parliament that it is the ambition of this Commission to be <span class="italic">responsive and flexible</span>, so that we can indeed, bearing in mind consumer interests, meet the needs at the time as flexibly as possible. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I hope I have not spoken for too long. I thank you for your patience and that of the Members. I would also like to thank them for their attention. It would be a pleasure, should opportunity allow, to have a further exchange of ideas with this Parliament on this important topic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
