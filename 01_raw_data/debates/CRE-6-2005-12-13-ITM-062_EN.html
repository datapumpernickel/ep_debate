It aims to protect the rights of passengers when travelling by air and the major principle of our Community policy on non-discrimination against disabled people and those with reduced mobility.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the European Parliament, particularly your rapporteur, Mr Evans, who cooperated with the Council and the Commission to facilitate the speedy adoption of this proposal. This is not the only initiative that aims to improve protection for people with reduced mobility in the transport sector: the Commission has made a commitment to look into the need to improve and guarantee these same rights in other modes of transport. People with reduced mobility must be guaranteed appropriate assistance, regardless of where they are going, and regardless of what mode of transport they are using.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already put forward a proposal for rail passengers and I intend to do the same for people with reduced mobility who use maritime transport and international coach transport. I think, Mr Twigg, ladies and gentlemen, that in 2005 we really have made progress to the benefit of all people with reduced mobility, thus helping them to truly feel part of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal before you today meets this objective of non-discrimination. It aims to set up ways of prohibiting operators from unreasonably refusing to transport people with reduced mobility by denying them the assistance they need. In this proposal, to be presented on 16 February, the Commission is pursuing four aims: there must be no discrimination against people with disabilities or reduced mobility; they must not be directly charged for the assistance they receive; this assistance must comply with a set of minimum standards and must be seamless; and responsibility for providing such assistance must be given to those best able to provide it – airports and airlines.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve these aims, assistance on the ground, around and within airports, remains the responsibility of the airports, while the air carriers must be obliged to provide assistance on board aircraft.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, assistance for people with reduced mobility must not be watered down. It must be organised by a single body responsible for ensuring that it is applied comprehensively, consistently and effectively. In terms of concrete implementation, the proposal includes all the flexibility needed to design appropriate solutions for the airports and airlines.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council agreed on a general approach to this proposal in October. Thanks to Parliament’s constructive contribution, we hope that this important text can be adopted quickly, so as to provide disabled people and those with reduced mobility with the real possibility of assistance, throughout Europe. That demonstrates the importance of this text in terms of society and solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank you in advance, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, for acting to ensure that we can give this advance as a gift – if I may put it that way during this festive season – to all disabled or elderly people and to everyone with reduced mobility, so that they can make use of all our modes of transport, just like able-bodied people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This regulation, on the rights of disabled people and those with reduced mobility when travelling by air, will make a real improvement to the lives of those members of our Community, by giving them the security to take full advantage of the opportunities for air travel – for business and leisure – which have so transformed our world in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly congratulate Mr Evans, the rapporteur, for his hard work and dedication in steering this dossier so fluently along its legislative path. It is a fine example of how, when a legislative proposal offers real and tangible benefits to the citizens of the Community, the institutions can collaborate effectively to ensure that these benefits are delivered in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first time, this regulation sets out in clear terms what assistance disabled persons and those with reduced mobility are legally entitled to expect from airports and airlines and under what conditions. By placing a clear responsibility on airport managing bodies to organise the necessary assistance for disabled passengers from the time they arrive at the airport until they board the plane, the regulation will give disabled persons travelling by air the assurance that their needs will be met seamlessly by one responsible body, backed by the force of European law.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, many airports and airlines already provide excellent services to disabled people and are rightly proud of their achievements in this area. The regulation recognises that fact by explicitly providing that airport managing bodies may, while retaining their overall legal responsibility, contract with other bodies, including airlines, to deliver services on the ground. Thus, those airlines that already deliver a high level of service to disabled passengers should be able to secure contracts with the airport managing bodies to enable them to continue to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, I consider that this regulation pulls off the difficult trick of ensuring that disabled people get the legal right to an acceptable standard of service when travelling by air, without placing undue and onerous burdens on the industry that has to provide these services.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate all concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like sincerely to thank the shadows, the Parliament and Group staff, my own staff, the Commission, the various disabled organisations and aviation groups with which I have been privileged to work and the UK Presidency, without whose sterling efforts my anticipated historic first reading agreement would not have been possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Too many people – the elderly or those with disabilities – complain of being neglected or, worse still, maltreated at Europe’s airports. Fundamental rights for disabled passengers when travelling by air ought to be something we take for granted. However, the reality can be very different. One example is Ryanair and the insulting manner in which it treats disabled passengers. It is probably the best-publicised culprit, but there are plenty of others and not just the low-cost carriers.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, you and I were speaking recently about your issues with Lufthansa; I have had other issues with Iberia, to name but two. Only yesterday, on my flight to Strasbourg, Air France blamed the one disabled passenger for the one-hour delay in boarding people. Of course, against this, as Mr Twigg has said, many people’s experiences are positive, and many airlines and airports offer a good service.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it was against a background of complaints and a service which can at best be described as patchy that, earlier this year, as the Commissioner said, his Commission presented proposals for improving the rights of persons of reduced mobility, to which, despite some opposition early on, I am very pleased we have now been able to add disabled people.</p>
<p class="contents">During its passage through the European Parliament I have also been pleased to be able to present other improvements. Most importantly, ensuring that the proposal is for a seamless service for passengers, from any point of arrival at any of the airports in the European Union, to destinations – including transfers, which are often the most traumatic experiences for people.</p>
<p class="contents">At my suggestion, the committee also amended the Commission text to give airports the overall responsibility for ensuring an efficient and effective service with, as Mr Twigg again mentioned, the ability to contract it out if they so wish.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also very pleased to be able to amend the proposal to allow guide dogs or service dogs on long-haul flights, because I am advised that the owners of those dogs are in the best position to judge how long a flight the animal can cope with.</p>
<p class="contents">In the report we also requested that planes and airports be better designed in consultation with disabled people’s organisations and that the airport and airline staff be given real disability awareness training. In addition, I think there is a real need for reservation systems, including websites, to be much more user-friendly and effective. The aim is to ensure that people with reduced mobility and disabled passengers enjoy the same rights when travelling by air as you or I, without incurring any additional costs – the costs being spread across every passenger handled by the air carrier and included in the price of the ticket.</p>
<p class="contents">Airline statistics suggest that up to ten million passengers in this category are assisted at Europe’s airports every year. Therefore, it is essential that the guidelines are clear and agreed at European level. It would be pointless if one or a few of the 25 EU Member States had good legislation and the others had poor legislation or none at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Travelling by air is now almost as common as travelling by car, with up to half the population expecting to fly at least once a year. Without this sort of watertight legislation, some airlines will look for loopholes to avoid providing for disabled people and those who need a little extra help at busy airports where the distance from check-in to the boarding gate can be up to a kilometre. Many airlines have made improvements under a voluntary agreement. However, without proper legislation, there will always be some who, by negligence or indifference, ruin the holidays or trips of vulnerable people.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope colleagues will support this proposal, because it is long overdue. It is much anticipated and, above all, it is a good news and positive European story. I repeat my thanks for the incredible endeavour of the UK Presidency, because I know the vast amount of time and effort that has been put into it. I thank the President-in-Office warmly for his presence here tonight at nearly 10.10 p.m. All 25 EU governments and all the major parties in the European Parliament are in support of this package that will be presented. We should be very proud when we vote on this report on Thursday and achieve, as I hope and expect, an agreement at first reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an important regulation for disabled and elderly passengers as it guarantees a series of fundamental rights. Firstly, it enshrines the right to assistance free of charge and prohibits any refusal to allow passengers with reduced mobility to embark. It will put an end to abuse and discrimination. Secondly, it identifies the airport operator as the single point of reference with general service responsibility to which passengers can turn, and will also enable those airlines which have hitherto provided high-quality assistance to continue to do so, on condition that they comply with the standards set out in the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Rules are set for providing uniform assistance for all, irrespective of the size of the airport. Assistance must be guaranteed from the point of arrival outside the airport, not only from the check-in desk as is the case today. Compensation will be payable in the event of loss or damage to wheelchairs and other equipment, and there is provision for mandatory training for staff providing assistance. Information must be available in a form accessible to all and the protection of privacy will be assured. These are fundamental guarantees to protect the right to mobility without discrimination, and it is therefore an important step forward in the defence of human rights, of which the European Parliament is the guarantor. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The unacceptable practice of some airlines of refusing carriage, on cost grounds, to people with disabilities will be impossible in future. There will be comprehensive, uniform rules at European level for the rights of air passengers with disabilities or reduced mobility; which represents great progress. This is a further step towards the passenger rights for all modes of transport that are so important to us. It will also enable us to take due account of demographic development in our countries and of the increasing mobility of the European public. In future, airport operators will bear clear responsibility for the services to be organised. Some airlines have already put such services in place themselves, and any solutions of theirs that function well will continue to be possible, by agreement and subject to contractual rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is no secret that disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility are discriminated against in respect of other passengers, not only whilst booking flight tickets but also when boarding planes. Therefore, I believe that implementation of the new directive will prevent such discrimination. I also believe that by approving this report we will ensure equal travel possibilities for disabled persons and those with reduced mobility and will regulate the provision of such services at the European Union level. Persons with reduced mobility will no longer be groundlessly refused to book a flight or board a plane. Furthermore, specially trained personnel will provide such persons with assistance tailored to their personal needs, and, most importantly, such services will be provided free of charge; the responsibility will lie with a single institution which will ensure that such services are provided continuously and to a high standard.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate Mr Evans and I thank him for the possibility of constructive cooperation. I believe that the compromises achieved will contribute to passing the legal acts at first reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Disabled people and people with reduced mobility have the same rights as the rest of the community to freedom of movement, freedom of choice and non-discrimination. These rights extend to all areas of people’s lives and air transport is no exception.</p>
<p class="contents">All subsequent content stems from this positive principle and we welcome this, not least the extension of the original plans to cover not only those with limited mobility but also people with physical or mental disabilities, something that deserves to be highlighted.</p>
<p class="contents">This extended concept could be more stringent for operators or lead to further costs, but the problem is not the people’s problem, and must not be seen as such, but should be viewed as part of a broader need to ensure accessibility to infrastructure, transport and services, for which fair solutions must be found. Ladies and gentlemen, one does not remove barriers by creating other barriers. We must therefore congratulate the rapporteur on his ability to broker compromises in adopting amendments, for example those relating to the distribution of responsibilities between airports and airlines. The report acknowledges that there are airlines already offering this service to a very high standard, an aspect that often sets them apart from their competitors, and at no extra cost.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I have two more brief remarks. I wish firstly to highlight the attention to detail in the drafting of the proposal; the changes made to the Regulation certainly make it more difficult to practise discrimination. Secondly, I would like to praise the explicit introduction of the principle of transparency in the calculation of attendance rates charged by airports to the airlines, which will ensure proportionality and direct correlation with the actual service provided. To conclude, I welcome this report and congratulate Mr Evans and those who helped him to reach the excellent compromise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In close cooperation with the Commission, which, we must acknowledge, is doing exemplary work in terms of facilitating access for disabled people to all forms of transport — they have already done so in the case of trains, now aircraft, and tomorrow buses — have succeeded in drawing up rigorous legislation, which is demanding but applicable, and suited to the new circumstances of the airports and companies.</p>

We may even be deciding on our own lives, as anyone could be affected – whether it be as a result of an accident or of illness. In fact, we shall probably all be affected; that is to say, as a result of old age. After all, we all want to live to old age. We do not want to be old, however, and certainly not to do without mobility.</p>
<p class="contents">I am confident that we shall succeed in pushing through equal opportunities and non-discrimination for travel, too. We are starting today with air transport, and tomorrow we shall be discussing similar aspects in rail, bus and waterborne transport. I am proud of the European Union for creating – in the shape of this regulation – the first legislation especially for people with disabilities. The proposal provides that an air carrier or tour operator may not refuse to accept a reservation for a flight on the grounds of reduced mobility of the passenger. It does, however, permit certain exceptions. For example, the reservation can be refused if the size of the aircraft or the absence of cabin crew do not permit the carriage of persons with reduced mobility. In that case, however, the person concerned must be offered alternatives.</p>
<p class="contents">The second key point in the proposal after the carriage obligation consists in the establishment of the quality and quantity of high-level assistance. In future, this will also – but not exclusively – be available from the airlines operating out of EU airports. It is good that there is a consensus that the cost of particular services for air passengers with disabilities or reduced mobility must be shared equally by all air passengers. I would ask my fellow Members to support the Evans report tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
