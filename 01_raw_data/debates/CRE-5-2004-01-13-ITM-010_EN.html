<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Varela Suanzes-Carpegna (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Madam President, I would ask you not to count what I am going to say first as speaking time because I would like, on behalf of all my colleagues, to make a slight protest at this situation. I know that it is not your fault, Madam President, but this is an irritating situation because the debate was initially scheduled for the morning, then it was changed to the early afternoon and now it has been left for the night, and this often happens to us with fisheries. I would ask that this never happen again because clearly it entirely breaks up the debate. I am going to speak until 5 p.m., and I hope that you will at least allow the rapporteur time to speak properly, because I do not believe the Commissioner will have time to answer me. He will have to do so at 9 p.m. In any event, the members of the Committee on Fisheries believe that this is not good and we hope that it will not happen to us again in the future. Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="contents">My political group asked for this report because it believes that the Committee on Fisheries should focus all its attention on the study and analysis of certain fisheries, analysing their situation, their functions, their problems and their future. This could be done with various fisheries, but we have decided to begin with tuna fisheries for the simple reason that it is the most globalised species on the planet, both in its extraction and in its processing and marketing. This means that it involves great interests and complex problems at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of tuna there is a very clear inter-relationship between fleet and industry, and the role of the European Union is essential since our market is the world's top market for this species, and our fleet is also the biggest in the world, and tuna represents 60% of total production of canned fish, the European Union currently being – with a production of some 400 000 tonnes of canned tuna – the world’s top producer. This generates a very significant number of jobs – which furthermore is highly localised – in peripheral maritime regions highly dependent on fisheries. For specific data I would refer you to my report.</p>
<p class="contents">Our intention is to provide a technical and political consideration of the whole of the sector, both extractive and processing, to analyse its position within the European Union and the world in order to draw conclusions which we can deliver to the Commission and the Council in order to increase awareness and sensitivity towards this important industry and finally to propose a series of specific measures to improve its defence.</p>
<p class="contents">We have begun by defining the species the report is directed at, focusing essentially on tropical tuna, which constitute 90% of what is processed by the canning industry. We call for the defence of sustainable and responsible fishing, as the very basis for its future. We defend fishing which is respectful of other species, such as dolphins. We therefore support the <span class="italic">Dolphin-Safe</span> labelling of the AIDCP, the intergovernmental body which includes the European Union amongst its members; we call for transparency and clarity for consumers; we condemn illegal fishing – IUU – the flags of convenience which shelter it and we support the regional fisheries organisations and the Commission's role in them, we propose the creation of other new ones and we also request the maintenance and extension of the network of international tuna fishing agreements, given the highly migratory nature of these species and the guarantee that these international fisheries agreements represent for responsible fishing in the face of private agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the consensus reached in the Committee on Fisheries, in which the rapporteur accepted amendments from all political groups and proposed specific compromises, which have been incorporated, as in the case of the support for the amendments from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, demonstrate our genuine interest in supporting fisheries which must be sustainable both ecologically and economically and socially. I thank all the Members for their cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">To greatly summarise the contents of the report, we are calling for assistance for the Community fleet to prevent it from losing competitiveness in the globalised tuna world and we advocate a specific register for this fleet which will not receive aid from a structural point of view following the reform of the fisheries policy. It should be given incentives to retain the Community flags in the face of the temptation to take flags of convenience; that a census be created, authorised by the respective RFOs, and that illegal fishing and landings by these fleets be effectively controlled in order to put an end to unfair competition.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, we are calling for a specific unit within the Fisheries DG on highly migratory species with adequate resources and personnel to defend European interests in these fora at all times. We also call on the Commission to create a specific Advisory Committee on tropical tuna.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to our important canning industry, we are calling for a stable legal framework which allows it to better plan its activity and safeguard its investments. And we call for the same requirements for the Community industry as for the industries which export its product to our markets in order that we may compete under equal conditions within a very liberalised Community market which is continuing to open up with concessions to third countries, in particular in South East Asia. To this end we also call for the creation of a network of European reference laboratories in order to control the quality of products and technical and sanitary conditions, to which the European Union’s strict rules on the origin of goods must be applied.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the globalisation of the tuna market, we are facing very complex issues which require constant and priority attention, as happens in relation to the supply of raw material to the Community industry, and we therefore call for a new study of the real supply needs which allow the Community administration to take the appropriate decisions at all times.</p>
<p class="contents">Our report, Commissioner, attempts to help the Commission to act correctly. We are therefore asking for specific things, such as: a specific action plan, a global framework for structural support, a defence plan to deal with third States and, to this end, the creation of units and advisory committees as I just said in my speech. This is therefore our opinion, it is the European Parliament's opinion, and we hope that the European Commission is now sensitive to it and will act accordingly. We in the European Parliament have begun our work and from now on we are going to demand compliance with our requests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I generally endorse your analysis of the situation in the tuna industry. I take the view that all actors in the tuna industry – from the fishermen to the processing industry – are a chain, and a chain, as we know, is only as strong as its weakest link.</p>
<p class="contents">From the Commission’s perspective, three issues are especially important in supporting the interests of the tuna industry. Firstly, we will continue to need access to tuna stocks in third countries’ waters in future. Secondly, we must defend the interests of the tuna industry through our mandate in the regional fisheries organisations, and thirdly, we want to utilise our market policies in order to create a safety net for stakeholders.</p>
<p class="contents">On access to tuna stocks in third countries’ waters, our fishing industry can only benefit from the new form of partnership agreements, which this House also supports. In your resolution, you call for a study on the state of tuna resources. The Commission is at present producing a kind of framework agreement for the assessment of the tuna fish chapters of the various fisheries agreements, and I will gladly take up your proposal within this context.</p>
<p class="contents">On the regional fisheries organisations, I can confirm that I am determined to defend the Community’s interests in sustainable fishing within the regional fisheries organisations. We are pursuing several priorities in this context, which also match the priorities set by this Parliament. Firstly, we want to clamp down on illegal fishing, because it is nothing but unfair competition and the destructive exploitation of fish stocks. Our Community action plan for the eradication of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing was supported both by this Parliament and the Council. This is a political priority for the Commission and we have already launched appropriate initiatives in various fisheries organisations. Secondly, we must adapt the fleet capacity to match the fishing that is available. The Community cannot accept an aggressive expansion of third countries’ fleets at a time when its own fleet is undergoing cuts. Thirdly, we need a mid- to long-term strategy for sustainable resource management. At our instigation, multiannual framework programmes have been adopted in various regional fisheries organisations. Examples are the management plans for Northern bluefin tuna and swordfish in the Atlantic, and the capacity restrictions on the tuna fishing fleet in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to market issues. First of all, I would like to make it clear that the compensation payments within the framework of the common market organisation must remain a regulatory instrument for crisis situations; they cannot become a kind of long-term intervention mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also remind you that a separate tariff exemption applies to tuna imports that are processed by Community industry. By contrast, imports of canned tuna and semi-processed products, such as tuna fillets, are subject to a tariff rate of 24%. This is the highest tariff in the fisheries sector and has been bound and applied for more than thirty years. Furthermore, canned tuna and fillets are classified as a sensitive product in international negotiations, which is why very few commercial licences have been granted for them. The combination of Community tariffs and trade preferences has clearly enhanced the competitiveness of the tuna industry.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are aware, the Community has already introduced a ban on the import of products derived from illegal fishing. The Commission attaches great importance to a multilateral approach here. That is why we are also complying with the recommendations of the regional fisheries organisations. Secondly, it is also important that we apply the rules of origin and the health rules to imports without discrimination. The Commission is keen to continue working with the sector in identifying gaps in the veterinary control system. However, the responsibility for control primarily lies with the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is this: product labelling is intended to guarantee fair commercial practices. In this context, we must distinguish between the responsibilities of the market participants and the competence of regulatory authorities. The Commission intends to take up this issue again soon. We will of course consult Parliament and the tuna industry as part of this process.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by emphasising that the Commission is keen to engage in dialogue with all the interest groups. To this end, we are holding preparatory meetings on the negotiations on fisheries agreements or when determining our positions prior to the meetings of the regional fisheries organisations, which also involve the industry itself. This approach has proved extremely successful. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, I am fed up with the Committee's items being kicked around on the agenda from one day to the next. It was on the agenda for this morning's debate and here we are now, with half the members of the Committee who have asked to speak in the debate having to come back this evening. What way is this to organise diaries?</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I congratulate the rapporteur on this excellent own-initiative report. It was Mr Varela's idea that the Fisheries Committee should conduct in-depth investigations into some of the major species of fish, and what could be more appropriate than starting with tuna, a species of global importance now worth in excess of USD 2 billion per year. World production of canned tuna is over two million tonnes a year, while the trade in fresh tuna is also burgeoning. We held a special hearing in our Committee on this issue, with many industry experts giving evidence. In addition, the Sustainable Development Intergroup organised a seminar in Brussels last November entitled 'Tuna Fleet and Industry: Prospects for the Future', at which we had a wide range of international speakers.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to concentrate on one important aspect of the report, namely the AIDCP – or Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Program – to which the EU is a signatory, as is the United States and most of the tuna-producing nations of Central and South America. It is the most reliable method for ensuring that tuna is dolphin safe. I am grateful to Mr Varela for highlighting this in his report in a very positive way. He said in his report, 'the system for protecting dolphins in purse-seine fisheries established by the AIDCP, ... is far removed from other private certification schemes which have hitherto been introduced.' I thoroughly endorse that analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">One of these private certification schemes, promoted by the Californian NGO Earth Island, has dominated the canned tuna market for some years. It is estimated that over 97% of all canned tuna in Europe carries their 'dolphin safe' label. However, their 'dolphin safe' label is not turtle safe or shark safe. The method of fishing supported by Earth Island, in its current form, causes the death of countless turtles, sharks and other species and also kills thousands of young yellowfin tuna, discarded dead into the sea because they are below marketable weight.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much endorse the support that Mr Varela's report has given to the AIDCP label and hope the Commission will push for this label to be used exclusively on canned tuna in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe it is an excellent description of the problems worrying the Community tuna fleet, as well as its processing industry. It is true, as we have acknowledged many times in the Committee on Fisheries, that tuna is the most globalised segment of the fisheries sector, and that the Community market demands more product – both fresh tuna and processed tuna – than its fleet and its canning sector can provide.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore believe that Mr Fischler’s commitment to unreservedly defend our tuna sector, our fleet and our canning and processing sector is important, just as the governments of third countries promote actions in favour of their own fisheries sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">By acting in this way, the Commission will defend the European social model and the economic and social cohesion of regions such as mine which largely depend on this industry. We join with the rapporteur, Mr Varela, in calling on the Commission to draw up a strategy in relation to tuna, the preservation of the most threatened species, such as bluefin tuna, and of the most vulnerable fishing grounds. We want fishing and marketing to respond to sustainable and environmental criteria, as well as food safety principles and that, therefore, control mechanisms be established at borders so that imported products have the same phytosanitary guarantees as those originating from our own fleet and industry.</p>
<p class="contents">This Community strategy we are asking the Commission for is all the more urgent if we consider the vulnerability of our sector to possible unfair competition and the precariousness of many thousands of jobs in our industry, the majority of them carried out by women.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore urge the Commission to continue exerting pressure at international level in order to ensure that the principles of this responsible fishing are respected, and that it continue to promote controls and inspection, but we hope that in relation to tuna what we have seen on other occasions does not happen: that what <span class="italic">Penelope Fischler</span> weaves by night is unravelled by <span class="italic">Penelope Lamy</span> by day.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore hope that the criteria which Commissioner Fischler has expressed today turn out to be those which win out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank him for taking on board many of the Verts/ALE Group's suggestions.</p>
<p class="contents">Many lessons can be learned from the way in which tuna fishing is managed. For instance, regional tuna management bodies such as ICAT have made great progress in combating fishing by vessels flying flags of convenience. Another example comes from the Pacific Ocean, where the regional body, the IATTC, has succeeded in dramatically reducing certain types of by-catch, namely dolphins. Finally, several tuna bodies are in the throes of establishing limits on the capacity of the fishing fleets that are allowed to be involved in the fishery.</p>
<p class="contents">The initiatives mentioned in Mr Varela's report are very good ones, but the report does not get rid of the remaining problems, especially the overfishing of several species such as bigeye and bluefin tuna, as well as the unacceptable amount of by-catch involving a wide number of species taken via so-called FAD fishing – the favoured method used by EU vessels. I believe it is essential that the EU clean up these aspects of its fisheries if it is to be committed to a sustainable fisheries policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My group does, of course, fully support his report.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight two points that we consider to be particularly sensitive: consumer health and employment in the fisheries sector and in the tuna processing sector. After years of tests, scientific analyses and expert opinions, we all know that fish consumption is on the increase: fish is healthy, the consumption of fish products – either fresh, smoked, frozen or canned fish – by European citizens increases year after year, and is also due to several effective advertising and information campaigns.</p>
<p class="contents">We also know only too well that in the Member States various requirements, especially those relating to health and hygiene, must, rightly, be met in order to market canned fish products produced in Europe. In order to adequately protect consumer health, the same requisites should also be extended to products from third countries where, unfortunately, health regulations in this area are often too lenient or even, in some cases, completely lacking. We therefore support and strongly insist on the requests made in points 8 and 10 of the motion for a resolution, which point out, respectively, the need to intensify inspections on third-country products – which are, moreover, already provided for by Directive 91/493/EEC – and the need to create Community laboratories to uphold quality, food safety and consumer safety against what is known as food piracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The – equally important – issue of competitiveness and, therefore of employment, in the tuna fishing sector and the canned tuna industry, is linked to the sensitive issue of protecting consumer health.<span class="bold"> </span>If, in order to adequately protect the consumer, certain requirements are imposed, including those that I just mentioned relating to health, which involves a considerable amount of money being invested, and if the same requirements are not applied to products from third countries then, with the inevitable entry into the Community market of products at very low prices compared to European products, then competitiveness in the fishing industry and the European canned tuna industry will be unfairly harmed. There is a grave risk of job losses in a sector that has already been hit hard in recent years by a worrying socio-economic crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, we would point out the need to support, with every possible regulatory and economic means, the sector in question, which is an important source of employment also in other Mediterranean regions, including Sicily, where fishing and bluefin tuna processing has for centuries provided economic support to a considerable percentage of the active population.</p>
<p class="contents">With this message of hope we also want to see an assurance of something tangible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This activity generates a huge number of jobs, directly and indirectly, both in Europe and in the developing countries with which we are linked through international agreements and where European industry has made significant investments.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, what emerges from the very comprehensive analysis carried out by our rapporteur of the various different Community policies that impact on the sector is that we are very far from having an overall and coherent Community strategy of encouraging the development of this activity. On the contrary, it is as if the Community were doing its best to penalise its own tuna fleet and its own processing industry and to favour the fleet and industry in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As an example, at a time when we are seeing considerable growth throughout the world in unregulated fishing capacity flying flags that show little respect for international maritime law, the Commission has proposed banning all public aid for new constructions in Europe and making the construction of new vessels dependent on old ones being destroyed without any compensation of any kind. It seems to want to encourage Community shipowners to fly third-country flags that they would not otherwise choose.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we are lowering customs tariffs considerably on canned tuna from third countries and at the same time subjecting our own processors to ever more requirements, without taking into account the impact of these constraints on the competitiveness of our industry. It is therefore time to review these Community policies, which threaten to compromise the future of a sector that has nevertheless enjoyed exemplary success. We must not allow this to be threatened by these inconsistent policies and by the lack of an overall vision and definite strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is certainly something that consoles and encourages us. The issue of fishing gear and environmental sustainability in this extremely important fisheries sector were well dealt with, and there are two further issues where – and here I would like to appeal to my fellow Members – we must try to maintain a balance.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the fisheries sector, tuna fishing is extremely important for the European Union in the two areas that it includes: on the one hand, extractive fishing – fleets that fish tuna in our waters and those outside the European Union – and, on the other hand, the important pillar represented by the processing sector, which processes tuna of European origin but also, as has been mentioned, tuna originating, in particular, in the seas of Asia and other seas. We must, of course, focus on safety, in particular as regards these productions, but – and on this matter I am glad that the rapporteur agreed with me that we must not proceed rashly – we must also be very careful as regards customs regimes. With this report we are calling for a study and for the Commission to carry out an assessment. I agree with the Commissioner that one of the preferences is a regime which has to date given results whilst, compared with other countries, we have one of the highest customs duties. So, balancing the two pillars of the European fisheries industry – processing and fleets that fish tuna – is an objective that we cannot abandon and which we must focus on.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, with the wisdom that distinguishes this House – and the report currently before us is proof of this – we will succeed in guaranteeing both aspects and, thus, a more prosperous and more sustainable tuna fishing industry in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Most people's experience of eating tuna is through access to the canned product. However, fresh tuna has become more popular and is readily available to consumers in my country, Scotland. That is why paragraph 11 in the resolution, stating that the product's origin should be identified and that there should be full and accurate information for consumers on the type of tuna packed and on the ingredients, is so important. As many of my colleagues have said, the accurate labelling of dolphin-friendly tuna is important in order to reassure consumers that what they are eating does not damage vulnerable species. This directly links in to the recent proposal by the Commission on cetacean by-catches and the resulting protection of these at-risk species.</p>
<p class="contents">The protection of dolphins and other cetaceans is of concern to many of my constituents, especially many schoolchildren whom I meet. That is why inspection of third-country products is important not just in terms of health, but also in terms of consumer information.</p>
<p class="contents">This report highlights conservation-friendly approaches and I welcome it as a basis for sustainable fishing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner Fischler is sitting patiently, listening to our debate, and half our colleagues have been unable to contribute to it. This is no way to organise business. This debate should now be finished and persons on the list should be recalled to speak. Before I make my points to the rapporteur, I would ask you to deduct the 38 seconds I have just spoken for.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his comprehensive report. Many of the points he raises are certainly to be welcomed. I was particularly pleased with the emphasis placed on the need to prevent incidental mortality among dolphins and other species associated with tuna fisheries. Aside from tuna fishing, many dolphins are being washed up dead in my own area of the South-West because of pair trawling. This is therefore an important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I was also happy to hear the rapporteur insisting that products from third countries should meet the same food safety and quality standards as our own. This is something for which we on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have campaigned hard with regard to farm products. The same should naturally apply to fisheries products. Our consumers have a right to safe food, and third-country imports must be of the same high standard.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Fischler spoke about third-country agreements. I am always worried about these agreements because, although many new agreements include conservation measures, there is little conservation to be seen in reality. What is happening off the coast of Africa is much more than exploitation of waters. I believe we are threatening the indigenous fisherman. If there are going to be third-country agreements, they will have to be much better monitored and we must be sure that fish are being caught safely and that our money is being spent wisely.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is that, with regard to labelling catches as tuna-friendly and purchasing dolphin-friendly tuna, we must be sure that practices are genuinely tuna- and dolphin-friendly, that there is no huge by-catch with caught tuna and that people do not purchase such products because they think they are both conservation-friendly and by-catch-friendly, when, in fact, a large number of turtles, sharks and dolphins are evidently being caught. This is misleading, and we have to be very careful when using the 'friendly' label. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With its abundance of species, tuna has become a commercially and socio-economically significant fishery resource, to the extent that it has recently shown strong growth rates. To put this into figures, tuna accounts for more than 60% of canned fish production in the EU, with more than 40 000 people directly employed in the industry. With Spain, Italy, France and Portugal leading the way, the European tuna fleet is the most productive in the world, as it accounts for more than 20% of the total catch.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an industrial activity with strong historical traditions. Parliament’s sole aim in producing this report is to call for a detailed and through-going study of the current situation and to set out the future prospects for this sector of fishing. The report thus begins by focussing on two fundamental problems facing the tuna fishing sector: the loss of competitiveness of the fleet and of the industry in the EU faced with imports from third countries and the sustainable conservation and management of resources.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be recognised that these characteristics are not confined to tuna; they are widespread and apply to almost all types of fishing. To ensure that the EU shows unequivocal support for the industry, this report calls for a specific action plan and a structural support framework for the tuna sector. With this instrument, the EU must demand that products from third countries meet the same health standards for quality and for food safety as products from the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the European Union once again calls for more frequent product inspections in order to ensure that rules on conservation are adhered to in full. As regards the conservation and management of fisheries resources, tuna is a migratory species that is particularly vulnerable to illegal fishing in international waters. Consequently, the EU must prevent the transfer of EU-owned vessels to countries flying flags of convenience. The capacities of the fishing fleet must also adapt more effectively to the resources available. Finally, in conclusion, I should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the excellent work of the rapporteur, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, which will certainly make a positive contribution towards setting out future prospects in this sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At least that has allowed us not to have to come back after 9 p.m. I am sure Commissioner Fischler is also pleased about that. However, this sort of thing should not happen in this House and we should organise our debates more efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome this very good report and congratulate the rapporteur on producing it. As others have said, tuna is as important to the southern regions of Europe as cod and hake is to the northern ones, and those of us from the northern region can therefore understand the concerns. A very significant percentage of the catch goes to the processing industry, meaning that there are very many dependent jobs both at sea and on shore. Up to 60% of the fish caught are canned, as Mrs Stihler has said, and much of that is eaten by us in the northern hemisphere. I, like many people, am very fond of it. However, there are major issues at stake here and they are of concern to me. We can only support sustainable and responsible fishing. I agree with Mr Parish and others who expressed concerns about dolphins. That is something of concern to many people in my constituency. Ultimately, however, our fleets must remain competitive in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">We must have quality control and the size of fish caught must be closely monitored. The Commissioner mentioned three important points, one of which is access to third countries. If we are going to have access to third countries – which is probably needed – it must be closely monitored and there must be tighter controls. Above all we must rule out illegal fishing and protect those species under threat. We need a mechanism for both long- and short-term strategies for the industry, but these must take into account the requirements of the industry and be sensitive to the issue of biomass and tuna stocks. We must work for a more sustainable industry in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A number of countries belonging to this Community have a traditionally strong position in the tuna sector and are vulnerable to changes in the market. It is clear, not only from the Committee on Fisheries’ hearing, but also from what my colleague Mr Varela has said, that the time has come to act. Third countries, particularly those in Asia, have recently sought to secure for themselves a major chunk of the tuna market, which is a lucrative one. I see one explanation for the success of our non-European competitors as being the fact that they have an advantage in terms of costs over the owners of ships belonging to the Community fleet. European shipowners have to comply with Community regulations on hygiene, supervision of fishing activity, production conditions, protection of the environment, and social security for their workers. Important and right though that is, it costs money. In order to prevent shipowners from abandoning the Community flag for the sake of competitive advantage, I call for defensive action. Firstly, there is a need for coordination of the Community policy measures that affect the tuna fleet and the canning industry; secondly, additional fisheries agreements are needed; thirdly, if third countries want to sell their products on the EU market, compliance with health and hygiene regulations must be an absolute requirement; and, fourthly, duties on canned tuna must be maintained until such time as import and trade restrictions are lifted. What this boils down to is that the EU’s strategy must be a coordinated one and conceived at international level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
