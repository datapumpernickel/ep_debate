<p>The regulation adopted by the Council pursuant to the Commission proposal mentioned by the honourable Member is not intended to abolish aid to tobacco cultivation but to set guarantee thresholds and bonuses for the 2002, 2003 and 2004 harvests, and makes some technical modifications to the provisions of the common organisation of the market in tobacco.</p>
<p>The regulation takes account of the employment situation insofar as the modification to this field of activity of the Community tobacco fund is directed, in particular, towards promoting the development of specific initiatives for converting tobacco production towards other crops and other economic activities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission announced a global evaluation study of the sector, which should be available at the end of 2002. This study will serve as a basis for a proposed reform of the COM in tobacco in 2003.</p>
<p>With regard to the future direction of the Community policy on tobacco, the compromise solution adopted in the Council is accompanied by a unilateral Commission statement which appears in the Council’s Minutes, which has been accepted by the German, Danish, Dutch and United Kingdom delegations.</p>

<p>"The Commission would point out that its Communication "Sustainable development in Europe for a better world: the European Union’s strategy for sustainable development", considers, amongst other things, the adaptation of the raw tobacco system, following the evaluation to take place in 2002, in such a way as to allow the gradual elimination of subsidies, while implementing measures to develop new sources of income and economic activity for producers and employees, and consequently to approve a date in the near future."</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Council could not avail itself of a right to initiative which, according to the Treaty, falls to the Commission. The Commission has not so far presented any specific initiative on the issue of moral harassment in the workplace.</p>
<p>In its meeting of 7 March 2002, the Council nevertheless reaffirmed that the European employment strategy must give everybody the opportunity to take part in active life and must contribute to the creation of a dynamic and efficient labour market in which motivated and well-trained workers can carry out highly productive and qualified tasks. It is therefore necessary to pursue the modernisation and reform of the labour market and improve our social protection systems so that, while offering protection to those who need it, they have the incentive to be active. This approach comes clearly within the context of fighting exclusion, which is a multidimensional phenomenon.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0206"></a>

<p>Can the Council comment on the Commission communication of 13 February on the responses to the challenges of globalisation, in particular on the urgency of the problem?</p>
<p>The communication emphasises the increasing frequency in the 1990s of financial crises: Mexico (1994), East Asia (1997-1998), Russia (1998), Turkey (2001) and Argentina (2001); and the fact that they have mainly affected developing countries and, for most of them, have had important consequences in terms of output loss, welfare, social conditions and unemployment.</p>
<p>Can the Council express how it intends to prevent further crises in the immediate future? And in the longer term how it intends to link the two issues of reform of the International Monetary and Financial System and development aid? Does it think that the Tobin Tax may play a role?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>On 5 March 2002 the Council (Ecofin) considered the Commission's final report on responses to the challenges of globalisation. While it noted the Commission's critical assessment of alternative development funding mechanisms such as tax measures, the Council acknowledged that the developed countries could also contribute to funding development by assessing these alternative funding instruments.</p>
<p>The Commission's report nonetheless stresses that the viability of a tax on currency transactions has yet to be demonstrated and that in any case, a multilateral approach would in all likelihood be required, including its application by the major international financial centres. In this respect, the Commission report concludes that the issue needs to be considered in much greater depth, and that in the short and medium term, a more substantial contribution from national budgets will be required, along with a more rational use of resources.</p>
<p>It should also be pointed out that to date, the Commission has submitted no proposal to the Council on introducing a tax on international currency transactions at Community level; without such a proposal, the Council can take no action in this connection.</p>
<p>For its part, the Council highlighted the need for the developed countries to increase their levels of official development aid, and its effectiveness.</p>
<p>Furthermore, over and above studying the alternative financial instruments, the Council stated its readiness to explore shorter-term means of tackling development-funding needs by increasing the level of aid to the poorest countries and also assessing the relevance of granting SDRs for funding development.</p>
<p>Finally, the Council shares the viewpoint stated by the Commission in its report that, in general, the international financial system has worked well for the last 50 years, and has recently demonstrated its capacity for recovery. With a view to increasing still further the efficient management of the international financial system, the EU wishes to see fresh steps taken to encourage the system's stability and transparency, including increasing action to prevent crises, strengthening the framework for resolving financial crises, and making fresh efforts to tackle financial abuses. Here, the work of the international financial institutions needs to be stepped up, and the financial abuses arising from globalisation, such as the funding of terrorism, money laundering, financial crime and illegal fiscal practices, need to be tackled.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

It thus follows that the Council takes due consideration of this aspect for each Community transport policy initiative which contains an "island dimension"; the Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network are a most relevant example in that respect.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0221"></a>

<p>As you are probably aware, the Council has had the opportunity to examine, on various occasions, the effects of the social, economic and political situation of the Argentinean crisis.</p>
<p>At the "ECOFIN" Council on 21 January 2002, the Council examined thoroughly the situation in that Latin American country. It was in particular agreed to fully support the negotiations with a view to strengthening co-operation between the Argentinean government and the International Monetary Fund, directed towards designing a sustainable, consistent and credible economic programme laying the basis for sound economic growth with low inflation, while easing social tensions. At that occasion, the Council considered that the economic programme should be strong, viable and credible, both to the domestic and the international community, as well as sustainable over the medium term to support a lasting recovery of the Argentinean economy and it should pay due attention to the growing social problems. The programme should also promote a legal and regulatory framework conducive to a resumption of domestic and foreign investment. The Council also considered it would be very important for the programme to adhere to the principles of a market-based economy and to avoid discriminating against foreign direct investors and creditors.</p>
<p>Considering that attention should also be paid to the social consequences of the current crisis, the Council encouraged the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, in close co-operation with the IMF, to examine with the Argentinean government measures aimed at alleviating the social impact of the current crisis.</p>
<p>At the same occasion, the Council reaffirmed its readiness to offer technical co-operation to the Argentinean government for the design and implementation of monetary, exchange rate and financial policies. The Council considered that a strong and credible strategy should be defined and implemented promptly so as to overcome the current difficulties. This would have a positive impact not only on Argentina’s economic prospects but also for the long-term economic prospects of the whole Latin American region.</p>
<p>At the ‘General Affairs’ Council on 28 January 2002, the Council welcomed the will expressed by the Mercosur Foreign Affairs Ministers in their Joint Declaration, made in Buenos Aires on 11 January 2002, to strengthen the integration process amongst their countries, considering that a strengthened Mercosur should be the key to the development of the region. The Council also reiterated the importance it attaches to the establishment of an Association Agreement between the EU and Mercosur. It welcomed the progress achieved so far in these negotiations and reiterated the EU commitment to continue to make further progress.</p>
<p>The Council will follow closely the evolution of the Argentinean crisis and it remains open to examine any other possible measures, in particular those which may be suggested or requested by the Argentinean authorities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0224"></a>

<p>The Council's failure to reach agreement at the Laeken Summit on the permanent seat of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has been well documented. The Commission is beginning the recruitment process for the EFSA's management board and executive director, with the Authority scheduled to be in full operation from September onwards this year.</p>
<p>Can the Council comment on whether it sees this situation as meeting the Parliament's location criteria of 'enhancing the Authority's independence and integrity'? (Report <a href="/doceo/document/A-5-2001-0416_EN.html">A5-0416/2001</a>- Resolution <a href="/doceo/document/TA-5-2001-0664_EN.html">T5-0664/2001</a>)</p>
<p>Anwer</p>
<p>The Council reminds the Honourable Member that when the European Council met in Laeken on 14 and 15 December 2001, the European Union made an effort to respond to citizens' expectations with regard to high levels of consumer protection, security and living standards. The European Council, which specifically welcomed the setting up of the European Food Safety Authority and noted the adoption of various texts designed to increase those of consumer protection in certain areas.</p>
<p>At its meeting of 21 January 2002, the Council adopted the amendments tabled by the European Parliament at second reading the previous 11 December to the Regulation which, amongst other objectives, includes the setting up of the European Food Safety Authority. The Council would remind the Honourable Member that this decision means that the Regulation in question was de facto adopted, in keeping with current procedure (TCE Article 151(3) – codecision). From that moment, the Authority set up by the Regulation should had been in a position to begin its work forthwith, which, according to the Laeken conclusions, will begin in Brussels while waiting for an overall agreement on the seats of the agencies.</p>
<p>The Council is fully aware of the location criteria put forward by the European Parliament in its resolution, but would point out that it is not up to it, under any circumstances to decide on that location.</p>
<p>Independently of the issue of the final seat of the European Food Safety Authority, which will be resolved in due course, Council would assure the Honourable Member that it attaches the greatest importance to the principle of the independence of the Authority and its central organs, specifically its administrative board and its executive director. In this connection, the Council believes that the procedure laid down by Regulation 178/2002 setting up the Authority for appointing the members of the administrative board – a procedure in which Parliament plays a significant role – will guarantee that this principle is fully upheld.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The decision taken by the General Affairs Council on 14 March on ODA in preparation for Monterrey so that collectively an EU average of 0.39% is reached by 2006 is a first significant step towards the UN goal of 0.7% of ODA/GNI. Those Member States that have reached this target will renew their efforts to remain at or above it. It is the first time that the Member States of the EU have collectively and individually committed themselves to reaching an intermediate target by a specific date.</p>
<p>This is a formal commitment, which will allow a substantial increase in the amounts allocated to relieving poverty. The Council decision represents an increase in ODA from the EU of USD 7 billion per year by 2006 from its current level of USD 25.4 billion per year. It means an extra USD 20 billion over the period 2003-2006. This concrete effort by the EU in increasing its contribution and in setting a deadline is considerable and is in stark contrast, for instance, to the position of the US whose commitment will eventually, without specifying a date, mean a USD 5 billion increase from its current level of USD 10 billion per year.</p>

<p>On 5 March 2002, the Ecofin Council discussed the Commission’s final report on the answers to the challenges of globalisation. The Council took note of the critical assessment in the Commission report of alternative instruments for development funding, such as the taxation of international capital transactions, and recognised in this connection that the developed countries can also contribute to development funding by assessing these alternative funding instruments. </p>
<p>The Commission report, however, underlines that the feasibility of a tax on capital transactions is yet to be proven and that such a tax in any case undoubtedly requires a multilateral approach and the cooperation of the large international financial centres. The Commission report therefore concludes that yet more research is required and that, in the short and medium term, the contributions from national budgets will need to increase considerably and it will be necessary to make more effective use of resources. </p>
<p>The Council emphasised that, in its opinion, the developed countries should enhance their official development aid and the effectiveness thereof. </p>
<p>In addition, the Council declared itself prepared not only to assess alternative funding instruments but also both to look into shorter-term solutions for meeting the need for development funding by increasing the concessionality of development funding for the poorest countries, and also to determine whether it is meaningful to allocate special drawing rights for development funding. The above consideration will be taken into account when any discussions are held during the Seville European Council on the subject of a possible tax on international capital transactions. </p>
<p>Finally, it is to be underlined that the Commission has not so far submitted a proposal to introduce such a tax at Community level to the Council and that the Council, in the absence of such a proposal, cannot take a decision in this matter. </p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0243"></a>

<p>The presidential elections held in Côte d'Ivoire in October 2000 give strong cause for concern as the candidacy of Alassane Outtaras was not accepted. At the same time, opposition supporters were subjected to unspeakable violence and at least 300 people were killed. Unfortunately, one feature of the 'debate' is an argument about definitions of ethnicity, which gives rise to misgivings that the country may be pitched into serious ethnic conflicts. Fortunately, a reconciliation forum has been held in the country. We are also aware that the country is one of those accused of exploiting bought children as slave labour on the cocoa plantations.</p>
<p>What measures has the Council taken to further the implementation of the National Reconciliation Forum's recommendations? What measures have been taken to enable the June 2002 regional elections to be conducted freely and democratically? Does the Council have any information indicating that sufficient measures have been taken to prevent the use of child slave labour on the cocoa plantations?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As the honourable Member must surely know, the EU began talks with Côte d'Ivoire in accordance with Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement<a href="#defann_21_1" name="refann_21_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> following the elections in Côte d'Ivoire in 2000 which were characterised by violence, infringements of human rights and the exclusion of certain major political parties. When these talks were concluded in June 2001, the EU decided progressively to resume cooperation based on an examination of the political situation at regular intervals. The Council is still following what is happening during the political process of truth and reconciliation, and it decided in February of this year fully to resume EU cooperation. </p>
<p>The Council recently discussed the elections that are planned to take place this year and, because the forthcoming Côte d'Ivoire elections are taking place at local level, Côte d'Ivoire has not been given priority when it comes to the monitoring of elections by the EU. The Commission will nonetheless contribute to the funding of these elections and possibly support local observer groups. </p>
<p>The EU has repeatedly expressed deep concern at the occurrence of forced and child labour, child trafficking and cases of child slavery, in particular in West and Central Africa. It carried out, during last year, demarches in several countries of the region and urged governments to fulfil their obligations under the relevant UN Conventions (or to ratify them if they had not done so) and to take measures in conformity with them. The government of Côte d'Ivoire informed the EU that it was fully engaged in fighting child trafficking. A proposal for a new law has been tabled that would facilitate prosecution of persons involved in that business and border controls have been strengthened because the authorities believe that trafficking mainly takes place in border regions.</p>
<p>The Council will continue to closely follow these issues and hopes that the resumption of full cooperation with Côte d'Ivoire will contribute to reducing some of the root causes of these problems, including poverty.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>1. The Council set out in its conclusions of 11 March its views and planned course of action regarding both the human rights situation in China and, in general terms, the next session of the Commission of Human Rights.</p>
<p>2. As far as China is concerned in particular, I draw your attention to the last paragraph of the Council conclusions, whereby the Council has agreed to the following approach, to be adopted if a draft resolution on human rights in China were to be tabled:</p>
<p> -"The EU will study the contents of such draft resolution carefully;</p>
<p>-If the draft resolution is put to a vote, EU members of the Commission will consider favourably voting for its adoption;</p>
<p>-EU members of the Commission would vote against a no-action motion, should one be present, and the EU would actively encourage other Commission members to do likewise, since, in the EU's views, the very notion of no-action is in itself contrary to the spirit of dialogue."</p>
<p>3. The Council stresses that no draft resolution has been tabled so far and that the United States, which introduced such a resolution in recent years, has not yet stated its intention on this matter this year. Although the US is not prevented from tabling a resolution as an observer to the Commission on Human Rights, the US might experience difficulties from a procedural point of view, due to this status. If the US were to decide to table a resolution, the EU would be willing to consider ways to help overcome such procedural difficulties, as long as this were in accordance with the March conclusions of the Council, mentioned above.</p>
<p>4. Regarding Chechnya, the Council considers that the human rights situation is still a cause for concern and deserves the full attention of the Commission on Human Rights. The EU has engaged in a constructive dialogue with the Russian Federation in Geneva and elsewhere, aiming at reaching a consensus for a Chairman's statement on this question.</p>
<p>5. Finally, as far as Columbia is concerned, the EU is working on a text that it expects to be delivered as a Chairman's statement, as was done in previous years. </p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0255"></a>

These disclosures, coming approximately one month after the US President's 'evil axis' speech, show that the USA is prepared, on the pretext of combating terrorism, to take the first step towards a further escalation of the nuclear arms race, with incalculable consequences for the human race. Moreover, they also alter the conventional policy on the use of nuclear weapons by focusing on the possibility of using them for a pre-emptive strike. Countries which do not possess nuclear weapons are also threatened with nuclear attack and it is proposed that conventional weapons systems should acquire nuclear capability.</p>
<p>How will the Council respond to this US provocation and what measures will it take to advance the cause of total world nuclear disarmament?</p>
<p>Αnswer</p>
<p>1. Τhe Council has not taken a stance on US Government discussions or decisions on the use of nuclear weapons, nor has any Member State asked for the Council to address this matter.</p>
<p>2. Of course, the EU remains fully committed to the proper application of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, to the objectives set out in the decision of the 1995 Review and Extension Conference and to the Final Document approved at the 2000 Review Conference.</p>
<p>3. Article VI paragraph 14 of the Final Document, which was approved by consensus, that is, including by the US as a state party to the ΝΡΤ, reads as follows: "The Conference notes the nuclear-weapon States' declaration that none of their nuclear weapons are targeted at any state", that is, at any state party to the treaty.</p>
<p>4. The ΕU has constantly reiterated that the ΝΡΤ is the cornerstone of international efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the basis for continuing nuclear disarmament. In its statement to the first Preparatory Committee for the 2005 Review Conference of the states party to the ΝΡΤ in New York on 8-19 April 2002, the ΕU repeated that universal ratification of the ΝΡΤ was vital to strengthening non-proliferation at global level and the disarmament objectives around which Union policy revolves, which is why it repeated its call on Cuba, India, Israel and Pakistan to ratify the NPT unconditionally as non-nuclear states.</p>
<p>5. Multilateral regulation is the principle underlying the EU's approach to disarmament and non-proliferation. The ΕU has taken and will continue to take an active part in discussions organised by disarmament, weapons control and non-proliferation conferences and conventions in order to maintain, strengthen and extend the scope of universal rules.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

At the recent meeting of the EU-Turkey Association Council on 16 April, the European Union again clearly expressed its concern at the current lack of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Turkey, including the cultural rights of all its citizens irrespective of origin. On this occasion, the ΕU made a point of raising the question of the status of Turkish citizens of Kurdish extraction.</p>
<p>2. Although it noted that recent legislative reforms in Turkey had brought about a degree of improvement, the ΕU made it perfectly clear to Turkey that it needs to make more progress in the field of human rights and democratic freedoms if it is to meet the political accession criteria laid down in Copenhagen. The ΕU stressed the paramount importance of practical application in this context. More importantly, the ΕU expressed its humanitarian concern about hunger strikers refusing food to the death in their fight for prison reforms and the tragic loss of human lives as a result.</p>

<p>The Commission shares the view of the Honourable Member as regards the participation of applicant countries in the next European elections. Following the Laeken conclusions, the Union is determined to bring the accession negotiations with the candidate countries that are ready to a successful conclusion by the end of 2002, so that those countries can take part in the Parliament elections in 2004 as members.</p>
<p>As regards gender equality, the Commission draws the attention of the Honourable Member to the fact that the accession criteria laid down by the European Council in Copenhagen for countries wishing to join the Union also include the acquis on non-discrimination and gender equality. The Commission is thoroughly monitoring the progress made by candidate countries in this respect. In its 2001 Strategy Paper it concluded that “further progress was made in several countries in ensuring gender equality, both in terms of legislation and the institutional framework. However, further efforts are needed to promote the economic and social equality of women as it is also the case in the Communauté.”</p>
<p>The Commission continues to support measures aiming at improving the gender equality in the context of its pre-accession strategy, e.g. through assistance in the framework of Phare National Programmes in various candidate countries following the priorities set out in the Accession Partnerships, or through the possible participation of candidate countries in the 2001-2005 Community Programme on Gender Equality, which covers also the promotion of equal participation and representation. It is however the responsibility of each country concerned to identify its particular needs for assistance under these programmes.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0205"></a>

<p>Does the Commission think it is fair that Member States are obliged to provide financial support for research activities that conflict with their national laws, which will be the case if the Framework Programme finances from Community resources research activities which conflict with the national laws of several Member States?</p>
<p>What can be done to prevent this situation leading to pressure on (future) Member States to liberalise their ethical and legal framework for research activities, in order to profit from European research funds? How does the Commission intend to prevent competition being affected by whether or not research on embryos is allowed? Is there any way, other than excluding these activities from funding under the Framework Programme, to prevent this undesirable situation and unfair competition, while taking full account of the subsidiarity principle?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>Research involving the use of adult stem cells seeking to develop new cell therapy techniques is funded under the 5th Framework Programme and will also be encouraged in the 6th Framework Programme.</p>
<p>In line with Parliament’s amendment at first reading to the 6th Framework Programme and in line with the opinion of the European Group on Ethics, the Commission considers that we should not at this stage, when knowledge is still limited, deny ourselves the option of exploring the opportunities presented by all the potential sources of stem cells in addition to human embryos explicitly produced for this purpose. This includes adult human stem cells but also those originating from the blood from the umbilical cord or from interrupted pregnancies as well as cells from supernumerary human embryos.</p>
<p>This research could therefore be funded, provided that it is scientifically relevant, justified and respects the ethical regulations and codes currently in force in the countries in which the research will be taking place. The Commission requests that the agreement of the local ethical committees or responsible authorities in the country where the research is to take place be obtained prior to the start of the research. In addition, an ethical review panel at Commission level will be instructed to ascertain whether the project partners fulfil all the requisite conditions.</p>
<p>In the fields in which the Community has official competence, and this is the case with research, national legislation should not affect a strictly Community level action which has been decided according to the institutional procedure with the involvement of the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p>Moreover, such a possibility would run counter to the obligation of respect for diversity laid down in Article 22 of the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union.</p>
<p>For reasons linked, in particular, to competence in the matter and to respect for cultural diversity in Europe, it is now the responsibility of present and future Member States to establish regulations in this field. These regulations will be defined through the democratic process in each State.</p>
<p>At first glance, there is nothing to prevent Article 169 being applied in the field of research on the human embryo provided that the prevailing regulations and codes are respected. However, to date, the Commission has not received any request to this effect from the Member States. It does not, therefore, intend to make any proposal subject to the codecision procedures laid down for the implementation of Article 169 of the EC Treaty.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The honourable Member is right to point out that there should no longer be an age limit for the potential beneficiaries of Commission actions promoting the training and professional development of researchers. The Commission’s proposal for the new framework programme (2001-2006) no longer mentions an age limit. It proposes to distinguish between researchers who are in an initial phase of their career (whatever their age) and more experienced researchers, as the honourable Member recommends. This Commission position received the approval of Parliament and the Council at first reading under the codecision procedure.</p>
<p>The ‘Research Training Networks’ referred to specifically in the honourable Member’s question will serve this dual purpose in that they will have to be clearly based on a fair balance between the two ‘categories’ of researchers: in addition to providing training for researchers at the beginning of their career, they will be open to experienced researchers and thus be a useful knowledge-sharing mechanism.</p>
<p>However, it is impossible for the Commission to change the conditions for eligibility for the ‘Research Training Networks’ for the 5th Framework Programme currently in progress. These conditions derive from decisions relating to the 5th Framework Programme, which stipulate explicitly that the networks must be geared towards the training of ‘young’ researchers, and from the subsequent establishment of a standard contract setting the age limit at 35.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

In this case the treatment and assessment of these measures are to require the period envisaged in the procedural guidelines on state aid. The period required to finalise the investigation may vary depending on the type of procedure that must be followed in the case and on the type of decision to be taken.</p>
<p>The Commission’s approach to regional aid is in the first place defined by setting aid ceilings for regions, taking into account the specific conditions of economic development that apply in the region concerned. Aid schemes can be approved when they apply in a general way to any company that wishes to invest in such a region. In other words, they should be neutral as concerns the sector in which the company is operating. A higher aid level can be allowed if the company is a small and medium-sized enterprise.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0211"></a>

<p>In 2001, 335 planned company mergers were notified to the Commission in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 on the control of company mergers<span class="sup">1</span>. In 332 cases, the Commission took a decision in the light of the planned merger’s compatibility with the Common Market, and it was possible for the vast majority of cases to be concluded within the period of a month. In 20 cases (referred to as Phase II cases), more thorough investigations, leading to decisions within a total period of five months, were necessary because of serious reservations from a competition angle.</p>
<p>Because of the general economic situation and the uncertainty of the share markets, there has been a slight fall in the number of company mergers notified since the last quarter of 2001, and this has led overall to stabilisation at a relatively high level.</p>
<p>By means of a rapid procedure conducted within the statutory periods, the Commission examines every company merger in terms of its compatibility with the Common Market and makes a decision in every individual case, for which it gives its reasons. Any problems from a competition angle that may arise are thoroughly investigated. The investigation is carried out in a transparent manner. There is close contact between the Commission and the parties concerned, and the Member States are given the opportunity to adopt positions on the matter. The rights of the companies involved in the merger are secured by providing for consultation, the inspection of documentation and the formal transmission of specific complaints. Where it is applied, the procedure has the additional advantage for companies of providing what is termed a ‘one-stop shop’ through which multiple notifications to different national competition authorities in the Member States can be avoided.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Commission has endeavoured to go on improving the procedure. For example, the Green Paper of 11 December <a href="#defann_45_1" name="refann_45_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup">2</span> concerning the revision of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 submits proposals for further intensifying cooperation with the parties by means, for example, of the possibility of introducing, upon request and for a limited period, an interruption of period for submitting binding promises.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission will, in the future too, publish guidelines and announcements concerning its administrative practice in order to make it easier for companies to apply the regulations governing the control of mergers, to enhance legal certainty and to make the procedure still more transparent.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In its report of 27 February 2002, the General Consumer Federation of Greece (INKA) criticises the checks carried out in Greece on the use of pesticides during harvesting as piecemeal and inadequate. The report claims that the chronic lack of measures and checks has created a 'chemical bomb' which threatens the health of producers and consumers, the environment and ground water.</p>
<p>Since high levels of pesticides and chemicals have been found in fruit and vegetables intended for domestic consumption and for export to other Member States, in some cases as much as 25 times the permissible limits, what steps will the Commission take to ensure that the Greek authorities carry out effective checks in order to protect European consumers?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission has taken the following steps to ensure that Member States carry out a minimum of check sampling of pesticide residues on their food market.</p>
<p>The annual Monitoring Recommendations provide for the monitoring of residues of about 44 pesticides on 12 food products. The minimum number of samples to be taken are 12 for Greece. The Recommendation is not binding, but so far Greece has always submitted such data to the Commission, which forms part of the Annual EU report on Pesticide Residues monitoring, published on the Internet.</p>
<p>In addition Greece has to provide the Commission with its annual monitoring plan in which Greece discloses its intentions for national monitoring of pesticide residues outside the scope of the Union co-ordinated plan. The data resulting from this programme must also be sent to the Commission and are included in the annual report.</p>
<p>The annual reports available from 1996 to 1999 do not suggest large scale violations of the Pesticide Residues legislation in Greece: 4% of all samples exceed the Maximum Residue Limit (MRL’s), which is around the same as the European average.</p>
<p>MRLs are set to protect the health of consumers, but are in most cases set much lower – in some cases more than 25 times lower - because the authorisation for the use of pesticides allows only the minimum amount needed for proper control of the pest. When residues are found in excess of the MRL and the levels pose a potential risk to the health of any group of consumers, this is immediately reported to the Commission and the Member States authorities through the Rapid Alert System.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0178"></a>

Once this has been signed and returned however, the victim then receives a large bill for inclusion in the guide, followed by repeated demands for payment.</p>

<p>The Commission shares the Honourable Member’s concerns about these marketing practices. The Commission has noted a significant rise in the number of complaints relating to scams involving the marketing of travel guides, particularly targeting small and medium sized enterprises.</p>
<p>These unfair commercial practices and the ‘rogue traders’ who employ them undermine competition and confidence in the internal market.</p>
<p>The Commission has analysed the complaints to determine whether Community laws have been infringed. These practices may be considered as “misleading" under the Council Directive on Misleading Advertisements which aims to protect consumers and business from the effects of misleading advertising. This directive has been transposed into all Member States national legal systems and the directive does foresee the use of injunctions as a preventive measure for stopping the continued use of misleading advertising.</p>
<p>The Commission has no power to enforce this directive against individuals, as this is the competence of national enforcement authorities in the countries from which these mailshots are sent. The Commission would be ready to start infringement proceedings if it became evident that Member States were not applying the Directive, for example by enforcing the foreseen sanctions.</p>
<p>Therefore the Commission has already alerted Member State enforcement authorities using the European group of the International Marketing Supervision Network (IMSN). Precise details of the companies involved in marketing these travel guides have been given to the enforcers. They can therefore consider what steps can be taken either individually or collectively.</p>
<p>Last year, for instance, the British office of Fair Trading and Spanish Catalan Authorities successfully co-operated to stop one firm, based in Spain, marketing a travel guide from continuing to use misleading mailshots. This kind of co-operation is to be strongly encouraged.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission has also passed on this information to the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) supervisory authority in relation to travel guides which are being marketed by rogue traders operating out of the European Economic Area (EEA) countries, particularly Liechtenstein.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0181"></a>

<p>The Union plant health regime is based on Council Directive 2000/29/EC1 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community. This Directive lays down, amongst other things, the list of organisms the introduction or spread of which within the Community shall be banned. Both the white fly and the tomato yellow leaf curl virus are part of this list. As a consequence, the Member States have to take appropriate measures in order to prevent the introduction or spread of these two organisms.</p>
<p>However, specific phytosanitary provisions have to be approved in order to accommodate fully the climatic and agricultural specificity of the Canary Islands. Until then, Directive 2000/29/EC is not applicable to this part of the Spanish territory.</p>
<p>The finalisation of these specific phytosanitary provisions requires a substantial amount of technical data, some of them still to be submitted by Spain. The Commission will take immediate action once this information is made available.</p>
<p>Concerning possible compensation for damage caused by plagues, the Commission, as a general rule, does not accept that outbreaks of plant pests and diseases can be considered to constitute natural disaster or exceptional occurrence. In the case set out by the Honourable Member, the Commission cannot grant a type of compensation that might have indemnified the affected farmers, neither in the framework of rural development plans, nor within the Common Organisation of the Market for fruit and vegetables. However, some pest management costs may be covered by Producer Organisations operational programmes, in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 609/2001.</p>
<p>In addition, under certain circumstances, and following notification to and approval by the Commission, Member States may provide State aid to producers hit by plant diseases.

<p>At present, there is no Directive completely covering the advertising of tobacco products. In fact, the Directive on tobacco advertising and sponsorship adopted by the Parliament and the Council in 1998 was annulled by the Court of Justice (ECJ) in October 2000. This limits the Community “acquis” in this field to the prohibition of tobacco advertising on television, as a result of the “Television without Frontiers” Directive of 1989.</p>
<p>However, immediately after the Court’s judgement, the Commission prepared a new proposal for a Directive on tobacco advertising and sponsorship, which was adopted by the Commission in May 2001. This new proposal is fully consistent with the ECJ judgement; it foresees inter alia the prohibition of advertising in newspapers and magazines, on the Internet and on the radio, as well as a prohibition of the sponsoring of cross-border events.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to remind the Honourable Member of the fact that this proposal, which the Commission transmitted to Parliament in June 2001, has still not had a first reading in this Institution, a situation that seriously delays the adoption of this important piece of tobacco control legislation.</p>
<p>The Economic and Social Committee adopted a favourable opinion on the Commission’s proposal in October 2001. The Parliament’s Environment Committee approved their draft opinion in March this year, and together with the Legal Affairs Committee will conduct a hearing on the issue on 15 April this year. The Commissioner in charge of Health and Consumer Protection addressed the Legal Affairs Committee on this proposal on 26 March. The Council hopes to discuss this proposal at the Health Council on 26 June. The Commission notes that the first reading in Parliament is so far scheduled for July.</p>
<p>Although there is at present no legislation in this area, some Member States have in fact introduced legislation that corresponds to the provisions of the annulled advertising Directive, or even goes beyond it.</p>
<p>In Denmark, for example, such legislation entered into force on 1 January 2002. In the Netherlands, a Bill whose scope is very similar to that of the annulled Directive is in the last phase of parliamentary approval. In Ireland, a new Bill covering large parts of the annulled Directive has been enacted recently and will enter into force soon. In the United Kingdom, a Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Bill is before Parliament and the Government hopes it will be enacted this autumn. Moreover, Spain is preparing legislation closely based on the provisions of the annulled Directive.</p>
<p>Therefore, a number of Member States have introduced, or are in the process of preparing, far-reaching legislation in this area – motivated by concern at the link between tobacco promotion and tobacco consumption. On the contrary, the situation in other Member States is still characterised by the absence of stringent legislation on tobacco advertising. There is a resulting variation in national laws, and it has become clear that the divergences between these national laws may have the effect of strengthening barriers that impede the free circulation of advertising and sponsorship products and services between Member States.</p>
<p>These barriers need to be removed to assure the smooth operation of the single market, hence the justification for this proposal.</p>
<p>The Commission calls on the Parliament to speed up the work on this draft Directive.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0186"></a>

<p>Again and again, we learn of new food safety crises in Europe. Just over a month ago, carcinogenic PCB residues were found in pig feed and poultry feed. And residues of allergenic antibiotics were recently discovered in feed from a Belgian factory.</p>
<p>It is also rumoured that the Commission's proposal for a regulation on the control of feedingstuffs and foodstuffs has been delayed because of differences of opinion between directorates.</p>
<p>In view of these recurrent serious problems, does the Commission not consider that this matter ought to be given top priority?

<p>The Commission attaches a high priority to the preparation of a proposal on feed and food controls, a key priority in the White Paper on Food Safety. It must be pointed out however that the issues for this proposal are of a very complex nature with far reaching legal consequences. They need careful reflection.</p>
<p>In general, the proposal aims to have a clear Community framework for control systems, in which the respective responsibilities of Member States and the Commission are systematically set out.</p>
<p>Member States National Control Systems will have to be designed and developed in accordance with a harmonised Community-wide approach. This will involve establishing operational criteria for the national control authorities, qualification and training requirements for their staff, and the implementation of documented control procedures. This also includes the taking of effective, dissuasive and proportionate enforcement measures where non-compliance is identified.</p>
<p>It is in particular being considered within the Commission services to include in the proposal a section on administrative and penal sanctions to be imposed in case of breach of Community and national feed and food law. This includes the misuse of antibiotics. More precisely, the Commission is reflecting on possible penal sanctions if feed and food controls reveal the use of unauthorised or prohibited additives in feed or foodstuffs in breach of Directives 70/524/EEC (feed additives) and 95/2/EC (food additives) respectively.</p>
<p>The Commission’s responsibilities include the auditing of the control systems applied by the Member States and the taking of enforcement measures in case serious shortcomings are identified in these systems. One of the enforcement measures still under discussion within the Commission services is the possible withdrawal of Community funding granted under the Regulation on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund.</p>
<p>Further responsibilities of the Commission include the auditing of third countries so as to verify whether the conditions of production of feed and food destined for the Community market are of the same standard or of a standard equivalent to that applied by the Community.</p>
<p>The proposal will embrace all feed and food law, in a similar fashion to Regulation 178/2002 of the Parliament and of the Council laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety.</p>
<p>It is the intention of the Commission to submit this proposal before August 2002.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0235"></a>

<p>Recently, the port of Southampton has analysed various shipments of food from non-EU boats. The reports from scientists suggest significant problems and health risks with that food - particularly raw fish. Now that non-EU boats are aware of the potential of not getting their food past ports such as Southampton, they are moving on to other ports, where inspection and analysis are seemingly more lax. The loads are then re-imported into the UK and processed as EU safe food when this would have been forbidden entry into the UK before. The City of Southampton Council believes that it can prove this with several shipments it has tracked.</p>
<p>Does the Commission accept that ports interpret EU health and safety provisions for food products differently in different Member States?

<p>Council Directive 91/493/EC requires that the health conditions for fishery products imported from third countries must be at least equivalent to those applicable to these products originating from the Community.</p>
<p>The Commission is working towards further harmonising the microbiological criteria for the production of fishery products, on which the Scientific Committee is currently evaluating the available scientific information.</p>
<p>Checks on imports of products of animal origin are harmonised and clearly laid down in Council Directive 97/78/EC which specifies the documentary, identity and physical checks that must be carried out in any border inspection post in the Community1.</p>
<p>This legislation also lays down the rules which must apply to consignments which do not fulfil Community import requirements. In case of re-dispatch, the official veterinarian of the border inspection post must invalidate the import certificate and inform the other Community border inspection posts. If any of the checks indicates that a danger to human health exists, the consignment must be destroyed.</p>
<p>Details for the physical checks, including chemical and microbiological testing required for particular high-risk products, such as fish, subject to safeguard decisions, are normally specified in the relevant decision.</p>
<p>When there are no harmonised measures applicable to imports of products of animal origin, Member States are required to submit consignments to tests according to national rules.</p>
<p>Certain problems in the harmonisation of import checks for fishery products in the Member States have been identified during the last few years. The Commission is investigating with the Member States if harmonisation should be strengthened in particular as regards physical checks.</p>
<p>In the case of fresh fishery products directly landed on the territory of Member States by a fishing vessel flying a third country flag, Community legislation requires that these fishery products undergo the same veterinary checks as laid down in respect of fish landed by fishing vessels flying the flag of Member States.</p>
<p>Commission staff of the Food and Veterinary Office conduct regular inspections of all border inspection posts in the Member States to verify that correct Community standards of facilities, staffing and procedures are maintained. The reports of their inspections are made public, and are available on the Commission’s web-site.</p>
<p>Should any documented large discrepancies in application of Community legislation be brought to the attention of the Commission, this will be investigated and further action will be taken.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0260"></a>

The Council Recommendation of July 1999 asks Member States to adopt a protection framework based on the Recommendation into their national legislation and implement measures according to this framework.</p>
<p>Would the Commission consider introducing a common legislatory framework to compel Member States to comply with the best safety practices and remedy the disparity?</p>
<p>In the implementation report, Ireland states that it has submitted a revised Planning and Development Act in November 2001. However, Ireland fails to mention that this revision actually exempts companies erecting mobile phone masts from planning permission.

Is the Commission satisfied that it meets the demands set out above in the Council Recommendation?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Honourable Member’s question refers to the Community framework established by the Council Recommendation of 12 July 1999 limiting the exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields. The scope of this Recommendation covers the whole spectrum of non-ionising radiation, including emissions from devices such as mobile telephone systems. It calls on Member States to adopt the proposed set of limit values and to implement the measures necessary in order to limit exposure of the public to the levels given in the Recommendation.</p>
<p>The constant development in the use of electricity, and in particular the rapid development of mobile telecommunications systems, including the installation of transmitter masts, has given rise to some public concern. The Commission is very much aware of this, and the Recommendation just referred to addresses these concerns in a very comprehensive way, based on the opinion of leading experts and relevant European committees. However, as a Council Recommendation is not a binding legal instrument, Member States may adopt higher or lower levels of protection. Given the limitations of the EC Treaty, and in particular of Article 152 on public health which explicitly excludes, with very few exceptions, any harmonisation of the laws and regulations of Member States, the Community cannot adopt legislation in this area based on public health grounds.</p>
<p>However, at European level there are other binding instruments which effectively limit total body exposure to non-ionising radiation, and which compel Member States to comply with the best safety practices. Firstly, the Council Recommendation invites the Commission to work towards the establishment of European standards of compliance with the recommended basic restrictions. This is currently done within the framework of the mandate M/305 given to Cenelec, the European standardisation organisation for electrical equipment. This mandate derives directly from the Directives on low voltage and radio terminal and telecommunications equipment. On this basis Cenelec will develop standards which will replace conflicting national standards and ensure that eventually all devices emitting non-ionising radiation put on the market will meet the limits set up by the Council Recommendation. The first standard on mobile telephones was published in June 2001, and the standard on base stations is expected by July 2002.</p>
<p>Secondly, Union legislation governing radio products, including mobile telephone masts, obliges manufacturers to ensure that they are safe. Directive 1999/5/EC on Radio Equipment and Telecommunications Terminal Equipment obliges manufacturers to ensure that their products do not have an adverse effect on health and enables national authorities to impose restrictions on the use of radio products, e.g. by prescribing minimum distances from the public, so as to ensure that telephone masts are appropriately installed.</p>
<p>Therefore, beyond the provisions of the Council Recommendation, European standards and Community legislative provisions ensure that existing disparities will be remedied.</p>
<p>In general, the Irish implementation report demonstrates the willingness to take into account the limits recommended at Community level. The present lack of specific measures regarding planning permission should not be seen as an obstacle to the achievement of the Council Recommendation’s objectives. In fact, total body exposure will depend on the local power of each base station.</p>
<p>From a Commission perspective, therefore, we are not primarily concerned with Member States’ systems for granting planning permissions. The Commission is concerned about ensuring that the limit values which are set in the Council Recommendation, and which are reflected in the Cenelec standards, are respected. When this is the case the Honourable Member’s concerns regarding the level of public protection and maintaining an appropriate regulatory framework are effectively addressed.</p>
<p>The future European standard for base stations will define the conditions for putting antennas into service, taking into account other existing installations and their emissions. It will thereby ensure that in all cases, the recommended limits are not exceeded.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission recalls that the Union has based its position with regard to nuclear safety in all candidate countries on the Council Report on Nuclear Safety in the Context of Enlargement of June 2001. This report concludes that the “safety improvement programme for the Temelin units has been the most comprehensive so far for this reactor type. Completion of these programmes at […] Temelin is essential to remove the few remaining deviations at these plants with regard to achieving a high level of nuclear safety.”</p>
<p>Given this technical evaluation as well as the demands and recommendations that the Council submitted to the Czech authorities, the Commission sees no justification to support calls for an early closure of the Temelin Nuclear Power Plant (NPP). The purpose of the current trial phase is to identify and remedy remaining potential weaknesses. All occurring anomalies or incidents during this phase, as have been widely reported in some media, have been classified as “zero” or “category one” events on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES), meaning without radioprotection concern. The Czech authorities regularly identify their root causes. These events have not changed the overall European Union expert evaluation of the Temelin NPP mentioned above.</p>
<p>The responsibility to maintain a high level of nuclear safety at the plant is incumbent on the operator and the independent Czech nuclear regulatory authority. Following the debate last year in the Parliament on the idea of an international donor conference, neither the Czech Government, nor Member States have signalled any interest in the provision of financial assistance related to an early closure of the Temelin plant. In any case there are no compelling technical reasons for such a closure. Therefore, the Commission sees no need for committing Community funds to this purpose.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0169"></a>

<p>In order to obtain the Community aid paid for their products, Greek farmers are 'required' to sign two standing orders and authorisations, one in respect of the Agricultural Bank, through which the aid must be paid to farmers, and the second in respect of the farmers' cooperative. The 'standing orders', which are for an indefinite period, authorise the bank and the cooperative to debit from the account in which farmers' aid is deposited any payments due to (1) the inland revenue in respect of tax or other dues, (2) ELGA (the farmers' insurance organisation), and (3) any other body. The positions from which the two parties to the agreement negotiate are unequal since the producer/consumer is compelled to use the services of the Agricultural Bank in order to receive the aid to which he is entitled and is persuaded to sign the standing orders both in respect of the bank and his cooperative, otherwise payment of the aid will be delayed.</p>
<p>Does the Commission, therefore, not consider that such a vaguely formulated, 'carte blanche' standing order authorising the payment of any form of sum due to third parties falls within the scope of Directive 93/13/EEC<a href="#defann_57_1" name="refann_57_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on unfair terms in consumer contracts?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Now, clearly, the contractual relations established between the farmer, on the one hand, and the Greek Agricultural Bank and the farmers’ cooperative to which the farmer belongs, on the other, relate to the procedures for the collection of taxes on Community subsidies and are therefore closely linked to the farmer’s professional activity.</p>

<p>Within the framework of the ‘Culture 2000’ programme (call for proposals 2002), it would have been perfectly possible for cultural operators to submit a project to celebrate the bicentenary of Victor Hugo. Regretfully, the Commission notes that no application for funding for such a project was submitted to commemorate this bicentenary.</p>
<p>Moreover, the ‘Culture 2000’ programme also provides, under action 3, for the funding of special cultural events with a European or international dimension such as the organisation of memorable innovative cultural events which are accessible to the citizens in general, particularly in the field of the cultural heritage, arts and history of Europe, also involving education, the arts and culture. It is within this framework that a year of Verdi was celebrated in 2001 and a year of Bach was celebrated as part of the preparations for the ‘Culture 2000’ programme in 1999.</p>

<p>The Commission recognises that infrastructure investment is key for future viable economic and commercial development in North East Asia, a region that covers a vast land area with big differences in factor endowments. Improvements in sectors such as transportation, energy, telecommunication and finance are seen as crucial in the current stage of economic co-operation and integration. Successful development in these fields will require abundant private investment. According to recent studies, the cost of upgrading and expanding the region’s infrastructure to international standards will amount to USD 7.5 billion annually for the next 15 to 20 years. However, although North East Asia undoubtedly has an enormous economic potential, it is still a very heterogeneous region, and national, political, institutional and bureaucratic impediments remain very high.</p>
<p>Financing for infrastructure investments in the region now come from three sources: the private sector, bilateral assistance, and International Financial Institutions (IFIs), in particular the World Bank (WB) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).</p>
<p>At the current stage, both the ADB and the WB are already giving priority to regional, sub-regional, and national projects and programmes that will contribute most effectively to regional developments in various parts of Asia and the former Soviet Union (i.e. Central Asia, South Asia, the Mekong area). A similar focus could be envisaged towards North East Asia by the same IFIs. It seems therefore more appropriate, at this stage, to enhance co-ordination among existing IFIs rather than creating a new development bank in the region.</p>
<p>Member States are shareholders of the ADB and WB and the question of the possible Community representation in the governing bodies of such institutions is a matter that is not specifically related to the establishment of a North-East Asian Development Bank.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0191"></a>

<p>Seconded national experts are excluded from any official act in which the Commission exercises its public law prerogatives and they cannot enter into a commitment on the Commission’s behalf. However, national experts may work in any field where their services are deemed necessary provided there is no conflict with the interests of the Community. For this purpose, both the Head of the Unit to which it is intended to assign the national expert, and the national expert must declare in writing that there is no risk of a conflict of interests between the tasks the national expert performs for his/her employer or the professional activities of his/her close family, and the tasks entrusted to him or her as a seconded national expert.

<p>In the context of the Commission’s proposals on Administrative Reform, and notably the use of non-permanent human resources, the Commission has approved proposals for a modification of the rules that are applicable to national experts with the purpose of reinforcing the principle that, in their work, national experts represent the Commission. The Commission Decision on National Experts will include explicit provisions to ensure that they are under an obligation to respect the same professional standards as officials. Furthermore, national experts should work on the basis of an exhaustive job description, under the double constraint of work under the guidance of permanent officials, and strict measures addressing the risk of conflict of interests. The formal Commission Decision on the revised "Rules applicable to National Experts on Detachment to the Commission” will be adopted before end of May 2002.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0200"></a>

<p>With reference to the objectives of the European transport policy, the Commission can only deplore the effects on rail freight traffic of the security problems at SNCF’s Fréthun terminal. The operations of this terminal, where trains are prepared for their journey through the Channel Tunnel, are in fact subject to constant disruption, and are even suspended, because of repeated attempts by illegally-resident immigrants to board these trains, come what may, in order to reach the United Kingdom and request asylum there.</p>
<p>This distressing matter, referred to at the Transport Council on 26 March, brings various Community policies into play.</p>
<p>One is that of ensuring the free movement of goods via a trans-European transport corridor, which means that sufficient, necessary and proportionate steps must be taken by France in order to ensure the passage of trains under the same non-discriminatory conditions. What is at issue is a question of fact. Since this situation arose in November last year, the Commission, applying Council Regulation (EC) 2679/98<a href="#defann_66_1" name="refann_66_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> of 7 December 1998 on the functioning of the internal market in relation to the free movement of goods among the Member States, has regularly asked France for all necessary explanations on the steps taken and on how and when they would be implemented. The Commission would be able to take action by default if it were not satisfied by these explanations. However, compensation for the parties sustaining loss due to the disruption of operations is a matter for the French courts.</p>
<p>On the other hand, one of the fundamental causes of the problem is that the Community framework for the free movement of persons has not yet been established as regards the crossing of borders and the exercise of the right of asylum. The Commission has drawn up all the proposals required to create this Community framework in matters of immigration and asylum, which are currently being discussed in the Council, where they are making slow progress.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Commission appeals to the two Member States involved to implement in the short term the most appropriate practical measures to mitigate the consequences of the immediate problems, and, in particular, to make secure the terminals near the French end of the tunnel as well as, in the medium term, to promote the adoption of Community measures recently proposed by the Commission on immigration and the right of asylum, which are likely to finally eliminate the problem.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In 1996 the Parliament and the Council adopted Decision 1692/96/EC of 23 July 1996 on Community guidelines for the development of the Trans-European Transport Network7. This decision established the guidelines covering the objectives, priorities and broad lines of measures envisaged in the area of the trans-European transport networks.</p>
<p>Article 9 of this Decision describes the criteria applying to the Trans-European road Network. This Article provides that the network shall comprise motorways and high-quality roads which, among other aspects, bypass the main urban centres on the routes identified by the network.</p>
<p>The network schemes are illustrated by maps attached to Decision 1692/96/EC. On map 2.7 it is indicated that the Dublin C-ring motorway is part of the Trans-European Networks outline plan for roads. This ringroad could be seen as a concrete example to eliminate bottlenecks around conurbations.</p>
<p>The recently adopted Commission proposal to update the guidelines does not alter the trans-European character of this route which would therefore remain eligible for Trans-European Network (TEN) Community funding.</p>
<p>Moreover under the Structural and Cohesion Funds, substantial support continues to be provided to tackle problems of congestion. In the case of congested roads in the Dublin area, the Cohesion Fund has financed the major part of the M50 C-ring motorway around the city. In regard to public transport, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) also support the extension and improvement of suburban rail infrastructure and rolling stock, including light rail.</p>
<p>At the conference on the European transport policy for 2010, organised in Brussels on 27 November 2001, the third round table discussion was focussed on the future priorities of the trans-European transport network policy. The need to eliminate bottlenecks around conurbations was emphasised by some participants arguing that local or regional networks may determine the performance of inter-regional links and these networks should therefore not be excluded from the Trans-European Network. Other participants argued that these networks were nonetheless the responsibility of the regional authorities and this limits the scope for action by the Community. In the framework of the 2004 revision of the TEN-Transport Guidelines the Commission considers to elaborate in more detail on this bottleneck issue.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0216"></a>

<p>Although the total quantity of high quality beef under the World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreement amounts to 58 100 tonnes, only a part of that quantity is effectively imported. In the quota year 2000/2001 approximately 39 700 tonnes were imported under the preferential terms applicable to high quality beef. The imported quantity corresponded to just a little more than half a percentage point of the Community consumption of beef in that same period.</p>
<p>The Council is currently discussing a Commission proposal to open an autonomous quota of 1 000 tonnes of high quality beef at a duty-rate of 20% ad valorem. Furthermore, it is the intention of the Member of the Commission in charge of Agriculture and Fisheries to propose to the Commission and to the Council a supplementary quantity to the Community, in 2002/2003 only, of 10 000 tonnes also at a duty-rate of 20% ad valorem. It is expected that due to the return to normal market conditions with increased consumption levels, the possible additional high quality quota in 2002/2003 may be sold on the Community market without disturbing the market equilibrium.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0218"></a>

<p>The task of the Euratom Safeguards Office is to ensure that within the European Union nuclear material is not diverted from its intended use. The report of the operation of the Euratom Safeguards Office for the period 1999 to 2000 which was published in July 2001 points out that small discrepancies were still being investigated with the operators concerned. It points out furthermore that nuclear material still remains in the MOX-Demonstration Facility at Sellafield which has now been closed down. It also says that an important verification problem appears in some installations, including Sellafield where old plutonium-holding materials are stored. Difficulties of access and handling due to radiation protection and safety reasons do not permit full routine safeguards activities of these installations to be performed.</p>
<p>Is the Commission concerned about these findings and will it now indicate what the up-to date position is in relation to the discrepancies under investigation and where they were uncovered and will it state what action it is taking to ensure full routine safeguards activities are carried out at the closed Sellafield facility and, finally, has the Euratom Safeguards Office been given any additional responsibilities following the events of 11 September 2001?</p>
<p>Discrepancies may emerge in bulk handling installations due to differences in the operators and inspectors measurement systems, due to clerical errors or due to process losses. Discrepancies appear frequently, yet they have always been resolved up to now by closer investigations using operating data and source data and by physical verifications of the material involved. Hence, the Commission has no reason to conclude that nuclear material has been diverted from its intended use.</p>
<p>The MOX Demonstration Facility (MDF) has been closed down as a fabrication installation, it is still possession of nuclear materials which remained static and were always under Euratom control. The results of the control were satisfactory as reported.</p>
<p>Concerning the issue of the old Pu-holding-materials, the situation remains unchanged, i.e. the materials remain ‘frozen’ (under seal and/or surveillance). The Commission does not consider under the present circumstances justifiable to request a very significant workload and radiation exposure to facility personnel and inspectors in order to improve their knowledge over this static material. However, normally, whenever such material needs to be handled for other purposes, the inspectors use the opportunity for verifying it.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Further to the proposals made in the Commission's Action Plan on Skills and Mobility<a href="#defann_72_1" name="refann_72_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Barcelona European Council decided that a European Health Insurance Card will replace the current paper forms needed for health treatment in another Member State and that the Commission will present a proposal to that effect before the Spring European Council in 2003.</p>
<p>Currently Community Regulation No 1408/71 of the Council of 14 June 1971 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons and their families moving within the Community<a href="#defann_72_2" name="refann_72_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> guarantees that the Member State where a person is insured will be responsible for the health care costs if a person is staying temporarily in another Member State and needs immediate care. In order to prove that this person is legally entitled to such care and that he will be covered by the Member State where he is insured, the latter provides him with a paper form (E 111).</p>
<p>The purpose of the European health insurance card is to transform the European paper forms into an electronic health insurance card, so that the cardholder can claim access to urgent health care in a Member State other than the one where he is insured, which will nevertheless remain responsible for the cost.</p>
<p>The main objective is to cut down on paperwork and red tape, and to facilitate access to urgent health care for citizens travelling around the Community. Such a card will not only contribute to improving free movement and labour mobility within the Union but will also give a strong symbolic signal to citizens. As is the case with the E 111 form, the health card will also be available to Union citizens travelling to other Member States on holiday. The intention is not to create new rights for insured persons, nor to introduce a harmonised health or social security card. Neither is it to create a health card containing information on the holder's health status.</p>
<p>The Commission hopes the necessary decisions can be taken and implemented by 2004.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>The Commission will recall that in its 1997 White Paper on Energy for the Future: Renewable Sources of Energy it sought to launch a campaign for the take-off of renewables and it promised to send a Communication every two years to the Council and the Parliament evaluating the strategy and recommending a revised strategy, if necessary.</p>
<p>Taking into account the targets of 2010 in the White Paper, does the Commission consider that its campaign has taken off and that real progress is being made to exploit the various renewable energies which are abundantly available in the EU but which, in the past, have been neglected and, in particular, has progress been made in selecting pilot communities, regions, cities and islands which could reasonably aim at 100% supply from renewables, and is the potential, recognised by the Commission, for exploiting wood and agricultural residues including straw being realised together with the potential for biofuels, high yield annual and perennial C4 plants and solid vegetable biomass?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In February 2001, the Commission published its first report<a href="#defann_73_1" name="refann_73_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on the progress achieved towards the White Paper objectives. This report concludes that further efforts at the Community level and in the national policies of the Member States will be necessary to achieve the objectives of the White Paper, i.e. a 12% Renewable Energy Source (RES) contribution to the Community gross inland energy consumption in 2010.</p>
<p>The contribution of RES to Community gross inland energy consumption (source Eurostat) has increased from 5% on 1989 to 6% in 1998.</p>
<p>Concerning the integration of renewable energies in 100 communities referred to by the Honourable Member, the Commission concluded in its progress report that the specific objective of “100 communities aimed at 100% of RES supply “ would certainly be reached in 2003. Renewable Energy (RE) Partnerships, signed with such communities, are progressing rapidly and more than 100 potential candidates have been identified.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member highlights the need for recognising the potential of bioenergy. The Commission’s progress report underlines that bioenergy has become an important element of energy, environment and agriculture policy because of its contribution to security of supply. The biomass sector, including the production of heat, fuels and/or electricity from agriculture, industry and municipal wastes, has shown an increase of 13.5% in the Community during the period 1995-1998. In 1999, Agenda 2000 reforms further encouraged diversification of rural economy, providing aids for investments in RES exploitation and afforestation of agricultural land. In addition, the prolongation of set-aside policy offered a potential of 3.9 million hectares (ha) agricultural land to non-food production at preferential conditions, which resulted in the campaign of 1999-2000 in a use of 1.1 million ha of set-aside land for non-food cultures.</p>
<p>In order for renewable energy technologies to move fully into the mainstream of Community energy supplies (mass markets), and to compete in the single European Energy Market, different legislative frameworks should be amended to provide a more “level playing field”. This is why the Commission has recently launched a major programme of legislative initiatives (Directives) in the renewable energy sector.</p>
<p>The European Commission adopted on 7 November 2001 a legislative package as a follow-up to its recent White Paper on Transport Policy. The package contains a Communication (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2001&amp;nu_doc=0547">COM(2001) 547</a> final) including two proposals for Directives.</p>
<p>The Communication puts forward a concrete action plan for the promotion of alternative fuels and biofuels in road transport by concentrating policy efforts on the promotion of biofuels, natural gas and hydrogen.</p>
<p>Both proposals for Directives aim at promoting the use of biofuels for transport. The first proposal requires that an increasing proportion of all diesel and gasoline sold in the Member States be biofuel, starting with 2% in 2005. The second proposal creates a European-wide framework allowing Member States to apply reduced tax rates in favour of biofuels.</p>
<p>Moreover, the promotion of renewables in the Community is one of the key measures needed for reaching the Union Kyoto target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 8% by 2010 in relation to the 1990 level. The Commission is actively pushing renewables as an important component of its Climate Change strategy.</p>
<p>In the context of the European Climate Change Programme launched in June 2000 and based on a Commission Communication<a href="#defann_73_2" name="refann_73_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, renewables have played a fundamental role. The promotion of renewable energy is also an important element in the forthcoming Public Awareness Campaign and Campaign for Take-off foreseen by the Commission Communication on the implementation of the first phase of the European Climate Change Programme<a href="#defann_73_3" name="refann_73_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Swedish media report that the EU has decided to withdraw its support of some EUR 3.3 million to the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) for budgetary reasons.</p>
<p>WADA is sport's weapon in the fight against drug-use. In the light of all the unfortunate reports concerning drug-use among participants at the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, this fight is more important than ever. In order to get to grips with doping, we must fight it together. Without the EU's support, WADA's future is uncertain.</p>
<p>The EU was to contribute approximately one sixth of WADA's total budget of just over EUR 20 million. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) is paying its share of EUR 10 million.</p>
<p>Is it true that the EU will not be paying its share of support to WADA and, if so, what other anti-doping measures does the Commission plan to take?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Before answering the question on financing, it should be recalled that the World Anti-Doping Agency is a private-law organisation, whose role is to ensure the international coordination of the method utilised in combating doping in sport. Nonetheless, prime responsibility for the fight against doping lies with the sporting organisations, cooperating fully in certain areas with the national governments.</p>
<p>It is the case that the Commission is not considering making a contribution to financing the Agency’s operating budget. The reasons for this have been explained on several occasions. The main problem lies in the fact that the Commission would be committing itself to paying, on an annual basis, 18% of the Agency’s budget, decided on by two-thirds majority vote of the Foundation Board, where the Community is in a minority. This means that this body could unilaterally determine the amount to be funded by the Community, which would be contrary to the budgetary procedures in force within the Community.</p>
<p>The Commission is, nevertheless, willing to collaborate with the Agency on specific projects. For example, in 2001, three projects proposed by the Agency were funded by the Commission, amounting to EUR 2 million overall.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0230"></a>

<p>Pursuant to that legislation (which is directly applicable under the Member States’ internal legal systems), cash withdrawals from automatic teller machines and credit- or debit-card payments up to a value of EUR 12 500 in any euro-zone country will, with effect from 1 July 2002, be effected under the same terms and conditions as in the country in which the card was issued. With effect from 1 January 2003 the same will apply to bank transfers in the euro zone.</p>
<p>Pursuant to Article 7 of the Regulation, compliance with the provisions thereof shall be guaranteed by effective, proportionate and deterrent sanctions.</p>
<p>However, most Europeans are unaware that the regulation exists, although it will enable significant saving to be made (particularly in the case of tourists) from next summer onwards.</p>

<p>Regulation 2560/2001 on cross-border payments in euro was adopted on 19 December 2001 and some of its provisions entered into force on 31 December 2001. With effect from 1 July 2002, charges for the withdrawal of euro from automatic cash dispensers and for the use in euro of payment cards must be the same for transactions within a country and across borders. Up until this date, banks and payment card companies may deduct different charges for cross-border transactions in euro.</p>
<p>This Regulation is marked by its simplicity. The equal-tariff rule can be easily explained to tourists using a payment or withdrawal card in automatic cash dispensers. The Commission is therefore persuaded that consumer organisations and the media will circulate this information during June 2002. It will itself be circulating information in the form of a press release during this period.</p>
<p>As regards penalties, the principles of Community law establish this as a matter in which the Member States are competent, under Article 10 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. That is why, in January 2002, the Commission drew the attention of government experts on payments to the obligations of the national authorities arising from the adoption of the Regulation.</p>
<p>The introduction, on 1 January 2002, of euro notes and coins, was, for the public, the first step in the creation of a Single Payment Area. The second step will be the alignment of tariffs in the use of cards and automatic cash dispensers on 1 July 2002.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Would the Commission accept that the levying of departure taxes at EU airports is a disincentive to intra-EU travel, especially when applied to the return leg of tickets which are normally held by travellers who are not citizens of the levying country, and therefore constitutes an impediment to the right to free movement?</p>
<p>The question of free movement of persons has been brought numerous times before the Court of Justice. On those occasions, the Court has examined whether specific national measures introduce a discriminatory treatment based on the nationality of citizens of the Community or on discrimination between citizens and non-citizens<a href="#defann_78_1" name="refann_78_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 13</span>.</p>
<p>As to whether airport taxes constitute an impediment to the free movement of services, this matter too has been the subject of litigation cases brought before the Court of Justice. In two recent cases<a href="#defann_78_2" name="refann_78_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 14</span>, it has been examined whether the imposition of airport taxes irrespective of the nationality of the passengers but depending on their destination would infringe the freedom to provide services. In both cases the Court has held that “a measure that makes the provision of cross-border services more onerous than that of comparable domestic services amounts to a restriction of the freedom to provide services” <span class="sup">15</span>.</p>
<p>The Commission also wishes to point out that on the basis of jurisprudence from the Court of Justice it has been established that national measures which, even if they are not discriminatory, are liable to hinder or make less attractive the exercise of fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the EC Treaty, are incompatible with Community law unless they are justified by imperative requirements in the general interest, are suitable for securing the attainment of the objective which they pursue, and do not go beyond that is necessary in order to attain it.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In May 2001, the Commission adopted a communication on the EU’s role in promoting human rights and democratisation in third countries. The basis for this communication is the Commission’s policy on the use to which Chapter B7-7 (European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights) funds are put; it proposes a new approach and defines thematic priorities and a number of countries to be targeted. In the conclusions of the General Affairs Council in June 2001, the Council gave a favourable verdict on this document.</p>
<p>In order to implement these political guidelines, the Commission, in December 2001, adopted a Programming Document for the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (Chapter B7-7 of the EU Budget), and this document was the subject of informal preliminary discussions by Parliament and the most representative non-governmental organisations in the human rights field.</p>
<p>The Commission notes, with regard to Parliament’s comments on the Budget, that certain of the proposed activities exceed the Budget resources available and do so by a large amount.</p>
<p>In particular, the Commission takes the view that this latter category includes the establishment of a ‘Voice of Europe’ radio station. By way of comparison, ‘Voice of America’ has a total staff of 1 200, with a budget of over USD 131 million (over EUR 148 million) in 2001, which does not include the cost of broadcasting and of other support services. The annual budget of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights is itself only some EUR 100 million.</p>
<p>Under these conditions, the Commission takes the view that if this priority were taken into account, the guidelines sketched out in its communication and the priorities listed in its 2002-2004 Programming Document on Chapter B7-7 might not be respected.</p>
<p>Moreover, if such an initiative is launched without appropriate staff and resources, there is a risk that expectations might not be met.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0236"></a>

<p>Within the LAGs, the Valencian regional authorities have included a public involvement prerequisite which automatically disqualifies groups which successfully worked with LEADER II. I believe that the public involvement prerequisite which appears in the Orden de la Consellería (Valencian Government Law) of 2 November 2000, like all the obligations to which it gives rise, runs counter to the thinking underpinning the Commission Communication to the Member States of 14 April 2000 on the LEADER initiative, and totally undermines the autonomy of the LAGs.</p>
<p>Given that the Commission requires a detailed definition of the entire selection procedure, and that the Member States are obliged to ensure that the procedure is a transparent one, what approaches has the Commission made to the Spanish Government in respect of the LEADER+ selection process anomalies in Valencia? What means are at the Commission’s disposal to rectify the situation?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>The selection of Local Action Groups is the exclusive responsibility of national authorities. The selection criteria described in the programme and the subject of a special study by the Commission at the time of the negotiations must be respected.</p>
<p>By virtue of the impartiality that applies in the selection of Local Action Groups, and with the agreement of the national authorities, the Commission is in favour of a competitive procedure based on objective selection criteria and in accordance with the standards in force in the particular Member State.</p>
<p>It should be remembered that simply having been part of the Leader I and II Local Action Groups is not a reason for automatic inclusion in Leader +. The Commission has always favoured new groups’ being set up.</p>
<p>The problem raised by the honourable Members has been notified to the Spanish authorities so that the points of disagreement might be clarified. In the event of fraud or breaches of Community regulations being discovered, the Commission would contact the relevant services, including the European Anti-Fraud Office if necessary.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Following the Commission's decision to launch an inquiry in Greece concerning the misuse of aid to OA, including the loan (February 2002) of EUR 9.5 million to address existing problems, the management of OA has been taking counter-productive decisions and saddling OA - which is already bankrupt - with fresh debts and jeopardising the position of its financially sound subsidiaries.

<p>The Commission wishes to inform the honourable Member that the abandonment of certain routes and the re-assignment of aircraft to others are decisions of a purely commercial nature by the management of Olympic Airways (OA). In the framework of the procedure opened on 6 March 2002 pursuant to Article 88 of the EC Treaty and relating both to the misuse of aid already approved and granted to Olympic Airways by decision of the Commission in 1994 and 1998 and to new illegal aid granted to that company since then, the Commission will be able to carry out a detailed examination of economic and financial developments in the company since 1998, as well as of these decisions by OA’s management. The Commission’s decision to open the above-mentioned procedure was notified on 11 March 2002 to the Greek authorities, who have one month within which to forward their initial observations to the Commission.</p>
<p>As for possible non-compliance both with the restructuring plan covering the period 1998-2002 and with the many conditions imposed by the 1994 decision, if the Commission observes that a Member State is not complying with a conditional or negative decision applying to it, and in particular if there is abuse of the decision, then the Commission may, in accordance with the provisions of the procedural regulations relating to state aid<a href="#defann_85_1" name="refann_85_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, immediately contact the Court of Justice, and this in accordance with Article 88(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community.</p>
<p>With regard to the payment of new forms of aid, if the Commission observes, in the course of its inquiry, that the Greek state is continuing to make illegal forms of aid available to OA, it may take a decision known as a ‘suspension injunction’, enjoining the Member State to suspend the payment of any illegal aid until such time as the Commission has ruled on the compatibility of this aid with the Common Market.</p>
<p>In the same way, the Commission may take a decision known as a ‘recovery injunction’, enjoining the Member State provisionally to recover any aid paid illegally until such time as the Commission has ruled on the compatibility of this aid with the Common market, and this on condition that the following criteria are fulfilled:</p>
<p>- there is no doubt, according to an established procedure, that the measure concerned constitutes aid;</p>
<p>- there is an urgent need to take action;</p>

<p>State aid to shipping is part of a Community policy designed to safeguard employment in the Community, preserve the Community’s maritime expertise, develop maritime skills and enhance safety, as well as reduce the competitive disadvantage suffered by European operators who, at international level, are obliged to confront operators who, more often than not, are subject to less stringent requirements in fiscal, social and, in particular, safety terms.

<p>From the perspective of Community legislation on waste management, it is important to underline that Directive 75/442/EEC of 15 July 1975 on waste as amended<a href="#defann_87_1" name="refann_87_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> stipulates a number of key obligations for Member State in connection with the management of waste. Specifically, Article 4 requires Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure that waste is recovered or disposed of without endangering human health and without using processes or methods which could harm the environment. Member States are required under that provision to take the necessary measures to prohibit the abandonment, dumping or uncontrolled disposal of waste. In addition, Article 8 requires Member States to ensure that any holder of waste has it handled by a private or public waste collector or recovers or disposes it himself in accordance with the directive. Furthermore, Article 9 requires that waste disposal operators must obtain a permit from the relevant national competent authority. In addition to Directive 75/442/EEC, Member States must comply with the provisions set out in Directive 1999/31/EC of 26 April 1999<a href="#defann_87_2" name="refann_87_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> on the landfill of waste and Directive 91/689/EEC of 12 December 1991<a href="#defann_87_3" name="refann_87_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> on hazardous waste. Individual Member States are responsible for implementing these Community obligations.</p>
<p>Following on from the ‘Kouroupitos’ judgment<a href="#defann_87_4" name="refann_87_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, in which Greece was required to pay a daily penalty of EUR 20 000 from the Court of Justice under Article 228 of the EC Treaty in respect of non-compliance with its previous judgment<a href="#defann_87_5" name="refann_87_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> concerning the failure by Greece to respect the basic safety requirements of Article 4 of Directive 75/442/EEC on waste in relation to an illegal rubbish tip in the area of Chania Crete, the Commission continues to be concerned about the state of waste management in Greece, in particular in relation to disposal operations. The Commission is following up a number of recent complaints it has received concerning waste disposal activities in that country. In its national waste management plan of June 2000, Greece estimates that for 1999 only 51.3% of municipal waste disposal went to what it terms ‘sanitary landfill sites’, the rest going to ‘ordinary tips’ which according to the plan only meet ‘sanitary landfill site’ specifications partly or not at all. It is not clear to what extent the definitions ‘sanitary landfill site’ and ‘ordinary tip’ fulfil the criteria set by the Landfill Directive 1999/31/EC for hazardous, non-hazardous and inert waste landfills. The plan sets out a long-term strategy for future development of ‘sanitary landfill sites’ to service municipal waste disposal as well as an objective to phase-out and restore uncontrolled tips. Whereas Directive 1999/31/EC on landfill of waste had to be transposed into national law by 16 July 2001, Greece has failed to notify the Commission of its transposition legislation and the Commission has already raised this matter with the Greek authorities.</p>

<p>The Commission would like to inform the Honourable Member that it is aware of the United Kingdom’s private finance initiative (PFI). PFI is a broad concept covering a multitude of arrangements where the public sector contracts to procure services using private sector management skills and private finance. The exact legal and economic make-up of a given PFI transaction will determine the extent to which the matter is regulated by public procurement legislation. Thus, a given PFI transaction may, for example, constitute a public contract, a works concession or a services concession, and will be subject to the appropriate each time provisions of Community law. In other words, PFI projects have to be considered on a case by case basis in order to determine whether they are covered by, and in conformity with, Community public procurement legislation.</p>
<p>As regards the effects that the recent proposal for a new public procurement directive might have on PFI projects, the Commission would like to mention the inclusion of a new buying technique known as the competitive dialogue designed to allow a degree of flexibility in the award of particularly complex contracts. The Commission considers that the competitive dialogue may be an appropriate framework for, among other things, the award of complex PFI public contracts.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the Commission is not aware of any general practices concerning the use of framework agreements, as provided for in Article 1.7 and Article 32 of the proposal, in PFI contracts.</p>
<p>The Commission would also like to comment on the Parliament’s Amendment No 24. It has already indicated to the Parliament that it would be prepared to accept this amendment in principle if it is modified so as to clarify that several contracting authorities may enter into the same framework agreement at the same time.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

In addition to these most recent arrests carried out in Malabo by a group of so-called security officials (headed by Julián Ondo Nkum), approximately 40 other illegal arrests have been carried out in various towns within Equatorial Guinea. Furthermore, the government has threatened to declare illegal the CPDS, one of the main opposition parties.</p>
<p>Is the Commission aware of these facts?

<p>The Commission is aware of the events mentioned and is carefully monitoring the development of the situation on the ground.</p>
<p>The Commission is taking part in the European Union’s strengthened political dialogue with Equatorial Guinea on the questions of democratisation, strengthening of the rule of law and respect for human rights.</p>
<p>This dialogue follows the principles of the Cotonou Agreement and is taking place in a rapidly developing socio-economic context. Its aim is radically to change attitudes and habitual responses acquired over decades of secrecy and obscurantism. This change can only be effected in the long term and is all the more difficult inasmuch as there is now a huge amount at stake economically in the country. Indeed, oil resources are constantly on the increase, and foreign aid is now of relatively marginal importance.</p>
<p>In this context, the Commission has decided to fund a project aimed at strengthening the rule of law, enhancing respect for human rights and promoting the emergence of an independent civil society. While bearing in mind that it is the government of Equatorial Guinea that is exclusively responsible for organising any presidential election, the Commission has reiterated its concern that all elections should be free and transparent. At the government’s request, the Commission could lend technical support to the elections.</p>
<p>Both directly and through the reports of the Special Representative of the United Nations’ Commission on Human Rights, the European Commission is monitoring the development of the human rights situation, as well as the commitments made by President Obiang. During his last visit, the Special Representative observed that a start had been made on taking initiatives to comply with the recommendations made in the resolution by the United Nations’ Commission on Human Rights.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0252"></a>

<p>The Commission has received a reply to its letter to the former official in question. Since this is a personnel matter it is not appropriate, or in keeping with best practice, for the contents to be made public. The Commission can inform the Honourable Member, however, that the former official has indicated that he has not yet accepted the post in question.</p>
<p>The Commission is studying the file and relevant considerations. It is not possible at this stage, therefore, to give any indication of the decision that the Commission will take.</p>
<p>The established convention of the Commission in cases of this kind is that, in the event that the Commission does not give its authorisation, the Commission expects a former official not to take up the post. If, despite that, the post is taken up the Commission has the option of starting disciplinary measures against the former official concerned.</p>
<p>In a case where a former official does not give notice of new duties, and where the Commission becomes aware of this, the ex-official is reminded of his or her duties and asked to clarify to the Commission the nature of the post that has been accepted. In the case of a conflict of interest, he or she could be asked to stop his or her job immediately. If that is not done, the ex-official could be subject to disciplinary measures.</p>
<p>Generally, ex-officials request permission before undertaking any new activity. To the knowledge of the Commission, based on the last five years, former officials take up duties in about 30 cases per year.</p>
<p>Within the last five years, after examination, the permission has been totally refused in one case, partially refused in three cases, conditionally accepted in three cases, and granted in all other cases.</p>
<p>In its proposal for modification of the Staff Regulations in the context of Administrative Reform, the Commission proposes to strengthen Article 16 of the Staff Regulations by placing an obligation on a former official to notify the Institution if he or she proposes to take up a professional activity within two years of termination of service. Similarly, Article 17 has been strengthened in respect of the divulging of information not yet in the public domain.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0256"></a>
