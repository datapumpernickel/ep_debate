<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Hecke (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the main themes of the 2001 human rights report are, in fact, mainstreaming and the EU’s human rights policy.</p>
<p class="contents">This means in the first place that we should put an end to the harmful tradition whereby the European Union and the Member States set great store by the concept of human rights in their resolutions and reports, but whereby in practice, and in day-to-day foreign policy, they often allow other interests to take precedence.</p>
<p class="contents">I have just returned from Geneva where, along with the Parliament delegation, I attended the 58th meeting of the UN Human Rights Committee. During a talk with the 15 EU ambassadors, it transpired that the world’s most important human rights forum is not only struggling with a huge problem of credibility, but that the Union also fails to succeed in pursuing a consistent and coherent human rights policy and in speaking with one voice.</p>
<p class="contents">During a motion on humanitarian situations in the Middle East last week, the European representatives in the UN committee were divided in their vote. This, of course, affects our moral authority. Moreover, the impression is created that the European Union sponsors without any hesitation resolutions on human rights violations in countries such as Congo, Sudan and Colombia, while its attitude is far more restrained when it comes to strategically or economically important partners, including China.</p>
<p class="contents">The new EU guidelines on human rights dialogues will undoubtedly strengthen the coherence and consistency of the EU’s human rights policy, provided they are applied. In fact, these guidelines also form the basis for a programme document in which priority is given to the European initiative for democracy and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Patten has played a pioneering role in this respect. However, we are anxious about the implementation of the document. Despite the high priority which Parliament accords this budget chapter, the appropriations were already reduced in 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">In my report, I confined myself to two topical themes: the modern forms of slavery and the delicate balance between the war on terrorism and respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Although slavery was officially abolished fifty years ago, it continues to exist in all kinds of forms: people are trafficked and sold like commodities, are employed in forced labour, receive very little pay and are restrained in their freedom of movement. The little statistical data that is available is alarming. Especially in the current European climate, where the extreme right is in the ascendant, the European Union has every reason for tackling this growing problem. This report calls for national and international changes in the law in order to prosecute human traffickers, protect victims and prevent people from ending up in modern forms of slavery.</p>
<p class="contents">The second theme concerns the complex relationship between terrorism and human rights after the attacks of 11 September. It is patently obvious that terrorist attacks are serious crimes that should be treated accordingly. However, human rights violations can also be a breeding ground for terrorism and, at the same time, the fight against terrorism can lead to new human rights violations, can serve as justification for human rights violations or can make countries turn a blind eye to violations committed by allied forces in the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Prominent politicians, including Lord Russell Johnson, have warned against repeating the mistakes of the Cold War when dictatorships in developing countries were supported in the name of the fight against Communism. It is important, as part of the fight against international terrorism, to remove the underlying causes which feed extremist feelings or which are used by terrorists to recruit followers.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, the attacks of 11 September and the fight against terrorism have painfully exposed the shortcomings of international law. The Geneva conventions are still based on the assumption that wars between states form the biggest threat to peace, while most current conflicts are civil wars or terrorist action. The Geneva Convention on prisoners of war is based on the protection of soldiers of regulated armies, while the majority of the fighters today are guerrilla and militia fighters and the majority of victims are civilians.</p>
<p class="contents">The report therefore calls for new rules, new conventions and new instruments which accommodate these new types of conflict. The Union will need to fulfil a pioneering role in the review of international law and will need to ensure that the International Criminal Court becomes operational at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">We as the European Parliament, with a worldwide reputation in the field of human rights, must ensure at all costs that a number of universal and fundamental human rights are observed at all times. I would therefore like to thank those of my fellow MEPs who, with their contributions, have helped create a well-balanced report which already met with a broad consensus in the Committee on Foreign Affairs. I hope that Parliament will be able to give its unanimous backing to this human rights report tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Díez González (PSE),</span></span>  <span class="italic"> rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, we have drafted this report that I am presenting today mindful of the fact that the Commission communication notes the importance that the Union attaches to human rights in the development of its external policy and this, in our opinion, should be warmly welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to emphasise, however, that although this communication puts forward important proposals and suggestions, it does not provide, in our view, practical instruments that will enable us to successfully confront the new challenges resulting from the new vision that we share and in which human rights and their promotion are fully integrated into the Union’s external policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In theory, there are no substantial differences in the approach adopted by the Union institutions on defining how to address the development of human rights and the consolidation of democracy in the world, but it is when it comes to translating words into deeds, however, that differences between the institutions emerge. All too often, the democratic demands made on our partners take second place to the economic and commercial interests of the Union as a whole and of its individual Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us add to this another observation, which is in my view even more paradoxical: despite the fact that we share a single doctrine, a number of different policies are in force. Just take the paradigmatic case of Cuba, and I only mention this as one example. The Council is blocking relations, whilst the Member States maintain bilateral relations, in trade and in all types of other fields with the island. Under these circumstances, the aim of this report is not to reiterate the Union’s by now well-known position on this matter, but rather to seek to put forward proposals for firm action, both in the negotiation of agreements of all kinds between the European Union and third states and in the application of these agreements, as well as their possible suspension.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals contained in this report are intended to provide the work of the various Community institutions with greater coherence, putting an end to the de facto contradictions and to the particular predominance of the political will of the Council in this field, because in our opinion, the fact that the Union does not have a position of its own, expressed with a single voice, causes us to act on the international stage according to necessity or under the changing leadership of others who do not always share our interests in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">In drafting this report we have been both ambitious and responsible; we have shown the ambition that committing ourselves to the defence of human rights in the world requires and the responsibility that comes from realising that the challenge of integrating human rights into the Union’s external policy is a genuinely complex matter. We have also borne in mind, however, that the contradictions between institutions and the lack of unanimity, coordination and unity in action are the worst enemy of human rights and of democratisation in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals put forward in this report must, therefore, be seen as a means of overcoming this situation and of overcoming our own contradictions. As Mr Patten stated this afternoon in his intervention, we are fond of lecturing others on human rights but we would sometimes do well to look at ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">My first proposal is, therefore, to ask the Commission to draw up an interinstitutional code of conduct, designed to ensure a more coherent and more equitable approach in the Union's external action in this field. This code must govern relations between the Union and the more than 120 States to which the democratic clause currently applies. A code, ladies and gentlemen, that will be an instrument for defining the terms, both internal and external, under which dialogue takes place; a code to provide cohesion for the speech and the actions of the Union, but never to undermine dialogue; a code which serves as a political instrument, not a legal or ethical one, which systematically collates the Union’s values and political thought and its rules of implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to emphasise that such a code must not be based on the punitive and suspensive nature of the human rights clause, but on mutual respect between the parties concerned, incorporating as many positive incentives as possible and including generous cooperation programmes, that will enable respect for human rights to be strengthened at all levels. Our objectives must be not only to evaluate the progress made by the various partner countries in the field of human rights but also to achieve a coherent balance between countries and regions, above all preventing unfair results, comparative injustices and the treatment of these countries and regions with double standards, all of which we saw in Geneva. The code must, ultimately, be the handbook for parliamentary democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The second proposal that this report makes, and which I should like to go into, recommends that the Parliament produced by the 2004 elections should establish a Commission on Human Rights responsible for problems relating to human rights, democratisation in third countries and relations with international organisations active in the sphere of human rights</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly and lastly, I should like to mention the proposal for the Commission to establish a European Union Agency for Human Rights and Democracy, a suggestion that was made by the Cologne European Council. This agency, ladies and gentlemen, would be a body whose objective would be to establish common criteria and parameters for analysing the human rights situation in the world, drawing up an annual assessment that will facilitate interinstitutional action in accordance with the elements that constitute the code. It is, of course, the Commission that will have to establish the areas in which the agency will act but it would be very useful, in order to produce more effective and coordinated work, if it could, for example, include the evaluation of the impact of structural measures, given their enormous importance in the processes of reconciliation following armed conflict. Lastly, it will be a useful instrument, that does not take competences away from anyone, but which adds both its own and external efforts and resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to the five amendments tabled by Mrs Malmström, I must say that I am not going to accept them and that I am going to ask plenary to vote for the report, which was<span class="italic"> </span>adopted by a broad majority in committee, with three abstentions and not a single vote against. Nevertheless, I thank both Mrs Malmström and the other honourable Members of all political groups who tabled amendments and who discussed matters with us during the drafting of this report, because their work has helped to enrich it.</p>
<p class="contents">I should furthermore like to ask Parliament’s services to bear in mind that the original text is in Spanish and to revise the other versions, because there are some differences in the finer points of meaning. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Together and quite decisively, we have said ‘no’ to those who would seduce us with their radicalism, and to those who treat humanity with contempt, and, in this report, we are saying ‘yes’ to human rights with no ifs or buts. This is far from being only something we call for in politics; it is also a challenge to the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, and, although it might be wondered what it has to do with this issue, it is actually a great deal, because, in an age of globalisation, it is increasingly the multinational enterprises that are called on to take steps in this direction. Whilst we in politics have to hear the accusations of hypocrisy levelled at the former foreign policy of the USA and at the EU's foreign policy, which does not yet really exist, that accusation applies yet more to businesses. Only if they too manage to come round to defending human rights with no ifs or buts, will we be spared much of what we all feared was coming to us when the terrible events of 11 September struck us.</p>
<p class="contents">What is astonishing about this report is not so much that it pays lip-service to many familiar things, but that there was, in our Industry Committee, which is a rather conservative set-up and not very familiar with these topics, unanimous support for establishing social standards, and for a Green Paper that would trenchantly call for social responsibility on the part of enterprises, even though the person to whom today's ‘no’ was directed is also a member of this committee. Our decision was unanimous. Why? Because the despiser of democracy, who plays this down, was not even there and did no work on it! I hope that all of Europe's voters will see this, and, at the same time, also see when we are saying ‘no’ and to what we are saying ‘yes’, that is, to this report and to human rights without ifs and buts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Union’s commitment to the defence of human rights and democratic principles needs effective, and above all coherent, action; if there is no coherence, there is no credibility, and without credibility there is no authority to promote and demand respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason I support the strategic and comprehensive approach proposed by the Commission with regard to integrating human rights into EU foreign policy and ensuring that all policies, all Community programmes and projects, take this issue into account. Finally, I support the approach geared towards humanitarian aid based on human rights, because of the importance it can have in terms of conflict prevention, and I believe that Country Strategy Papers should propose specific measures for the promotion of human rights, which should be treated as a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">The struggle for human rights cannot be disassociated from the fight against poverty and development cooperation policy, inasmuch as both promote the establishment of the economic and social conditions necessary to guarantee peace and to ensure that everyone can live in dignity; conditions without which the respect for fundamental rights is no more than a pipe dream.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason I would make a particular request to the Commission that, in the context of political dialogue and the discussion of the Country Strategy Papers, universal access to education should be considered as a priority issue, because education is indispensable for the development of populations, and without development it will be very difficult for us to talk about full respect for human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Above all, however, I should like to thank the rapporteurs for their sound reports. Parliament has always given high priority to human rights and defended them in all circumstances, and we have not defended them any the less since 11 September 2001. In relation to the candidate countries – which are also of course, in a way, third countries – we have had great success in attaching importance to human rights and democratisation through the Copenhagen Criteria and the whole set of EU regulations. In that connection, we have also focused upon women’s rights and rights in general. That applies not merely to the candidate countries but also to the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think that the Commission’s communication is completely clear regarding how, in purely practical terms, we are to secure human rights specifically for women. There is of course no doubt at all that, in a long list of the countries we cooperate with, women are oppressed in a range of different areas. They are very often victims of religious or cultural traditions, and I believe we need to take stock of the concept of religious and cultural traditions used to oppress a quite specific group, namely girls and women in general. In this connection, I believe that we must try to involve women themselves more actively, and perhaps we should start by developing a number of programmes with the help of those women who have come to Europe, for we do not always have precise policies for tackling their status in our own countries. If we were to adopt this approach, we could perhaps also obtain some experience of use in connection with the developing countries. I should like especially to refer to paragraphs 2 and 3 of the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities in which we propose that the Commission do some very practical work on a number of aspects of this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Orden (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, it is right and proper that the European Union should focus strongly on human rights issues. I have been in the forefront of those campaigning for human rights, democracy and the rule of law in countries such as Burma and Zimbabwe, where the re-election of President Mugabe last month and the political violence and intimidation that continued to accompany it, were a matter of great concern and make a mockery of international actions.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to be more effective in our efforts, then it seems to me that we need to focus more specifically on such areas of genuine human-rights abuse. We should not define the concept of human rights so widely that every human desire and affliction is embraced. We must take care that we do not allow extremists and terrorists to exploit our concern for human rights. While we must be ever watchful of the civil liberties of our citizens, we must ensure that human rights legislation does not intrude excessively into operational areas which affect our ability to protect our law-abiding citizens and our democracies, particularly at a time of heightened threat.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights must not become a device that helps give comfort, even financial compensation, to those such as terrorists, themselves the worst abusers of human rights. The reports before us today are commendable for their coverage, but they sometimes stray into areas best avoided. To some extent they lose sight of the original concept of human rights. They make no mention of the need for good governance and the fact that corrupt governments in failed states are often the prime source of human rights abuse. These are general points, but there are some specific points that we cannot support. For example, while we strongly support a ban on the horrendous exploitation and abuse of children as child soldiers in countries such as Uganda and Sierra Leone, we cannot support a ban on the recruitment of soldiers under 18 in our own countries. The British Army is probably the best in the world. Some 5 000 personnel, 4.5% of its strength, are under eighteen. More than a third of its personnel proudly and voluntarily sign up before they reach adulthood. They are not deployed to areas of conflict until they turn 18. It would be a gross mistake and an intrusion into an area of uniquely national competence to try and ban such recruitment.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot accept the incorrect interpretation of the Geneva Convention, or the excessive criticism of US actions in its handling of prisoners at Guantanamo, when the United States administration has made it clear that it will ensure that the basic human rights of all those held in custody will be respected. We do not share the enthusiasm for an international criminal court, as currently proposed, which might easily become a political instrument and whose jurisdiction over real human rights abusers, such as terrorists, is unclear. We do not support the communitarisation of foreign policy in the European Union. There is much we can support, but I have outlined those areas which we cannot support.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of constant self flagellation, hand-ringing and searching for flaws in our own democracies we really must be more effective in correcting the constant and massive abuse of human rights which is the daily lot of people is so many far-flung countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We absolutely have to acknowledge the flaws of our own democracy. That was absolutely germane to the debate about the Middle East Unless we recognise our own flaws and inadequacies, how can we ever bring about changes in other democracies? That is what these two reports do brilliantly.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Díez González' report reminds us that we have agreements with human rights and democracy clauses yet we do nothing. We stand by because the economic factors prevent us from acting. We look at the economic provisions rather than the demands of citizens who look to us to improve their lives through the agreements that the EU and its Member States have signed and ratified.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Van Hecke's report reminds us that there is much that is wrong with the world and brilliantly focuses us on the need for the European Union to speak with one voice. As a delegate last week in Geneva, I witnessed that the Commission is arguably one of the most ineffective Commissions known to those long attenders. Why? Because the Middle East is being used as a ball that is being batted between one group of nation states and another. At the same time, what happens? We stand here in this chamber, enjoying this luxury to contradict one another, to belong to different parties, to have different ideas, to have different sexual orientation, a different colour, a different way of life. That is the reality of human rights abuses. We cannot be narrow in the interpretation of human rights. We need to be global. We need to be expansive.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a quotation after September 11: 'an attack upon one is an attack upon us all.' That is the reality. That is the immutable principle in the defence of human rights and universal freedoms.</p>

<p class="contents">I am proud that, in general, the European Parliament holds its head high when it comes to defending human dignity in the world. Tolerance, respect, democracy and human rights are building blocks of European cooperation, and these values must always be defended.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has a good policy in this area but, as many have said, it is far too fuzzy and incoherent. We need a coordinated, credible and consistent strategy that is integrated naturally into the EU’s other activities. That is something we have repeated many times. It is also unfortunate that we have abandoned the tradition of holding a major human rights debate at the part-session in Strasbourg and have instead spread the debate out so that, for example, Mrs Swiebel’s report on human rights in the EU is to be debated much later. That is symptomatic of the fact that, in this area too, our work is incoherent.</p>
<p class="contents">For quite a few years, Parliament and the Commission have proposed different measures for coordinating policy between the institutions and improving follow-up. Few of these proposals become a reality. They are nonetheless quite pressing, and I cannot understand why it should be so difficult to put them into effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Van Hecke’s report focuses on terrorism and modern slavery. Slavery and trafficking in human beings, especially children, are terrible problems and they occur, to some extent, in secret. It is truly excellent that these matters are being brought out into the open. Terrorism and human rights are topical subjects too. Especially here in the European Parliament, we have highlighted the fact that the fight against terrorism, which is obviously incredibly important, also raises a number of issues about integrity and legal certainty. The open society must never be weakened by undemocratic methods. We should like to have seen more of these issues addressed in what is otherwise a very good report supported by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree entirely with the philosophy and the intentions behind Mrs Díez González’ report. We have doubts, however, about some of the proposals made in it, for example that concerning the new interinstitutional code. Certainly, this is extremely praiseworthy, but we wonder how it relates to the demands we are already making. Shall we ever be able to cooperate with anyone if all these demands have to be fulfilled? We believe in dialogue and, now already, we are making demands, for example in Article Two of the Association Agreement, which are not being fulfilled. Should we in that case be adding more hoops that have to be passed through?</p>
<p class="contents">We also have our doubts about setting up a new human rights agency. What is such a bureau meant to do? What mandate is it to have? A single committee for citizens’ and human rights is, however, an excellent idea that we support.</p>
<p class="contents">Human dignity is still violated in the most odious ways throughout the world. The EU can play an important role when it comes to defending human rights. We need increased coordination, improved assessment and follow-up and better documentation for analysis purposes, however. We must speak with one voice. Only then can the EU obtain real influence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Mr Van Hecke and Mrs Malmström stated, in the fight against terrorism we have also come up against totally new dangerous pressures that make human rights work more difficult than before. In these circumstances we are also in danger of being guilty of the same thing we accuse the governments of many countries of, which is to say a rhetorical commitment to human rights that fails, however, to lead to any purposeful and coherent action being taken. It is just empty talk.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not need the new agency that Mrs Díez González is proposing in her report; what we need instead is political will. We must find this political will in our own institutions, in Parliament, the Commission and, first and foremost, in the Council of Ministers, which has shown little but uncertainty and only now and again given a credible performance in the Human Rights Forum, which Mr Van Hecke once again reminded us of, to his credit.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of merely praising and filing away Mr Van Hecke’s excellent report – and that also goes for most of Mrs Díez González’s report, which I think is very worthy of our support – we should for once take our own words seriously. When we adopted the report on human rights last year we decided that we would assess the working methods of the EU’s competent bodies responsible for human rights issues and democracy. We have not done that. We are expected to hold the other EU institutions accountable regarding the implementation of the EU’s human rights policy, but we have not done that. Instead we have settled for rhetorical commitments and fine words, which have also been heard here today almost <span class="italic">ad nauseam</span>. For that reason I hope we shall for once take Mr Van Hecke’s report, and much of Mrs Díez González’s report also, seriously and undertake the relevant work accordingly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The real fight for democracy and against oppression and terrorism begins, of course, here. Through its association and trade agreements, the EU can conduct an active policy in favour of human rights and democracy. We know that human rights violations have terrible consequences, and when these happen and when terrorism occurs we all too often come out with the question, ‘Who is behind this?’ and all too rarely with the question ‘Why?’. It is not enough to know ‘who’. We must also know ‘why’. We know that behind terrorism lie frustrations, oppression, an absence of democratic opportunities and a lack of human rights, as we see, for example, in the Middle East today and as we see when individual acts of terrorism strike civilians at random in Israel. We have problems with our policy in the EU. Not with producing fine phrases, but with taking action initiated by ourselves. We accept clear breaches of the human rights clauses attached, for example, to the Association Agreement with Israel – clear breaches which have no consequences. We need to put an end to this hypocrisy. Our long debates will lead nowhere if we are unwilling either to put an end to the high-flown speeches or to allow the splendid words to be followed by action. The EU is not powerless. We can in actual fact make a difference. We could have made a difference in such a way that what some of us experienced in Jenin yesterday might not have actually happened. We are not powerless.

Anyone who has taken the time to look at the exhibition must have been impressed by one of his statements and I quote, "For me the world is not made up of nations, but of people." Would not the world be a different place if, in our shaping of policy and legislation, in our negotiations and decision-making, we as politicians could keep these words in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a need for a new approach to foreign policy and indeed not only to foreign and development policy, but in all aspects of our dealings with third countries. If we could move away from thinking in terms of facts and figures, sums and statistics, markets and merchandise; if we could remember at all times that our policies impact on the real lives of real people, then we would demonstrate a genuine commitment to the fundamental values we claim to cherish.</p>
<p class="contents">The promotion of democracy, respect for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms are all values which form an integral part of the Union which we have built together over the past number of years. These are the values which have brought peace, prosperity and freedom to our continent, and it is only right and fitting that we should seek to promote these benefits further afield.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the view of the rapporteur that what is needed are concrete proposals for firm action. Lofty ideals and expressions of goodwill are not enough. We must fully integrate our human rights policies with all policies which involve countries outside the Union, be that trade, agriculture, fisheries, etc. I support the requirement for a democracy clause in international agreements as well as strict monitoring for compliance with these clauses.</p>
<p class="contents">The Irish Government currently allocates almost EUR 2 million to democracy and human rights projects. The grants are aimed at promoting respect for human rights and democracy worldwide. The emphasis is on helping people to assert their rights and to understand to participate fully in the democratic process. Building a stronger democratic structure must be a key aspect of development efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a broad range of projects which we can support, involving the promotion and protection of human rights and support for democracy and good governance in developing countries. It is perfectly legitimate to link financial incentives to human rights and democracy questions through our funding of key projects. Practical steps are being taken to make an ethical foreign policy a reality. I firmly believe that continued action in this direction would ensure that the support of projects would have a real and positive impact on the lives of poor people living in developing countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I applaud the fact that the European Union wants to stand up for these people. After all, the European Union wants to be a community of values. This also means that it employs the instruments it has at its disposal in order to protect the oppressed elsewhere. Mr Van Hecke rightly calls for a more structured approach to this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I should like to make two observations regarding this human rights debate. Firstly, we must be cautious. In our Member States, racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism still constitute a considerable danger. As such, it is not appropriate for us to set ourselves up as a benchmark for the rest of the world. This is why I feel that some statements, particularly in the report by Mrs Díez González, go too far. Without disputing the fact that every state must adhere to international law, I call for more respect for other choices and for other cultures.</p>
<p class="contents">A second observation concerns the question whether the protection of human rights is best served by an approach which is as centralised as possible. Unlike Mrs Díez González, I do not think so. The interests and contacts of the Member States are too diverse. Gathering all these too tightly would only lead to an internal competitive battle. In the final analysis, this would be at the expense of the protection of human rights. If every Member State and every European institution employs its own instruments wisely, a great deal could be improved today in the fight for recognition of human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, the democratic clause serves only to compel Parliament and the public to accept trade and economic agreements concluded with military, religious or political totalitarian regimes. Some months ago now, when Mr Dupuis went to Laos to call for democracy and the release of five democratic activists of the Movement for Democracy of 26 October 1999, he and another four radical activists were imprisoned in breach of all the international agreements, including, in particular, the agreements between the European Union and Laos.</p>
<p class="contents">Some months on, with regard to the non-violent action of Mr Dupuis, we can warn the human, civil and political rights activists who are placing their hope in the European Union not to be under any illusion. We feel it is our duty and our responsibility to declare that the inertia of the Commission and the Council is encouraging political crime while, in terms of law and jurisdiction, they are guilty of omission. Some weeks ago now, Commissioner Patten, responding to a question from Mr Cappato regarding these Laotian militants who have been in prison for over three years, stated that the Commission was not planning to convene an emergency meeting of the Joint Committee but that it was going to pursue the channels already open. I am sure the democratic activists who have been in prison for three years will be delighted to wait for the European Union to wade through all its diplomatic red tape before it does anything to help.</p>
<p class="contents">I have just one thing to say to Mrs Díez González. She said that the Commission and the Council are turning a blind eye to the violations that have been observed. That is not true: they are turning two blind eyes; they do not want to see anything, they do not want to hear anything and they do not want to say anything, and above all, they do not want to do anything. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am going to concentrate on the work of Mrs Díez González because it reflects work I myself began in the early 1990's, after the fall of the Berlin Wall. There are very few people in the Chamber who were here at that time, but I can still see one or two officials from those days.</p>
<p class="contents">At the time, Parliament decided to work closely with the Commission in establishing a programme to promote democracy and human rights, primarily in Central and Eastern Europe, but also in those countries close to us and in the wider world, and to put the whole process onto a more systematic basis. That led to the creation of budgetary chapter B7-700, now known as the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights. The first thing I would like to say is that the success of this scheme is not widely recognised. Over a period of years, many millions of euros have been spent on projects large and small, near and far, by and large with tremendous success and a very high profile in the countries in which they have been active. This initiative has been a success. There are criticisms, as with any programme, but by and large we should congratulate the Commission on the way in which it handled this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in 1999, the whole process was reversed. The process under which the Parliament and the Commission, alongside the G-24, the Council of Europe and one or two other entities, was involved in the monitoring and selection of programmes. The Commission then took on the whole process in-house.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to the heart of the recommendations of Mrs. Díez González' report. Should there be an agency for human rights and democratisation? My answer, and the answer of the PPE-DE group is: not yet. We think that the Commission should still be given the responsibility for maintaining these programmes. Obviously, we need to watch it closely, but to create yet another bureaucracy does not seem appropriate to us at this time.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally have no objection to the restoration by Parliament of the Committee on human rights and democratisation. This discussion, however, needs to take place nearer the time of the next election.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, we could surely restore the working party on human rights and democratisation within the Foreign Affairs Committee to maintain the oversight that this Parliament should now have on the EUR 100 million being spent annually under the Budget. My proposition is fundamentally this: Parliament, and I am grateful to those colleagues who are still in the Chamber, should re-focus on human rights and democratisation. These are political projects, they need political oversight. We should not leave it all to the Commission, still less to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">So, colleagues, let us take an interest again. I am grateful to Mrs Díez González for focusing attention on this matter. Many of her propositions are well worth pursuing, but not the ones I have singled out as being rather bureaucratic. I am very grateful for the work she has done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Consider the pictures of Jenin which have been recalled in this House today, the war which is degenerating into hatred, the hatred which is taking root and generating intolerance, but consider too the need for respect for diversities and minorities, which is an extremely sensitive area of the uphill struggle to secure human rights. That is precisely why our debate is timely, for it is taking place at a time when we are calling upon Parliament to renew its efforts to protect diversities; furthermore, all this is happening on the very day that Mr Le Pen would have us assert a political doctrine, a design, a resolve to deny any respect for diversities and any form of tolerance in politics. This would seem to be a helpful coincidence giving our endeavours positive and proactive meaning.</p>
<p class="contents">One more word on the subject of terrorism: I was pleased to hear the point made that terrorism is not a threat to the West or to democracy: it is a threat to and a denial of human rights. The response to terrorism cannot fail to disregard human rights, whoever the people are we are dealing with. It is wrong to punish barbarism with barbarism – and I am quoting Cesar Baccarat here, not our group – and so we demand that there be no hasty convictions, no short cut taken around the proper procedure in the trials of the Guantanamo prisoners, and we call for provision to be made for an appeal procedure as in all trials for any crime. We call upon the United States to act quickly, diligently and rigorously in ratifying the convention which will allow the International Criminal Court to start work.</p>
<p class="contents">A few words on the subject of underage working, Mr President: we believe that all forms of underage working, of child labour, are a violation of the right to childhood, which is a stage of life during which people are not supposed to use machine guns, for example. This also applies to child soldiers and suggests, once again, that human rights are only taken into account when it is convenient. Although it might not be convenient for the British army, we would prefer it if there were no more underage soldiers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The number of violations increases, and with it the feeling of powerlessness to do anything about it.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe, the mother of moral values, should not resign itself to this. The European Union must adopt a more consistent and less hypocritical policy. However, I do believe that every country where violations occur should be assessed individually. The implications of punitive measures are ultimately more important than the way in which they are targeted.</p>
<p class="contents">A rigid code of conduct is not effective. It is preferable to apply clear guidelines strictly, taking into account the specific circumstances. If sanctions are imposed, the population should always be spared as much as possible. In the European Union’s policy, human rights should not only be given priority in words, but mainly in deeds. Without civilisation, there is no progress, and without human rights, there is no civilisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As the world’s leading economic entity, the Union can exert a powerful diplomatic influence on human progress, especially in the poorest countries that most frequently breach these rights, but which are most often victims as well. In fact, these countries, which have suffered unbalanced and desperate economic and commercial foundations for far too long, are fertile breeding grounds for human rights violations when a cultural or religious wall of silence which single-handedly seeks to justify tradition or customs condemns more than half the population, namely women, to innate and eternal inferiority.</p>
<p class="contents">We speak of ‘the rights of man’. We should in fact say ‘right of the human person’, since we must be aware that when men are persecuted, women are always treated even worse. We only have to cast our minds back to the barbaric events not so long ago, when two Nigerian women, in a parody of justice, were condemned to death by stoning for adultery. These cases, which received extensive media coverage and had fortunate outcomes, must not hide the extreme distress of other women, a whole population of which, in the Islamic Republic of Iran, for example, are held prisoner by laws and customs that are based on the inequality of the sexes. Segregation and genuine State terrorism govern and shape the lives of women, if they do not decree their death through savage practices such as stoning.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights also grant this recognition of individuals, sexes and peoples. Parliament would do credit to these rights and its democratic ambition by recognising aboriginal peoples, as has been possible since a United Nations permanent body on aboriginal issues was set up, and by establishing a delegation to deal with these issues, which is what we voted for in 1992. We need more than declarations and resolutions, we need practical action which must promote human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There have been 250 conflicts since the Second World War, and 86 million people have been killed in them. Mr Van Hecke, our rapporteur, deserves our thanks for not having shied away from also addressing the present-day consequences of 11 September. We are faced with the incomprehensible phenomenon of the crimes of 11 September being taken as an excuse to abrogate human rights that had been won over centuries of struggle, such as the Geneva Convention and the rule of law over nations. Crimes are thus being used to abrogate international law, which is part of civilisation's cultural riches. To such an extent has this become the case that we can observe something like a reversion to ‘might is right’ on an international scale. To combine, as one sees fit, martial law with something alleged to be criminal law is utterly intolerable. It is to be feared that the next step will be for the law of the strongest to even acquire some sort of legitimacy.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must counter these developments by demonstrating the courage of its own convictions to a high degree. It cannot be acceptable for states to consciously place themselves outside the international judicial order, with the effect that they are thereby actively stimulating the spiral of violence and accelerating it still further. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report concerns modern slavery and threats and violence on the part of terrorist groups. Slavery is on the increase throughout the world, including in Europe. Slavery is not a thing of the past. It is based upon a view of human beings that is as out of keeping with our civilisation and Christian culture as it can possibly be. It is based on the very opposite of the idea of people’s equal, unique and inviolable worth.</p>
<p class="contents">The UN’s children’s fund, UNICEF has raised the alarm about the fact that 200 000 children in West Africa are victims of trafficking, with the cocoa industry responsible for a significant proportion of this. There is also evidence that child labour and trafficking in human beings are on the increase. It is mostly boys who work on the cocoa plantations of West Africa and often have to do the heavy work of harvesting the cocoa beans. The working day for these children is up to fifteen hours long. It is not only a question of child labour, but children are also sold as slaves by one cocoa producer to another. The Council, the Commission and the EU Member States must take action, and vigorous action at that.</p>
<p class="contents">Mention should also be made of the trafficking in women and children that is taking place more and more in Europe. The countries most affected are Romania, Moldavia and the Czech Republic. Such trafficking is a great tragedy for those affected, who are exploited in a horrible way, above all within prostitution. The UN protocol on trafficking in human beings, added to the UN Convention Against Organised Transnational Crime, is an important tool in this area. The Member States and the candidate countries must now translate their words into genuine action in order to put an end to this loathsome trade.</p>
<p class="contents">National governments, police and judicial systems appear passive, powerless and resigned faced with the task of tackling these fundamental issues of human dignity in depth and combating the sex trade and trafficking in human beings in similar detail. Such resignation is dangerous for democracy itself. People demand vigorous and determined efforts when it comes to solving these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me also to emphasise paragraphs 52, 53, 54 and 55 of Mr Van Hecke’s report, which are about religious freedom. I find it completely incomprehensible that converting from Islam to Christianity, Buddhism or other religions is punishable by the death penalty in most Arabic and Muslim countries. That is not consonant with human dignity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The way politics works, it always involves a tightrope walk with hope on one side and despair on the other. Events in Zimbabwe at present tempt us to despair, while we can perhaps derive hope from developments in Sierra Leone. Things can, though, seem quite different the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">We pointed the way with our collaboration with the ACP states on the Cotonou Agreement, with its clauses on human rights and democracy, and its commitment to good governance and the rule of law. We have an instrument, even if it is not as solid as we – whose political dialogue in Parliament supports this work – might well have wished. This political dialogue, I believe, is of outstanding importance, as agreement can be reached, in the final analysis, only through discussions with each other. That is why there is also the entitlement to consultation before suspension is resorted to. Even that is not a straightforward matter, for we have to ask ourselves how we are to punish the dictatorial regime, without at the same time affecting the people. In this connection, then, I tend to go along with a proverb that is often used in Germany: ‘The impossible gets done at once, but miracles take a bit longer.’</p>
<p class="contents">We will have to have staying power, and I do not know whether human rights really are violated more frequently today than in the past. What is certain, though, is that crime, too, has become public. More things become known to us today, and we are of course forced to take action. The fact, though, that crime is now public and that there are almost always cameras there to record it, gives a chance of fighting things that used to remain hidden away. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I do welcome the fact that human rights are among the priorities of our foreign policy, that new forms of slavery are being highlighted such as terrorism, in particular, and the slavery of forced child labour and the slavery of forced prostitution; moreover, there are common positions relating to a capacity for cooperation within the World Trade Organisation and the International Labour Organisation to combat these forms of slavery: this is therefore a fight against the exploitation of man by man in all fields and all areas, especially where minors and child abuse are concerned.</p>

This is not just a question of condemnation, therefore, it is not just a matter of identifying these violations: it is the promotion of human rights. This is achieved through two innovations: firstly, an ambassador for human rights, the expression of Parliament, and secondly, a European agency for the promotion of human rights. To achieve these two innovations we need a responsible foreign policy made up of practical proposals: that is what we will be calling for and we will make sure we are involved in their development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mrs Díez González, the rapporteur, is well aware of this. She understands the situation better than most, perhaps, given that, being a Basque and a democrat, she belongs to a category of Spanish and European people who, even now, have to fight against ultra-nationalist terrorism to consolidate the fundamental rights which are the European Union’s distinguishing marks.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of my speech is mainly to express my support for Mrs Díez’s and Mr Van Hecke’s proposals and suggestions, adding just one or two observations. The first is that there should not be a restrictive interpretation of the many excellent initiatives they have suggested. For example, it should not be the case that very high standards in human rights should be a prerequisite and unavoidable condition for the European Union to be able to cooperate with third countries, but rather that to raise the level of respect for human rights in each country with which we cooperate should be the objective and result of such cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">My second observation comes as a response to criticisms we have heard with regard to the fact that, whilst we make many demands in the area of human rights in relation to third countries, particularly countries in the developing world, we are far more tolerant, on the other hand, when faced with frankly unsatisfactory situations in this area within EU countries themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not true. These reports refer specifically to third countries, but I take it for granted that the moral and political authority of our debate on cooperation in the world surrounding the European Union, with which we hope to be able to have a coherent relationship, will be much more credible and effective if we practice what we preach, and when what we require of others is endorsed by our own conduct, and by our self-imposed requirement to continue making progress, day after day, to improve the protection of human rights within the EU itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Commission and especially of my colleague Mr Patten, who is unable to take part in today's discussion, I wish to thank Mrs Díez González and Mr Van Hecke for their reports, which complement each other well. Mrs Díez González, in your report on the Commission communication on human rights, you call on the institutions to work out a common code of conduct to serve as a basis for the EU's relations with third states. The Commission reaffirms the significance, for the European Union's relations with other states, of a constructive and dynamic concept founded on critical partnership and collaboration. The Council, too, reaffirmed this approach with its guidelines for dialogues on human rights. Such dialogue shows particular promise when respect for human rights and for democratic principles forms an essential component of agreements concluded with third states and when such agreements include a clause on human rights. As has already been mentioned, the Cotonou Agreement was a forward step of this kind. The Commission is prepared to discuss the form this clause should take in future and how it is to be applied efficiently, and, in doing so, will attach great importance to Parliament's conceptions.</p>
<p class="contents">In her report, Mrs Díaz González goes on to advocate the establishment of a European Agency for Human Rights and Democracy, which would perform a reporting and advisory role. As stated in its communication, though, the Commission takes the view that the European Union has no lack of either facilities for consultation or sources of information. The European Union can rely on reports by the United Nations, the Council of Europe and, not least, a large number of international non-governmental organisations. The actual challenge for every institution is to make prompt and comprehensive use of the information available and then summon the political will to take difficult decisions. An additional advisory forum would make it impossible to cope with this challenge, and it would, furthermore, be extremely difficult for the Commission to transfer powers to such a body in the sensitive area of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Van Hecke's report is devoted to two main subjects, one being counter-terrorism and the other the fight against modern forms of slavery. The European Union emphatically condemns slavery in all its forms, including, as the concept does today, alongside traditional slavery and the slave trade, such things as serious violations of the rights of children and of women, the exploitation of certain dependency situations, and apartheid. These continue to afflict millions of people in many parts of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has only recently made a statement to the Human Rights Committee in which it welcomed the various international instruments, notably those of the ILO, for combating these forms of slavery, and also called for more positive action against trafficking in human beings. As regards basic working norms, the Commission included in last year's communication a comprehensive strategy with the title of ‘Promoting core labour standards and improving social governance in the context of globalisation’ under which countries are to receive incentives and be put in a position to implement core labour standards and adhere to them.</p>
<p class="contents">One definite step was the Council's acceptance of a revised generalised scheme of preferences – the social incentive system – which provides for additional preferences for countries which adhere to core labour norms. From now on, in addition, serious contraventions of one of the ILO's fundamental conventions will be among the grounds for temporary withdrawal of generalised preferences. It was above all on these grounds that the EU suspended the Generalised System of Preferences for Burma.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is now giving increased financial support to projects in many countries against trafficking in human beings, against trafficking in women, against child labour or slavery, for example, projects combating the exploitation of juveniles in Gabon, Benin, Togo, and Nigeria, or projects within the frameworks provided by the STOP or DAPHNE programmes, which are aimed at combating trafficking in human beings and sexual exploitation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Van Hecke is quite right to emphasise in his report that the events of 11 September manifest new forms of terrorism. It is to that part of the report that I now turn. It is only right that the whole political debate has been permeated by the fight against terrorism. Considerations of human rights have an effect at different levels. The European Union holds fast to the important legal distinction that it is states that can violate human rights, whilst terrorist acts are to be categorised in legal terms as criminality. Despite the urgent need for action, it is most important to counter-terrorism in all its aspects that we ourselves and our allies strictly maintain the values of international human rights and of humanitarian law.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Van Hecke's report furthermore refers to the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights. The Commission is actively endeavouring to implement its new strategy, which comprises a longer-term concept providing for the selection of a limited number of subject areas, which it treats as of core importance and in which the Community's contribution can bring about real change. As before, the Commission will continue to involve Parliament in the discussion on how the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights is to be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me again congratulate Mrs Díez González and Mr Van Hecke on their reports. The Commission welcomes the collaboration with Parliament in further advancing our common cause of democracy and human rights. The European Union is founded on respect for human rights, and this is true both of internal affairs policy within Europe and of Europe's policy in foreign affairs.</p>
